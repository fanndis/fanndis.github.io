The '''President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities''' ('''PCAH''') was an advisory committee to the [[White House]] on cultural issues. It worked directly with the Administration and the three primary cultural agencies: the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], as well as other federal partners and the private sector, to address policy questions in the arts and humanities, to initiate and support public/private partnerships in those disciplines, and to recognize excellence in the field. Its core areas of focus were arts and humanities education, cultural exchange, and the creative economy.

The committee was composed of both private and public members. The private members were appointed by the President and are prominent artists, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and state and local public officials who demonstrated commitment to the arts and humanities. Its public [[Ex officio member|ex officio]] members included the heads of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]; the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services|Institute of Museum and Library Sciences]]; the Departments of [[United States Department of Education|Education]], [[Department of the Interior|Interior]], and [[Department of State|State]]; the [[National Gallery of Art]]; the [[Smithsonian Institution]]; the [[John F.

==Background==
The PCAH was established by [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12367 of June 15, 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12367.html|title=Executive Orders {{!}} Executive Order 12367--President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en}}</ref> It has conducted major research and policy analysis, and catalyzed important federal cultural programs, both domestic and international. PCAH's website states, "These achievements rely on the PCAH's unique role in bringing together the White House, federal agencies, civic organizations, corporations, foundations and individuals to strengthen the United States' national investment in its cultural life. Central to the PCAH mission is using the power of the arts and humanities to contribute to the vibrancy of our society, the education of our children, the creativity of our citizens and the strength of our democracy."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pcah.gov/about-us |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027144230/http://www.pcah.gov/about-us |archive-date=2017-10-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Current programs==

===Turnaround Arts===
Turnaround Arts<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://turnaroundarts.pcah.gov/ |title=Turnaround Arts |access-date=2015-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225170234/http://turnaroundarts.pcah.gov/ |archive-date=2015-12-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was a national program that brings arts education to high-poverty elementary and middle schools across the country. It was the first federal program to specifically support arts education as an improvement tool in the country's lowest-performing schools, and was run by the PCAH, in coordination with the White House, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE), and several foundations.

===National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards===
The National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards recognized the country's best creative youth development programs for increasing academic achievement, graduation rates and college enrollment by engaging children and youth in the arts and humanities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nasaa-arts.org/nasaa_research/national-arts-humanities-youth-program-awards/|title=National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards|website=nasaa-arts.org |date=|accessdate=2019-07-06}}</ref> Formerly titled Coming Up Taller, these annual awards focused national attention on outstanding programs across the country that promoted the creativity of America's young people, providing them learning opportunities and the chance to contribute to their communities. Accompanied by a cash award and a ceremony at the White House with the First Lady, the National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards not only rewarded these projects with recognition but also provided organizational and capacity building support over the course of the year.

===National Student Poets Program===
The PCAH, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the nonprofit Alliance for Young Artists & Writers partnered to present the National Student Poets Program (NSPP),<ref>[http://www.artandwriting.org/the-awards/national-student-poets-program/ National Student Poets Program (NSPP)]</ref> the nation's highest honor for young poets (grades 9-11) presenting original work. Five students were annually selected for one year of service as literary ambassadors, each representing a geographic region of the country. By elevating and showcasing their work for a national audience, the program strived to inspire other young people to achieve excellence in their own creative endeavors and promote the essential role of writing and the arts in academic and personal success.

===Film Forward===
Sundance Film Forward is an international touring program designed to enhance greater cultural understanding, collaboration and dialogue around the globe by engaging audiences through the exhibition of films, workshops and conversations with filmmakers. Sundance Film Forward is an initiative of the Sundance Institute, which partnered with the PCAH and other federal arts programs.

===Save America's Treasures===
Established by Executive Order in 1998, Save America's Treasures (SAT)<ref>[http://www.archfoundation.org/category/save-americas-treasures/ Save America's Treasures (SAT)]</ref> is a federal public-private partnership that includes the NEA, NEH, IMLS, the National Park Service (NPS), the American Architectural Foundation (AAF) and formerly the PCAH. The PCAH and the National Park Service jointly oversaw the management of the federal competitive matching grant component, which helps preserve, conserve, and rescue our nation's most significant cultural and heritage resources, including historic structures, collections of artifacts, works of art, maps, manuscripts, and sound recordings. Although funding for the program was suspended, the PCAH and AAF convened a series of thought leadership forums to develop elements for framing and catalyzing a preservation strategy that built on the strengths and success of SAT.

===Special initiatives===
Through its work with the private sector, the PCAH was able to raise private resources, which were directed to special initiatives that supported youth programs, recognized artists, broadened arts awareness, and celebrated the nation's cultural life. Examples include:

* Educational workshops and cultural events programming at the White House
* The National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medals
* Annual NEH Jefferson Lecture on the Humanities
* U.S. Cultural and Heritage Tourism Summit (2005)

==August 2017 resignations==
On August 18, 2017, 16 of the 17 committee members, including [[Kal Penn]] and [[Chuck Close]], resigned in protest of [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's]] response to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The resigning commissioners stated in a letter to the President, "Reproach and censure in the strongest possible terms are necessary following your support of the hate groups and terrorists who killed and injured fellow Americans in Charlottesville."<ref name="wapo-18aug2017" /><ref name="scribd-18aug2017" /><ref name="latimes-18aug2017" />
The initial letters of each paragraph of the resignation letter spell 'RESIST'. The only member of the committee who did not sign the letter was theater and film director [[George C.
