'''''Cats''''' is a [[sung-through]] musical [[musical composition|composed]] by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], based on the 1939 poetry collection ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]]. It tells the story of a tribe of cats called the [[Jellicle cats|Jellicles]] and the night they make the "Jellicle choice," deciding which cat will ascend to the [[Heaviside Layer]] and come back to a new life. The musical includes the well-known song "[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]" as sung by [[Grizabella]]. As of 2019, ''Cats'' remains the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|fourth-longest-running Broadway show]] and the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|sixth-longest-running West End show]].

Lloyd Webber began setting Eliot's poems to music in 1977, and the compositions were first presented as a [[song cycle]] in 1980. Producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] then recruited director [[Trevor Nunn]] and choreographer [[Gillian Lynne]] to turn the songs into a complete musical. ''Cats'' opened to positive reviews at the [[New London Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1981 and then to mixed reviews at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1982. It won numerous awards including Best Musical at both the [[Laurence Olivier Award|Laurence Olivier]] and [[Tony Award]]s. Despite its unusual premise that deterred investors initially, the musical turned out to be an unprecedented commercial success, with a worldwide gross of US$3.5 billion by 2012.

The London production ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances, making ''Cats'' the longest-running musical in both theatre districts for a number of years. ''Cats'' has since been revived in the West End twice and on Broadway once. It has also been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world many times. Long-running foreign productions include a 15-year run at the [[Operettenhaus]] in [[Hamburg]] that played over 6,100 performances, as well as an ongoing run in a purpose-built theatre in Japan that has played over 10,000 performances since it opened in 1983.

''Cats'' started the [[megamusical]] phenomenon, establishing a global market for musical theatre and directing the industry's focus to big-budget [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], as well as family- and tourist-friendly shows. The musical's profound but polarising influence also reshaped the aesthetic, technology, and marketing of the medium. ''Cats'' was adapted into a [[Cats (1998 film)|direct-to-video film]] in 1998, and a [[Cats (2019 film)|feature film adaptation]] directed by [[Tom Hooper]] in 2019.

==Background==
''Cats'' is based on [[T. S.

===Poems===
[[File:Thomas Stearns Eliot by Lady Ottoline Morrell (1934).jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot's poetry provided most of the lyrics for ''Cats'']]
''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' is a collection of [[light poetry]] about cats that Eliot had originally written for his godchildren in the 1930s. Due to the rhythmic nature of Eliot's work, there had been previous attempts before ''Cats'' at setting his poems to music, though none of these attempts had been met with much critical or commercial success.<ref name=sternfeld115>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|p=115}}</ref> Musicologist John Snelson wrote of the poems:

{{quote|text=[They] provided excellent material for musicalization, as Eliot's style in this collection is reminiscent of a popular lyricist. The poet uses repeated catch phrases, strong hooks, steady rhythm and outrageous, attention-grabbing, witty rhymes, which are the ingredients of every well-crafted popular lyric.<ref name=snelson129>{{harvnb|Snelson|2004|p=129}}</ref>}}

Most of the lyrics in ''Cats'' were taken from ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' with very minor alterations. Supplementary verses from unpublished poems by Eliot were adapted for "Grizabella: The Glamour Cat" and "The Journey to the Heaviside Layer", while the song "The Moments of Happiness" was taken from a passage in Eliot's ''[[The Dry Salvages]]''. ''Cats'' director [[Trevor Nunn]] and lyricist [[Richard Stilgoe]] provided the remaining lyrics, namely for the opening number "Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats" and the most famous song from the musical "[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]". The former was written by Nunn and Stilgoe and was modelled after an unpublished poem by Eliot titled "Pollicle Dogs and Jellicle Cats", while the latter was written by Nunn based on another Eliot poem titled "Rhapsody on a Windy Night".<ref name=sternfeld117118/>

==Creation==
===Inception===
Lloyd Webber began composing the songs in late 1977 as a songwriting exercise, partly because Eliot's book had been a childhood favourite and partly to see if he could write music to predetermined lyrics. The compositions were performed privately for friends but Lloyd Webber had no further intentions for them at the time. After his [[song cycle]] ''[[Tell Me on a Sunday]]'' was televised by the [[BBC]] in early 1980, Lloyd Webber began to consider using his musicalization of Eliot's poems in the same vein for a televised concert anthology.<ref name=catsalw>{{harvnb|Eliot|Eliot|Lloyd Webber|Nunn|1983|p=9}}</ref> He approached producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] to explore possible avenues for the songs.<ref name=chicago1981/>

''Practical Cats'', as the show was then called, was first presented as a song cycle at the 1980 summer [[Sydmonton Festival]]. The concert was performed by [[Gemma Craven]], [[Gary Bond]] and [[Paul Nicholas]]. Eliot's widow and [[literary executor]], [[Valerie Eliot|Valerie]], was in attendance and brought along various unpublished cat-themed poems by Eliot. One of these was "Grizabella the Glamour Cat" which, although rejected from Eliot's book for being "too sad for children", gave Lloyd Webber the idea for a full-blown musical.<ref name=unmasked315317>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=315–317}}</ref> He explained:

{{quote
|text=The musical and dramatic images that this created for me made me feel that there was very much more to the project than I had realised. I immediately decided that I needed the support of another to encourage me to re-work my settings and to see if a dramatic whole could be woven from the delightful verse that I was now to be allowed to develop.<ref name=catsalw/>
}}

Lloyd Webber thus decided to turn ''Practical Cats'' into a musical, co-produced by Mackintosh and the [[Really Useful Group]]'s [[Brian Brolly]].<ref name=unmasked315317/>

===Development===
Shortly after the Sydmonton Festival, Lloyd Webber began setting the unpublished poems he had been given to music, a few of which were later added into the show. He also composed the [[overture]] and "The Jellicle Ball", incorporating [[analog synthesizer]]s into these orchestrations to try to create a unique electronic [[soundscape]].<ref name=unmasked317>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|p=317}}</ref> Meanwhile, Mackintosh recruited Nunn, the then artistic director of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC), to direct ''Practical Cats''. Nunn was an unusual choice as he was considered "too high-brow" for musical theatre,<ref name=McLamore414>{{harvnb|McLamore|2017|p=414}}</ref> but Mackintosh felt that a "pedigree" director was needed to ensure Valerie Eliot's approval of the project.<ref name=unmasked308309318>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=308–309, 318}}</ref> After much persuasion, Nunn came on board and was joined by his RSC colleagues, choreographer [[Gillian Lynne]] and set and costume designer [[John Napier (designer)|John Napier]].<ref name=chicago1981>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31773702/chicago_tribune/|title='Cats': Hit feline musical has London purring|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=Richard|last=Christiansen|author-link=Richard Christiansen (critic)|date=13 September 1981|page=117|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref><ref name=unmasked318320>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=318–320}}</ref> Nunn initially envisioned ''Practical Cats'' as a [[chamber piece]] for five actors and two pianos, which he felt would reflect "Eliot's charming, slightly offbeat, mildly satiric view of late-1930s London".<ref name=nunnnyt/> However, he relented to Lloyd Webber's more ambitious vision for the musical.<ref name=nunnnyt/> Nunn was also convinced that for the musical to have the wide commercial appeal that the producers desired, it could not remain as a series of isolated numbers but instead had to have a narrative [[through line]].<ref name=unmasked318320/> He was therefore tasked with piecing the self-contained poems together into a story.<ref name=Siropoulos129132/> Nunn wrote about the significance "Grizabella the Glamour Cat" had on the construction of the narrative:

{{Quote
|text=Here in eight lines Eliot was describing an intensely recognizable character with powerful human resonances, while introducing the themes of mortality, and the past, which occur repeatedly in the major poems. We decided that if Eliot had thought of being serious, touching, almost tragic in his presentation of a feline character, then we had to be doing a show which could contain that material, and the implications of it. Furthermore, we would have to achieve the sense of progression through themes more than incidents.<ref name=catsnunn/>
}}

An event called the Jellicle Ball was referenced by Eliot in the poem "The Song of the Jellicles", while a cat version of heaven known as the Heaviside Layer was mentioned in one of his unpublished poems. Nunn expanded on these concepts by conceiving the Jellicle Ball as an annual ritual in which the cats vie to be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer, thus giving the characters a reason to gather and sing about themselves in the musical. He also added the element of rebirth as a play on the idea that cats have nine lives.<ref name=sternfeld117118>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=117–118}}</ref>

One of Nunn's stipulations for agreeing to direct ''Practical Cats'' was that actress [[Judi Dench]] would be cast in the musical. Lloyd Webber was happy to oblige given her credentials and so Dench joined the company in the [[dual role]]s of [[Grizabella]] and [[Jennyanydots]]. Former [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] principal dancer [[Wayne Sleep]] was offered the part of [[Mr. Mistoffelees]] after Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh attended a performance by his dance troupe, one of the many dance showcases they saw in preparation for the musical. Casting for the other roles began in November 1980, with auditions held across the UK for dancers who could also sing and act. There was an initial disagreement over the casting of Nicholas as [[Rum Tum Tugger]]; Nunn had misgivings about the actor's easy-going attitude but eventually yielded to Lloyd Webber, Mackintosh and Lynne, all of whom were keen on Nicholas for the role. [[Sarah Brightman]], who had already made a name for herself with the chart hit "[[I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper]]", arranged a private audition and was cast in an as-then undecided role. By December, the full cast had been assembled.<ref name=unmaskedcasting>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=320, 322, 325–330}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Mackintosh engaged the advertising agency Dewynters to design a poster for the musical. After much back-and-forth, the agency presented a minimalist poster consisting of a pair of yellow feline eyes (with dancing silhouettes for the [[pupil]]s) set against a black backdrop. The producers and the creative team loved the design but felt that the title&nbsp;— ''Practical Cats''&nbsp;— looked out of place when paired with the image of the cat's eyes. The musical's title was thus shortened to just ''Cats''.<ref name=unmasked335336>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=335–336}}</ref>

The musical was scheduled to open on 30 April 1981, with [[Preview (theatre)|previews]] starting on 22 April. Shortly before tickets went on sale in mid-February, Nunn revealed to the alarmed producers that he was struggling to write the script for the musical. Despite still having no established book or score, rehearsals began on 9 March 1981 in a church hall in [[Chiswick]], London. The original music director, Chris Walker, became so frustrated with the unfinished score that he quit by lunchtime and was replaced by the film conductor [[Harry Rabinowitz]].<ref name=unmasked334338>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=334–338}}</ref> The situation improved later that day when Lloyd Webber, Mackintosh and Nunn met with Stilgoe, a musician known for his ability to improvise lyrics on the spot, in hopes that Stilgoe could write an opening song for the musical. By the next evening, Stilgoe had produced a draft for "Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats".<ref name=unmasked341>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|p=341}}</ref> However, "Memory", an [[11 o'clock number]] for Grizabella that Nunn insisted the show needed as its "emotional centre",<ref name=unmasked331>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|p=331}}</ref> still had no lyrics at this point. Lloyd Webber's former writing partner [[Tim Rice]] was brought in to write a lyric for the song, but his version was rejected by Nunn for being too depressing. The lyrics for "Memory" were not completed by Nunn until well into the previews.<ref name=unmasked345354>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=345, 348–349, 354}}</ref>
[[File:CatsOriginalLondonCast.jpg|thumb|left|The original 1981 London cast of ''Cats'']]
Many of the ensemble characters were created by the original cast through extensive [[improvisation]] sessions held during the rehearsal process. Said Nunn: "[O]n day one of rehearsals what we had was 15 poems set to music and five weeks later we had a show with characters, relationships and stories running from beginning to end."<ref name=sternfeld130132/><ref>{{harvnb|Siropoulos|2008|pp=184–185}}</ref> The production faced a last minute mishap when Dench [[Achilles tendon rupture|snapped her Achilles tendon]] during rehearsals for "The Old Gumbie Cat" and had to pull out one week before the first preview. Her understudy Myra Sands replaced her as Jennyanydots, while [[Elaine Paige]] agreed to take over the role of Grizabella. Opening night was pushed back to 11 May, but Mackintosh refused to postpone the previews as he wanted to dispel the industry rumours that the production was an impending debacle.<ref name=unmasked344346>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=344–346}}</ref>

The development of ''Cats'' was also plagued by financial troubles. Mackintosh struggled to raise the £450,000 (US$1.16 million<ref name=smith/>) needed to stage the musical in the [[West End theatre|West End]] as major investors were sceptical of the show's premise and refused to back it. Lloyd Webber personally [[underwriting|underwrote]] the musical and took out a second [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] on his house for the [[down payment]] of the theatre. He later recalled that if ''Cats'' had been a commercial failure, it would have left him in financial ruin.<ref name=unmasked321346>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=321, 328, 346}}</ref> The remaining [[Financial capital|capital]] was eventually raised by small investments procured from 220 individuals through newspaper advertisements.<ref name=sternfeld117118/><ref name=McLamore414/> After the musical became a massive hit, the [[rate of return]] for these investors was estimated to have exceeded 3,500 per cent.<ref name=telegraphwebber>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/11281186/Andrew-LLoyd-Webber-Cats-2014-Nicole-Sherzinger.html|title='They told me I was crazy': Andrew Lloyd Webber on Cats|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 December 2014|access-date=2 May 2019|first=Rachel|last=Stewart|url-status=live|archive-date=20 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520125721/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/11281186/Andrew-LLoyd-Webber-Cats-2014-Nicole-Sherzinger.html}}</ref>

==Synopsis==

===Act I&nbsp;– When Cats Are Maddened by the Midnight Dance===
[[File:RCCL Cats 2018 1.png|thumb|The [[Jellicle cats]] gather every year to make the "Jellicle Choice", and decide which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.]]
After the overture, the cats gather on stage and describe the [[Jellicle cats|Jellicle]] tribe and its purpose ("Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats"). The cats (who break the [[fourth wall]] throughout the show) then notice that they are being watched by a human audience, and proceed to explain how the different cats of the tribe are named ("[[The Naming of Cats]]"). This is followed by a [[ballet]] solo performed by [[Victoria the White Cat|Victoria]] to signal the beginning of the Jellicle Ball ("The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball"). At this moment, [[Munkustrap]], the show's main narrator, explains that tonight the Jellicle patriarch [[Old Deuteronomy]] will make an appearance and choose one of the cats to be reborn into a new life on the Heaviside Layer.

The first contender Munkustrap introduces is [[Jennyanydots]] ("The Old Gumbie Cat"), a large tabby cat who lazes around all day, but come nighttime, she becomes active, teaching mice and cockroaches various activities to curb their naturally destructive habits. Just as Jennyanydots finishes her song, the music changes suddenly and [[Rum Tum Tugger]] makes his extravagant entrance in front of the tribe ("The Rum Tum Tugger"). He is very fickle and unappeasable, "for he will do as he do do, and there's no doing anything about it".

Then, as Rum Tum Tugger's song fades, a shabby old grey cat stumbles out wanting to be reconciled; it is [[Grizabella]]. All the cats back away from her in fear and disgust and explain her unfortunate state ("Grizabella: The Glamour Cat"). Grizabella leaves and the music changes to a cheerful upbeat number as [[Bustopher Jones]], a fat cat in "a coat of fastidious black", is brought to the stage ("Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town"). Bustopher Jones is among the elite of the cats, and visits prestigious [[gentlemen's club]]s. Suddenly, a loud crash startles the tribe and the cats run offstage in fright. Hushed giggling sounds signal the entrance of [[Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer]], a pair of near-identical cats. They are mischievous petty burglars who enjoy causing trouble around their human neighbourhood ("Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer"). After they finish, they are caught off-guard and confronted by the rest of the cats.

Finally, the Jellicle patriarch, Old Deuteronomy, arrives before the tribe ("Old Deuteronomy"). He is a wise old cat who "has lived many lives" and is tasked with choosing which Jellicle will go to the Heaviside Layer every year. The cats put on a play for Old Deuteronomy ("[[The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles]]"), telling a story about two dog tribes clashing in the street and subsequently being scared away by the Great [[Rumpus Cat]]. A sombre moral from Old Deuteronomy is interrupted by a second loud crash, presumably from [[Macavity]], which sends the alarmed cats scurrying. After a quick patrol for Macavity, Old Deuteronomy deems it a false alarm and summons the cats back as the main celebration begins ("The Jellicle Ball"), in which the cats sing and display their "[[wikt:Terpsichorean|Terpsichorean]] powers".

During the Ball, Grizabella reappears and is once again shunned by the other cats ("Grizabella: The Glamour Cat (Reprise)") while Old Deuteronomy looks on sadly. She tries to dance along, but her age and decrepit condition prevent her from doing so ("Memory (Prelude)").

===Act II&nbsp;– Why Will the Summer Day Delay&nbsp;– When Will Time Flow Away?===
After the Jellicle Ball, Old Deuteronomy contemplates "what happiness is", referring to Grizabella. However, the cats do not understand him, so he has [[Jemima (cat)|Jemima]] (also known as Sillabub), the youngest of all Jellicles, sing it in simpler terms ("The Moments of Happiness"). [[Gus: The Theatre Cat|Gus]]&nbsp;– short for Asparagus&nbsp;– shuffles forward as the next cat to be introduced ("Gus: The Theatre Cat"). He was once a famous actor but is now old and "suffers from [[palsy]] which makes his paws shake". He is accompanied by [[Jellylorum]], his caretaker, who tells of his exploits. Gus then remembers how he once played the infamous pirate captain, [[Growltiger]] a.k.a. the Terror of the [[River Thames|Thames]] ("Growltiger's Last Stand"). Gus tells the story about the pirate captain's romance with Lady Griddlebone, and how Growltiger was overtaken by the Siamese and forced to walk the plank to his death.

Back in the present, after Gus exits, [[Skimbleshanks]] is seen sleeping in the corner ("Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat"). He is the cat who is unofficially in charge of the night train to Glasgow. Skimbleshanks is considered vital to the rail operations, as without him "the train can't start". Within his song, a whole steam train engine is assembled out of objects in the junkyard.

With a third crash and an evil laugh, the "most wanted" cat Macavity appears. He is the so-called "[[Napoleon]] of Crime" who always manages to evade the authorities. Macavity's henchmen capture Old Deuteronomy and take off with the patriarch in tow. As Munkustrap and his troop give chase, [[Demeter (cat)|Demeter]] and [[Bombalurina (cat)|Bombalurina]] explain what they know about Macavity ("Macavity: The Mystery Cat"). When they are finished, Macavity returns disguised as Old Deuteronomy, but his cover is blown by Demeter and he ends up in a fight with Munkustrap and Alonzo. Macavity holds his own for a time, but as the rest of the tribe begin to gang up and surround him, he shorts out the stage lights and escapes in the resulting confusion.

After the fight, Rum Tum Tugger calls upon the magician [[Mr. Mistoffelees]] for help ("Magical Mr. Mistoffelees"). Known as the "original conjuring cat", Mr. Mistoffelees can perform feats of magic that no other cat can do. He displays his magical powers in a dance solo and uses them to restore the lights and bring back Old Deuteronomy. Now, the Jellicle Choice can be made.

Before Old Deuteronomy can announce his decision, Grizabella returns to the junkyard and he allows her to address the gathering. Her faded appearance and lonely disposition have little effect on her song ("[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]"). With acceptance and encouragement from Jemima and Victoria, her appeal succeeds and she is chosen to be the one to go to the Heaviside Layer and be reborn into a new Jellicle life ("The Journey to the Heaviside Layer"). A tyre rises from the piles of junk, carrying Grizabella and Old Deuteronomy partway toward the sky; Grizabella then completes the journey on her own.{{efn-lr|The method in which Grizabella ascends to the Heaviside Layer varies depending on the production. In the original London and Broadway productions, she climbs up a stairway that emerges from the ceiling. In the 1990s and 2000s scaled-down touring productions, she ascends via a [[flying saucer]]-like vessel.<ref>

==Artistic elements==

===Musical treatment===
[[File:Andrew Lloyd Webber in Eurovision 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]]]
''Cats'' is completely told through music with no dialogue in between the songs,<ref name=hummler>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1982/legit/reviews/cats-1200425296/|title=Cats|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=13 October 1982|first=Richard|last=Hummler|access-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402021920/https://variety.com/1982/legit/reviews/cats-1200425296/}}</ref> although there are occasions when the music accompanies spoken verse. Lloyd Webber's compositions employ an eclectic range of musical styles so as to magnify the characters' contrasting personalities.<ref name=snelson31>{{harvnb|Snelson|2004|p=31}}</ref> For example, the rebellious Rum Tum Tugger is introduced with a [[rock music|rock]] song ("The Rum Tum Tugger"); the fallen Grizabella is accompanied by a dramatic operatic [[aria]] ("Grizabella: The Glamour Cat"); Old Deuteronomy makes his grand entrance to a [[lullaby]]-turned-[[anthem]] ("Old Deuteronomy"); and Gus' nostalgia for the past is reflected through an old-fashioned [[music hall]] number ("Gus: The Theatre Cat").<ref name=Siropoulos129132>{{harvnb|Siropoulos|2010|pp=129–132}}</ref> Many of the songs are [[pastiche]]s of their respective genres, which Snelson attributes to the show's origins as a song cycle:

{{Quote
|text=The original concept of a set of contrasting numbers, without a dramatic narrative, meant that each song needed to establish some sort of musical characterization independent of the others and develop a quick rapport with the audience. Such a rapid familiarity and identification of purpose can be achieved through pastiche. But it was only a musical starting point, for the songs in ''Cats'' move beyond the straightforward "[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]" pastiche of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''; they are less pointed, more the free workings within a range of chosen styles than direct copies of a specific performer or number. The audience responds to the musical differences, given an initial security provided by the familiarity of recognizable, underlying stylistic generalities.<ref name=snelson162>{{harvnb|Snelson|2004|p=162}}</ref>
}}

Lloyd Webber also employs various techniques to help connect the pieces. Namely, the score relies heavily on recurring [[Motif (music)|motifs]] as well as the use of [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[reprise]]s.<ref name=sternfeld132133>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=132–133}}</ref> For instance, [[Melody|melodic]] fragments of "Memory" are sung by Grizabella and Jemima at several points in the show before the song is sung in full,<ref name=sternfeld160161>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=160–161}}</ref> serving to characterize Grizabella and foreshadow her final number.<ref name=everettlaird67>{{harvnb|Everett|Laird|2015|p=67}}</ref><ref name=McLamore415>{{harvnb|McLamore|2017|p=415}}</ref> Similarly, Lloyd Webber introduces a [[fugue]] in the overture, and variations of this theme are then repeated throughout the musical until it is finally resolved as Grizabella ascends to the Heaviside Layer.<ref name=sternfeld133142>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=133–142}}</ref>

The musical also features an unusual amount of "group-description" numbers. According to musicologist Jessica Sternfeld, such numbers are usually relegated to the [[prologue]] and nothing more, as seen in "[[Another Op'nin', Another Show]]" from ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' and "[[Tradition (song)|Tradition]]" from ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. ''Cats'' on the other hand features four Jellicle-defining songs: "Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats", "The Naming of Cats", "The Jellicle Ball" and "The Ad-Dressing of Cats". These numbers allow the cats to celebrate their tribe and species as a whole, in between the ones that celebrate individual members.<ref name=sternfeld127128/>

===Choreography===
[[File:Gillian Lynne Olivier Awards2013.jpg|thumb|[[Gillian Lynne]]]]
Regarded as "one of the most challenging shows to dance in musical theatre history",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/2019/11/26/what-the-hell-is-the-show-cats-has-always-astounded-people-says-andy-blankenbuehler.html|title=Four decades on, 'Cats' roars still|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=26 November 2019|first=Carly|last=Maga|access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> dance plays a major role in ''Cats'' as the original creative team had specifically set out to create "England's first dance musical".<ref name=catslynne>{{harvnb|Eliot|Eliot|Lloyd Webber|Nunn|1983|p=13}}</ref> Before ''Cats'', the industry-wide belief was that British dancers were inferior to their Broadway counterparts. The risky hiring of a British choreographer, Lynne, for a British dance musical was described by one historian as "a vivid and marvellous gesture of transatlantic defiance".<ref name=sternfeld118119>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=118–119}}</ref> Making Lynne's job more challenging was the fact that the music in ''Cats'' is unceasing and the majority of the cast remains on-stage throughout nearly the entire show.<ref name=sternfeld118119/>

Lynne choreographed the original London production with a dance crew consisting of her assistant Lindsay Dolan, the dance captain Jo-Anne Robinson, and cast members Finola Hughes and John Thornton.<ref name=catslynne/> The resulting choreography blends [[ballet]], [[modern dance]], [[Jazz dance|jazz]] and [[Tap dance|tap]], interspersed with acrobatic displays.<ref name=Siropoulos129132/> Lynne also trained the cast to evoke the movement, physicality and behaviour of actual cats.<ref name=smh>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/musicals/cat-in-the-act-20100305-po6n.html|title=Cat in the act|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 February 2010|first=Melissa|last=Kent|access-date=12 April 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=20 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520125840/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/musicals/cat-in-the-act-20100305-po6n.html}}</ref> These feline traits were incorporated into the movement and choreography so as to create an "[[anthropomorphic]] illusion".<ref name=Siropoulos129132/> Lynne considered the 13-minute "Jellicle Ball" dance to be the crux of the show, noting that in order to work as a dance-driven musical, ''Cats'' "had to succeed there or die".<ref name=catslynne/><ref name=lynnecourierpost>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31744588/courierpost/|title=How she makes Webber's 'Cats' purr like a kitten on stage|work=[[Courier-Post]]|date=2 December 1984|page=72|first=Robert|last=Baxter|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> She recalled the difficulty she faced in persuading Lloyd Webber to add the extended dance break, culminating in her and her dance crew having to dance all the parts in the "Jellicle Ball" to convince him.<ref name=catslynne/><ref name=lynnecourierpost/>

===Staging===
The original staging of ''Cats'' at the [[New London Theatre]] was considered revolutionary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/london-production-of-cats-to-close-on-may-11-com-103374|title=London Production of Cats to Close on May 11|work=[[Playbill]]|date=15 January 2002|first=Paul|last=Webb|access-date=15 May 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=23 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523131143/http://www.playbill.com/article/london-production-of-cats-to-close-on-may-11-com-103374}}</ref> and "one of the first truly immersive theatrical experiences".<ref name=independent2015>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/cats-revival-is-timeless-appeal-or-the-nicole-scherzinger-factor-the-reason-for-its-success-10021888.html|title=Cats revival: Timeless appeal or is Nicole Scherzinger the reason for its success?|work=[[The Independent]]|date=3 February 2015|first=Nick|last=Duerden|access-date=16 May 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=20 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520130425/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/cats-revival-is-timeless-appeal-or-the-nicole-scherzinger-factor-the-reason-for-its-success-10021888.html}}</ref> Instead of a conventional [[proscenium]], the theatre was quasi-[[Theatre in the round|in-the-round]] with a central [[revolving stage]].<ref name=nunnnyt>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/theater/trevor-nunn-reshapes-cats-for-broadway.html|title=Trevor Nunn Reshapes 'Cats' for Broadway|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 October 1982|access-date=15 May 2019|first=Steve|last=Lawson|url-status=live|archive-date=15 May 2019|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190515041901/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/03/theater/trevor-nunn-reshapes-cats-for-broadway.html}}</ref><ref name=wapostage>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1982/08/29/london-theater-cats-38/b5ab3269-1d74-4e73-b355-394c0c5249ed/|title=London Theater: 'Cats' &|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=29 August 1982|first=Richard L.|last=Coe|author-link=Richard L.

===Set and costume design===
Napier began designing the set in November 1980, wanting "a place where cats might congregate together, which also included maximum room for dancing".<ref name=junkyard/> The set of ''Cats'' consists of a junkyard filled with oversized props to give the illusion that the cast are the size of actual cats;<ref name=sternfeld116>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|p=116}}</ref> it remains the same throughout the show without any scene changes. Over 2,500 of these scaled-up props were used to fill the whole auditorium in the original Broadway production.<ref name=Siropoulos129132/><ref name=playbilltrivia/>

Napier also designed the costumes, combining cat and human features based on "hints" given in Eliot's poems, while ensuring that they did not impede the dancers' movements.<ref name=junkyard>{{cite web|url=https://www.catsthemusical.com/about-the-show/the-junkyard/|title=The Junkyard|publisher=catsthemusical.com (official website)|access-date=20 May 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=20 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520123716/https://www.catsthemusical.com/about-the-show/the-junkyard/}}</ref> The costumes generally consist of a [[unitard]], a wig that is fashioned to suggest the presence of feline ears, patches resembling body fur, and [[arm warmer|arm]] and [[leg warmer]]s to give the performers' hands and feet a more paw-like appearance. As with the contrasting music and dance styles, the costumes and make-up are used to bring out each character's distinct personality. For example, the costume for the flirtatious Bombalurina is designed to accentuate her sensuality, while the markings on the costume for Jemima&nbsp;— the youngest of the tribe&nbsp;— resemble crayon scribbles.<ref name=sternfeld130132>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=130–132}}</ref> Every character's design [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] is custom-painted by hand onto a plain unitard to line up with their performer's individual body. In order to reproduce the "hand-drawn aesthetic" of Napier's original design sketches, costume painters in the original Broadway production used [[squeeze bottle]]s to apply the paint. Due to the amount of dancing in ''Cats'', most of the costumes did not last longer than a few months.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollatsek|2016|pp=74, 103}}</ref>

===Heaviside layer===
The plot of ''Cats'' revolves around a tribe of cats vying to go to the "Heaviside Layer", which is used as a metaphor for rebirth.<ref name="The Story"/> The concept and the corresponding song "Journey to the Heaviside Layer" are based on an unpublished [[poem fragment]] by [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>[http://tseliot.com/editorials/in-eliots-own-words-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats In Eliot’s Own Words: Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats] (2016). Retrieved 14 June 2019.</ref>

The Japanese-language production of ''Cats'' by the [[Shiki Theatre Company]] has been playing continuously since it premiered in [[Shinjuku]], Tokyo, in November 1983.

''Cats'' redefined musical theatre in the German-speaking part of the world, turning an industry which consisted of [[repertory theatre]] at the time towards privately funded commercial productions. The success of the Vienna and Hamburg productions sparked a "musical boom" in the region that saw numerous musicals being launched not just in Germany but also in [[Switzerland]].<ref name=Menze/><ref name=catshamburg/> It also led to a "construction boom" in Germany as new theatrical venues such as the [[Schmidt Theater]] were enacted all around the country.<ref name=catshamburg/><ref name=poppenhager>{{harvnb|Poppenhäger|2000|p=44}}</ref> Germany has since grown to become the third largest musical market after the US and UK, with Hamburg as its "musical capital".<ref name=Menze/><ref name=catshamburg/>

After Hamburg, the German production transferred to [[Stuttgart]] where it played from 2001 to 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cats-abschied-ohne-katzenjammer-a-114917.html|title='Cats': Abschied ohne Katzenjammer|language=de|date=29 January 2001|newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]]|first=Lisa|last=Arns|access-date=29 May 2019|archive-date=11 May 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511022444/https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/cats-abschied-ohne-katzenjammer-a-114917.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reallyuseful.com/shows/cats/shows-archive/cats-cast-lists/cats-stuttgart-cast-march-2001|title=Stuttgart, March 2001|publisher=[[Really Useful Group]]|url-status=dead|access-date=9 April 2019|archive-date=23 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223094044/http://www.reallyuseful.com/shows/cats/shows-archive/cats-cast-lists/cats-stuttgart-cast-march-2001}}</ref> [[Stage Entertainment]] took over the production mid-2002 and moved the show to [[Berlin]] (2002–2004)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/legit/news/germany-s-stage-expands-its-holdings-1117869240/|title=Germany's Stage expands its holdings|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Ed|last=Meza|date=1 July 2002|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stage-entertainment.com/productions/y739BrkO1oGN7/|title=Cats: 2002 Berlin|publisher=[[Stage Entertainment]]|access-date=18 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916191511/https://www.stage-entertainment.com/productions/y739BrkO1oGN7/|archive-date=16 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> and later [[Düsseldorf]] (2004–2005),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stage-entertainment.com/productions/n8mNgQoqxgLMp/|title=Cats: 2004 Düsseldorf|publisher=[[Stage Entertainment]]|access-date=18 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190916191510/https://www.stage-entertainment.com/productions/n8mNgQoqxgLMp/|archive-date=16 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> before touring other cities until 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicalzentrale.de/index.php?service=0&subservice=2&details=85|title=Cats (Tour 2004–06)|work=Musicalzentrale|language=de|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=2005tickets>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407021445/http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/cats/buy.htm|title=Cats: Buy Tickets (2005)|publisher=[[Really Useful Group]]|url=http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/cats/buy.htm|archive-date=7 April 2005|access-date=15 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Mehr-Entertainment launched a separate tour of ''Cats'' that ran from December 2010 to June 2013, performing in a travelling purpose-built tent theatre.<ref name=catshamburg/> Besides Germany, this company also made stops in cities in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicalzentrale.de/index.php?service=0&subservice=2&details=3500|title=Cats (Tour 2011–13)|work=Musicalzentrale|language=de|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
====London====
The original London production received mostly rave reviews, with critics hailing it as a watershed moment in British musical theatre.<ref name=sternfeld121123>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=121–123}}</ref> [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' lauded ''Cats'' as "an exhilarating piece of total theatre". Billington praised the show's "strong framework" and the ease in which the poems were integrated. He was also very impressed by Lloyd Webber's fitting compositions, Napier's environmental set, Lynne's effective and at times brilliant choreography, and Nunn's "dazzling staging" that makes use of the entire auditorium.<ref name=billington1981>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31752533/cats_musical_review_12_may_1981/|title=Cats|work=[[The Guardian]]|author-link=Michael Billington (critic)|first=Michael|last=Billington|date=12 May 1981|page=9|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The show received similarly glowing reviews from ''[[The Sunday Times]]''{{'}} [[Derek Jewell]] and ''[[The Stage]]''{{'}}s Peter Hepple. Jewell proclaimed it to be "among the most exhilarating and innovative musicals ever staged",<ref name=sternfeld121123/> while Hepple declared that with ''Cats'', "the British musical has taken a giant leap forward, surpassing in ingenuity and invention anything Broadway has sent us".<ref>{{cite news |title=Play Reviews: Cats |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001180/19810514/098/0011 |access-date=21 May 2019|work=[[The Stage]]|date=14 May 1981 |page=11 |first=Peter|last=Hepple|via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

There were a few lukewarm reviews, most notably from [[Irving Wardle]] of ''[[The Times]]''. Wardle enjoyed Lloyd Webber's compositions but found the visual spectacle too overwhelming.<ref name=sternfeld121123/> Robert Cushman's review for ''[[The Observer]]'' concluded that ''Cats'' was flawed but unmissable.<ref name=cushman1981>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/31753213/the_observer/|title=The cat's whiskers|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Robert|last=Cushman|date=17 May 1981|page=31|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>

====Broadway====
Reactions to the original Broadway production were mixed.<ref name=greenfield>{{harvnb|Greenfield|2009|p=101}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Frank Rich]] noted that the main draw of the show was that it "transports the audience into a complete fantasy world that could only exist in the theater". He attributed much of this "wondrous spectacle" to Nunn's direction, Napier's set and costume designs, as well as the talented cast. Rich found many of Lloyd Webber's songs to be "cleverly and appropriately" pastiche, and was impressed with how Lynne and Nunn distinguished each character through personalised movement. However, he panned Lynne's choreography and felt that the musical failed in its vague attempt to tell a story. Overall, he wished that the show had more "feeling to go with its most inventive stagecraft."<ref name=frankrich>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/08/theater/theater-lloyd-webber-s-cats.html|title=Theatre: Lloyd Webber's 'Cats'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 October 1982|first=Frank|last=Rich|author-link=Frank Rich|access-date=27 March 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=27 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327104043/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/08/theater/theater-lloyd-webber-s-cats.html}}</ref> [[Clive Barnes]] of the ''New York Post'' concluded his review saying: "Its importance lies in its wholeheartedness.

The 2016 Broadway revival received a similarly mixed review by [[Charles Isherwood]] of ''The New York Times''.

Despite mixed reviews when ''Cats'' opened in New York in 1982, critics agreed that it was innovative and visually spectacular in ways that Broadway had never seen before.<ref name=sternfeld172174>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=172–174}}</ref> The musical became a cultural phenomenon and has had a profound influence on the medium.<ref name=greenfield99100>{{harvnb|Greenfield|2009|pp=99–100}}</ref> ''Cats'' established musical theatre as a global commodity,<ref name=Siropoulos142143/><ref name=Wollman169170/> marking the beginning of a new era in the industry that is characterised by huge global stakes for potentially even huger global profits.<ref name=Siropoulos142143/> It led the shift in the Broadway market towards big-budget [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s and shows that appeal to families and tourists,<ref name=grimes1997/><ref name=dietz151152/> which in turn left smaller productions struggling to compete.<ref name=Wollman169170/> ''Cats'' also ushered in a "[[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of British musicals" which saw West End exports dominate the industry for nearly two decades.<ref name=telegraphclosing/><ref name=sternfeld110111>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=110–111}}</ref> Musical theatre historian Vagelis Siropoulos asserted that in terms of impact, the "seminal Broadway opening" of ''Cats'' was "comparable only to [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' thirty nine years ago."<ref name=Siropoulos142143/>

Ultimately, critics are polarized on whether ''Cats'' has changed musical theatre for the better or for the worse. [[William Grimes (journalist)|William Grimes]] wrote of its detractors: "There are more than a few who see the ''Cats'' phenomenon as the theatrical equivalent of the rise of the megabudget [[Hollywood]] [[action film]]. For them, ''Cats'' is a soulless money machine."<ref name=sternfeld172174/>

===Influence and innovations===
As the "first true [[megamusical]]",<ref name=sternfeld113114>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=113–114}}</ref> ''Cats'' pioneered a genre of musical theatre that is produced on a grand and global scale. It paved the way for later megamusicals&nbsp;— including ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1985), ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986) and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' (1989)&nbsp;— that have dominated the industry since.<ref name=Allain206207>{{harvnb|Allain|Harvie|2014|pp=206–207}}</ref> Siropoulos explained:

{{quote|
text= ''Cats'' is considered the quintessential megamusical, because it reconceived, like no other show before, theatrical space as an immense affective encompasser, that transforms the viewing experience into a hypercharged thrill-ride and the spectator into an explorer of new and challenging aural and visual sensations. Its unprecedented success paved the way for even bolder hyperspatial configurations, made the set designer a proper environment builder and raised [[Lighting designer|light]] and [[sound design]] into the status of art in their own right. It also paved the way for the constant revolutionization of stage technology.<ref>{{harvnb|Siropoulos|2008|p=194}}</ref>}}

[[File:Cats the Musical in London 1999 (12).jpg|thumb|The cat's-eyes logo and the "now and forever" slogan were used to advertise the musical at the New London Theatre (1999).]] 
''Cats'' introduced a marketing strategy that set the template for subsequent megamusicals. Early advertisements for the musical did not feature traditional [[pull quote]]s (despite many positive reviews) or any of the cast, instead branding the show itself as the star. It did this by adopting&nbsp;— and then aggressively promoting&nbsp;— a single recognisable image (the cat's-eyes logo) as the face of the show.<ref name=sternfeld75126/> The cat's-eyes logo was the first globally marketed logo in musical theatre history,<ref name=grimes1997/> and was paired with a [[tagline]] ("now and forever") to create what ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called "one of musical theatre's greatest posters".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10951266/Five-reasons-why-Cats-seems-to-enjoy-nine-lives.html|title=Five reasons why Cats seems to enjoy nine lives|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 July 2014|first=Dominic|last=Cavendish|access-date=28 July 2019}}</ref> Such branding emblems proved equally effective for later megamusicals, as seen with the waif [[Cosette]] for ''Les Misérables'' and the Phantom's mask for ''The Phantom of the Opera''. This advertising method had the additional effect of diminishing the importance of critical reviews, popularising the so-called "critic-proof" status of megamusicals.<ref name=sternfeld75126>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=75, 78, 125–126}}</ref>

Additionally, ''Cats'' was the first Broadway and West End show to capitalise on merchandising as a major revenue stream. Stalls were set up in the theatre lobbies to sell souvenirs ranging from toys and watches to coffee mugs, all of which were emblazoned with the cat's-eyes logo. The official ''Cats'' t-shirt became the second-best-selling t-shirt in the world in the 1980s, second only to the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] t-shirt. Merchandising has since become an important source of income for the industry.<ref name=Siropoulos142143>{{harvnb|Siropoulos|2010|pp=142–143}}</ref><ref name=nypostmerch>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/08/02/thanks-to-cats-theater-souvenirs-are-now-and-forever/|title=Thanks to 'Cats,' theater souvenirs are now and forever!|work=[[New York Post]]|date=2 August 2016|first=Michael|last=Riedel|access-date=8 July 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707182248/https://nypost.com/2016/08/02/thanks-to-cats-theater-souvenirs-are-now-and-forever/}}</ref>

Beyond the megamusical, ''Cats'' also led the Broadway trend for musicals aimed at families and tourists, which later took the form of the [[Disney Theatrical Productions]] and [[jukebox musical]]s.<ref name=dietz151152>{{harvnb|Dietz|2016|pp=151–152}}</ref><ref name=5ways>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/legit/news/how-cats-changed-broadway-1201827574/|title='Cats': 5 Ways the Smash Musical Changed Broadway|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2 August 2016|first=Gordon|last=Cox|url-status=live|archive-date=7 July 2019|access-date=8 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707194329/https://variety.com/2016/legit/news/how-cats-changed-broadway-1201827574/}}</ref> The marketing campaigns for the musical targeted family audiences at a time when this demographic was not a consideration in the industry.<ref name=5ways/> Composer [[Joe Raposo]] said of family musicals in 1986: "''Cats'' is a wonderful proof of what an audience is out there, untapped.

[[File:Radio mics.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Radio microphones have become the norm in live theatre since ''Cats''.<ref name=Leonard112/>]]
The musical's [[fantasy]] setting and disregard for [[Verisimilitude (fiction)|verisimilitude]] allowed for groundbreaking experimentations in lighting and audio technology. The original London and Broadway productions featured [[David Hersey]]'s pioneering use of [[automated lighting]] to produce kaleidoscopic landscapes and complicated optical effects. Hersey also used light in an "architectural manner", with fast-changing configurations to spotlight different performers in rapid succession. This dynamic shifting of the audience's perspective created an effect similar to that of [[fast cutting]] in film editing.<ref name=Siropoulos129132/> The original London production of ''Cats'' was also the first known instance in which an entire cast was individually outfitted with [[radio microphones]].<ref name=Leonard112>{{harvnb|Leonard|2001|p=112}}</ref> The departure from shared ambient microphones meant that the show did not have to depend on the acoustics and architectural design of the theatrical venue, and enabled the sound designer to achieve cinematic levels of sound amplification and studio-quality audio in live theatre.<ref name=burston207208>{{harvnb|Burston|1998|pp=207–208}}</ref> This practice transformed sound design and has since become the norm in live theatre.<ref name=Leonard112/>

''Cats'' opened new regional, touring and international markets that the industry continues to capitalise on.<ref name=Wollman169170/> Recognising the global potential of his show, Mackintosh replicated the original production worldwide with an unprecedented degree of standardisation.<ref name=Siropoulos142143/> Paraphrasing theatre historian Alan Filewod, Marla Carlson wrote:

Mackintosh's insistence that all touring productions of ''Cats'' replicate the Broadway production also resulted in the expansion and upgrading of regional theatre venues to accommodate the musical's demanding logistical requirements, as local theatre owners did not want to miss out on the opportunity to host the lucrative show.<ref name=greenfield100102>{{harvnb|Greenfield|2009|pp=100, 102}}</ref>

"Memory" is the standout hit song from ''Cats''. By 2002, the song had been played over two million times on radio and television stations in the US.<ref name=guardianclosing/> It was the most requested song at piano bars and lounges in the 1980s, and was an equally popular choice at weddings, concerts and other gatherings. As of 2006, the song had been recorded around 600 times by artists such as [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Judy Collins]], and [[Johnny Mathis]], in covers ranging from [[easy listening]] to [[techno]].<ref name=sternfeld125163>{{harvnb|Sternfeld|2006|pp=125, 157, 163}}</ref> According to Sternfeld, it is "by some estimations the most successful song ever from a musical."<ref name=sternfeld113114/>

Despite moderate hits with ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', Lloyd Webber was still relatively unknown to the general public before ''Cats'', especially in the US. With ''Cats'', he became a big celebrity in his own right.<ref name=sternfeld113114/> The musical also established the theatrical careers of the original creative and production team. Following ''Cats'', they collaborated on other global blockbusters including ''[[Starlight Express]]'' (composed by Lloyd Webber, directed by Nunn and designed by Napier), ''Les Misérables'' (directed by Nunn, designed by Napier and produced by Mackintosh), and ''The Phantom of the Opera'' (composed by Lloyd Webber, choreographed by Lynne and produced by Mackintosh).<ref name=sternfeld117118/><ref name=snelson3233>{{harvnb|Snelson|2004|pp=32–33}}</ref>

==Revisions and cut material==
The stage production of ''Cats'' has undergone several revisions since its London opening. When the show transferred to Broadway, several cuts and rewrites were made with the intention of appealing more to an American audience.<ref name=unmasked375>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|p=375}}</ref> Additionally, a song entitled "Cat Morgan Introduces Himself" was cut during initial development. Lloyd Webber performed this song at the show's 6,138th Broadway performance, when it broke the record to become the longest-running Broadway show.<ref name=1997record>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cats-breaks-broadway-record-com-329193|title=Cats Breaks Broadway Record|work=[[Playbill]]|date=20 June 1997|first=Robert|last=Viagas|access-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=22 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522075713/http://www.playbill.com/article/cats-breaks-broadway-record-com-329193}}</ref>

==="Growltiger's Last Stand"===
The "Growltiger's Last Stand" sequence has been changed multiple times over the course of the show's history. In the original London production, the "last duet" for Growltiger and Griddlebone was a setting for an unpublished Eliot poem, "The Ballad of Billy M'Caw". For the original Broadway production, the Ballad was replaced with "In Una Tepida Notte", a parody of Italian opera with more [[slapstick]] humour.<ref name=playbilltrivia/><ref name=unmasked384385>{{harvnb|Lloyd Webber|2018|pp=384–385}}</ref> This new version was eventually incorporated into all other productions of ''Cats''.<ref name=playbilltrivia>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/cats-trivia-encyclopedia-70737|title=Cats Trivia Encyclopedia|work=[[Playbill]]|date=17 June 1997|first=Ellis|last=Nassour|access-date=24 March 2019|url-status=live|archive-date=24 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324151802/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/cats-trivia-encyclopedia-70737}}</ref>

"Growltiger's Last Stand" has been criticised as being racially offensive. The original lyrics, taken directly from the Eliot poem it is based on, included the ethnic slur "[[Chink]]s" and this was later replaced with the word "[[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]]".<ref name=growltiger>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/08/04/cats-broadway-revival/|title='Cats' Is Returning to Broadway Minus One Racist Song|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=4 August 2016|first=Tom|last=Huddleston Jr.|access-date=3 April 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403130801/http://fortune.com/2016/08/04/cats-broadway-revival/|archive-date=3 April 2019}}</ref> The number also originally involved the cast putting on "Asian accents" to portray the Siamese cats.<ref name=isherwood2016/>
In the 1998 video version, the entire scene featuring Growltiger was cut.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Peter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/01/tv/cover-story-broadway-s-cats-restaged-for-eternity-we-thought-they-were-kidding.html|title=Broadway's 'Cats': Restaged for Eternity (And We Thought They Were Kidding!)|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 November 1998|access-date=5 April 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190405061425/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/01/tv/cover-story-broadway-s-cats-restaged-for-eternity-we-thought-they-were-kidding.html|archive-date=5 April 2019}}</ref> By 2016, "Growltiger's Last Stand" had been removed completely from the US and UK productions of the show.<ref name=growltiger/>

===Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer===
In the original London production, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were characters in their own right and sang their eponymous song themselves as a singsong-style duet. When the show transferred to Broadway, the song was instead sung in the third-person, with Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer as puppets being magically controlled by Mr. Mistoffelees. Their number was also rewritten to be faster and more upbeat, alternating between [[vaudeville]]-style verses and a "manic [[patter song|patter]]" section. Eventually, the Broadway version of the song was rewritten to allow Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer to once again sing their own song as full characters.<ref name=McLamore416418>{{harvnb|McLamore|2017|pp=416–418}}</ref>

===Rum Tum Tugger===
The 2014 London revival introduced several modernizations to the show. Rum Tum Tugger was reworked from a ladies-man rockstar to a [[breakdancing]] street cat. His eponymous musical number was also turned into a [[Rapping|rap]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/10951867/Cats-classic-musical-to-feature-a-rapping-cat.html|title=Cats: classic musical to feature a rapping cat|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 July 2014|first=Anita|last=Singh|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://britishtheatre.com/review-cats-new-wimbledon-theatre/|title=REVIEW: Cats, New Wimbledon Theatre|work=BritishTheatre.com|date=11 November 2016|first=Alexa|last=Terry|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> The 2015 Australian tour and 2015 Paris production also used the new version of the character; however, the 2016 Broadway revival did not.

===Choreography===
The 2016 Broadway revival featured new choreography by [[Andy Blankenbuehler]], who introduced more [[hip hop]] and [[cool jazz]] elements to the movements and dances.<ref name=dancemagjellicle/> Blankenbuehler's choreography for the ensemble numbers did not differ too much from the original by Lynne, but significant changes were made in several solo numbers, including "The Rum Tum Tugger" and "Mr. Mistoffelees".<ref name=isherwood2016/>
