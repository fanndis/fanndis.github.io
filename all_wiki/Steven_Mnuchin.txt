In the five years following Mnuchin's acquisition of OneWest, the bank foreclosed on 36,000 homes in California, leading local activists to begin calling Mnuchin "the foreclosure king."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/20/the-high-finance-mogul-in-charge-of-our-economic-recovery}}</ref> The high foreclosure rate might have been a result of the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, whereby the FDIC had to reimburse OneWest for losses.<ref name="bloomberg2"/> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', OneWest "was involved in a string of lawsuits over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars".<ref name="NYT02"/> Because of these foreclosures, around 100 protesters of [[Occupy Los Angeles]] gathered outside Mnuchin's home in October 2011 and held signs that read "Make Banks Pay".<ref name="bloomberg"/> Two California fair-housing groups filed complaints to the federal government alleging that OneWest had violated the [[Fair Housing Act]] by not lending money to African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.<ref name="BI01"/><ref name="NYT01"/><ref name=politico>{{cite web |last1=Woellert |first1=Lorraine |title=Trump Treasury pick made millions after his bank foreclosed on homeowners |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-treasury-foreclosed-homes-mnuchin-232038 |website=[[Politico]] |accessdate=December 5, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205031950/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-treasury-foreclosed-homes-mnuchin-232038 |archivedate=December 5, 2016 }}</ref>

In November 2016, after OneWest was sold to CIT, the California Reinvestment Coalition submitted a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request to the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) to learn more about CIT's [[reverse mortgage]] subsidiary, Financial Freedom.<ref name=politico/> According to the HUD's response, CIT/Financial Freedom foreclosed on 16,220 federally insured reverse mortgages from April 2009 to April 2016. This represented about 39% of all federally insured reverse mortgage foreclosures during that time. CRC estimated that Financial Freedom serviced only about 17% of the market and thus was foreclosing more than twice as often as its competitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dsnews.com/news/04-27-2016/is-something-amiss-in-the-reverse-mortgage-industry |title=Is Something Amiss in the Reverse Mortgage Industry? |publisher=DSNews |date=November 13, 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211749/http://www.dsnews.com/news/04-27-2016/is-something-amiss-in-the-reverse-mortgage-industry |archivedate=November 17, 2016 }}</ref> CIT Group disclosed to investors that it had received subpoenas from HUD's Office of the Inspector General in the third and fourth quarters of 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Dreier |first=Peter |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-worst-of-wall-street-meet-donald-trumps-finance-chairman/ |title=The Worst of Wall Street: Meet Donald Trump's Finance Chairman |newspaper=[[The Nation]] |date=May 10, 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119140806/https://www.thenation.com/article/the-worst-of-wall-street-meet-donald-trumps-finance-chairman/ |archivedate=November 19, 2016 }}</ref> In November 2016, two non-profits filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging [[redlining]] by OneWest Bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/11/17/bank-tied-trump-adviser-accused-redlining/93964914/ |title=Bank tied to Trump adviser accused of discrimination |website=USA Today |date=September 27, 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119044232/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/11/17/bank-tied-trump-adviser-accused-redlining/93964914/ |archivedate=November 19, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/mnuchin-onewest/ |title=Trump treasury pick's bank accused of discriminating against minorities |first1=David |last1=Fitzpatrick |first2=Drew |last2=Griffin |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |date=January 17, 2017 |accessdate=May 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218185627/http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/mnuchin-onewest/ |archivedate=February 18, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/11/17/steven-mnuchin-black-trump/ |title=Steven Mnuchin's Bank Has Been Accused of Discrimination |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |first1=Lucinda |last1=Shen |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=May 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621135556/http://fortune.com/2016/11/17/steven-mnuchin-black-trump/ |archivedate=June 21, 2017 }}</ref>

In 2012, after Dune's deal with 20th Century Fox ended, Mnuchin teamed up with filmmaker [[Brett Ratner]] and Australian businessman [[James Packer]] to merge his Dune Entertainment company with Ratner and Packer's newly founded [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment|RatPac Entertainment]] joint venture; resulting in [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]], which then struck a financing deal with Warner Bros. Between 2013 and 2018, RatPac-Dune financed many films for Warner Bros., including ''[[American Sniper]]'' and ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''. Mnuchin was co-chairman of the trio's movie company, [[Relativity Media]], but left seven months before it went bankrupt.<ref name="NYT02">{{cite web |last1=Sorkin |first1=Andrew Ross |title=Unlikely Fund-Raiser for Trump and Party (hardcopy) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/business/dealbook/donald-trumps-pick-for-fund-raiser-is-rife-with-contradictions.html |accessdate=May 10, 2016 |work=The New York Times |date=May 10, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515113527/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/business/dealbook/donald-trumps-pick-for-fund-raiser-is-rife-with-contradictions.html |archivedate=May 15, 2016 }}</ref> A source close to the company said he had resigned because of the potential for a conflict of interest between his duties at Relativity and OneWest.<ref name="RaineyExit"/> He and other investors reportedly lost $80&nbsp;million.<ref name="WashPo"/>

Mnuchin worked with [[Republican National Committee]] counterpart [[Lewis Eisenberg]] on a late-developing joint operation for the committee and the Trump campaign.

===Political views===
In a November 30, 2016, interview on ''[[CNBC]]'', Mnuchin called it the Trump administration's job to "make sure that the average American has wage increases and good jobs". Furthermore, he said his priority was getting a sustained growth of GDP of 3% or 4%. He said in order to get there, "our number one priority is tax reform". Mnuchin said he would reduce corporate taxes to 15%, cut taxes for the middle class, and simplify the tax system. When asked about trade, he said he believed in trade deals with individual countries, as opposed to regional trade deals. Mnuchin said, "This president [...] is going to have open communication with business leaders", when asked about keeping jobs from being offshored to Mexico.<ref name="cnbc_2016-111-30"/> During the interview, he also said he wants to "strip back parts of [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd–Frank]]", because he argued it was too complicated, and it prevented banks from lending. He called the stripping back of Dodd–Frank "the number-one priority on the regulatory side".<ref name="nytimes"/>

On November 30, 2016, Donald Trump announced on his website that he would nominate Mnuchin as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]].<ref name="greatagain"/> In the statement, Trump called Mnuchin a "world-class financier, banker, and businessman", and he said Mnuchin played an important role in developing his "plan to build a dynamic, booming economy". Mnuchin himself said he was "honored to have the opportunity to serve our great country in this important role". He called Trump's economic agenda a "bold" one "that creates good-paying jobs and defends the American worker".<ref name="greatagain">{{cite web |url=https://greatagain.gov/president-elect-trump-announces-nominations-for-treasury-and-commerce-departments-8772d0fc6553 |title=President-Elect Donald J.

''The New York Times'' noted that Mnuchin's selection "fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump's campaign attacks on the financial industry". For example, an ad of Trump's campaign said Goldman Sachs' CEO had "robbed [the] working class". Mnuchin is the third former Goldman-Sachs executive to serve in the job, after [[Henry M. Paulson Jr.|Hank Paulson]], under President [[George W. Bush]], and [[Robert Rubin]], under President [[Bill Clinton]], in the 2000s and 1990s, respectively.<ref name="NYT01"/>

During his Senate confirmation hearing on January 19, 2017, Mnuchin was criticized by Democrats for OneWest's foreclose practices. Mnuchin said: "Since I was first nominated to serve as treasury secretary, I have been maligned as taking advantage of others' hardships in order to earn a buck.

====Artificial intelligence====
Mnuchin, when asked in an interview with [[Michael Allen (journalist)|Mike Allen]] of [[AXIOS Media|Axios]] "whether he was worried about [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] displacing jobs, replied: 'not at all{{nbsp}}...

While briefing reporters on April 26, Mnuchin said President Trump "has no intention" to release his tax returns, asserting that Trump "has released plenty of information".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2017/04/26/mnuchin-trump-tax-returns/100940974/ |title=Mnuchin: Trump has 'no intention' of releasing returns |date=April 26, 2017 |publisher=The Detroit News |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426222242/http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2017/04/26/mnuchin-trump-tax-returns/100940974/ |archivedate=April 26, 2017 }}</ref>

In the August 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville, Virginia, opposing the removal of Confederate statues, protesters included neo-Nazis and Klansmen, leading to violent conflicts. President Trump said there was "blame on both sides". Several hundred of Mnuchin's Yale classmates drafted a letter urging him to resign from the administration in protest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/steve-mnuchin-yale-alumni-urge-him-to-resign-from-trump-administration-2017-8/ |title=Steve Mnuchin's Yale classmates are urging him to resign from the Trump administration in protest |date=August 18, 2017 |publisher=Business Insider |first=Brian |last=Logan |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820162841/http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/steve-mnuchin-yale-alumni-urge-him-to-resign-from-trump-administration-2017-8/ |archivedate=August 20, 2017 }}</ref> Mnuchin responded by saying: "While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape, or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways."<ref name=charlottesville>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/19/mnuchin-defends-trump-charlottesville-241830 |title=Mnuchin, facing calls for resignation, defends Trump |date=August 19, 2017 |publisher=Politico |first=Zachary |last=Warmbrodt |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822134702/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/19/mnuchin-defends-trump-charlottesville-241830 |archivedate=August 22, 2017 }}</ref>

On September 24, Mnuchin appeared on [[This Week (ABC TV series)|''This Week'']] and [[State of the Union (American TV program)|''State of the Union'']] to defend Trump's call to "get that son of a bitch off the field right now", referring to the [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)|protests by professional athletes]] starting in 2016, most notably marked by [[Colin Kaepernick]] kneeling during the pregame singing of the national anthem. Mnuchin said: "...{{nbsp}}it's not about race, it's not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time.{{nbsp}}... [T]his is about respect for the military and first responders in the country."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/nfl-players-mnuchin-trump-free-speech-243065 |title=Mnuchin: NFL players 'can do free speech on their own time' |author=Robillard, Kevin |date=September 24, 2017 |newspaper=Politico |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924174759/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/nfl-players-mnuchin-trump-free-speech-243065 |archivedate=September 24, 2017 }}</ref>

====Comments on ''Lego Batman'' movie====
In March 2017, Mnuchin drew ethics concerns as regarding a statement he had made urging parents to "send all your kids to ''LEGO Batman''" during an interview with [[Axios (website)|Axios]], apparently endorsing ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' which he was an [[executive producer]] of. Just earlier in the interview, Mnuchin acknowledged: "I'm not allowed to promote anything that I'm involved in."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/steven-mnuchin-lego-batman-movie/520782/ |title=Holy Ethics Disaster, Batman! |author=Venook, Jeremy |date=March 24, 2017 |newspaper=The Atlantic |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925230826/https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/03/steven-mnuchin-lego-batman-movie/520782/ |archivedate=September 25, 2017 }}</ref> In response, Mnuchin wrote in a letter to [[Walter Shaub]] at the [[Office of Government Ethics]] (OGE) that he "should not have made that statement", and assured the OGE that "it was not my intention to make a product endorsement".<ref>Vitali, Ali, [http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/mnuchin-not-my-intention-promote-lego-batman-movie-n741016 "Mnuchin: 'Not My Intention' to Promote Lego Batman Movie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331183120/http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/mnuchin-not-my-intention-promote-lego-batman-movie-n741016 |date=March 31, 2017 }}, [[NBC News]], March 31, 2017.

====Divestment from prior businesses====
In May 2017, it was reported that Mnuchin's fiancée, [[Louise Linton]], had succeeded him as the interim CEO of [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment|Dune Entertainment]] effective February 2017.

Following criticism of his use of a [[United States Air Force]] jet on a trip to [[Kentucky]] that involved viewing the [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017|solar eclipse]], the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened up an inquiry into Mnuchin's use of government aircraft.<ref name="washingtonpost_2017-08-31">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/treasury-inspector-general-to-review-mnuchin-flight-to-ft-knox/2017/08/31/d9e122d4-8eb2-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html |title=Treasury inspector general to review Mnuchin's flight to Fort Knox |author=Harwell, Drew |date=August 31, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915173827/https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/treasury-inspector-general-to-review-mnuchin-flight-to-ft-knox/2017/08/31/d9e122d4-8eb2-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html |archivedate=September 15, 2017 }}</ref> The watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)]] request regarding Mnuchin's use of government aircraft.

During the OIG's investigation into Mnuchin's use of government aircraft, it was revealed that Mnuchin had requested a military jet for his honeymoon travel to Europe in June 2017. Mnuchin stated that, as a member of the [[United States National Security Council]], he needed access to secure communications during his honeymoon, but withdrew his request for the military jet after an alternative was identified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mnuchin-honeymoon-aircraft-20170914-htmlstory.html |title=Treasury inspector general looking into Steven Mnuchin's request for a military jet for his honeymoon |author=Puzzanghera, Jim |date=September 14, 2017 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925230437/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mnuchin-honeymoon-aircraft-20170914-htmlstory.html |archivedate=September 25, 2017 }}</ref> Mnuchin stated: "I'm very sensitive to the use of government funds. I've never asked the government to pay for my personal travel{{nbsp}}... The story [regarding the honeymoon travel request] was quite misreported."<ref name=WaPo-170914 /> The OIG investigation also showed Mnuchin had taken a [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[C-37A]], the military designation of the [[Gulfstream V]], to return from New York to Washington on August 15 after flying to New York commercially. Although the request for travel on the military jet was initiated by Mnuchin's office, the aircraft had previously been used to fly Transportation Secretary [[Elaine Chao]] from [[Joint Base Andrews]] to [[Teterboro Airport]]. Mnuchin's return flight lasted less than an hour and had an operating cost of at least $25,000.<ref name=ABC-170922>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mnuchins-travel-investigators-now-probing-costly-government-flight/story?id=50006219 |title=Mnuchin's travel: Investigators now probing another costly government flight |author1=Fishel, Justin |author2=McLaughlin, Elizabeth |date=September 22, 2017 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=September 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925011743/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mnuchins-travel-investigators-now-probing-costly-government-flight/story?id=50006219 |archivedate=September 25, 2017 }}</ref>

The OIG released its report on October 4, 2017, concluding that there was "no violation of law in these requests and uses" of government aircraft by Mnuchin, but also expressing concern regarding "a disconnect between the standard of proof called for in the Daley memo and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests".<ref name=Delmar-171004>{{cite letter |url=http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015e-ee60-dfe3-abfe-ffe93fab0000 |subject=Memorandum: Inquiry Re Use of Government Aircraft by Secretary Mnuchin |author=Delmar, Rich |date=October 4, 2017 |recipient=Inspector General Thornton |publisher=Department of the Treasury |accessdate=October 5, 2017 |archivedate=October 6, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006053636/http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015e-ee60-dfe3-abfe-ffe93fab0000 |url-status=live}}</ref> The referenced Daley Memo was issued by then-White House Chief of Staff [[William M. Daley]] on April 4, 2011, and it stated the standards for use of government aircraft by senior executive branch officials were given in [[OMB Circular A-126]], dated February 10, 1993. The Daley Memo also states that travel using military aircraft must be considered a White House Support Mission, taken at the specific direction of the President under one of a set of limited circumstances that "make commercial transportation unacceptable".<ref name=Delmar-171004 /> The typical reimbursement paid by requesting federal executive agencies covers only the cost of an equivalent coach ticket on a commercial flight.<ref name=ABC-170922 />

In the report, the OIG reviewed nine travel requests by Mnuchin for military air transportation since March 2017, of which seven were approved and taken, one was withdrawn, and one was approved with travel pending in late October 2017.<ref name=Delmar-171004 /> The total cost of the seven trips taken was $811,800, calculated from per-hour cost and operating hours for the specific aircraft, or Air Force-provided direct costs of operations. Two of the flights, taken to Europe in March and May 2017, each cost more than $300,000. On one flight, to Ottawa in June, Mnuchin was accompanied by his then-fiancée Linton. The total cost of the Ottawa trip was $16,350, and the reimbursement repaid for Linton's cost of travel was $744.<ref name=CNN-171005>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/05/news/mnuchin-trips-government-planes/index.html |title=The 7 trips Steven Mnuchin took on government planes for $811,800 |author=Horowitz, Julia |date=October 5, 2017 |accessdate=October 5, 2017 |publisher=CNN |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006042338/http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/05/news/mnuchin-trips-government-planes/index.html |archivedate=October 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/mnuchin-military-flights.html |title=Seven Flights for $800,000: Mnuchin's Travel on Military Jets |author=Rappeport, Alan |date=October 5, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=October 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005235225/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/mnuchin-military-flights.html |archivedate=October 5, 2017 }}</ref> Due to an inconsistency in the records provided for the trip to New York on August 15, the OIG opened a second inquiry in October 2017, "to assure that [the OIG] have in fact received all relevant records".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/10/news/economy/treasury-inspector-general-mnuchin-travel/index.html |title=Inspector general launches second review of Steven Mnuchin's travels |author=Borak, Donna |date=October 10, 2017 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 11, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011054404/http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/10/news/economy/treasury-inspector-general-mnuchin-travel/index.html |archivedate=October 11, 2017 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Mnuchin's mother was a long-time investor with [[Bernie Madoff]]. After his mother died in early 2005, Mnuchin and his brother liquidated her investments, making $3.2&nbsp;million. A Madoff trustee sued to retrieve the money from the Mnuchins, but a court ruled that the Madoff trust could recoup money only from those who had cashed out less than two years before the December 2008 collapse of Madoff's company.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eisinger |first=Jesse |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/trumps-treasury-secretary-pick-steven-mnuchin-is-a-lucky-man |title=Trump's Treasury Secretary Pick is a Lucky Man.
