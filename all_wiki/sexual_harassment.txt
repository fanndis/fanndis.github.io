'''Sexual harassment''' is a type of [[harassment]] involving the use of explicit or implicit sexual overtones, including the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Paludi | first1 = Michele A. | last2 = Barickman | first2 = Richard B. | chapter = Definitions and incidence of academic and workplace sexual harassment | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vx4qhVPOYUUC&pg=PA2 | title = Academic and workplace sexual harassment: a resource manual | pages = [https://archive.org/details/academicworkplac0000palu/page/2 2–5] | publisher = SUNY Press | location = Albany, NY | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780791408308 | url = https://archive.org/details/academicworkplac0000palu/page/2 }}</ref> Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from verbal transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault|assault]].<ref name="auto">Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda.

In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that is due to the fact that they do not impose a "general civility code."<ref>{{caselaw source |case=''Oncale v.Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.'', 528 U.S. 75 (1998) |findlaw=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/75.html |justia=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/523/75/case.html}}</ref> In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.

Sexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal [[employment discrimination]]. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.

==Etymology and history==
The modern legal understanding of sexual harassment was first developed in the 1970s, although related concepts have existed in many cultures.

=== The term "sexual harassment" ===
Although legal activist [[Catharine MacKinnon]] is sometimes credited with creating the laws surrounding sexual harassment in the United States with her 1979 book entitled ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women'',<ref name=":8" /> she did not coin the term. The phrase appeared in print in a 1972 issue of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper published in Toronto.<ref>Hugh Gardner, "..and every prisoner an unprintable word," ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 18 March 1972, p. 35. Source: ProQuest Historical Newspapers digital archive.</ref> An early use of the term was in a 1973 report about discrimination called ''"Saturn's Rings"'' by [[Mary Rowe]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kamberi|first1=Ferdi|last2=Gollopeni|first2=Besim|date=2015-12-01|title=The Phenomenon of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace in Republic of Kosovo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316515762|journal=International Review of Social Sciences|volume=3|pages=13|access-date=2018-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003100810/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316515762|archive-date=2018-10-03|url-status=live}}</ref>  At the time, Rowe was the Chancellor for Women and Work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).<ref>Rowe, Mary, "Saturn's Rings," a study of the minutiae of sexism which maintain discrimination and inhibit affirmative action results in corporations and non-profit institutions; published in Graduate and Professional Education of Women, American Association of University Women, 1974, pp.&nbsp;1–9. "Saturn's Rings II" is a 1975 updating of the original, with racist and sexist incidents from 1974 and 1975. Revised and republished as "The Minutiae of Discrimination: The Need for Support," in Forisha, Barbara and Barbara Goldman, Outsiders on the Inside, Women in Organizations, Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey, 1981, Ch. 11, pp.&nbsp;155–171. {{ISBN|978-0-13-645382-6}}.</ref> Due to her efforts at MIT, the university was one of the first large organizations in the U.S. to develop specific policies and procedures aimed at stopping sexual harassment.

Rowe says that harassment of women in the workplace was being discussed in women's groups in Massachusetts in the early 1970s. At [[Cornell University]], instructor [[Lin Farley]] discovered that women in a discussion group repeatedly described being fired or quitting a job because they were harassed and intimidated by men.<ref name = "ss">{{cite book|last=Farley|first=Lin|title=Sexual Shakedown: The Sexual Harassment of Women on the Job|isbn=0070199574|url=https://archive.org/details/sexualshakedowns00far_x3q|year=1978|publisher=McGraw-Hill|url-access=registration}}</ref> She coined the term "sexual harassment" to describe the problem, and described it at length in 1975 testimony before the New York City Human Rights Commission.<ref>"Testimony given by Lin Farley", ''Hearings on women in blue-collar, service, and clerical occupations|publisher=Commission on Human Rights of the City of New York,'' April 21, 1975</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva B.|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&q=lin+farley&pg=PA8|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-09800-6|page=8}}</ref> In the book ''In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution'' (1999), journalist [[Susan Brownmiller]] says the women at Cornell became public activists after being asked for help by [[Carmita Dickerson Wood]], a 44-year-old single mother who was being harassed by a faculty member at Cornell's Department of Nuclear Physics.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Aron|first=Nina Renata|url=https://timeline.com/carmita-wood-sexual-harrassment-f2c537a0e1e8|title=Groping in the Ivy League led to the first sexual harassment suit—and nothing happened to the man|date=2017-10-20|work=Timeline|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuY_BAAAQBAJ&q=carmita+wood&pg=PA146|title=Cornell: A History, 1940–2015|last1=Altschuler|first1=Glenn C.|last2=Kramnick|first2=Isaac|date=2014-08-12|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801471889|pages=146|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Brownmiller|first=Susan|title=In our time : memoir of a revolution|date=1999|publisher=Dial Press|isbn=0-385-31486-8|location=New York|pages=281|oclc=41885669}}</ref> Farley wrote a book, ''Sexual Shakedown: The Sexual Harassment of Women on the Job'', published by McGraw-Hill in 1978 and in a paperback version by Warner Books in 1980.<ref name = "ss"/>

These activists, Lin Farley, [[Susan Meyer (Cornell University)|Susan Meyer]], and [[Karen Sauvigne]] went on to form [[Working Women United]] which, along with the [[Alliance Against Sexual Coercion]] (founded in 1976 by [[Freada Klein]], [[Lynn Wehrli]], and [[Elizabeth Cohn-Stuntz]]), were among the pioneer organizations to bring sexual harassment to public attention in the late 1970s. One of the first legal formulations of the concept of sexual harassment as consistent with sex discrimination and therefore prohibited behavior under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] appeared in the 1979 seminal book by Catharine MacKinnon<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=camtwo|title=MacKinnon, Catharine A.|website=University of Michigan Law School|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411204853/https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=camtwo|archive-date=2018-04-11|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> entitled "Sexual Harassment of Working Women".<ref>{{cite book | last = MacKinnon | first = Catharine | title = Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination. | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1979 | isbn = 9780300022995 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sexualharassment00cath }}</ref>

=== Key sexual harassment cases ===
Sexual harassment first became codified in U.S. law as the result of a series of sexual harassment cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the early women pursuing these cases were African American, often former civil rights activists who applied principles of civil rights to sex discrimination.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408074746/https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|archive-date=2018-04-08|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' (1976) and ''[[Paulette L. Barnes, Appellant, v. Douglas M. Costle, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (1977) determined it was sex discrimination to fire someone for refusing a supervisor's advances.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wBPD1vvTCYC&q=%22Diane+Williams%22&pg=PA92|title=The Women's Movement Against Sexual Harassment|last=Baker|first=Carrie N.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521879354|language=en}}</ref> Around the same time, ''[[Bundy v. Jackson]]'' was the first [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] case to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mullins|first=Luke|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/04/hertoo-40-years-ago-this-woman-helped-make-sexual-harassment-illegal-sandra-bundy/|title=#HerToo: 40 Years Ago This Woman Helped Make Sexual Harassment Illegal|date=2018-03-04|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-04-10|url-status=live|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135537/https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/04/hertoo-40-years-ago-this-woman-helped-make-sexual-harassment-illegal-sandra-bundy/|archive-date=2018-04-10}}</ref> Five years later the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] agreed with this holding in ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]].'' Another pioneering legal case was ''[[Alexander v. Yale]]'', which established that the sexual harassment of female students could be considered sex discrimination under [[Title IX]], and was thus illegal.

The term was largely unknown (outside academic and legal circles) until the early 1990s when [[Anita Hill]] witnessed and testified against [[Supreme Court of the United States]] nominee [[Clarence Thomas]].<ref name="techrep">Bowers, Toni; Hook, Brian.

==Varied behaviors==
[[File:Bullying Sexual.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A man makes an unwanted sexual advance on a woman.]]

One of the difficulties in understanding sexual harassment is that it involves a range of [[behavior]]s. In most cases (although not in all cases) it is difficult for the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[humiliation]] experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Louise|first=Fitzgerald|year=1995|title=Why Didn't She Just Report Him?

* A predatory harasser: a person who gets sexual thrills from humiliating others. This harasser may become involved in sexual extortion, and may frequently harass just to see how targets respond. Those who don't resist may even become targets for rape.
* A dominance harasser: the most common type, who engages in harassing behavior as an ego boost.
* Strategic or territorial harassers who seek to maintain privilege in jobs or physical locations, for example a man's harassment of a female employee in a predominantly male occupation.
* A [[Street harassment|street harasser]]: Another type of sexual harassment performed in public places by strangers. Street harassment includes verbal and nonverbal behavior, remarks that are frequently sexual in nature and comment on physical appearance or a person's presence in public.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Street Harassment and the Informal Ghettoization of Women |first=Cynthia Grant |last=Bowman |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=3 |date=Jan 1993 |pages=517–80 |jstor=1341656 |doi=10.2307/1341656 |url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=facpub |access-date=2019-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109090954/http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=facpub |archive-date=2020-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Impact ==
The impact of sexual harassment can vary. In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment.

===Coping===
{{Expert needed|psychology|section|date=July 2018}}
Sexual harassment, by definition, is unwanted and not to be tolerated. There are ways, however, for offended and injured people to overcome the resultant psychological effects, remain in or return to society, regain healthy feelings within personal relationships when they were affected by the outside relationship trauma, regain social approval, and recover the ability to concentrate and be productive in educational and work environments. These include [[stress management]] and therapy, [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11495093 |year=2001 |last1=Foa |first1=EB |last2=Street |first2=GP |title=Women and traumatic events |volume=62 Suppl 17 |pages=29–34 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry}}</ref> friends and family support, and advocacy.<ref name="Advocacy as coping mechanism">{{Cite web|url=https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cope-with-the-current-news-cycle-as-a-sexual-abu-1820823444|title=How to Cope With the Current News Cycle as a Sexual Abuse Survivor|last=Schwartz|first=Deb|date=2017-12-05|website=Lifehacker|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142415/https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cope-with-the-current-news-cycle-as-a-sexual-abu-1820823444|archive-date=2018-06-12|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref><ref name="Sexual Assault Advocates">{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-metoo-affects-sexual-assault-advocates|title=How #METOO Affects Sexual Assault Advocates|last=Books Olsen|first=Hanna|date=2017-12-22|website=PacificStandard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141717/https://psmag.com/social-justice/how-metoo-affects-sexual-assault-advocates|archive-date=2018-06-12|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>

Immediate psychological and legal counseling are recommended since self-treatment may not release stress or remove trauma, and simply reporting to authorities may not have the desired effect, may be ignored, or may further injure the victim at its response.

A 1991 study done by K.R. Yount found three dominant strategies developed by a sample of women coal miners to manage sexual harassment on the job: the "lady", the "flirt", and the "tomboy".
The "ladies" were typically the older women workers who tended to disengage from the men, kept their distance, avoided using profanity, avoided engaging in any behavior that might be interpreted as suggestive. They also tended to emphasize by their appearance and manners that they were ladies. The consequences for the "ladies" were that they were the targets of the least amount of come-ons, teasing and sexual harassment, but they also accepted the least prestigious and lowest-paid jobs.<ref name="Landrine 1997">{{cite book |last1=Landrine |first1=Hope |first2=Elizabeth A. |last2=Klonoff |year=1997 |title=Discrimination Against Women: Prevalence, Consequences, and Remedies |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Sage Publications}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>

The "flirts" were most often the younger single women. As a defense mechanism, they pretended to be flattered when they were the targets of sexual comments. Consequently, they became perceived as the "embodiment of the female stereotype,...as particularly lacking in potential and were given the fewest opportunities to develop job skills and to establish social and self-identities as miners."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Landrine|first1=Hope|title=Discrimination against women : prevalence, consequences, remedies|last2=Klonoff|first2=Elizabeth|date=1997|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-0954-0|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=36548828}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}

The "tomboys" were generally single women, but were older than the "flirts". They attempted to separate themselves from the female stereotype and focused on their status as coal miners and tried to develop a "thick skin". They responded to harassment with humor, comebacks, sexual talk of their own, or reciprocation. As a result, they were often viewed as sluts or sexually promiscuous and as women who violated the sexual double standard. Consequently, they were subjected to intensified and increased harassment by some men. It was not clear whether the tomboy strategy resulted in better or worse job assignments.<ref name="Landrine 1997"/>

The findings of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not likely to be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.<ref name="Landrine 1997"/> For example, after an anti-groping device allowing victims to mark their assailants with an invisible ink stamp has been released in Japan, some experts claimed it is wrong to put the onus on the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|title=Anti-groping stamp lets victims mark assailants|date=29 August 2019|website=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902031332/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49509231|archive-date=2 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Common effects on the victims===
{{Expert needed|psychology|section|date=July 2018}}

Common psychological, academic, professional, financial, and social effects of sexual harassment and retaliation:
* Becoming publicly [[sexualization|sexualized]] (i.e. groups of people "evaluate" the victim to establish if he or she is "worth" the sexual attention or the risk to the harasser's career)
* Being objectified and humiliated by scrutiny and gossip
* Decreased work or school performance as a result of stress conditions; increased [[absenteeism]] in fear of harassment repetition
* [[Defamation]] of character and reputation
* Effects on sexual life and relationships: can put extreme stress upon relationships with [[significant other]]s, sometimes resulting in divorce
* Firing and refusal for a job opportunity can lead to loss of job or career, loss of income
* Having one's personal life offered up for public scrutiny—the victim becomes the "accused", and his or her dress, lifestyle, and private life will often come under attack.
* Having to drop courses, change academic plans, or leave school (loss of tuition) in fear of harassment repetition or as a result of stress
* Having to relocate to another city, another job, or another school
* Loss of references/recommendations
* Loss of trust in environments similar to where the harassment occurred
* Loss of trust in the types of people that occupy similar positions as the harasser or his or her colleagues, especially in case they are not supportive, difficulties or stress on peer relationships, or relationships with colleagues
* Psychological stress and health impairment
* Weakening of support network, or being ostracized from professional or academic circles (friends, colleagues, or family may distance themselves from the victim, or shun him or her altogether)

===Post-complaint retaliation and backlash===
Retaliation and backlash against a victim are very common, particularly a complainant. Victims who speak out against sexual harassment are often labeled troublemakers who are on their own "power trips", or who are looking for attention. Similar to cases of [[rape]] or sexual assault, the victim often becomes the accused, with their appearance, private life, and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dittmann|first=M.|date=October 2003|title=Sexual harassment too often leads to humiliation for victims|url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/harass.html|journal=Monitor on Psychology|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=34|issue=9|pages=13|access-date=11 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502213700/https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/harass.html|archive-date=2 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> They risk hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow students, and even friends.

Women are not necessarily sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues.<ref name="webcom">[http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html Dealing With Sexual Harassment] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070709085048/http://www.webcom.com/wcs/harass.html |date=2007-07-09 }} (link is not active)</ref> Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility.<ref name="backlash">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html|title=Sexual Harassment Retaliation, Backlash, and Victim-blaming|website=Sexual Harassment Support|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130061955/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Backlash.html|archive-date=30 January 2009}}</ref> For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women [[shunning|shunned]] her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit.<ref>Bingham, Clara; Gansler, Laura Leedy.

Retaliation has occurred when a sexual harassment victim suffers a negative action as a result of the harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades, have their projects [[sabotage]]d, be denied work or academic opportunities, have their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after reporting sexual harassment or leading to unemployment as they may be suspended, asked to resign, or be [[firing|fired]] from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also [[stalking]] and [[cyberstalking]] of the victim.<ref name="webcom" /><ref name="backlash" /> Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.

Of the women who have approached her to share their own experiences of being [[Sexual harassment in education|sexually harassed by their teachers]], [[Feminism|feminist]] and writer [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote in 2004:
<blockquote>I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html|title=The Silent Treatment|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|date=February 23, 2004|publisher=New York Metro|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011083501/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/index.html|archive-date=2008-10-11|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref></blockquote>

Another woman who was interviewed by sociologist Helen Watson said, "Facing up to the crime and having to deal with it in public is probably worse than suffering in silence. I found it to be a lot worse than the harassment itself."<ref>Watson, Helen.

==Organizational policies and procedures==
Most companies have policies against sexual harassment; however, these policies are not designed and should not attempt to "regulate romance" which goes against human urges.<ref name="markschickman"/>

Act upon a report of harassment inside the organization should be:
{{quote|The investigation should be designed to obtain a prompt and thorough collection of the facts, an appropriate responsive action, and an expeditious report to the complainant that the investigation has been concluded, and, to the full extent appropriate, the action taken.|Mark I.

When organizations do not take the respective satisfactory measures for properly investigating, stress and psychological counseling and guidance, and just deciding of the problem this could lead to:
* Decreased productivity and increased team conflict
* Decreased study or job satisfaction
* Loss of students and staff. Loss of students who leave school and staff resignations to avoid harassment. Resignations and firings of alleged harassers.
* Decreased productivity and increased absenteeism by staff or students experiencing harassment
* Decrease in success at meeting academic and financial goals
* Increased health-care and sick-pay costs because of the health consequences of harassment or retaliation
* The knowledge that harassment is permitted can undermine ethical standards and discipline in the organization in general, as staff or students lose respect for, and trust in, their seniors who indulge in, or turn a blind eye to, or treat improperly sexual harassment
* If the problem is ignored or not treated properly, a company's or school's image can suffer
* High jury awards for the employee, attorney fees and litigation costs if the problem is ignored or not treated properly (in case of firing the victim) when the complainants are advised to and take the issue to court.<ref name="techrep"/><ref name="VAW_effects" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>Boland, 1990{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref><ref name="janaraver"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://qnc.queensu.ca/story_loader.php?id=42b98262192e9|title=Sexual harassment bad for victims and for business|date=June 22, 2005|website=Queen's News Centre|publisher=Queen's University School of Business|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907233138/http://qnc.queensu.ca/story_loader.php?id=42b98262192e9|archive-date=September 7, 2009|access-date=March 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/guides/S/63925/7|title=For Help with the Handling of Harassment|last=Prekel|first=Truida|date=2005|publisher=Western Cape Government|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018012030/http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/guides/S/63925/7|archive-date=2012-10-18|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>

Studies show that [[organizational climate]] (an organization's tolerance, policy, procedure etc.) and workplace environment are essential for understanding the conditions in which sexual harassment is likely to occur, and the way its victims will be affected (yet, research on specific policy and procedure, and awareness strategies is lacking). Another element which increases the risk for sexual harassment is the job's gender context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a field which is perceived as atypical for women).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2007.00067.x |title=A Meta-Analysis of the Antecedents and Consequences of Workplace Sexual Harassment |year=2007 |last1=Willness |first1=Chelsea R. |last2=Steel |first2=Piers |last3=Lee |first3=Kibeom |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=60 |pages=127–162 |citeseerx=10.1.1.472.6532 }}</ref>

According to Dr. Orit Kamir, the most effective way to avoid sexual harassment in the workplace, and also influence the public's state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy prohibiting sexual harassment and to make it very clear to their employees. Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within the workplace rather than to "air out the dirty laundry" with a public complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds Kamir.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.idc.ac.il/he/lawreview/volumes/volume09/pages/kamir.aspx|last=Orit|first=Kamir|date=2008|website=IDC Herzliya|language=he,en|script-title=he:החוק הישראלי למניעת הטרדה מינית — איפה אנחנו במלאת לו עשור?|trans-title=Israel's Sexual Harassment Law After Its First Decade: An Assessment of Its Achievements and Failings|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202032950/http://portal.idc.ac.il/He/lawreview/volumes/volume09/Pages/kamir.aspx|archive-date=2012-12-02|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref><ref name="maryrowe">Rowe, Mary.

Most prefer a pragmatic solution that would stop the harassment and prevent future contact with the harasser rather than turning to the police. More about the difficulty in turning an offense into a legal act can be found in Felstiner & Sarat's (1981) study,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=William L.F. |last1=Felstiner |first2=Richard L. |last2=Abel |first3=Austin |last3=Sarat |year=1980 |title=The Emergence and Transformation of Disputes: Naming, Blaming, Claiming… |journal=Law & Society Review |volume=15 |issue=3/4 |pages=631–54 |jstor=3053505 |doi=10.2307/3053505|s2cid=56047694 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/987149074d383bedb8970b8a8c73865feb62521f }}</ref> which describes three steps a victim (of any dispute) must go through before turning to the justice system: naming – giving the assault a definition, blaming – understanding who is responsible for the violation of rights and facing them, and finally, claiming – turning to the authorities.

It may include a range of actions from mild transgressions to [[sexual abuse]] or [[sexual assault]].<ref name="auto"/> Sexual harassment is a form of [[Law|illegal]] [[employment discrimination]] in many countries, and is a form of [[abuse]] (sexual and [[psychological abuse]]s) and [[bullying]].

The [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] classifies [[violence against women]] into three categories: that occurring in the family, that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State.

===Varied legal guidelines and definitions===
'''The [[United Nations]] General Recommendation 19 to the convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' defines sexual harassment of women to include:

<blockquote>such unwelcome sexually determined behavior as physical contact and advances, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography and sexual demands, whether by words or actions. Such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it is discriminatory when the woman has reasonable ground to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment, including recruitment or promotion, or when it creates a hostile working environment.</blockquote>

While such conduct can be harassment of women by men, many laws around the world which prohibit sexual harassment recognize that both men and women may be harassers or victims of sexual harassment. However, most claims of sexual harassment are made by women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment.cfm |title=Sexual Harassment Charges: EEOC & FEPAs Combined: FY 1997 - FY 2011 |publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007201224/http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment.cfm |archive-date=2012-10-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sexual harassment is rife in Egypt. A 2013 study from the United Nations showed that 99.3 percent of Egyptian women have suffered some form of sexual harassment.

===Australia===
The [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]] defines sexual harassment as "... a person sexually harasses another person (the person harassed ) if: (a) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the person harassed; or (b) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed; in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated."<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|sda1984209|Sex Discrimination Act 1984|28A}}.</ref>

===Europe===
In the [[European Union]], there is a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] on sexual harassment. The ''Directive 2002/73/EC – equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions'' states:<ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"/>
<blockquote>For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: (...)
* sexual harassment: where any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature occurs, with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited.</blockquote>

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] also addresses the issue of sexual harassment (Article 40), using a similar definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|last=Council of Europe|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210455/http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|archive-date=2015-09-23}}</ref>

====Denmark====
Sexual harassment is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action is used to change a victim's sexual status against the will of the victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.<ref name="Denmark law">{{cite web|url=http://www.ku.dk/regel/2/2002.html#LOV%20nr%201385|title=Denmark Law|date=2016-06-29|publisher=Københavns Universitet|language=da|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321222932/http://www.ku.dk/regel/2/2002.html#LOV%20nr%201385|archive-date=21 March 2012|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=137042|title=Ligebehandlingsloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om ligebehandling af mænd og kvinder med hensyn til beskæftigelse m.v|website=www.retsinformation.dk|language=da|trans-title=The Equal Treatment Act - Executive Order on the Equal Treatment Act for men and women with regard to employment, etc.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214022811/https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=137042|archive-date=2018-12-14|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>

====France====
In [[France]], both the Criminal Code and the Labor Code are relevant to the issue of sexual harassment. Until May 4, 2012, article 222-33 of the French Criminal Code described sexual harassment as "The fact of harassing anyone in order to obtain favors of a sexual nature".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000408905|title=Loi n° 2002-73 du 17 janvier 2002 de modernisation sociale|date=17 January 2002|website=Legifrance|language=fr|trans-title=Art. 179 of the Law no. 2002-73 of 17 January 2002 on social modernization|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207182819/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000408905|archive-date=2018-02-07|access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref> Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors.

According to Abigail C. Saguy in her book ''What is Sexual Harassment: From Capitol Hill to the Sorbonne'', " According to French penal law, '''sexual''' '''harassment''' is also different from rape and sexual assault in that it does not involve physical contact. Rather, with '''sexual harassment''' , economic dependence and official authority alone are used to pressure a person into having sexual relations(pg.24)."

A ban on discrimination was included in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19950082/index.html|title=Federal Act on Gender Equality|date=1 January 2017|website=The Federal Council - The Portal of the Swiss Government|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324102217/https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19950082/index.html|archive-date=24 March 2018|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref> Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Article 4 of the GEA of 1995 discusses the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace: "Any harassing behaviour of a sexual nature or other behaviour related to the person's sex that adversely affects the dignity of women or men in the workplace is discriminatory. Such behaviour includes in particular threats, the promise of advantages, the use of coercion and the exertion of pressure in order to obtain favours of a sexual nature."<ref name=":4" />

Sexual harassment in [[India]] is termed "[[Eve teasing]]" and is described as: unwelcome sexual gesture or behaviour whether directly or indirectly as sexually coloured remarks; physical contact and advances; showing pornography; a demand or request for sexual favours; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct being sexual in nature or passing sexually offensive and unacceptable remarks. The critical factor is the unwelcomeness of the behaviour, thereby making the impact of such actions on the recipient more relevant rather than intent of the perpetrator.<ref name="india_rape" /> According to the [[Indian constitution]], sexual harassment infringes the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her right to life and live with dignity under Article 21.<ref name="amicus.iupindia.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp|title=ICFAI University - Workplace Harassment|website=Amicus.iupindia.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202183755/http://www.amicus.iupindia.org/Lels_WorkplaceHarassment_ovw.asp|archive-date=2017-12-02|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=February 2020|fix-attempted=yes}}<!-- The archives are only of the domain reselling page -->

Almost 16 years after the Supreme Court's landmark guidelines on prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace (known as the "[[Vishaka Guidelines]]"), the Act has endorsed many of the guidelines, and is a step towards codifying gender equality. The Act is intended to include all women employees in its ambit, including those employed in the unorganized sector, as well as domestic workers. The Indian law does not permit the victim or complainant to take assistance of a legal professional in the inquiry, however, in [[Arti Devi Vs Jawaharlal Nehru University]],<ref>https://indiankanoon.org/doc/195150471/</ref> the High Court of Delhi permitted the complainant to avail the services of a counsel as her defence assistant.

The Act has identified sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and her right to life and to live with dignity under article 21 of the Constitution; as well as the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe environment free from sexual harassment. The Act also states that the protection against sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity are universally recognized human rights by international conventions and instruments such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has been ratified on the 25th June, 1993 by the Government of India.<ref>[[The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2020}}

The [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]] introduced changes to the [[Indian Penal Code]], making sexual harassment an expressed offense under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.

====Israel====
The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction of liberty, an offense to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally, the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are defined by the law as "prejudicial treatment".<ref name="Kamir">{{cite journal | last1 = Kamir | first1 = Orit | title = Israel's 1998 Sexual Harassment Law: Prohibiting Sexual Harassment, Sexual Stalking, and Degradation Based on Sexual Orientation in the Workplace and in all Social Settings | url = http://sitemaker.umich.edu/Orit_Kamir/files/sexharas2.pdf | journal = International Journal of Discrimination and the Law | volume = 2005 | issue = 7 | pages = 315–336 | access-date = 2012-10-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017132743/http://sitemaker.umich.edu/Orit_Kamir/files/sexharas2.pdf | archive-date = 2015-10-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Sexual Harassment, or ''sekuhara'' in Japanese, appeared most dramatically in Japanese discourse in 1989, when a court case in Fukuoka ruled in favor of a woman who had been subjected to the spreading of sexual rumors by a co-worker. When the case was first reported, it spawned a flurry of public interest: 10 books were published, including English-language feminist guidebooks to 'how not to harass women' texts for men.<ref name=Huen>{{cite journal |last1=Huen|first = Y. |title=Workplace Sexual Harassment in Japan: A Review of Combating Measures Taken |journal=Asian Survey |year=2007|volume=47|issue=5|pages=811–827 |doi = 10.1525/as.2007.47.5.811 }}</ref> Sekuhara was named 1989's 'Word of the Year.'

Laws then established two forms of sexual harassment: ''daisho'', in which rewards or penalties are explicitly linked to sexual acts, and ''kankyo'', in which the environment is made unpleasant through sexual talk or jokes, touching, or hanging sexually explicit posters. This applies to everyone in an office, including customers.<ref name=Huen />

In Malaysia, sexual harassment as defined by the [http://www.agc.gov.my/agcportal/uploads/files/Publications/LOM/EN/Act%20265%20-%20Employment%20Act%201955.pdf Employment Act 1955], is “any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, whether verbal, non-verbal, visual, gestural or physical, directed at a person which is offensive, humiliating or a threat to their well-being”. The Act does not distinguish between male and female or employer and employee. As such, sexual harassment can be committed by a female against a male, or an employee against an employer.

Sexual harassment is common, and since 2010 trains on the Malaysian Railway have included pink-coloured [[women-only passenger car|women-only cars]] as a means of cutting down on it.<ref name="buses">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40468372/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/women-only-buses-aim-halt-sex-harassment/|title=Women-only buses aim to halt sex harassment|publisher=NBC News|date=2 December 2010|access-date=9 June 2017}}</ref> There are also women-only buses in Kuala Lumpur since 2010.<ref name="buses"/> In 2011, the government launched a women-only taxi service in the greater Kuala Lumpur area.<ref name="taxis">{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/27/179417.html|title=Malaysia launches women-only taxis, hoping to reduce number of rape and robbery cases|work=Agence France-Presse|publisher=Al Arabiya News|date=27 November 2011|access-date=9 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004034930/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/27/179417.html|archive-date=4 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The taxis have women drivers, and operate on an on-call basis.<ref name="taxis"/>

====Pakistan====
Pakistan has promulgated harassment law in 2010 with nomenclature as "The Protection Against Harassment of Women at The Workplace Act, 2010".
This law defines the act of harassment in following terms.
"Harassment means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature or sexually demeaning attitude, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to such a request or is made a condition for employment."
Pakistan has adopted a Code of Conduct for Gender Justice in the Workplace that will deal with cases of sexual harassment. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment At workplace (AASHA) announced they would be working with the committee to establish guidelines for the proceedings. AASHA defines sexual harassment much the same as it is defined in the U.S. and other cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aasha.org.pk/ |title=Alliance Against Sexual Harassment |publisher=AASHA |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025235625/http://www.aasha.org.pk/ |archive-date=2012-10-25 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=February 2020}}

====Evolution of sexual harassment law====

=====Workplace=====
{{main|Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States}}

In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[color]], [[national origin]] or [[religion]]. Initially intended to only combat sexual harassment of women, {42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2} the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers men and women. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.<ref name=":7" />

''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|date=October 27, 2004|website=ifeminists.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807125033/http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html|archive-date=August 7, 2011|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' established sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In 1980 the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".<ref>{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v.

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment, and the case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' (US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit – 924 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1991)) resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic%3D445 |title=Sexual Harassment Support Forum |access-date=2006-07-19 |url-status = dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223845/http://shsf.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=445 |archive-date=2007-03-10 }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> However, some legal scholars have argued this does not go far enough and that the reasonable person standard also needs to take [[intersectionality]] into account.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Onwuachi-Willig |first1=Angela |author-link=Angela Onwuachi-Willig |title=What About #UsToo?: The Invisibility of Race in the #MeToo Movement |journal=Yale Law Journal Forum |date=18 June 2018 |volume=128 |page=109 |url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&context=faculty_scholarship |access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref> Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v.

Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v.

=====Education=====
{{Main|Sexual harassment in education in the United States}}

[[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 (United States) states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

In ''Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools'' (1992), the U.S. Supreme Court held that private citizens could collect damage awards when teachers sexually harassed their students.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0503_0060_ZS.html |title=Franklin v.

====Additionally====
There are a number of legal options for a complainant in the U.S.: [[mediation]], filing with the EEOC or filing a claim under a [[U.S. state|state]] Fair Employment Practices (FEP) statute (both are for workplace sexual harassment), filing a common law [[tort]], etc.<ref name="whattodo">{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/911/harasswhatdo.html|title=Sexual Harassment Fact Sheet: What to Do if You or Someone You Know is Sexually Harassed|date=2014|publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020062451/http://www.feminist.org/911/harasswhatdo.html|archive-date=2012-10-20|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref> Not all sexual harassment will be considered severe enough to form the basis for a legal claim. However, most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The section below "EEOC Definition" describes the legal definitions that have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar to the EEOC definition have been created for academic environments in the U.S. Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |title=Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance |publisher=Office for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education |date=January 19, 2001 |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919234743/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html |archive-date=September 19, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====EEOC Definition====
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims that it is unlawful to harass an applicant or employee of any sex in the workplace. The harassment could include sexual harassment. The EEOC says that the victim and harasser could be any gender and that the other does not have to be of the opposite sex. The law does not ban offhand comments, simple teasing, or incidents that aren't very serious. If the harassment gets to the point where it creates a harsh work environment, it will be taken care of.<ref name="eeoc"/> In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:

Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
# Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
# Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
# Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

1. and 2. are called "[[quid pro quo]]" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits, and "sexual coercion".

Type 3. known as "[[hostile work environment]]", is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.<ref name="webcom" />

'''Note:''' a workplace harassment complainant ''must'' file with the EEOC and receive a "right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=====''Quid pro quo'' sexual harassment=====
[[File:Stop à la violence sexiste au travail.jpg|thumb|right|[[International Trade Union Confederation]] (2015-2017).]]

Quid pro quo means "this for that." In the workplace, this occurs when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is quid pro quo harassment?|date=March 18, 2013|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209001311/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_quidproquo.html|archive-date=February 9, 2009|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref> Quid pro quo harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Quid pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|website=Sexual Harassment Support|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402083730/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/SHworkplace.html|archive-date=2 April 2010}}</ref>

=====''Hostile environment'' sexual harassment=====
{{Main|Hostile work environment}}

This occurs when an employee is subjected to comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both "serious" and "frequent." Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for creating a hostile environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|title=The Law & Your Job: What is hostile environment harassment?|date=March 18, 2013|publisher=American Bar Association|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802171805/http://www.abanet.org/publiced/practical/sexualharassment_hostileenvironment.html|archive-date=August 2, 2009|access-date=2012-10-07}}</ref>

The line between "[[quid pro quo]]" and "hostile environment" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against her if she does not comply.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|title=Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment|date=19 March 1990|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910004803/https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/currentissues.html|archive-date=10 September 2019|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Hostile environment" harassment may acquire characteristics of "quid pro quo" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII have occurred."</blockquote>

=====Sexual orientation discrimination=====
In the United States, there are no federal laws prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation. However, [[Executive Order 13087]], signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|website=MAP|publisher=Movement Advancement Project|access-date=15 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814110642/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws|archive-date=14 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, California has laws in place to protect employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.

=====Retaliation=====
Retaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a ''negative action'' after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired, demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job reassignment—any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. (See ''Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White''.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php|title=Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, Sheila|date=December 5, 2005|website=Medill Journalism|via=Northwestern University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614052101/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/003256.php|archive-date=2006-06-14|access-date=2006-07-10}}</ref> Retaliation is as illegal as the sexual harassment itself, but also as difficult to prove. Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of sexual harassment was not proven.

=====New Jersey=====
New Jersey was historically known to have one of the strongest anti-sexual harassment laws in the United States. The Law Against Discrimination used to hold an employer liable if the sexual harassment was done by a member of upper-level management.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court modified the precedence in the State of New Jersey and prevented the company from being liable if they had a well-published and enforced anti-harassment policy. Accordingly, if a policy existed and was enforced, the victim or witness to the sexual harassment would need to complain about the conduct. The company would not be liable if they investigate the matter and take some remedial measures to make sure that the harassment stops. The Company only becomes liable if the activity occurs again. (See ''Aguas v. NJ''.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-supreme-court/1692580.html|title=Aguas vs State|last=Supreme Court of New Jersey|date=February 11, 2015|website=Findlaw|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922162731/https://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-supreme-court/1692580.html|archive-date=22 September 2019|access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=March 2019}}

== Criticism ==
Though the phrase ''sexual harassment'' is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial. Accordingly, misunderstandings can occur. In the US, sexual harassment law has been criticized by persons such as the [[criminal defense lawyer]] [[Alan Dershowitz]] and the legal writer and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Eugene Volokh]], for imposing limits on the right to [[free speech]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Volokh |first=Eugene |url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass/ |title=Freedom of Speech vs. Workplace Harassment Law — A Growing Conflict |publisher=UCLA Law School |access-date=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028060846/http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/harass/ |archive-date=2012-10-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Jana Rave, professor in organizational studies at the [[Queen's School of Business]], criticized sexual harassment policy in the ''[[Ottawa Business Journal]]'' as helping maintain archaic stereotypes of women as "delicate, asexual creatures" who require special protection when at the same time complaints are lowering company profits.<ref name="janaraver">{{Cite web|url=http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1|title=Sexual Harassment: Poisoning profit prospects|last=Jeff|first=Esau|date=August 10, 2005|website=Ottawa Business Journal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020062419/http://www.obj.ca/Other/Archives/2005-08-10/article-2233666/Sexual-harassment%3A-Poisoning-profit-prospects/1|archive-date=20 October 2012|access-date=3 March 2012}}</ref> [[Camille Paglia]] says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', "Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm|title=Playboy interview, Camille Paglia|date=May 1995|publisher=Playboy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622065038/http://privat.ub.uib.no/bubsy/playboy.htm|archive-date=22 June 2006}}</ref>

Other critics assert that sexual harassment is a very serious problem, but current views focus too heavily on sexuality rather than on the type of conduct that undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki Shultz, a law professor at [[Yale University]] comments, "Many of the most prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work—particularly the more highly rewarded lines of work—as bastions of male competence and authority."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM|title=Love, Lust, and the Law Sexual Harassment in the Academy|last=Alger|first=Jonathan R.|website=American Association of University Professors|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203104653/http://www.aaup.org/publications/Academe/1998/98so/SO98Alg.HTM|archive-date=February 3, 2006}}</ref> Feminist [[Jane Gallop]] sees this evolution of the definition of sexual harassment as coming from a "split" between what she calls "[[power feminist]]s" who are [[pro-sex]] (like herself) and what she calls "[[victim feminist]]s", who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a ''perversion'' of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual.<ref>Gallop, Jane.

There is also concern over abuses of sexual harassment policy by individuals as well as by employers and administrators using false or frivolous accusations as a way of expelling employees they want to eliminate for other reasons. These employees often have virtually no recourse thanks to the [[at-will]] law in most US states.<ref>Westhues, Kenneth. ''Eliminating Professors: A Guide to the Dismissal Process''. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-7734-8210-4}}.{{page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>

O'Donohue and Bowers outlined 14 possible pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment: "lying, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia, false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy, personality disorders not otherwise specified."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jip.43 |title=Pathways to false allegations of sexual harassment |year=2006 |last1=O'Donohue |first1=William |last2=Bowers |first2=Adrian H. |journal=Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling |volume=3 |pages=47–74 }}</ref>

There is also discussion of whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and permissive habits have created a more sexualized general environment, in which some forms of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to greater sexualization in everyday environments.<ref>Parker, Kathleen. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_save_the_males_ho_culture_lights_fuses_b.html 'Save the males': Ho culture lights fuses, but confuses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702013450/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/06/30/2008-06-30_save_the_males_ho_culture_lights_fuses_b.html |date=2008-07-02 }}."
