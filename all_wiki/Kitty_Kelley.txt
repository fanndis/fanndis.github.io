'''Catherine''' "'''Kitty'''" '''Kelley''' (born April 4, 1942) is an American journalist and author of several best-selling unauthorized biographies of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]],  [[Rock Hudson]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nancy Reagan]], the [[British Royal Family]], the [[Bush family]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]].

For the Sinatra biography, Kelley won praise for the quality of her research and willingness to risk a lawsuit, but critics have not rated her other works as highly. She has been described as a "professional sensationalist" and the "consummate gossip monger".

==Early life==
Kelley was raised in [[Spokane, Washington]], the eldest child of Adele and William Vincent Kelley, a lawyer who served as president of the city's [[bar association]]. Growing up Kelley helped take care of her five sisters, Mary Cary, Ellen, Margaret, Adele Monica and Madeleine Sophie, as well as her brother, John.<ref>''Poison Pen'' by [[George Carpozi, Jr.]] p.26</ref>  The family vacationed in Europe and spent summers at their two lakeside cottages in western [[Idaho]].<ref>Carpozi p. 38</ref> Kelley graduated from [[St. Augustine's Elementary School]] and then attended the private prep school [[Holy Names Academy]].<ref>Carpozi p. 40</ref>

In 1962, Kelley allegedly was expelled from the [[University of Arizona]] in lieu of police filing criminal charges for grand larceny against her, according to the biography ''Poison Pen'' by [[George Carpozi Jr.]]{{page needed|date=January 2016}} The stolen items were expensive pieces of jewelry that Kelley's fellow students had kept in their dorm rooms.    {{page needed|date=January 2016}} During the aftermath of her leaving the University of Arizona, her parents refused to let her live with them and sent her to live in [[Seattle]] with her maternal grandparents, the Martins. It was there that Kelley suffered a [[Mental breakdown|breakdown]] and used a [[wheelchair]] during some of that time.<ref>Carpozi pp. 335–40</ref> After this eight-month hiatus, Kelley surfaced at the [[University of Washington]],<ref>Carpozi p. 45</ref> where she received a [[B. A.|B.A. in English]]. She worked at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and went on to become a receptionist-press secretary for Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]].<ref name="slate"/>

Following four years as a press assistant to McCarthy, Kelley worked for two years as the editorial page researcher for the ''[[Washington Post]]''. Since then she has had a full-time career as a freelance writer. Her articles have appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''The Washington Post'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'', ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref name="randomhouse.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/thefamily/ata_bio.php |title=The Family by Kitty Kelley: Bio |publisher=Randomhouse.com |date=March 23, 1998 |access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

==Books==

===Jacqueline Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor biographies===
Kelley's first [[celebrity biographer|celebrity biography]] was ''Jackie Oh!'' (1978), a life of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], which was written at the request of [[Lyle Stuart]], who launched the book into the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]]. In the book, Kelley describes [[John F. Kennedy]]'s womanizing and includes "revelations" about Onassis's love life, her depression and [[electric shock treatment]]. Kelley's publisher Lyle Stuart was later quoted saying "at the time I believed her shock-treatment story. Looking back, I feel I was had and the whole thing was a fable. I doubt that it ever happened. And knowing how she makes things up, I believe she was sure she could get away with it because no one would sue."<ref name="ReferenceA">''Poison Pen'' by George Carpozi Jr. pg 140</ref> Journalist [[Michael Crowley (journalist)|Michael Crowley]] stated ''Jackie Oh!'' contained "core truths—including an unflinching look at JFK that showed him to have been 'more of a [[Romeo]] than has been previously revealed.'"<ref name=slate />

This book was followed by ''Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star'' (1981).

=== ''His Way'' ===
Kelley's next book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra'' (1986), was declared "an act of bravery".<ref name="slate" /> Kelley discussed Sinatra's marriages, affairs and links to the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mob]]. Sinatra filed a $2 million lawsuit to prevent it from being published but subsequently dropped it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanscholar.org/unauthorized-but-not-untrue/ |title=Unauthorized, But Not Untrue - Kitty Kelley |work=[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]] |date=April 2, 2008 |access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

The book was number one on the ''New York Times'' Best Seller List and hit best-seller lists in England, Canada, Australia and France. [[William Safire]] of the ''New York Times'' said "''His Way''...turns out to be the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time."<ref>William Safire, "The Truth About Frank", ''New York Times'', September 29, 1986</ref> In the ''Washington Post'', [[Jonathan Yardley]], wrote that "''His Way'' is such an improvement over her two previous books ... that comparisons border on the pointless."<ref name="slate" />

===''People'' magazine story===
In 1990, Kelley wrote a piece for ''People'' magazine based on interviews she had conducted with [[Judith Campbell Exner]], a former girlfriend of Frank Sinatra's who claimed to have had an affair with [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="slate"/><ref>Kelley, Kitty (February 29, 1988). [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20098379,00.html "The Dark Side of Camelot"]. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.</ref> Exner told Kelley that she had arranged ten meetings between Kennedy and Mafia gangster [[Sam Giancana]], and they discussed having the mafia [[assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|kill Fidel Castro]]. It was subsequently revealed that Exner, who was terminally ill, had been paid $50,000 to talk with Kelley and had not mentioned these "revelations" in her own autobiography, published years earlier. A former [[FBI]] agent said that Giancana had been under a federal wiretap, so these multiple meetings with Kennedy would have been impossible to cover up.<ref name="slate"/>

===Nancy Reagan biography===
In 1991 Kelley published ''Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography''. She was paid $3.5 million to write the book.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/16/garden/16KITT.html|title=For the Queen of Exposé, Four Walls That Won't Talk|access-date=August 5, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 16, 2004|author=Bruni, Frank}}</ref> The book claimed that Nancy Reagan had had affairs with [[Frank Sinatra]], that she frequently relied on [[astrology]], that she had lied about her age, and that she had a very poor relationship with her children, even alleging that she hit her daughter, [[Patti Reagan|Patti]]. According to ''Newsweek'', "Despite her wretched excesses, Kelley has the core of the story right. Even her staunchest defenders concede that Nancy Reagan is more [[Marie Antoinette]] than [[Mother Teresa]]." However ''Newsweek'' also criticized the book's basic factual accuracy, noting that Kelley had reported that [[Ronald Reagan]] had allegedly [[date rape]]d a 19-year-old, when the accuser would have actually been 25 at the time.<ref name="slate"/>

Former [[President of the United States|President]] Ronald Reagan issued a statement saying the book "has no basis in fact and serves no decent purpose."<ref>{{cite book|last= Goldberg|first= Bernard|author-link= Bernard Goldberg|title= [[100 People Who Are Screwing up America]]|year= 2005|edition= paperback|publisher= Harper Collins|location= New York|isbn= 0-06-076129-6|page= [https://archive.org/details/110peoplewhoares00gold/page/99 99]}}</ref>

[[Michael Korda]], who had been the editor for Kelley's previous book on Elizabeth Taylor, asked to excuse himself from this work as he was slated to edit Ronald Reagan's autobiography. The Nancy Reagan book was edited instead by [[Alice Mayhew]]. Korda stated that Nancy Reagan was purported to have said about Kelley, "I hope she gets hit by a truck."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Random House|year=1999|isbn=9780679456599|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/465 465]|quote="There was, however, one small fly in the ointment. I brought up the fact that I was already Kitty Kelley's editor (I had published her biography of Elizabeth Taylor), who was then working on what was supposed to be a sensational, unauthorized kiss-and-tell biography of Nancy Reagan. Mrs. Reagan was known to be furiously apprehensive about the book. "I hope she gets hit by a truck," Mrs. Reagan was reported to have said about Kelley."|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/465}}</ref>

===British royal family and the Bush family===
In September 1997, Kelley wrote ''The Royals'' (Warner Books, New York, {{ISBN|0-446-51712-7}}) about the [[British royal family]]. Kelley stated that the Windsors obscured their German ancestry and described scandals surrounding the members of the royal family.

''[[The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty]]'' was published in September 2004. Kelley announced plans for the book shortly after [[George W. Bush]]'s "election" in 2000 and worked on it for four years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6179623.stm | work=BBC News | title=Oprah gets 'vicious' biographer | date=December 14, 2006 | access-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref>

===Oprah Winfrey biography===
In December 2006, Crown announced it would publish Kelley's unauthorized biography of [[Oprah Winfrey]]. The book, ''Oprah: A Biography'', was released on April 13, 2010. ''The New Yorker'' declared the biography "one of those [[King Kong]] vs. [[Godzilla]] events in celebrity culture."<ref>{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Lauren |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/04/19/100419crbo_books_collins?currentPage=all |title=Kitty Kelley takes on Oprah Winfrey |publisher=The New Yorker |date=April 19, 2010 |access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Oprah dismissed the book as a "so-called biography".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/19/oprah-dismisses-kitty-kel_n_543390.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Danny | last=Shea | title=Oprah Dismisses Kitty Kelley Book: 'So-Called Biography' | date=April 19, 2010 }}</ref>

===''Capturing Camelot''===
Kelley's most recent book, ''Capturing Camelot: Stanley Tretick's Iconic Images of the Kennedys'', was published by Thomas Dunne Books in November 2012.<ref>Greg Tobin (December 2, 2012). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/capturing-camelot-by-kitty-kelley.html?_r=0 "The Kennedys"]. ''New York Times Book Review''.</ref>

==Criticism==
[[Barbara Walters]] said books like Kelley’s are more focused on salacious rather than factual content.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2010/04/26/DI2010042602936.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Kitty Kelley discusses Oprah bio | date=April 28, 2010 | access-date=May 7, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' claimed that Kelley "just aims for the jugular."<ref name=NYTimes/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that most journalists believe Kelley "too frequently fails to bring perspective or analysis to the fruits of her reporting and at times lards her work with dollops of questionable inferences and innuendos." [[Joe Klein]] described Kelley as a "professional sensationalist."<ref name="Time"/>

Michael Crowley of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine once called Kelley "the consummate [[gossip]] monger, a vehicle for all the rumor and innuendo surrounding her illustrious subjects".<ref name="slate">{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2106746|title=Kitty Kelley: Colonoscopist to the Stars|author=Crowley, Michael|access-date=August 5, 2008|work=Slate|date=September 15, 2004}}</ref> Kelley maintains, "I am an unabashed admirer of transparency and believe in the freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/author-q-and-a/qa-with-kitty-kelley/ |title=Q&A with Kitty Kelley |publisher=Washington Independent Review of Books |access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref> and, to that end, her writing is about "moving an icon out of the moonlight and into the sunlight". Crowley, while conceding that Kelley's books in particular her Sinatra biography, have revealed core truths not addressed by more sympathetic biographers, has also stated that her investigative methods are questionable, and many of the claims in her books have been falsified, as with her 1990 ''People'' magazine story about [[John F. Kennedy]] and organized crime boss [[Sam Giancana]], and her Nancy Reagan biography.<ref name="slate"/> Similar criticism has been leveled at her by [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref name="NYTimes">Maslin, Janet (April 11, 2010).
