Before the existence of [[recording medium]] and its player, the music industry earned profit through selling [[musical composition]]s on [[sheet music]]. The very first sales chart published by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in the United States was the ''Sheet Music Best Sellers'' chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6746273/first-billboard-issue-november-1-1894|title=The First Billboard: All That Was 'New, Bright and Interesting on the Boards'|website=Billboard|accessdate=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101232809/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6746273/first-billboard-issue-november-1-1894|archive-date=1 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the invention of the [[phonograph]] by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Incredible Talking Machine|url=https://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1999143_1999210_1999211,00.html|date=June 23, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817090940/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1999143_1999210_1999211,00.html|archivedate=August 17, 2013}}</ref> the music industry began hiring [[singers]] to record songs made by composers. Due to the length limit of recording media, [[single (music)|singles]] were the only available commercial releases. In 1900, the US record sales is estimated at about 3 million copies. The music industry continued its growth, and by 1921 the value of record sales in the US reached $106 million with 140 million records being sold.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIK2uSe_8VIC&pg=PA114 |title = Popular Music: Music and society|isbn = 9780415332675|last1 = Frith|first1 = Simon|year = 2004}}</ref> 

Album sales were first reported by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine on March 24, 1945.<ref name="billboard200">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7271910/happy-birthday-billboard-200-chart-album|title=Billboard 200 Turns 60!

Technological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl [[LP record]] as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, [[Columbia Records]] began to bring out 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. [[Musical film]] soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] quickly utilized the new longer format. ''Billboard'' launched its first regularly published weekly albums chart, [[Billboard 200|Best Selling Popular Albums]], on March 24, 1956.<ref name="billboard200"/>

During the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45&nbsp;rpm [[seven-inch single]] sales were considered the primary market for the recording industry, while albums were a secondary market. The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as [[Elvis Presley]] were driven primarily by single sales. Album sales reached its peak in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s (known as "[[album era]]") in which the album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70 Synopsis of "When Albums Ruled the World."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727182004/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70 |date=2018-07-27 }} from [[BBC Four]]'s ''The Golden Age Of The Album'' series. Retrieved 5 January 2014.</ref> From the early 1980s, the [[CD]] became the dominant format for both albums and singles, due to factors such as higher audio quality, durability, ease of use, and longer playing time. In 1986, [[Dire Straits]]' ''[[Brothers in Arms (album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' became the first album in history to sell over one million copies on CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-million-seller-cd|title=First million seller CD|website=guinnessworldrecords.com|accessdate=4 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112150533/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-million-seller-cd|archive-date=12 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Aside of paid advertising in print or broadcast media, [[radio]] [[airplay]] is one of the most important tools to sell records.

===Merchandise bundles===
In 2004, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] became the first major artist to bundle his album, ''[[Musicology (album)|Musicology]]'', with tour ticket purchases, giving copies of the album to each audience upon entrance to the venue. Those copies were counted as sales for the album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart during its corresponding week of each concert. This strategy led ''Billboard'' and Nielsen SoundScan tighten up their policy on how tickets bundled with albums would count for charting purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070311/prince-a-guide-to-his-complex-web-of-label-internet-and-distribution-deals|title=Prince: A Guide to His Complex Web of Label, Internet and Distribution Deals|website=Billboard|accessdate=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623224756/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070311/prince-a-guide-to-his-complex-web-of-label-internet-and-distribution-deals|archive-date=23 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Financial loss==
At times, labels over-shipped records to retailer due to the high expectation of commercial response. However, when records fail to be sold to consumers, retailers may return the unsold copies to the label. In January 2008, media reported that over one million unsold copies of [[Robbie Williams]]'s album ''[[Rudebox]]'' were sent to China to be crushed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-88-1338919|title=Robbie Williams to pave Chinese roads - NME|date=16 January 2008|website=NME|accessdate=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622165208/http://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-88-1338919|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[EMI]] owner Guy Hands said, "Roughly 85% of what EMI does get to release never makes a profit, in part because of the cash spent signing bands and partly due to ill-made bets on the number of CDs the market requires for particular acts."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/15/6|title=Interview: EMI's Guy Hands|first=Richard|last=Wray|date=15 January 2008|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622165238/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/15/6|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
