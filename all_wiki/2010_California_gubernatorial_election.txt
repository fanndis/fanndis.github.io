The '''2010 California gubernatorial election''' was held November 2, 2010 to elect the [[Governor of California|Governor]] of [[California]]. The primary elections were held on June 8, 2010. Because constitutional office holders in California have been prohibited from serving more than two terms in the same office since 1990, [[incumbent]] [[California Republican Party|Republican]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was ineligible to run for re-election for a third term. Former Governor [[Jerry Brown]], to whom the term limits did not apply due to a grandfather clause, defeated [[Meg Whitman]] in the general election. Brown was sworn into office on January 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cookpolitical.com/governors | title = Governors | publisher = [[Cook Political Report]] | accessdate = October 29, 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101026191254/http://cookpolitical.com/governors | archivedate = October 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_governor_elections/california/election_2010_california_governor | title = Election 2010: Gubernatorial Scorecard | publisher = [[Rasmussen Reports]] | accessdate = October 29, 2010}}</ref>

Both Whitman and Brown were criticized for [[negative campaigning]] during the election.<ref name=NPRads/> During their final debate at the 2010 [[Women's Conference]] a week before the election, moderator [[Matt Lauer]] asked both candidates to pull attack ads for the rest of the election, which elicited loud cheers from the audience.<ref name=NPRads>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130852376 Whitman, Brown In The Hot Seat Over Negative Ads] by Ina Jaffe.</ref> Brown agreed and picked one ad each of his and Whitman's that he thought, if Whitman would agree, should be the only ones run, but Whitman, who had been loudly cheered earlier as the prospective first woman governor of the state, was booed when she stated that she would keep "the ads that talk about where Gov. Brown stands on the issues."<ref name=PBSads>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2010/10/the-morning-line-negative-ads-put-front-and-center-in-race-for-california-governor.html Brown, Whitman Challenged to Pull Negative Ads in California Governor Race] PBS Newshour, [[David Chalian]] and Terrance Burlij, October 27, 2010.</ref>
