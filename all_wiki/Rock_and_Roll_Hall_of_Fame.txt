The '''Rock and Roll Hall of Fame''' (RRHOF) is a [[museum]] and [[hall of fame]] located in [[downtown Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]], on the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. The museum documents the history of [[rock music]] and the artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have influenced its development.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by [[Ahmet Ertegun]], founder and chairman of [[Atlantic Records]]. After a long search for the right city, Cleveland was chosen in 1986 as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Architect [[I. M. Pei]] designed the new museum, and it was dedicated on September 1, 1995.

== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation ==
The RRHOF Foundation was established in 1983 by [[Ahmet Ertegun]], who assembled a team that included ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' publisher [[Jann S. Wenner]], record executives [[Seymour Stein]], [[Bob Krasnow]], and Noreen Woods, and attorneys [[Allen Grubman]] and Suzan Evans. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] and ''[[American Bandstand]]''), Memphis (home of [[Sun Studio]]s and [[Stax Records]]), Detroit (home of [[Motown Records]]), Cincinnati (home of [[King Records (United States)|King Records]]), New York City, and Cleveland.<ref name="Tribune 86">{{cite news| last=Swindell| first=Howard| date=May 8, 1986| title=Rock 'N' Roll Finds Home in Cleveland| url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-05-06-8602010888-story.html| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| access-date=February 17, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217082953/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-05-06-8602010888-story.html| archive-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>

Cleveland lobbied for the museum, with civic leaders in Cleveland pledging $65 million in public money to fund the construction, and citing that [[WKNR|WJW]] disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] both coined the term "[[rock and roll]]" and heavily promoted the new genre—and that Cleveland was the location of Freed's [[Moondog Coronation Ball]], often credited as the first major rock and roll concert. Freed was also a member of the hall of fame's inaugural class of inductees in 1986.<ref>{{cite web| date=April 8, 2016| title=A Look Back at the First Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in 1986| url=https://www.wksu.org/post/look-back-first-rock-and-roll-hall-fame-induction-ceremony-1986#stream/0| work=[[WKSU]] News| last=Bhatia| first=Kabia| access-date=August 22, 2020| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409120552/https://www.wksu.org/post/look-back-first-rock-and-roll-hall-fame-induction-ceremony-1986#stream/0| archive-date=April 9, 2016}}</ref> In addition, Cleveland cited radio station [[WMMS]], which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[David Bowie]], who began his first U.S. tour in the city, [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Roxy Music]], and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among many others.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/wmms--a-cleveland-legend-turns-40/| title=Exhibits| website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame| access-date=August 23, 2018}}</ref>

Cleveland business leaders and media companies organized a petition demonstrating the city's support that was signed by 600,000 Northeast Ohio residents, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 ''USA Today'' poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Author [[Peter Guralnick]] said the hall should have been located in Memphis in a 2016 interview.<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Writing from the Inside Out| url=https://www.bu.edu/bostonia/winter-spring16/writing-from-the-inside-out/| first=Susan| last=Seligson| magazine=Bostonia| date=Winter–Spring 2016| pages=52–54}}</ref> Cleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As ''The Plain Dealer'' music critic Michael Norman noted, "It was $65 million{{nbsp}}... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money."

During early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered a site along the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown by [[Lake Erie]], east of [[Cleveland Stadium]]. At one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect [[I. M. Pei]] to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. [[Larry R. Thompson]] facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. Pei initially planned the tower to be {{convert|200|ft|m}} high, but was forced to reduce it to {{convert|162|ft|m}} due to the structure's proximity to [[Burke Lakefront Airport]]. The building's base is approximately {{convert|150,000|sqft|m2}}.

The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. [[Pete Townshend]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Sam Phillips]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[Sam Moore]] of [[Sam and Dave]], [[Carl Gardner]] of [[the Coasters]] and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]] all appeared at the groundbreaking.<ref name="HOF Timeline">{{cite web| title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum Timeline: 1995–2010| url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/08/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_and_3.html| newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]| location=Cleveland| access-date=March 1, 2013}}</ref>

The museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Little Richard]], among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at Cleveland Stadium.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Norman |first1=Michael |title=A firsthand account of the 1995 'Concert for the Hall of Fame,' with complete setlist |url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2015/09/a_firsthand_account_of_the_199.html |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |access-date=June 11, 2019}}</ref> It featured [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Al Green]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[John Fogerty]], [[John Mellencamp]], and many others.<ref name="HOF Timeline"/>

In addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.<ref name="HOF Timeline"/>

Since 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986–92, 1994–96, 1998–2008, 2010–11, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and five times in the hall of fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018). As of 2018, the induction ceremonies alternate each year between New York and Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web| last=Grzegorek| first=Vince| date=April 8, 2016| title=Rock Hall President: Induction to Take Place in Cleveland Every Other Year Beginning in 2018| url=http://clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2016/04/08/rock-hall-president-induction-to-take-place-in-cleveland-every-other-year-beginning-in-2018| newspaper=[[Cleveland Scene]]| access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>
 
The 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a [[public–private partnership]] between the City of Cleveland, the State of [[Ohio]], the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies at Public Hall.<ref>{{cite news| last=Soeder| first=John| title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is going strong, 15 years after opening| url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/08/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_and_4.html| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| access-date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>
 
Millions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in the events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.<ref>{{cite news| last=Soeder| first=John| title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions, done 'the Cleveland way,' are a hit| url=http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_ind_17.html| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| access-date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>

The building contains seven levels. On the lower level is the [[Ahmet Ertegun|Ahmet M. Ertegun]] Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll ([[Gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], [[rhythm & blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], [[Country music|country]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Detroit]], [[London]], [[Liverpool]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Seattle]]. There are exhibits about [[soul music]], the Fifties, [[Sun Records]], [[hip hop music]], Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes a theatre that features films on various subjects such as [[American Bandstand]].<ref>{{cite news| title=A look inside the redesign of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum: Interactive Graphic| url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/03/a_look_inside_the_redesign_of.html| newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]| access-date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>

The first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called "Backstage Stories." The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on [[one-hit wonders]] and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about [[Les Paul]], [[Alan Freed]], [[Sam Phillips]] and the evolution of audio technology.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Swank| first=Niki| title=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: the heart of rock and roll| url=http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=1274| journal=Builders Exchange Magazine| access-date=March 4, 2013| archive-date=October 16, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016184608/http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp%3FID%3D1274| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Visitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor.

Finally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about [[Elvis Presley]], [[hip-hop]], [[the Supremes]], [[the Who]], [[U2]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Clash]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], ''Women Who Rock'', and the [[Rolling Stones]].

Cleveland area musicians/bands who have performed at the Hall of Fame include [[The Pretenders]] (with [[Chrissie Hynde]] from Akron) in 1995 at the Hall's opening (they performed "[[My City Was Gone]]"), [[James Gang]] (with [[Joe Walsh]]) in 2001, [[Foo Fighters]] (with Warren-native [[Dave Grohl]]) in 2001, [[Velvet Revolver]] (with one-time Cleveland resident [[Scott Weiland]]) in 2007, [[The Raspberries]] in 2009, [[Bobby Womack]] in 2009, and [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=Pretenders+Hall+of+Fame| title=Search for setlists: Pretenders Hall of Fame| website=Setlist.fm| access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, showing [[Lake Erie]] in the foreground]]
Designed by [[I. M. Pei]] and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of [[Lake Erie]]. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass "tent" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.

The building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a café.

"In designing this building," Pei said, "it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of [[Cleveland]] and for fans of [[rock and roll]] around the world."<ref>{{cite web| title=The House That Steel Built: A Showcase of Interesting and Aesthetic Projects| url=http://www.lera.com/files/rock%26roll_AISC.pdf| website=American Institute of Steel Construction| access-date=March 4, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615041331/http://www.lera.com/files/rock%26roll_AISC.pdf| archive-date=June 15, 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2006 the RRHOF partnered with three entertainment production companies to create a branch museum in New York City.<ref name="Sisario">{{cite news |last=Sisario |first=Ben |date=November 20, 2008 |title=A Piece of Cleveland with a New York Accent |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/arts/music/21rock.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=C5}}</ref> On November 18, 2008, the '''Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC''' opened in [[Manhattan]]'s [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] district.<ref name="Sisario"/> Located at 76 [[Mercer Street (Manhattan)|Mercer Street]] just west of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], the Annex occupied an underground space of {{convert|25,000|sqft|m2}}.<ref name="Sisario"/> The branch museum operated in much the same way as its Cleveland parent, featuring archetypal display pieces like [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s coat from ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'', [[David Byrne]]'s "big suit" from ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'', and [[Elvis Presley]]'s motorcycle jacket and his Bible.<ref name="Sisario"/> But from its start the Annex also had a distinct [[New York area]] focus that made plenty of space for big items like the phone booth from [[CBGB]], layered thick with band stickers over the decades; Bruce Springsteen's own [[1957 Chevrolet]]; a special gallery reserved for the city's musicians; and an intricate {{convert|26|ft|m|adj=on}} scale model of Manhattan highlighting sites of rock history.<ref name="Sisario"/>

==Exhibit history==
Since 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.

The museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called ''I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965–1969''. It included memorabilia from numerous artists including [[John Lennon]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Janis Joplin]], as well as items related to the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and 1969's [[Woodstock]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9705/06/rock.hall.fame/index.html| title=Rock-and-Roll Hall pays tribute to 'psychedelic' era| date=May 6, 1997| work=[[CNN]]| access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref>

That exhibit was followed by ''Elvis is in the Building'', which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley—the "King of Rock and Roll" and the first inductee into the RRHOF, in 1986. [[Graceland]] supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.<ref>Keeter, Larry G. ''Elvis Is In the Building'', "Elvis International Forum," Summer 2000, pp.{{nbsp}}28–29.)</ref>  Next, the museum curated ''Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/972006/hip-hop-exhibit-features-run-dmc-tupac-shakur-artifacts/| title=Hip-Hop Exhibit Features Run-D.M.C., Tupac Shakur Artifacts| date=June 13, 2000| last=Hawthorne| first=Daniel| website=[[MTV]]}}</ref> That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by ''Rock Style'', an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from [[Buddy Holly]] to [[Alice Cooper]], from [[Ray Charles]] to [[David Bowie]] and from [[Smokey Robinson]] to [[Sly Stone]]. After it closed in Cleveland, ''Rock Style'' traveled to other museums in the U.S.

Other temporary exhibits have included ''Lennon: His Life and Work'', which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by ''In the Name of Love: Two Decades of [[U2]]'' and then ''Reflections: The [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] Supreme Legacy Collection''. A major exhibition titled ''Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics'' was on display during the [[2016 Republican National Convention]] in Cleveland.<ref>{{cite news| last=Smith| first=Troy| title=Rock Hall announces 'Rock, Power and Politics' exhibit to coincide with Republican National Convention| url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/12/rock_halls_rock_power_and_poli.html| date=December 10, 2015| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| location=Cleveland| access-date=October 19, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2019/08/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fames-rock-on-tv-exhibit-headed-to-chicago.html| title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 'Rock on TV' exhibit headed to Chicago| first=Troy| last=Smith| date=August 14, 2019| newspaper=The Plain Dealer}}</ref>

Other large temporary exhibits have focused on [[the Clash]] (''Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash''), [[the Doors]] (''Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors''), [[the Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' (''Tommy: The Amazing Journey''), and [[Bruce Springsteen]] (''From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen''). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (''Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power''). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. A major temporary exhibit in 2017 told the story and impact of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news| last=Smith| first=Troy| title=Rock Hall exhibit lays out Rolling Stone magazine's remarkable impact| url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/05/rock_halls_new_rolling_stone_e.html| date=May 4, 2017| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref>

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the [[Vans Warped Tour]], [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], Woodstock's 40th and 50th anniversaries, [[Austin City Limits]], the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], [[Roy Orbison]], Motown's 50th anniversary, [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Mellencamp]], and [[Geddy Lee]]'s basses.

The museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are [[George Kalinsky]], Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, [[Lynn Goldsmith]], [[Linda McCartney]], [[Mike McCartney]], Robert Alford,<ref>{{cite news| last=Yarborough| first=Chuck| title="Just Can't Get Enough: The Photography of Robert Alford" opens Sept. 19 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum| url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2012/09/just_cant_get_enough_the_photo.html| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| access-date=June 21, 2013}}</ref> and George Shuba.

===Public programs===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.
Every February, the museum celebrates [[Black History Month]] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll.<ref>{{cite news| last=Niesel| first=Jeff| title=Rock Hall Announces Events for Black History Month| url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2015/01/27/rock-hall-announces-events-for-black-history-month| newspaper=Cleveland Scene| date=January 27, 2015| access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref> Since the program began in 1996, such artists as [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], [[the Temptations]], [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[the Ohio Players]], [[Lloyd Price]], [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]], and [[Al Green]] have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.

Another program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl "DMC" McDaniels of [[Run-D.M.C]]., [[Lloyd Price]], [[Martha Reeves]], [[Marky Ramone]], [[Seymour Stein]], [[Ray Manzarek]] of [[the Doors]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] of [[the Supremes]], [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Ann Wilson|Ann]] and [[Nancy Wilson (rock musician)|Nancy Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Dennis Edwards]] of [[the Temptations]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] of the [[Jefferson Airplane]].

A similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. [[Peter Hook]] of [[Joy Division]], [[Spinderella]] of [[Salt n Pepa]], [[Tommy James]], and [[the Chi-Lites]] are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.

The American Music Masters series began in 1996 with ''Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger''. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] (1997), [[Robert Johnson]] (1998), [[Louis Jordan]] (1999), [[Muddy Waters]] (2000), [[Bessie Smith]] (2001), [[Hank Williams]] (2002), [[Buddy Holly]] (2003), [[Lead Belly]] (2004), [[Sam Cooke]] (2005), [[Roy Orbison]] (2006), [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (2007), [[Les Paul]] (2008),<ref>{{cite journal| last=D.X.| first=Ferris| title=Slash, Billy Gibbons Jam for Les Paul at Rock Hall's American Music Master's Concert| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/slash-billy-gibbons-jam-for-les-paul-at-rock-halls-american-music-masters-concert-20081117| journal=[[Rolling Stone]]| access-date=March 5, 2013}}</ref> [[Janis Joplin]] (2009),<ref>{{cite news| last=DeMarco| first=Laura| title=Rock Hall to honor Janis Joplin in American Music Masters series| url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2009/08/rock_hall_to_honor_janis_jopli.html| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| access-date=March 5, 2013}}</ref> [[Fats Domino]] and [[Dave Bartholomew]] (2010), [[Aretha Franklin]] (2011),<ref>{{cite news| last=Soeder| first=John| title=Aretha Franklin Honored in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame American Music Masters Tribute| url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2011/11/aretha_franklin_honored_in_roc.html| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| access-date=March 2, 2013}}</ref> [[Chuck Berry]] (2012),<ref>{{cite journal| last=Doyle| first=Patrick| title=Chuck Berry Praises Obama, Laments Fading Health| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chuck-berry-praises-obama-laments-fading-voice-20121027| journal=Rolling Stone| access-date=March 2, 2013}}</ref> [[The Everly Brothers]] (2014) and [[Johnny Cash]] (2017).<ref name="rhonors">{{cite news |last1=Yarborough |first1=Chuck |title=Rock Hall Honors: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame reimagines Music Masters with the honoree as the star performer |url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2019/01/rock-hall-honors-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-reimagines-music-masters-with-the-honoree-is-the-star-performer.html |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |access-date=20 October 2019 |language=en |date=13 January 2019}}</ref> In 2019 the concert series' format was retooled and the event was renamed the Rock Hall Honors, in which the honored performer is joined in concert by guests of their choice.<ref name="rhonors"/> The first Rock Hall Honors concert, featuring [[Mavis Staples]], was performed in Cleveland in September 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yarborough |first1=Chuck |title=Rock Hall Honors celebrates Hall of Famer Mavis Staples in revamped Music Masters program |url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2019/08/rock-hall-honors-celebrates-hall-of-famer-mavis-staples-in-revamped-music-masters-program.html |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |access-date=20 October 2019 |language=en |date=1 August 2019}}</ref>

===Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll ===

Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with "the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts", created an unordered list of  "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/site/faq/| title=FAQ| website=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum| access-date=March 24, 2015| archive-date=March 22, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322185411/http://rockhall.com/site/faq/| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0150472.html| title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock| website=Infoplease.com| date=February 11, 2017| access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref> The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.artcom.com/Museums/nv/mr/44114-10.htm| website=Artcom Museums Tour| title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum| access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref> It contains songs recorded from the [[Stagger Lee (song)|1920s]] through the 1990s.

Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as "The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".

===25th anniversary concert===
{{Main|25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concerts}}
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York.

==Inductees==
[[File:Eric-Clapton 1975.jpg|thumbnail|220px|English guitarist, singer, and songwriter [[Eric Clapton]] is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]

{{See also|List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees}}
Artists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years.

Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters.

The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included [[Elvis Presley]],<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wkyc.com/article/entertainment/music/rock-hall/list-of-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inductees/95-125896462| title=Who's inducted the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

===Performers===
A nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the "Performers" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly 500 experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. [[Block approval voting]] is used, with those nominees who receive the most votes being inducted, subject to a minimum of 50% approval. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.<!--It is *not* impossible for 5 to 7 nominees to each receive 50 percent or more of a vote, as the number of nominees is not specified, and voters can select multiple nominees. There were seven inductees in this category in 2004, and eight in 2001. --><ref>{{cite web| url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/induction-process/| title=Induction Process| website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame| access-date=August 23, 2018}}</ref>

In 2012, six additional groups, [[the Miracles]], [[the Famous Flames]], [[the Comets]], [[the Blue Caps]], [[the Midnighters]], and [[the Crickets]], were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. "There was a lot of discussion about this," said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago ... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/02/crickets_famous_flames_comets.html| title=Crickets, Famous Flames, Comets, Miracles, Midnighters and Blue Caps added to Rock Hall induction ceremony| last=Soeder| first=John| newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]| date=February 9, 2012| access-date=February 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Early Influences===
Early Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], and [[blues]], whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]] & [[The Ink Spots]], country musicians [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Hank Williams]], blues musicians [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Muddy Waters]], and jazz musicians [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and [[Louis Armstrong]]. After [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Billie Holiday]] in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer [[Wanda Jackson]] was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the "rock era".

===Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement===
Formerly the "Non-Performers" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, [[tour promoter|concert promoter]]s and [[Journalism|music journalists]]. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder [[Ahmet Ertegun]], this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/late-ertegun-honoured-with-new-hall-of-fame-award_1062079| title=Late Ertegun Honoured With New Hall Of Fame Award| date=March 11, 2008| journal=[[Contactmusic.com]]}}</ref>

===Award for Musical Excellence===
Formerly the "Sidemen" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran [[session musician|session]] and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the "Award for Musical Excellence" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, "This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/12/neil_diamond_alice_cooper_dr_j.html |title=Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Dr. John, Darlene Love and Tom Waits headed into Rock Hall |date=December 15, 2010 |access-date=December 20, 2010 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |last=Soeder |first=John}}</ref>

==Library and archives==
[[File: RocknRollHall 2015 LHCollins 600.jpg |thumb|right|350px |The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio November 2015]]
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of [[Cuyahoga Community College]] in Cleveland's [[Campus District]].

The Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.

The library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.

The archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], handwritten working lyrics by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[LL Cool J]], papers from music journalists such as [[Sue Cassidy Clark]], and rare concert recordings from [[CBGB]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Opens Archives to the Public| date=January 18, 2012| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-opens-archives-to-the-public-20120118| magazine=Rolling Stone| access-date=March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Graff| first=Gary| title=Rock Hall Opening Library and Archives This Week| url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/511232/rock-hall-opening-library-and-archives-collection-this-week| journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=January 17, 2012| access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Soeder| first=John| title=Rock Hall Library and Archives set to open Tuesday| url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/01/rock_hall_library_and_archives.html| newspaper=The Plain Dealer| date=January 15, 2012| access-date=March 1, 2013}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founders Jann Wenner and Suzan Evans, and writer [[Dave Marsh]], reflecting their personal tastes rather than public opinion as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that "At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the [[doo-wop]] groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today."<ref name="Friedman">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1966,00.html |title=Rock Hall of Fame Fallout: 'There Is Resentment Building Up' |access-date=April 4, 2001 |last=Friedman |first=Roger |date=April 4, 2001 |work=Fox News |archive-date=January 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115080549/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1966,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]] is often considered "The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll", but was not chosen for induction until 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00xf8k7/the-godmother-of-rock-roll-sister-rosetta-tharpe |title=The Godmother of Rock & Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe |work=[[BBC Four]] |date=May 24, 2011 |access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/black-culture/shows/list/rock-and-roll-rosetta-tharpe/| title=Godmother of Rock and Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe| network=PBS| series=Black Culture Connection| access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Velvet Underground]] drummer [[Maureen Tucker]] has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the "Hall of Lame".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html| title=Doug Yule - Story| website=Olivier.landemaine.free.fr| last=Yule| first=Jennifer| date=October 26, 2008}}</ref>

There was also criticism of the opacity in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:

<blockquote>With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders – and committee members say they want to keep it that way.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/in-rock-hall-of-fame-vote-a-battle-of-industry-egos.html| title=Battle of the Bands (and Egos) for the Rock Hall of Fame| last=Morrissey| first=Janet| date=December 3, 2011| access-date=December 5, 2011| newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Jon Landau]], the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. "We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room."<ref name="New York Times"/>

According to [[Fox News]], petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.<ref name="Friedman"/> The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/getting-progressive-the-rock-hall-voted-in-genesis-whos-still-missing.html| title=Getting progressive: The Rock Hall votes in Genesis.

Another criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.<ref name="Bream"/> A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted, although the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.<ref name="Bream">{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/457/story/931216.html |title=Three strikes, they're in |access-date=January 17, 2007 |last=Friedman |first=Roger |date=January 12, 2007 |newspaper=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020112245/http://www.startribune.com/457/story/931216.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=October 20, 2007}}</ref> The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres.

Members of the British [[punk rock]] band [[The Sex Pistols]], inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum "a piss stain" and "urine in wine."<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302091236/http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ |url=http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ |title=Official announcement from the Sex Pistols regarding the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |date=February 24, 2006 |archive-date=March 2, 2008 |website=Sex Pistols – The Filth and the Fury}}</ref>

In [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]'s Annual [[John Peel]] Lecture in 2013, the singer [[Charlotte Church]] accused the museum of [[gender bias]], stating, "Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that [[Tina Weymouth]]'s part in [[Talking Heads]] makes them one of the 36 female acts."<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/10/15/church| title=Transcript: Paul Resnikoff, "I'm Charlotte Church.

His criticisms included his opinions that there is a general lack of female inductees, that there is not enough support by the hall for music education, and that inductees are treated poorly at the award ceremony.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/64693-steve-miller-rips-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/ |title=Steve Miller Rips the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |journal=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |first=Evan |last=Minsker |date=April 9, 2016 |access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref>

In 2018, [[Bruce Dickinson]] of [[Iron Maiden]] criticized the Hall of Fame by calling it "an utter and complete load of bollocks ... run by a bunch of sanctimonious bloody Americans who wouldn’t know rock 'n' roll if it hit them in the face."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/iron-maidens-bruce-dickinson-brands-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-an-utter-and-complete-load-of-bollocks-2393652| title=Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson brands Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame "an utter and complete load of bollocks"| website=[[NME]]| first=Rhian| last=Daly| date=October 25, 2018| access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref> Dickinson has also expressed an overall distaste for the Hall of Fame entity, arguing that "if you put [music] in a museum, then it's dead."

===Dave Clark Five===
On March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of [[Fox News]] published an article claiming that [[the Dave Clark Five]] should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]. The article went on to say that Jann Wenner availed himself of a technicality on the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt "we couldn't go another year without a rap act."<ref name="Friedman2">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258664,00.html#2 |title=Rock Hall Voting Scandal: Rock Group Actually Won |access-date=April 6, 2007 |last=Friedman |first=Roger |date=March 14, 2007 |work=Fox News}}</ref>

===The Monkees===

In June 2007, Monkee [[Peter Tork]] complained to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that Wenner had blackballed [[the Monkees]], commenting:

{{bquote|[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, "What's the big deal? Everybody else does it." [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.}}

In a Facebook post, fellow Monkee [[Michael Nesmith]] stated that he did not know if the Monkees belonged in the Hall of Fame because he could only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and went on to say: "I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one."<ref>{{cite web |last=Nesmith |first=Michael |title='Should The Monkees be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?', you ask. |url=https://www.facebook.com/michaelnesmith/posts/400891016595629 |publisher=Facebook |access-date=May 13, 2012 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>
