===United States===
The U.S. edition of the magazine was started by the [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Corporation]], based in [[New York City]], in 1994. Hearst has branch offices in France, Italy, and several locations in the United States including [[Detroit]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[New England]], the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the Southwest, and the Southeast. The [[Esquire Network]] reality television series ''[[Running In Heels]]'' follows three interns working in the NYC office of the magazine. The editor-in-chief from 2012 to 2020 was [[Anne Fulenwider]]. On 9 December 2019, Hearst Magazines announced that Fulenwider would be leaving her post at the end of the year.<ref name="Marikar">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/style/marie-claire-editor-anne-fulenwider.html|title=Marie Claire Editor Departing for Health Start-Up|last=Marikar|first=Sheila|date=2019-12-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Aya Kanai]], then chief fashion director of Hearst, was named the new editor of the women's magazine, and started in January 2020.<ref name="Marikar"/>

===United Kingdom===

''Marie Claire'' launched a UK print edition in 1988,<ref name=BBC190910/> with a website launched in 2006 featuring segments on daily news, catwalk shows, photographs and reports, fashion and beauty, buys of the day, daily horoscopes, and competitions.

Its cover price was increased in February 2018 from £3.99 to £4.20, but this did not compensate for a decline in sales and advertising revenue, with print display advertising down 25% in 2018 and 30% in 2019.<ref name=BBC190910/> In September 2019, the magazine's current owners, [[TI Media]], announced that the final print edition would be published in November and the brand would become digital only, under licence with Groupe Marie Claire. The UK website currently has two million monthly users.<ref name=BBC190910/>

Combined print and digital circulation from July to December 2018 was 120,133 per issue – almost a third of which were free copies, and 4,729 of which were for the digital edition. This was down on the same period in 2017, when the average circulation was 157,412, with 4,012 digital edition readers.<ref name=BBC190910>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49651603 |title=Marie Claire to stop producing UK print magazine after November |last=Westbrook |first=Ian |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=10 September 2019 |accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>

===Australia===

In [[Australia]], ''Marie Claire'' magazine is part of [[Pacific Magazines]], the magazine publishing arm of television network [[Seven Network|Seven]]. ''MarieClaire.com.au'' launched in 2016 after the digital rights were returned to Pacific Magazines from [[Yahoo]] and provides daily fashion, beauty, and lifestyle news. In March 2019, ''Marie Claire'' partnered with [[Salesforce.com]] to survey Australian women to analyse how attitudes have changed in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/media/marie-claire-join-salesforce-improve-working-lives-aussie-women|title=Marie Claire Joins With Salesforce To Improve The Working Lives Of Aussie Women|work=B&T|date=2019-03-08}}</ref>
