"'''American Oxygen'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. It was written by [[Alex da Kid]], [[Candice Pillay]], [[X Ambassadors|Sam Harris]] and Rihanna; Alex da Kid and [[Kanye West]] produced it. Written over the course of a year, "American Oxygen" was inspired by the 1984 single "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" performed by [[Bruce Springsteen]]. It was made available for [[Streaming media|streaming]] on [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] on April 5, 2015, and released for [[Music download|digital download]] on April 14 via the [[iTunes Store]]. The song has patriotic lyrical content about a new America and the chasing of the [[American dream]].

Darren Craig, [[Jonathan Craven]] and Jeff Nicholas of the Uprising Creative directed the music video for "American Oxygen", which premiered exclusively on Tidal on April 6. It depicts numerous moments from [[American history]] while Rihanna sings in front of a large [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. Rihanna performed "American Oxygen" for the first time at the Final Four of the [[2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in [[Indianapolis]].

{{Quote box
 |quote = She [Rihanna] just really made magic with that song and she made it her own. And the fact that her and Alex both helped craft the song and turned it into something that's bigger than me, it just means way more. The perspective that they gave to it, having it be this immigrant story, is something so cool and unique that I probably wouldn't have thought of had it not been for them.

"American Oxygen" was written by [[Alex da Kid]], [[X Ambassadors|Sam Harris]], [[Candice Pillay]] and Rihanna. <!--- ITUNES METADATA ---> The production was done by Alex da Kid and the American rapper [[Kanye West]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a641992/rihanna-to-release-new-song-american-oxygen-on-itunes.html#~p9WpfNm8VwQjCg|title=Rihanna to release new song 'American Oxygen' on iTunes|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Lewis|first=Corner|date=April 15, 2015|access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref> The writing of the song began in 2014, and it continued over a course of one year. Originally, Alex da Kid sent the beats of the song to Harris who started writing some lyrics. In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Harris noted how "American Oxygen" really stuck with him and he started the chorus with a couple lines he wrote: "We worked on just that chorus for like three or four months, going back and forth, back and forth.... It goes to show you that sometimes these songs just appear out of nowhere and sometimes you just have to go at it like a block of marble and you're chipping away at it."<ref name="writing">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6524518/how-born-in-the-usa-inspired-rihannas-american-oxygen|title=How 'Born in the U.S.A.' Inspired Rihanna's 'American Oxygen'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Stutz|first=Colin|date=April 9, 2015|access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> Harris explained how he and Alex da Kid wanted the chorus of the song to say a lot, even with a very small amount of lyrics in it. When they got the final chorus, the producer started to look for potential performers of the song.<ref name="writing"/>

When the song came across Rihanna, she and Alex da Kid began to adjust the song. The singer and the producer co-wrote the verses together with Harris, "I wrote one thing and then Alex and Rihanna had the idea to turn it into this song about an immigrant story, coming to this country as an outsider... That was her idea, really, hers and Alex's, to turn it into that kind of song." Harris stated that the inspiration for starting to write "American Oxygen" was the 1984 single "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" by [[Bruce Springsteen]].<ref name="writing"/> According to Harris, "He [Springsteen] gets that there's pride to living here in this country. This country is great and has the potential to be something really, really incredible, but there are a lot of problems that we don't acknowledge and it's important to shed light on both those things. And if you can do that in a song, that's the best."<ref name="writing"/> He also told the publication that they have their own version of "American Oxygen" too, however, according to him it means much more to be sung by Rihanna because she is a [[Black people|black]] female immigrant in the United States, "That is so powerful for a young kid to see her singing that song, it gets me choked up just thinking about it. It really was made so much more powerful by what she contributed to the songwriting and the performance of the song. I idolize her, and to have been given the opportunity to work with her is amazing."<ref name="writing"/>

"American Oxygen" was first featured on commercials which promoted the [[2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]].<ref name="oxygenperformance"/> Later, the song was made available for [[Streaming media|streaming]] on April 5, 2015, via [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], a service co-owned by Rihanna together with other music artists including, [[Jay Z]], [[Beyoncé]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2124299/rihanna-american-oxygen/|title= Rihanna Gifts The Earth With New Song, American Oxygen'|publisher=[[MTV News]]|last=Lidner|first=Emilee|date=April 5, 2015|access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> On April 14, "American Oxygen" was made available for [[Music download|digital download]] worldwide via the [[iTunes Store]].<ref name="audd"/> In Canada and the United States it was released two days later, on April 16.<ref name="cadd"/> It was sent to [[Adult contemporary music|Hot/Modern/AC]] radio in the United States on April 20,<ref name="adult"/> and impacted the [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit radio stations]] in the country a day after, on April 21.<ref name="chr"/>

"American Oxygen" is a [[sentimental ballad]] with a length of five minutes and twenty seconds.<ref name="nydailynews"/> According to Jim Farber of ''[[New York Daily News]]'', it features a "deeply resonant production" accompanied by [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]-inspired [[Beat (music)|beats]].<ref name="nydailynews"/> Jessica Goodman of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described it as a "slowed-down, [[dubstep]]-influenced track" in which she calls out a "new America."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/06/rihanna-american-oxygen_n_7009930.html|title=Rihanna Debuts New Track 'American Oxygen' Via Tidal|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|last=Goodman|first=Jessica|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> According to Ariana Bacle of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "American Oxygen" is a "a slower, soulful take on living in America."<ref name="EW">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/05/rihanna-debuts-american-oxygen-tidal|title=Rihanna debuts soulful 'American Oxygen' on Tidal|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Bacle|first=Ariana|date=April 5, 2015|access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref> Dee Lockett of [[Vulture.com|Vulture]] described it as a "sobering ode to the [[American dream]]".<ref name="vulture">{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/rihanna-american-oxygen.html|title=Rihanna’s New Song Should Be America’s Next National Anthem|publisher=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|last=Lockett|first=Dee|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref> Lyrically, the song interprets an immigrant story which could be seen in the lyrics:

<blockquote>

You can be anything at all<br>

</blockquote>

Farber compared the lyrical content of the song to the one of the 2009 single "[[Empire State of Mind]]" by [[Jay Z]] and [[Alicia Keys]]. According to Farber, "American Oxygen" "offers an un-ironic endorsement of the American dream, saluting unending possibility and upward mobility" and features Rihanna proudly singing the lines, "We sweat for a nickel and a dime, turn it into an empire."<ref name="nydailynews">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/single-review-rihanna-american-oxygen-grand-ballad-article-1.2175025|title=Rihanna’s ‘American Oxygen’ review: New single offers an un-ironic endorsement of the American dream|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|last=Farber|first=Jim|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 10, 2015}}</ref> According to Jake Flanagin of [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]], the song is autobiographical to Rihanna and describes her move to the United States in late 2003, when record producer [[Evan Rogers]] discovered her in [[Barbados]].<ref name="quartz"/> [[VH1]]'s Alexa Tietjen wrote that "American Oxygen" is similar to a presidential speech and "portrays a hurtful past while fostering hope for the future".<ref name="vh1review">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/5267/rihanna-releases-american-oxygen-on-itunes/|title=Rihanna Drops 'American Oxygen' for Everyone Who Doesn’t Use Tidal|publisher=[[VH1]]|last=Tietjen|first=Alexa|date=April 16, 2015|access-date=April 16, 2015}}</ref> According to Erika Ramirez of ''Billboard'', the lyrics of the song describe "pursuit and resilience."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6524243/rihanna-american-oxygen-video-tidal|title=Rihanna Debuts 'American Oxygen' Video on Tidal|work=Billboard|last=Ramirez|first=Erika|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref> [[CBS Radio]]'s reviewer thought that the final line in the song, "This is the new America" can be deemed as the "most telling".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2015/03/06/rihanna-american-oxygen-r8-march-madness/|title=Rihanna’s ‘American Oxygen’ Song Teased on Instagram|publisher=[[CBS Radio]]|date=March 9, 2015|access-date=April 12, 2015}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==

Vulture's Lockett wrote "But just in case the song doesn't wind up replacing our [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]], it'd also make for the perfect ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' theme song."<ref name="vulture"/> Tietjen of VH1 described "American Oxygen" as different for [[180 degree rule|180 degrees]] from her previous single, "[[Bitch Better Have My Money]]", and not "as raw as" "[[FourFiveSeconds]]".<ref name="vh1review"/> Ailbhe Mahone of the ''[[Irish Times]]'' declared the single as 'Track of the Week' and called it "epic". She also wrote, "When she sings the line ‘we are the new America’, we defy you not to feel a shiver down your spine."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/pop-corner-rihanna-s-new-blast-of-fresh-air-breaths-extra-life-into-album-1.2186353|title=Pop Corner: Rihanna’s new blast of fresh air breaths extra life into album|work=[[Irish Times]]|last=Mahone|first=Ailbhe|date=April 23, 2015|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref>

Rob Le Donne of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the single features more "serious" Rihanna than the persona on her previous singles, "it's hard to tell exactly what Rihanna is trying to say – but maybe that’s the point." Further more, he praised the producers Alex da Kid and West and the "layered" production that they have done on the song. However, he thought that "American Oxygen" is not "radio-friendly" unlike [[Eminem]] and Rihanna's 2010 single "[[Love the Way You Lie]]", which was also produced by Alex da Kid, or Rihanna's songs from her previous album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'', including "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]" and "[[Pour It Up]]". Le Donne wrote "So why is Rihanna, arguable queen of the club jam, putting out such a heavy single when she could have released another party banger?" To answer his question he put out two theories, on the first one, he thought that putting out the song is a "calculated move driven to get people talking about her again" because she has been musically inactive for three years, or the second theory that "Rihanna wants to move past her commercial [[Dance music|dance]] tracks and actually comment on [[Modern society|today's society]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/apr/16/rihanna-american-oxygen-eric-garner|title=Is Rihanna's American Oxygen an anthem for Eric Garner?|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Le Donne|first=Rob|date=April 16, 2015|access-date=April 17, 2015}}</ref>

The video begins with Rihanna standing on the stairs of a building on which wall is a big [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]. During the moment, shadows of a number of people are screened on the wall. Scenes are intercut with a moment from the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]] of the first ever black American president, [[Barack Obama]]. As the song begins Rihanna is shown singing the lyrics in front of a giant American flag. Other scenes such as rising up the flag, peaceful protests and imagery of a typical American family are also shown. Those are followed by inserts which include [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and an [[Slavery in the United States|American slave]].

=== Reception ===

In a review of the video, Alex Ungerman of ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' felt that the repetition of the word "breathe" is a very serious symbol and an important message linked to the [[death of Eric Garner]].<ref name="entertainmenttonightvideo"/> According to a writer of [[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]], the video shows the patriotic side of Rihanna and the struggle experienced by the black people in the country and their success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/rihanna/news/american-oxygen-higher/#EeGOWzh4ho5jyui2.97|title=WATCH: Rihanna Drops Patriotic Video For New Song ‘American Oxygen’|publisher=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]|date=April 7, 2015|access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref> Steven Gottlieb of Videostatic wrote that the video is, "is probably a bit more political than you might expect, utilizing a mix of news footage that runs the gamut from tragedy to transcendence."<ref name="videostatic"/> A ''[[Rap-Up]]''-reviewer thought that with the visual Rihanna spreads her message of unity.<ref name="rapupvideo"/> ''[[Us Weekly]]'''s Madeline Boardman called the music video "stunning" and thought it was different than Rihanna's previous videos in which she is known for "pushing the boundaries". She also wrote, "the clip was celebrated by social media users as "powerful," "important," and "iconic."<ref name="usweekly"/> Zoe Anastasiou of [[Style.com|Style]] website commented the fashion and wrote, "Rihanna's new video for 'American Oxygen' touches on issues of racial injustice and immigration, a far cry from the videos highlighting her bold (and oft barely-there) looks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.style.com/culture/entertainment/2015/rihanna-american-oxygen-news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418150532/http://www.style.com/culture/entertainment/2015/rihanna-american-oxygen-news |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 18, 2015 |title=Rihanna Segues From Fashion to Activism in Latest Video, and More of Today’s News |publisher=[[Style.com]] |last=Anastasiou |first=Zoe |date=April 16, 2015 |access-date=April 18, 2015 }}</ref>

Daniel Kreps of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the visual as, a quasi-time capsule feel, juxtaposing patriotic imagery with archival footage of the United States' most noteworthy historical events."<ref name="rollingstonevideo"/> He further wrote that, the video "similarly gazes inwards towards the nation" that results in a visual experience that could be seen in the visual for [[Billy Joel]]'s 1989 single, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]".<ref name="rollingstonevideo"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s Nolan Feeney thought that some of the presented historical moments "challenges readings of the song as a pure ode to the land of opportunity".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3772974/rihanna-american-oxygen-video/|title=Watch Rihanna Get Political in ‘American Oxygen’ Video|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Feeney|first=Nolan|date=April 6, 2015|access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref> Quartz's Flanagin disagreed with the critics who thought the video and the song were contradictory. According to him, "The message is clear: the life of the American immigrant is full of contradictions. To embark for the United States, illegally or with visa in hand, as a strawberry-picker or a pop-star, is an endeavor fueled by hope. But new arrivals often face intense social push back."<ref name="quartz"/> Adam Fleischer of MTV News noted that "those clips span decades, relate to numerous situations and evoke an array of emotions", and eventually agreed with Feeney.<ref name="mtvnewsvideo"/> Michelle Geslani of [[Consequence of Sound]] wrote, "It's a gripping visual that seems to pose the question: How far are we willing to go to protect this so-called Land of Opportunity?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/04/rihanna-unveils-video-for-american-oxygen-watch/|title=Rihanna unveils video for 'American Oxygen' — watch|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Geslani|first=Michelle|date=April 16, 2015|access-date=April 16, 2015}}</ref>
