In the 1850s, some 230 African Americans were enslaved on Friendfield Plantation and they produced 900,000 pounds of rice annually. Among them was Jim Robinson, born into slavery in 1850; one of his descendants is former First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] (née Robinson.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-obama-slavery-01-dec01-story.html|title=Michelle Obama's family tree has roots in a Carolina slave plantation|last=Clair|first=Stacy St.|date=December 1, 2008|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-08-28|last2=Glanton|first2=Dahleen|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Overview==
The current owner is Oscar Johnson Small II and his second wife Robbie Kephart.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The founder and first owner was [[James Withers]] (1710-1756), a brick maker in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] who also became a [[Planter (American South)|planter]]. He developed a plantation along the [[Sampit River]] for [[indigo]] and rice from 1734 onward, based on the use of enslaved labor.<ref name="friendfield">[http://friendfieldplantation.com/history.php Friendfield Plantation History]</ref><ref name="socialregister">Frances Cheston Train, [http://www.socialregisteronline.com/#!a-carolina-plantation-remembered/c1hfs A Carolina Plantation Remembered], ''[[Social Register|The Social Register Association]]'', Summer 2013</ref> He bought slaves from [[Barbados]], where they had been transported from Africa and were sometimes seasoned for a period of time.<ref name="socialregister"/> In 1818, Francis Withers (1768-1847), a grandson of James, built a new house on the Friendfield Plantation.<ref name="socialregister"/>

In the Low Country, where slaves developed a concentrated culture on large plantations, and slaves from Africa continued to be imported, African Americans developed what became known as the [[Gullah people|Gullah or GeeChee culture]]. It has been recognized as distinct for its creole African roots in language, cuisine and culture, and adaptations to the region. Paternal ancestors of First Lady Michelle (Robinson) Obama, including Jim Robinson, were among the Gullah enslaved laborers on the Friendfield Plantation.<ref name="friendfield"/><ref name="soil">{{Cite news|first=Shailagh |last=Murray |title=A Family Tree Rooted In American Soil: Michelle Obama Learns About Her Slave Ancestors, Herself and Her Country |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/01/AR2008100103169.html |work=The Washington Post |page=C01 |date=October 2, 2008 |accessdate=October 10, 2008}}</ref>

Francis Wither appointed his son-in-law, Dr. Alexius Mador Forster, III, MD (1815-1879), to manage the plantation, but it fell into disrepair after the [[American Civil War]]. An extended agricultural depression in the country brought down commodity prices. Combined with struggling with the change to free labor, planters faced a sudden lack of economic resources.<ref name="socialregister"/> After the war, Withers had the land cultivated mostly by [[sharecroppers]], [[freedmen]] who paid a portion of their crop to use the land. Michelle Obama's ancestor Jim Robinson, who became free at age 15, is believed to have been among them.<ref name="soil"/>

Friendfield Plantation passed out of the Withers family in 1897 when Elizabeth Hunt Warham Forster (1820-1906) sold it to B. Walker Cannon. (It had passed from the Withers bloodline in 1847 when Francis Withers died, as Elizabeth was his step-daughter.)

The property was later purchased by Patrick C. McClary, Sr., who used it as a duck hunting club.<ref name="socialregister"/> This was a common use for plantations by wealthy owners in the early 20th century. In 1926, the Friendfield House burned down in a fire.<ref name="socialregister"/>

In 1930, the plantation was purchased by Radcliffe Cheston, Jr., an investment banker from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="friendfield"/><ref name="socialregister"/> In 1932, he had a new Friendfield House built, designed by noted Philadelphia architect [[Arthur Ingersoll Meigs]] (1882-1956).<ref name="socialregister"/>

Up until the 1950s, African-American sharecroppers lived on the plantation and worked the fields.<ref name="socialregister"/> But during the early 20th century, thousands of African Americans left the South to go north in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial cities, seeking better opportunities and an escape from [[Jim Crow]] oppression. Michelle Obama's paternal grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr. migrated to Chicago from the Georgetown area. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Low Country from Chicago after retirement.<ref name="soil"/>

In 1989, the property was partly purchased by Daniel Thorne; it was co-owned by him and Frances Cheston Train, a daughter of Radcliffe Cheston.<!-- So? Who is that? --><ref name="socialregister"/> In 2019, Oscar Johnson Small II and his second wife Robbie Kephart bought the property.
