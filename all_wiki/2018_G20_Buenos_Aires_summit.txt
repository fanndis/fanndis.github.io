==Counter-summit==
The [[Latin American Council of Social Sciences]] (CLACSO) had organized a counter-summit, called the First World Forum of Critical Thinking, which took place in the week leading up to the G20 event.<ref>https://www.clacso.org.ar/conferencia2018/presentacion.php?s=1&idioma=en</ref> It was attended by other politicians such as former Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]], Bolivian vice president [[Álvaro García Linera]], former Colombian president [[Ernesto Samper]], and human rights activist [[Estela de Carlotto]]. At the event, former Argentine president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] criticised the economic policies of Mauricio Macri and the IMF loans that he has received.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2018/11/20/cfk-macri-merely-a-manager-of-policies-imposed-from-abroad|title= CFK: Macri merely a manager of policies imposed from abroad|author= |date= 20 November 2018|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref> Former Uruguayan president [[José Mujica]] was also invited, but declined to take part in the counter-summit to avoid damaging [[Argentina–Uruguay relations]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.batimes.com.ar/news/latin-america/jose-mujica-cancels-appearance-at-ba-speaking-event-with-cfk-dilma.phtml|title= José 'Pepe' Mujica cancels BA speaking event alongside CFK, Dilma|author= |date= 21 November 2018|publisher= Buenos Aires Times|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>

==Security==
The [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|previous summit]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany, met with huge protests, with cars set on fire and roads blocked by protesters. The 2018 summit had reinforced security, to prevent a repeat of those protests. Local left-wing organizations planned protests and called for foreign activists to join them.<ref name="security"/> The Argentine government, working alongside the others, is attempting to prevent the entry of troublemakers into the country, such as people with criminal charges or who have advocated for violent actions. Only peaceful protests will be allowed. Federal Security Minister [[Patricia Bullrich]] said that "We will not permit illegal acts. Those who want to cross the line will have to face the legal consequences".<ref name="security"/> 22,000 police and 700 security ministry agents will guard the event, working alongside the security services of the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Italy, Spain and others. An area of {{convert|12|km2}} around the {{interlanguage link|Costa Salguero Convention Centre|es|Centro Costa Salguero}} will be cordoned off, the public transportation network – including the [[Buenos Aires Metro|metro]] – will be shut down, and traffic along the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] will be halted. Friday, 30 November was declared a one-time [[public holiday]] day in the city of Buenos Aires, to prevent the traffic caused by people's daily activities, and residents were urged to leave the city for the long weekend.<ref>{{cite news |title=Argentinian government urges Buenos Aires residents to leave city for G20 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/28/argentina-g20-summit-buenos-aires-public-holiday-leave-town |accessdate=29 November 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 November 2018}}</ref> Media Minister {{interlanguage link|Hernán Lombardi|es}} reported that no infiltration by international terrorist groups had been detected, and the US government said that the remote location of Argentina would discourage international protesters from travelling to the country.<ref name="security">{{cite web |url= https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/g20-host-argentina-s-security-nightmare---unrest-and-anarchists-10952384|title= G20 host Argentina's security nightmare - unrest and anarchists|author= |date= 21 November  2018|publisher= Channel News Asia|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>

Two bomb attacks took place in the days before the summit. Judge [[Claudio Bonadio]], who was investigating former president [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] for embezzlement charges, was attacked in his home; his bodyguards stopped Marco Viola, who was arrested, and the bomb was dismantled by a police bomb squad. Anahi Esperanza Salcedo, who identifies as an [[Anarchism in Argentina|anarchist]] and a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]], tried to bomb the tomb of the late chief of police [[Ramón Lorenzo Falcón]] at [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], but her bomb went off early and she was hospitalized with injuries to her hand and face. Both attacks were made with [[improvised explosive device]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://en.mercopress.com/2018/11/15/buenos-aires-hit-by-two-bomb-attacks|title= Buenos Aires hit by two bomb attacks|author= |date= 15 November 2018|publisher= Merco Press|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref> After those events, the United Kingdom government lowered its terrorism alert for Buenos Aires from "very likely" to "likely".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.eldia.com/nota/2018-11-16-15-0-0-g20-ahora-reino-unido-bajo-el-riesgo-de-alerta-terrorista-politica-y-economia|title=G20: Ahora Reino Unido bajó el riesgo de alerta terrorista|trans-title= G20: the United Kingdom lowered the terrorist alert|language= Spanish|author= |date= 16 November 2018|publisher= El Día|accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>
