The Red Army Faction engaged in a series of bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, bank robberies and shoot-outs with police over the course of three decades. Their activity peaked in late 1977, which led to a national crisis that became known as the "[[German Autumn]]". The RAF has been held responsible for thirty-four deaths, including many secondary targets, such as chauffeurs and [[bodyguard]]s, as well as many injuries throughout its almost thirty years of activity. Although better-known, the RAF conducted fewer attacks than the [[Revolutionary Cells (German group)|Revolutionary Cells]], which is held responsible for 296 bomb attacks, arson and other attacks between 1973 and 1995.<ref>[http://www.im.nrw.de/sch/387.htm IM.NRW.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202084458/http://www.im.nrw.de/sch/387.htm |date=2 December 2008 }}, Innenministerium Nordrhein-Westfalen: Revolutionäre Zellen und Rote Zora.</ref>

Sometimes the group is talked about in terms of generations:
* the "first generation", which consisted of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof and others;
* the "second generation", after the majority of the first generation was arrested in 1972; and
* the "third generation" RAF, which existed in the 1980s and 1990s up to 1998, after the first generation died in [[Stammheim Prison|Stammheim maximum security prison]] in 1977.

On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the [[Reuters]] news agency, signed "RAF" with the submachine-gun red star, declaring that the group had dissolved.<ref name="rafinfo.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafinfo.de/archiv/raf/raf-20-4-98.php|title=RAF-Auflösungserklärung|language=German}}</ref> In 1999, after a robbery in [[Duisburg]], evidence pointing to Ernst-Volker Staub and Daniela Klette was found, causing an official investigation into a re-founding.<ref>Verfassungsschutzbericht Nordrhein-Westfalen 2001: [http://www.im.nrw.de/inn/doks/vs/z2001.pdf "Rote Armee Fraktion"], 2001, pp. 42 ff.

In total, the RAF killed 34 people,<ref>Scribner, Charity. "Buildings on Fire: The Situationist International and the Red Army Faction".

== Name ==

The usual translation into English is the Red Army ''Faction''; however, the founders wanted it not to reflect a [[splinter group]] but rather an embryonic militant unit that was embedded, in or part of, a wider communist workers' movement,<ref group=lower-alpha>In Leninist terminology a "fraction" is a subset of a larger communist movement. For example, the 12 July 1921 "Theses on the [http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/organization/comintern_and_germany.htm Structure of Communist Parties], submitted to the Third Congress of the Comintern" states that "to carry out daily party work every member should as a rule belong to a small working group, a committee, a commission, a fraction, or a cell." Cited in Louis Proyect, "The Comintern and the German Communist Party;" or the description of the "Bolshevik-Leninist Fraction" in the article [[Communist League (UK, 1932)]].</ref> i.e. a ''fraction'' of a whole.

The group always called itself the ''Rote Armee Fraktion'', never the Baader-Meinhof Group or Gang. The name refers to all incarnations of the organization: the "first generation" RAF, which consisted of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and others; the "second generation" RAF; and the "third generation" RAF, which existed in the 1980s and 90s. The terms "Baader-Meinhof Gang" and "Baader-Meinhof Group" were first used by the media and the government. The group never used these names to refer to itself, since it viewed itself as a co-founded group consisting of numerous members and not a group with two figureheads.

}}
The origins of the group can be traced back to the [[German student movement|student protest movement in West Germany]]. Industrialized nations in the late 1960s experienced [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social upheavals]] related to the maturing of the "[[baby boomers]]", the [[Cold War]], and the end of [[colonialism]]. Newly found [[youth culture|youth identity]] and issues such as [[racism]], [[women's liberation]], and [[anti-imperialism]] were at the forefront of [[left-wing politics]]. Many young people were alienated, from both their parents and the institutions of state. The historical legacy of [[Nazism]] drove a wedge between the generations and increased suspicion of [[authoritarian]] structures in society (some analysts see the same occurring in post-fascism Italy, giving rise to "[[Red Brigades|''Brigate Rosse'']]").<ref name="Townsend">Townshend, Charles.

The radicals regarded the [[Conservatism|conservative]] media as [[media bias|biased]]—at the time conservatives such as [[Axel Springer]], who was implacably opposed to student radicalism, owned and controlled the conservative media including all of the most influential mass-circulation tabloid newspapers. The emergence of the [[Grand Coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]] between the two main parties, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]], with former [[Nazi Party]] member [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] as chancellor, occurred in 1966. This horrified many on the left and was viewed as a monolithic, political [[marriage of convenience]] with pro-[[NATO]], pro-capitalist collusion on the part of the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] SPD. With about 90% of the [[Bundestag]] controlled by the coalition, an [[Ausserparlamentarische Opposition|Extra-Parliamentary Opposition]] (APO) was formed with the intent of generating protest and political activity outside of government.<ref>Harold Marcuse, [http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/publications/articles/1968.972.htm "The Revival of Holocaust Awareness in West Germany, Israel and the United States"].</ref> In 1972 a law was passed—the [[Berufsverbot#The 1972 Anti-Radical Decree|Radikalenerlass]]—that banned radicals or those with a "questionable" political persuasion from public sector jobs.<ref>Arthur B.

Some radicals used the supposed association of large parts of society with Nazism as an argument against any peaceful approaches:

The radicalized were, like many in the [[New Left]], influenced by:
* Sociological developments, pressure within the educational system in and outside Europe and the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}, together with the background of [[Counter-culture|counter-cultural movements]].
* The writings of [[Mao Zedong]] adapted to Western European conditions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

* Philosophers associated with the [[Frankfurt school]] ([[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Oskar Negt]] in particular<ref>''Walter Benjamin and the Red Army Faction'' – Irving Wohlfarth in Radical Philosophy 152</ref>) and associated [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] philosophers.<ref>Peter-Erwin Jansen, [http://negations.icaap.org/issues/98w/jansen_01.html "Student Movements in Germany, 1968–1984"], ''Negations'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20061009185623/http://www.icaap.org/list_journal.php?action=show_details&journal_id=11 E-journal]), No. 3, Fall 1998.</ref>

RAF founder [[Ulrike Meinhof]] had a long history in the Communist Party. [[Holger Meins]] had studied film and was a veteran of the Berlin revolt; his short feature ''How To Produce A Molotov Cocktail'' was seen by huge audiences. [[Jan Carl Raspe]] lived at the [[Kommune 2]]; [[Horst Mahler]] was an established lawyer but also at the center of the anti-[[Axel Springer AG|Springer]] revolt from the beginning. From their own personal experiences and assessments of the socio-economic situation they soon became more specifically influenced by [[Leninism]] and [[Maoism]], calling themselves "[[Marxist-Leninist]]" though they effectively added to or updated this ideological tradition. A contemporaneous critique of the Red Army Faction's view of the state, published in a pirate edition of ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'', ascribed to it "state-fetishism"—an ideologically obsessive misreading of bourgeois dynamics and the nature and role of the state in post-WWII societies, including West Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/red-army-faction-baader-meinhoff-critique-grossman|title="State-Fetishism": some remarks concerning the Red Army Faction, by A. Grossman|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>

It is claimed that property destruction during the [[Watts riots]] in the United States in 1965 influenced the practical and ideological approach of the RAF founders, as well as some of those in [[Situationist International|Situationist]] circles.<ref>Scribner, Charity. "Buildings on Fire: The Situationist International and the Red Army Faction". ''Grey Room'', Winter 2007, pp. 30–55.</ref>

Gramsci wrote on power, cultural, and ideological conflicts in society and institutions—real-time class struggles playing out in rapidly developing industrial [[nation states]] through interlinked areas of political behavior, Marcuse on [[coercion]] and [[hegemony]] in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication ("repressive tolerance") dispensed with the need for complete brute force in modern '[[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]'. His ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' was addressed to the restive students of the sixties. Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system. Both Gramsci and Marcuse came to the conclusion that the ideological underpinnings and the '[[Base and superstructure|superstructure]]' of society was vitally important in the understanding of class control (and acquiescence). This could perhaps be seen as an extension of Marx's work as he did not cover this area in detail. ''[[Das Kapital]]'', his mainly economic work, was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the [[Sovereign state|state]],<ref>Michael A. Lebowitz, ''Beyond Capital—Marx's Political Economy of the Working Class'', Palgrave 2003, p. 27. {{ISBN|978-0-333-96430-9}}.</ref> but his death prevented fulfillment of this.

[[File:Benno Ohnesorg Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Protest 1967.jpg|thumb|Benno Ohnesorg shot outside the Berlin Opera during a protest of the state visit of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].]]
Many of the radicals felt that Germany's [[Legislator|lawmakers]] were continuing authoritarian policies and the public's apparent acquiescence was seen as a continuation of the indoctrination the Nazis had pioneered in society ([[Volksgemeinschaft]]). The Federal Republic was exporting arms to African dictatorships, which was seen as supporting the [[Indochina Wars|war in Southeast Asia]] and engineering the remilitarization of Germany with the U.S.-led entrenchment against the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations.

Ongoing events further catalyzed the situation. Protests turned into riots on 2 June 1967, when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, visited [[West Berlin]]. There were protesters but also hundreds of supporters of the Shah{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, as well as a group of fake supporters armed with wooden staves, there to disturb the normal course of the visit. These extremists beat the protesters. After a day of angry protests by exiled Iranian radical Marxists, a group widely supported by German students, the Shah visited the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Berlin Opera]], where a crowd of German student protesters gathered. During the opera house demonstrations, German student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a police officer while attending his first protest rally. The officer, [[Karl-Heinz Kurras]], was acquitted in a subsequent trial. It was later discovered that Kurras had been a member of the [[Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin|West Berlin communist party ''SEW'']] and had also worked for the [[Stasi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/hitchens-guerrillas200908?currentPage=2|title=Christopher Hitchens on The Baader Meinhof Complex|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> though there is no indication that Kurras' killing of Ohnesorg was under anyone's, including the Stasi's, orders.

Along with perceptions of state and [[police brutality]], and widespread opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], Ohnesorg's death galvanized many young Germans and became a rallying point for the West German [[New Left]]. The Berlin [[2 June Movement]], a militant-Anarchist group, later took its name to honor the date of Ohnesorg's death.

On 2 April 1968 [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]], joined by [[Thorwald Proll]] and [[Horst Söhnlein]], set fire to two department stores in [[Frankfurt]] as a protest against the Vietnam war. They were arrested two days later.

On 11 April 1968 [[Rudi Dutschke]], a leading spokesman for protesting students, was shot in the head in an assassination attempt by the [[Far right|right-wing]] sympathizer [[Josef Bachmann]]. Although badly injured, Dutschke returned to political activism with the [[German Green Party]] before his death in a bathtub in 1979, as a consequence of his injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kingsreview.co.uk/closed-material-procedures-rudi-dutschke-and-kings/ |title=Closed Material Procedures, Rudi Dutschke and King's|publisher=kingsreview.co.uk |date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

Axel Springer's [[populism|populist]] newspaper ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'', which had run headlines such as "Stop Dutschke now!", was accused of being the chief culprit in inciting the shooting. Meinhof commented, "If one sets a car on fire, that is a criminal offence. If one sets hundreds of cars on fire, that is political action."<ref>Cited by Joshua Keating, "Has Germany's car arson wave come to America?"

All four of the defendants charged with arson and endangering human life were convicted, for which they were sentenced to three years in prison. In June 1969, however, they were temporarily paroled under an [[amnesty]] for [[political prisoner]]s, but in November of that year, the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (Bundesverfassungsgericht) demanded that they return to custody. Only Horst Söhnlein complied with the order; the rest went underground and made their way to France, where they stayed for a time in a house owned by prominent French journalist and revolutionary, [[Régis Debray]], famous for his friendship with [[Che Guevara]] and the ''[[foco]]'' theory of guerrilla warfare. Eventually they made their way to [[Italy]], where the lawyer Mahler visited them and encouraged them to return to Germany with him to form an underground guerrilla group.

The Red Army Faction was formed with the intention of complementing the plethora of revolutionary and radical groups across West Germany and Europe, as a more [[class consciousness|class conscious]] and determined force compared with some of its contemporaries. The members and supporters were already associated with the '[[Revolutionary Cells (German group)|Revolutionary Cells]]' and [[2 June Movement]] as well as radical currents and phenomena such as the [[Socialist Patients' Collective]], [[Kommune 1]] and the [[Situationist International|Situationists]].

Baader was arrested again in April 1970, but on 14 May 1970 he was freed by Meinhof and others. Less than a month later, Gudrun Ensslin would write an article in a West Berlin underground paper by the name of ''Agit883 (Magazine for Agitation and Social Practice)'', demanding for a call to arms and a building of the Red Army. The article ended with the words, "Develop the class struggles. Organize the proletariat. Start the armed resistance!"<ref>{{cite web|title=A Terrorist Call for "Building a Red Army" (June 5, 1970)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=897|website=German History in Documents and Images|publisher=German Historical Institute|accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref> Baader, Ensslin, Mahler, and Meinhof then went to [[Jordan]], where they trained with [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) guerrillas<ref name="Townsend" />{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}} and looked to the Palestinian cause for inspiration and guidance. But RAF organization and outlook were also partly modeled on the [[Uruguay]]an [[Tupamaros]] movement, which had developed as an urban resistance movement, effectively inverting [[Che Guevara]]'s Mao-like concept of a peasant or rural-based [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] and instead situating the struggle in the [[metropole]] or cities.

Many members of the RAF operated through a single contact or only knew others by their codenames. Actions were carried out by [[Covert cell|active units]] called '[[commando]]s', with trained members being supplied by a [[quartermaster]] in order to carry out their mission. For more long-term or core [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]] members, isolated cell-like organization was absent or took on a more flexible form.

In 1969 the Brazilian revolutionary [[Carlos Marighella]] published his ''[[Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla]]''.<ref>Carlos Marighella, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marighella-carlos/1969/06/minimanual-urban-guerrilla/index.htm ''Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla''], at [[marxists.org]]</ref> He described the urban guerrilla as:

The importance of [[small arms]] training, [[sabotage]], [[Confiscation|expropriation]], and a substantial [[safehouse]]/support base among the urban population was stressed in Marighella's guide. This publication was an antecedent to Meinhof's 'The Urban Guerrilla Concept' and has subsequently influenced many guerrilla and [[Insurgency|insurgent]] groups around the globe.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/index-history.htm Marxists.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822235917/http://www.marxists.org/archive/index-history.htm |date=22 August 2007 }}, Marxists internet archive.

That said, they shied away from overt collaboration with [[communist state]]s, arguing along the lines of the Chinese side in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] that the Soviet Union and its European satellite states had become traitors to the communist cause by, in effect if not in rhetoric, giving the United States a free pass in their exploitation of Third World populations and support of "useful" Third World dictators. Nevertheless, RAF members did receive intermittent support and sanctuary over the border in [[East Germany]] during the 1980s.

=== Anti-imperialism and public support ===
{{quote|The Baader-Meinhof Gang drew a measure of support that violent leftists in the United States, like the [[Weather Underground]], never enjoyed. A poll at the time showed that a quarter of West Germans under forty felt sympathy for the gang and one-tenth said they would hide a gang member from the police. Prominent intellectuals spoke up for the gang's righteousness (as) Germany even into the 1970s was still a guilt-ridden society. When the gang started robbing banks, newscasts compared its members to Bonnie and Clyde. (Andreas) Baader, a charismatic action man indulged in the imagery, telling people that his favourite movies were ''Bonnie and Clyde'', which had recently come out, and ''The Battle of Algiers''. The pop poster of Che Guevara hung on his wall, (while) he paid a designer to make a Red Army Faction logo, a drawing of a machine gun against a red star.| [[Stefan Aust]], author of ''[[Der Baader Meinhof Komplex]]''<ref name="NYTAust" />}}

When they returned to West Germany, they began what they called an "[[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic]] struggle", with [[Bank robbery|bank robberies]] to raise money and bomb attacks against U.S. military facilities, German police stations, and buildings belonging to the Axel Springer press empire. In 1970, a manifesto authored by Meinhof used the name "RAF" and the [[red star]] logo with a [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] [[submachine gun]] for the first time.<ref>[http://www.berlin1969.com/#/troubled-times/3998813 "Build Up the Red Army!"], originally published in German in ''883'' magazine, 5 June 1970.</ref>

After an intense manhunt, Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, Meins, and Raspe were eventually caught and arrested in June 1972.

== Custody and the Stammheim trial ==
[[File:JustizvollzugsanstaltStammheim.jpg|thumb|right|Stammheim Prison]]
After the arrest of the protagonists of the first generation of the RAF, they were held in [[solitary confinement]] in the newly constructed high security [[Stammheim Prison]] north of [[Stuttgart]]. When Ensslin devised an "info system" using [[pseudonym|aliases]] for each member (names deemed to have allegorical significance from ''[[Moby Dick]]''),<ref>Vague, T., ''The Red Army Faction Story 1963–1994'', Edinburgh 1994, p. 51</ref> the four prisoners were able to communicate, circulating letters with the help of their defense [[counsel]].

To protest against their treatment by authorities, they went on several coordinated [[hunger strike]]s; eventually, they were force-fed.
Holger Meins died of self-induced starvation on 9 November 1974. After public protests, their conditions were somewhat improved by the authorities.

The so-called second generation of the RAF emerged at that time, consisting of sympathizers independent of the inmates. This became clear when, on 27 February 1975, [[Peter Lorenz]], the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] candidate for mayor of Berlin, was kidnapped by the [[2 June Movement]] (allied to the RAF) as part of pressure to secure the release of several other detainees. Since none of these were on trial for murder, the state agreed, and those inmates (and later Lorenz himself) were released.

On 24 April 1975, the [[West German embassy siege|West German embassy in Stockholm was seized]] by members of the RAF; two of the hostages were murdered as the German government under Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] refused to give in to their demands. Two of the hostage-takers died from injuries they suffered when the explosives they planted mysteriously detonated later that night.

On 21 May 1975, the Stammheim trial of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and Raspe began, named after the district in [[Stuttgart]] where it took place. The Bundestag had earlier changed the Code of Criminal Procedure so that several of the attorneys who were accused of serving as links between the inmates and the RAF's second generation could be excluded.

On 9 May 1976, Ulrike Meinhof was found dead in her prison cell, hanging from a rope made from jail towels. An investigation concluded that she had hanged herself, a result hotly contested at the time, triggering a plethora of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Other theories suggest that she took her life because she was being ostracized by the rest of the group. There is, however, evidence to the contrary of this hypothesis.

During the trial, more attacks took place. One of these was on 7 April 1977, when Federal Prosecutor [[Siegfried Buback]], his driver, and his bodyguard were shot and killed by two RAF members while waiting at a red traffic light. Buback, who had been a Nazi member during WWII, was considered by RAF as one of the key persons for their trial. Among other things, two years earlier, while being interviewed by ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine, he stated that "Persons like Baader don't deserve a fair trial."<ref>''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', issue 24, 1975{{full citation needed|date=June 2020}}</ref> In February 1976, when interviewed by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' he stated that "We do not need regulation of our jurisdiction, national security survives thanks to people like me and Herold (chief of BKA), who always find the right way..."<ref>Interview with Attorney-General Siegfried Buback in: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 16 February 1976</ref>

Eventually, on 28 April 1977, the trial's 192nd day, the three remaining defendants were convicted of several murders, more attempted murders, and of forming a terrorist organization; they were sentenced to life imprisonment.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

=== Security measures ===
A new section of [[Stammheim Prison]] was built especially for the RAF and was considered one of the most secure prison blocks around the world at the time. The prisoners were transferred there in 1975 (three years after their arrest). The roof and the courtyard were covered with steel mesh. During the night, the precinct was illuminated by fifty-four spotlights and twenty-three neon bulbs. Special military forces, including snipers, guarded the roof. Four hundred police officers along with the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] patrolled the building. The mounted police officers rotated on a double shift. One hundred more [[GSG 9|GSG-9]] tactical police officers reinforced the police during the trial while [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] detectives guarded the front of the court area. Finally, helicopters overflew the area.<ref name="Ditfurth" />{{RP|549}}

Accredited media correspondents had to pass a police road block 400 meters from the court. The police noted their data and the number-plate and photographed their cars. After that they had to pass three verification audits, and finally they were undressed and two judicial officials thoroughly searched their bodies. They were allowed to keep only a pencil and a notepad inside the court. Their personal items including their identity papers were withheld by the authorities during the trial. Every journalist could attend the trial only twice (two days). ''[[The Times]]'' questioned the possibility whether a fair trial could be conducted under these circumstances which involved siege-like conditions. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' wondered whether that atmosphere anticipated "the condemnation of the defendants who were allegedly responsible for the emergency measures."<ref>''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 19 May 1976{{full citation needed|date=June 2020}}</ref>

During visits from lawyers and, more rarely, relatives (friends were not allowed), three jailers would observe the conversations the prisoners had with their visitors. The prisoners were not allowed to meet each other inside the prison, until late-1975 when a regular meeting time was established (30 minutes, twice per day), during which they were guarded.

=== Trial ===
The judges and their pasts are considered important by supporters of the accused. Judge Weiss (Mahler's trial) had judged Joachim Raese (president of the Third Reich's court) as innocent seven times. When he threatened Meinhof that she would be put into a glass cage she answered caustically, "So you are threatening me with Eichmann's cage, fascist?" ([[Adolf Eichmann]] who was an ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' in the [[SS]], was held inside a glass cage during his trial in Israel). [[Siegfried Buback]], the RAF's main trial judge in Stammheim, had been a Nazi Party member. Along with Federal Prosecutor Heinrich Wunder (who served as senior government official in the Ministry of Defense), Buback had ordered the arrest of [[Rudolf Augstein]] and other journalists regarding the [[Spiegel scandal|''Spiegel'' affair]] in 1962. Theodor Prinzing was accused by defense attorney [[Otto Schily]] of having been appointed arbitrarily, displacing other judges.<ref name="Ditfurth" />{{RP|547}}

At several points in the Stammheim trial, microphones were turned off while defendants were speaking. They were often expelled from the hall, and other actions were taken. It was later revealed that the conversation they had between themselves as well as with their attorneys were recorded. Finally it was reported by both the defendants' attorneys and some of the prison's doctors, that the physical and psychological state of the prisoners held in solitary confinement and white cells was such that they couldn't attend the long trial days and defend themselves appropriately. By the time the Stammheim trial began in early-1975, some of the prisoners had already been in solitary confinement for three years.<ref name="Ditfurth">{{Cite book| last = Ditfurth | first = Jutta | title = Ulrike Meinhof: Die Biography | publisher = Ullstein | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3550087288 }}</ref>

Two former members of the RAF, Karl-Heinz Ruhland and Gerhard Müller, testified under BKA's orders, as revealed later. Their statements were often contradictory, something that was also commented on in the newspapers. Ruhland himself later reported to ''Stern'' that his deposition was prepared in cooperation with police.<ref>''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' Issue 2, 1973{{full citation needed|date=June 2020}}</ref> Müller was reported to "break" during the third hunger strike in the winter of 1974–1975 which lasted 145 days. The prosecution offered him immunity for the murder of officer Norbert Schmidt in Hamburg (1971), and blamed Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin, and Raspe instead. He was eventually freed and relocated to the US after getting a new identity and 500,000 [[Deutschmark]]s.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

==== Lawyers' arrests ====
The government hastily approved several special laws for use during the Stammheim trial. Lawyers were excluded from trial for the first time since 1945, after being accused of various inappropriate actions, such as helping to form criminal organizations (Section 129, Criminal Law). The authorities invaded and checked the lawyers' offices for possible incriminating material. Minister of Justice [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]] stated proudly that no other Western state had such extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from a trial. [[Klaus Croissant]], [[Hans-Christian Ströbele]], Kurt Groenewold, who had been working preparing for the trial for three years, were expelled the second day of the trial. On 23 June 1975, Croissant, Ströbele (who had already been expelled), and Mary Becker were arrested, and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys' offices and homes, seizing documents and files. Ströbele and Croissant were remanded and held for four and eight weeks respectively. Croissant had to pay 80,000 Deutschmarks, report weekly to a police station, and had his transport and identity papers seized.<ref name="Ditfurth" />{{RP|545–572}}

The defense lawyers and prisoners were not the only ones affected by measures adopted for the RAF-trial. On 26 November 1974 an unprecedented mobilization by police and [[GSG 9|GSG-9]] units, to arrest 23 suspected RAF members, included invasion of dozens of homes, left-wing bookstores, and meeting places, and arrests were made. No guerrillas were found.{{cn|date=June 2020}} BKA's chief, Horst Herold stated that despite the fact that "large-scale operations usually don't bring practical results, the impression of the crowd is always a considerable advantage."<ref>Bakker Schut: Stammheim. p. 569</ref>

On 16 February 1979 Croissant was arrested (on the accusation of supporting criminal organization&nbsp;— section 129) after France denied his request for political asylum, and was sentenced to a prison term of two and half years to be served in [[Stammheim Prison|Stammheim prison]].

=== Defense strategy ===
The general approach by defendants and their attorneys was to highlight the political purpose and characteristics of RAF.

On 13 and 14 January 1976 the defendants readied their testimony (about 200 pages), in which they analyzed the role of imperialism and its fight against the revolutionary movements in the countries of the "third world". They also expounded the fascistization of West Germany and its role as an imperialistic state (alliance with the U.S. over Vietnam). Finally they talked about the task of urban guerrillas and undertook the political responsibility for the bombing attacks. Finally their lawyers (following Ulrike Meinhof's proposal) requested that the accused be officially regarded as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].<ref name="Ditfurth" />

On 4 May (five days before Meinhof's death) the four defendants demanded to provide data about the Vietnam War. They claimed that since the military intervention in Vietnam by the U.S. (and indirectly, the FRG), had violated international law, the U.S. military bases in West Germany were justifiable targets of international retaliation. They requested several politicians (like [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Helmut Schmidt]]) as well as some former U.S. agents (who were willing to testify) to be called as witnesses.

Later when their requests were rejected, U.S. agents Barton Osbourne (ex-CIA, ex-member of the [[Phoenix Program]]), G. Peck (NSA), and Gary Thomas gave extensive interviews (organized by defense lawyers) on 23 June 1976 where they explained how FRG support was crucial for U.S. operations in Vietnam. Peck concluded that the RAF "was the response to criminal aggression of the U.S. government in Indochina and the assistance of the German government. The real terrorist was my government."<ref>texte der Raf pp. 496–503</ref> Thomas presented data about the joint operations of FRG and U.S. secret services in Eastern Europe. He had also observed the Stammheim trial and referred to a CIA instructor teaching them how to make a murder look like a suicide. These statements were confirmed by the CIA case officer [[Philip Agee]].<ref name="Ditfurth" />

== Acts of terrorism ==
{{One source|section|date=December 2017}}
The Baader-Meinhof gang has been associated with various acts of terrorism since their founding. The first act of terrorism attributed to the group after the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] had been killed by a policeman in 1967 was the bombing of the Kaufhaus Schneider department store. On 2 April 1968, affiliates of the group firebombed the store and caused an estimated US$200,000 in property damage. Prominent members of the bombing included [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Gudrun Ensslin]], two of the founders of the Baader-Meinhof gang. The bombs detonated at midnight when no one was in the store, thus no one was injured. As the bombs ignited, Gudrun Ensslin was at a nearby payphone, yelling to the [[German Press Agency]], "This is a political act of revenge."{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

On 11 May 1972, the Baader-Meinhof gang placed three pipe bombs at a United States headquarters in [[Frankfurt]]. The bombing resulted in the death of a U.S officer and the injury of 13 other people. The stated reason for the bombing was a political statement in protest of U.S imperialism, specifically, a protest of US mining of North Vietnam harbours.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

On 19 May 1972, members of the Baader-Meinhof gang armed six bombs in the [[Axel Springer Verlag]] in Hamburg. Only three of the five bombs exploded, but it was enough to injure 36 people.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bahnsen|first=Uwe|title=Der Tag, an dem die RAF Axel Springer angriff|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article106330282/Der-Tag-an-dem-die-RAF-Axel-Springer-angriff.html|language=german|date=17 May 2012|newspaper=Die Welt}}</ref>

On 24 May 1972, just two weeks after the bombing of the United States headquarters in Frankfurt, the group set off a car bomb at the IDHS (Intelligence Data Handling Service) Building at [[Campbell Barracks]] in [[Heidelberg]]. The bombing resulted in the deaths of Specialists Charles Peck and Ron Woodward and Captain Clyde Bonner and the injury of five others.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

On 10 November 1974, the group killed [[Günter von Drenkmann]], the president of Germany's superior court of justice. The killing occurred after a string of events that led to a failed kidnapping by the 2 June Movement, a group that splintered off the Baader-Meinhof group after the death of [[Holger Meins]] by hunger strike in prison.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Starting in February 1975 and continuing through March 1975, the 2 June Movement kidnapped [[Peter Lorenz]], who at the time, was the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic]] candidate in the race for the mayor of West Berlin. In exchange for the release of Lorenz, the group demanded that many Baader-Meinhof and 2 June Movement members that were imprisoned for reasons other than violence be released from jail. The government obliged and released several of these members for the safe release of Lorenz.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

On 24 April 1975, six members affiliated with the Baader-Meinhof group seized the West German Embassy in Stockholm. The group took hostages and set the building to explode. They demanded the release of several imprisoned members of the Baader-Meinhof gang. The government refused the request, which led to the execution of two of the hostages. A few of the bombs that were intended to blow up the embassy prematurely detonated, which resulted in the death of two of the six Baader-Meinhof affiliates. The other four members eventually surrendered to the authorities.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In May 1975, several British intelligence reports circulated that stated that the Baader-Meinhof gang had stolen [[Mustard Gas|mustard gas]] from a joint U.S. and British storage facility. The reports also indicated that the Baader-Meinhof gang had intended to use the stolen gas in German cities. It eventually turned out that the mustard gas canisters were merely misplaced; however, the Baader-Meinhof gang still successfully capitalized on the news by frightening several different agencies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Toxic terror : assessing terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|others=Tucker, Jonathan B.|isbn=9780262201285|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=42421029}} {{Page needed|date=December 2017}}</ref>

During the early 1980s, German and French newspapers reported that the police had raided a Baader-Meinhof gang safe house in Paris and had found a makeshift laboratory that contained flasks full of ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', which makes [[botulinum toxin]]. These reports were later found to be incorrect; no such lab was ever found.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McAdams|first1=David|last2=Kornblet|first2=Sarah|editor1-last=Pilch|editor1-first=Richard F.|editor2-last=Zilinskas|editor2-first=Raymond A.|title=Encyclopedia of Bioterrorism Defense|date=15 July 2011|publisher=Wiley-Liss|isbn=9780471686781|chapter=Baader-Meinhof Group (OR Baader-Meinhof Gang|doi=10.1002/0471686786.ebd0012.pub2}}</ref>

== German Autumn ==
{{Main|German Autumn}}
On 30 July 1977, [[Jürgen Ponto]], the head of [[Dresdner Bank]], was shot and killed in front of his house in [[Oberursel]] in a botched kidnapping.<ref>Gretel Spitzer, ''Cartridges used to kill banker found by police'', [[The Times]], 5 August 1977</ref> Those involved were [[Brigitte Mohnhaupt]], [[Christian Klar]], and [[Susanne Albrecht]], the sister of Ponto's goddaughter.

Following the convictions, [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]], a former officer of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] who was then President of the German Employers' Association (and thus one of the most powerful industrialists in West Germany) was abducted in a violent kidnapping. On 5 September 1977, Schleyer's convoy was stopped by the kidnappers reversing a car into the path of Schleyer's vehicle, causing the Mercedes in which he was being driven to crash. Once the convoy was stopped, five masked assailants immediately shot and killed three policemen and the driver and took Schleyer hostage. One of the group (Sieglinde Hofmann) produced her weapon from a pram she was pushing down the road.<ref>Patricia Clough, ''Four die in kidnap of German industrialist'', The Times, 6 September 1977</ref>

A letter was then received by the federal government, demanding the release of eleven detainees, including those in Stammheim. A crisis committee was formed in [[Bonn]], headed by Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]], which, instead of acceding, resolved to employ delaying tactics to give the police time to discover Schleyer's location. At the same time, a total communication ban was imposed on the prison inmates, who were now allowed visits only from government officials and the prison chaplain.

The crisis dragged on for more than a month, while the ''[[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Bundeskriminalamt]]'' carried out its biggest investigation to date. Matters escalated when, on 13 October 1977, [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] from [[Palma de Mallorca]] to [[Frankfurt]] was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]]. A group of four [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]] members took control of the plane (which was named ''Landshut''). The leader introduced himself to the passengers as "Captain Mahmud" who would be later identified as [[:de:Zohair_Youssif_Akache|Zohair Youssef Akache]]. When the plane landed in Rome for refueling, he issued the same demands as the Schleyer kidnappers, plus the release of two Palestinians held in Turkey and payment of US$15 million.

The Bonn crisis team again decided not to give in. The plane flew on via [[Larnaca]], then [[Dubai]], and then to [[Aden]], where flight captain Jürgen Schumann, whom the hijackers deemed not cooperative enough, was brought before an improvised "revolutionary tribunal" and executed on 16 October. His body was dumped on the runway. The aircraft again took off, flown by the co-pilot Jürgen Vietor, this time headed for [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]].

A high-risk rescue operation was led by [[Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski]], then undersecretary in the chancellor's office, who had been secretly flown in from Bonn. At five past midnight ([[Central European Time|CET]]) on 18 October, the plane was stormed in a seven-minute assault by [[GSG 9]], an elite unit of the German federal police. All four hijackers were shot; three of them died on the spot. None of the passengers were seriously hurt and Wischnewski was able to phone Schmidt and tell the Bonn crisis team that the operation had been a success.

=== "Stammheim Death Night" ===

[[File:Grabstätte Baader, Raspe, Ensslin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Burial site of Baader, Raspe and Ensslin]]

After the successful conclusion of the Landshut hostage crisis was announced in the late evening of 17 October, all the RAF members incarcerated in Stammheim committed suicide during the following night. Their lawyer, Arndt Müller, had smuggled pistols into the prison. Andreas Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe shot themselves with these weapons while Gudrun Ensslin hanged herself. [[Irmgard Möller]] tried to kill herself with a knife, but survived severely injured. The suicides went unnoticed until early next morning. Doctors were rushed in. Baader and Ensslin were already dead when found. Raspe was still alive and moved to the hospital where he died soon after. Möller recovered after being brought to a hospital.<ref name=terh>Terhoeven(2013), pp. 17-21.</ref>

The suicide of the imprisoned RAF leadership led to a significant media echo. The coordinated attempt sparked numerous [[conspiracy theories]]. It was alleged that the RAF members did not kill themselves, but instead were killed by the German authorities, the [[Federal Intelligence Service|BND]], [[CIA]], the United States and [[NATO]]. These theories were spread by RAF supporters and sympathizers; some of them even taken up by the mainstream press. Available evidence shows that these suicides were planned and prepared for a long time by the RAF members.<ref name=terh/><ref>Kraushaar (2006), p.53.</ref>

On the very same day, Hanns-Martin Schleyer was shot to death by his captors en route to [[Mulhouse]], France. On 19 October, Schleyer's kidnappers announced that he had been "executed" and pinpointed his location. His body was recovered later that day in the trunk of a green [[Audi 100]] on Rue [[Charles Péguy]]. The French newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' received a letter declaring:
{{quote|After 43 days we have ended Hanns-Martin Schleyer's pitiful and corrupt existence... His death is meaningless to our pain and our rage... The struggle has only begun. Freedom through armed, anti-imperialist struggle.}}

== RAF since the 1980s ==
The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in late December 1991 was a serious blow to Leninist groups, but well into the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name RAF. Among these were the killing of Ernst Zimmermann, CEO of [[MTU Aero Engines]], a German engineering company; another bombing at the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force's]] [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (near [[Frankfurt]]), which targeted the base commander and killed two bystanders; a [[car bomb]] attack that killed [[Siemens]] executive [[Karl Heinz Beckurts|Karl-Heinz Beckurts]] and his driver; and the shooting of [[Gerold von Braunmühl]], a leading official at [[German Foreign Office|Germany's foreign ministry]].
On 30 November 1989, [[Deutsche Bank]] chairman [[Alfred Herrhausen]] was killed with a highly complex bomb when his car triggered a photo sensor in [[Bad Homburg]]. On 1 April 1991, [[Detlev Karsten Rohwedder]], leader of the government ''[[Treuhand]]'' organization responsible for the privatization of the [[East Germany|East German]] state economy, was shot and killed. The assassins of Zimmermann, von Braunmühl, Herrhausen, and Rohwedder were never reliably identified.

After [[German reunification]] in 1990, it was confirmed that the RAF had received financial and logistic support from the [[Stasi]], the security and intelligence organization of [[East Germany]], which had given several members (who had chosen to leave the group) shelter and new identities. This was already generally suspected at the time.<ref name="Schmeidel">Schmeidel, John.

In 1992, the German government assessed that the RAF's main field of engagement now was missions to release imprisoned RAF members. To weaken the organization further the government declared that some RAF inmates would be released if the RAF refrained from violent attacks in the future. Subsequently, the RAF announced their intention to "de-escalate" and refrain from significant activity.

The last action taken by the RAF took place in 1993 with a bombing of a newly built prison in [[Weiterstadt]] by overcoming the officers on duty and planting explosives. Although no one was seriously injured, this operation caused property damage amounting to 123 million Deutschmarks (over 50 million euros).

The last big action against the RAF took place on 27 June 1993. A ''[[Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz|Verfassungsschutz]]'' (internal secret service) agent named [[Klaus Steinmetz]] had infiltrated the RAF. As a result, [[Birgit Hogefeld]] and [[Wolfgang Grams]] were arrested in [[Bad Kleinen]]. Grams and [[GSG 9]] officer [[Michael Newrzella]] died during the mission. Due to a number of operational mistakes involving the various police services, German Minister of the Interior [[Rudolf Seiters]] took responsibility and resigned from his post.

=== Dissolution ===
On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the [[Reuters]] news agency, signed "RAF" with the machine-gun red star, declaring the group dissolved:

{{quote|Almost 28 years ago, on 14 May 1970, the RAF arose in a campaign of liberation. Today we end this project.
