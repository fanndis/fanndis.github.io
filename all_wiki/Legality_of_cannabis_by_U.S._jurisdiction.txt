{{Legality of cannabis by US state}}
{{short description|Differences in laws surrounding American cannabis by state and territory}}
In the [[United States]], the use and possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is illegal under federal law for any purpose, by way of the [[Controlled Substances Act|Controlled Substances Act of 1970]]. Under the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I substance, determined to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use – thereby prohibiting even medical use of the drug.<ref>{{citation|title=State-By-State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.mpp.org/issues/medical-marijuana/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws/state-by-state-medical-marijuana-laws-report/|publisher=Marijuana Policy Project|date=December 2016}}</ref> At the state level, however, policies regarding the [[Medical cannabis|medical]] and [[Recreational drug use|recreational]] use of cannabis vary greatly, and in many states conflict significantly with federal law.

The [[Medical cannabis in the United States|medical use of cannabis]] is legalized, with a doctor's recommendation, in 35 states, four out of five permanently inhabited [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]], and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].<ref name="NCSL MMJ">{{cite web|date=November 4, 2020|title=State Medical Marijuana Laws|url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx|url-status=live|accessdate=July 3, 2018|publisher=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]]}}</ref> Thirteen other states have laws that limit [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in [[cannabidiol]] (CBD), a non-[[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] component of cannabis.<ref name="NCSL MMJ" /> Although cannabis remains a [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I drug]], the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] prohibits federal prosecution of individuals complying with state medical cannabis laws.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|date=June 13, 2017|title=Jeff Sessions personally asked Congress to let him prosecute medical-marijuana providers|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/13/jeff-sessions-personally-asked-congress-to-let-him-prosecute-medical-marijuana-providers/|url-status=live|url-access=limited|accessdate=December 31, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/y0Ps0|archive-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>

The [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|recreational use of cannabis]] is legalized in 15 states, the [[Cannabis in Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the [[Cannabis in the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]], and [[Cannabis in Guam|Guam]].

Although the use of cannabis remains federally illegal, some of its derivative compounds have been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for prescription use. [[Cannabinoid]] drugs which have received FDA approval are Marinol ([[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]]), Syndros (THC), Cesamet ([[nabilone]]), and Epidiolex ([[cannabidiol]]). For non-prescription use, cannabidiol derived from [[hemp|industrial hemp]] is legal at the federal level, but legality and enforcement varies by state.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hudak|first1=John|date=December 14, 2018|title=The Farm Bill, hemp legalization and the status of CBD: An explainer|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225163555/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/12/14/the-farm-bill-hemp-and-cbd-explainer/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|accessdate=June 3, 2019|publisher=[[The Brookings Institution]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Timothy|date=May 6, 2019|title=CBD Is Wildly Popular.
