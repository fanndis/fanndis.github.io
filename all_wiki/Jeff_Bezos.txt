}}Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked at [[D. E. Shaw & Co.|D.&nbsp;E. Shaw]] and again during the early years of Amazon. He described this [[Lebensphilosophie|life philosophy]] by stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/1999/03/bezos-3|title=The Inner Bezos|last=Bayers|first=Chip|magazine=Wired|accessdate=March 7, 2018|archive-date=March 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320200110/https://www.wired.com/1999/03/bezos-3/|url-status=live}}</ref> During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.<ref name="Inside the Mind of Jeff Bezos"/> To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the [[mantra]] "Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need to [[Economies of scale|scale]] its operations to produce market dominance.<ref name="Amazon.com {{!}} History & Facts" /> He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of [[dividend]]s.<ref name="fastcompany.com" />

Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "[[work–life balance]]" because he believes balance implies that you can have one and not the other.

According to BBC, Bezos's top security staffer, [[Gavin de Becker]], "linked the hack to the ''Washington Post''{{'}}s coverage of the murder of Saudi writer [[Jamal Khashoggi]] at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul." Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the ''Washington Post'', owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia 'hacked Amazon boss's phone', says investigator|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47763179|publisher=BBC News|date=March 31, 2019|accessdate=May 9, 2019|archive-date=April 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411133518/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47763179|url-status=live}}</ref>
