'''James Chuter Ede''', '''Baron Chuter-Ede''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|PC|DL|JP}} (11 September 1882 – 11 November 1965), was a British teacher, trade unionist and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician. He served as [[Home Secretary]] under Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] from 1945 to 1951, becoming the longest-serving Home Secretary of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Chuter Ede was born in [[Epsom]], Surrey, the son of James Ede, a [[grocer]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hermiston |first=Roger |title=All Behind You, Winston – Churchill's Great Coalition, 1940–45 |year=2016 |publisher=Aurum Press |location=London |page=39 |isbn=978-1-78131-664-1}}</ref> of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] religious convictions, and his wife Agnes Mary (née Chuter). He was educated at Epsom National School, [[The Ashcombe School|Dorking High School for Boys]], Battersea Pupil Teachers' Centre, and [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], where he studied natural sciences. Either through his family background or by a decision when a student, he became a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], and his religion consumed much of his time and effort later in life.<ref name=hart>{{cite journal |last=Hart |first=Stephen|title=James Chuter Ede - a Model Unitarian Overlooked |year= 2020 |journal=Transactions of the Unitarian Historical Society |volume=27 |issue=2}}</ref>

He then worked as a teacher, becoming an assistant master at council elementary schools in [[Surrey]] from 1905 to 1914, mainly in [[Mortlake]].<ref>Jeffreys, Kevin, [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/32414 "Ede, James Chuter Chuter-, Baron Chuter-Ede (1882–1965)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008. Retrieved 19 April 2018 {{subscription}}</ref> He had to resign this post in 1914, when he stood for election to [[Surrey County Council]], and did not work as a teacher again.<ref name=hart/>

During the [[First World War]] he served in the [[East Surrey Regiment]] and [[Royal Engineers]], reaching the rank of [[Acting (rank)|Acting]]  [[Regimental Sergeant Major]]. After the war he was active within the [[National Union of Teachers]].

==Political career==
Initially a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], he became a member in 1908 of [[Epsom Urban District Council]] and in 1914 of Surrey County Council. During [[World War I]] he moved to the Labour Party.  He was charter mayor of [[Epsom and Ewell]] in 1937.

After fighting [[Epsom (UK Parliament constituency)|Epsom]] in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Mitcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitcham]], at [[1923 Mitcham by-election|a by-election]] in March 1923. However, he lost the seat in December at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]]. He returned to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], for the [[Tyneside]] seat of [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]], but was defeated again at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 election]]. He was re-elected at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], and held the seat until his retirement from the Commons at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. During the 1930s, he became the Labour Party's main specialist in the field of education, following [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], who had encouraged Ede by appointing him to chair a government committee on private schools.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barker |first=Rodney |date=1972 |title=Education and Politics, 1900-1951 |publisher=Oxford UP}}</ref>

In the wartime coalition he held junior ministerial office as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education]], under two [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for Education|Presidents]], first [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Herwald Ramsbotham]], and then [[Rab Butler|RA Butler]]. With Butler, he steered the [[Education Act 1944]] through Parliament, and it is clear that his detailed knowledge of state education, which Butler lacked, was crucial to the success of this measure.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Evans |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=James Chuter Ede and the Making of the 1944 Education Act |type=MA dissertation|publisher=Institute of Education, London}}</ref>  There remained considerable cross-party respect between the two men.<ref name=hart/>

He was [[Home Secretary]] in the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|1945 Labour government]] of [[Clement Attlee]], and concurrently [[Leader of the House of Commons]] in 1951. He was responsible for restructuring several public services, through the [[Police Act 1946]], the [[Fire Services Act 1947]], the [[Civil Defence Act 1948]], and the Justices of the Peace Act 1949.  In addition, he was closely involved in the [[Children Act 1948]], the [[British Nationality Act 1948]], the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]],  and the Criminal Justice Act 1948.  He established the [[Lynskey tribunal]] under Sir [[George Lynskey]] in 1948 to investigate allegations of corruption among ministers and civil servants.

In 1964 he left the Commons and was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Chuter-Ede''', ''of [[Epsom]] in the [[County of Surrey]]'' on 1 January 1965.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43538 |date=1 January 1965 |page=83}}</ref>

==Capital punishment==

In 1938, Chuter Ede voted for a motion in favour of abolishing the death penalty for [[murder]]. This did not result in any change in the law but, when he was Home Secretary, his own Criminal Justice Bill in 1948 was successfully amended by MPs who wished to abolish [[hanging]]. However, by this time Chuter Ede, in line with the policy of the Attlee Government, opposed the reform. For a while he agreed to commute every death sentence to [[life imprisonment]], but the [[House of Lords]] then rejected the amendment, and the Criminal Justice Act 1948 did not abolish capital punishment.  He permitted hangings to continue.

In 1950 [[Timothy Evans]] was convicted of murdering his own daughter, and Chuter Ede approved his death sentence. In 1953, after [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]] had been convicted and hanged for a murder committed in the same house (and it was clear he had committed several others), Chuter Ede eventually concluded that he had made the wrong decision in regard to Evans.

He took part in the campaign for a pardon for Evans, and ended his career supporting the cause of abolition.  In November 1965, capital punishment for murder was abolished by the [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965]], and Evans's body was transferred to consecrated ground, shortly before Chuter Ede's death. His campaign was described as "the last struggle of a liberal nonconformist of the old school".<ref>Quotation from Kevin Jeffreys, op cit; see also his introduction to ''Labour and the Wartime Coalition'', Historian's Press, 1987.</ref>

==Family==
Chuter Ede married Lilian Mary, daughter of Richard Williams, in 1917. She died in 1948. Lord Chuter-Ede survived her by 17 years and died at [[Ewell]], Surrey, in November 1965, aged 83. [[Chuter Ede Education Centre]] in South Shields is named after him. It was formerly a [[comprehensive school]].
