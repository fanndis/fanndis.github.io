'''John Joseph Nicholson''' (born April 22, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker whose career has spanned more than 60 years. He is known for having played a wide range of starring or supporting roles, including comedy, romance, and darkly comic portrayals of anti-heroes and villainous characters. In many of his films, he played the "eternal [[Outlaw (stock character)|outsider]], the [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] [[Vagrancy|drifter]]", someone who rebels against the social structure.<ref name="Katz" />

His most known and celebrated films include the road drama ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969); the dramas ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' (1970) and ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975); the comedy-dramas ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971),  ''[[The Last Detail]]'' (1973), ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1983), ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' (1985), ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'' (1997), and ''[[About Schmidt]]'' (2002); the neo-noir mystery ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974); the horror film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980); the biopic ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981); the fantasy comedy ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]'' (1987); the superhero film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989); the legal drama ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992); the romantic horror film ''[[Wolf (1994 film)|Wolf]]'' (1994); the science fiction comedy ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996); the comedy ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'' (2003); the romantic comedy ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'' (2003); and the crime drama ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006). He has also directed three films, including ''[[The Two Jakes]]'' (1990).

Nicholson's 12 [[Academy Award]] nominations make him [[List of actors with two or more Academy Award nominations in acting categories|the most nominated male actor in the Academy's history]]. He has won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] twice for ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' (1975) and ''As Good as It Gets'' (1997), and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for ''Terms of Endearment'' (1983). He is one of only three [[List of actors with two or more Academy Awards in acting categories|male actors to win three Academy Awards]], and one of only two actors to be nominated for an Academy Award for acting in every decade from the 1960s to the 2000s. He has won six [[Golden Globe Award]]s and received the [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]] in 2001. In 1994, at 57, he became one of the youngest actors to be awarded the [[AFI Life Achievement Award|American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award]].

Nicholson had a number of high-profile relationships, including ones with [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Rebecca Broussard]], and was married to [[Sandra Knight]] from 1962 to 1968. He has five children: one with Knight, two with Broussard (including [[Lorraine Nicholson]]), and one each with [[Susan Anspach]] and Winnie Hollman.

===Early work===
[[File: Little Shop of Horrors Nicholson.JPG|thumb|Nicholson as Wilbur Force in ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1960)]]
Nicholson first came to Hollywood in 1954, when he was seventeen, to visit his sister. He took a job as an office worker for animators [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] at the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]. They offered him an entry-level job as an animator, but he declined, citing his desire to become an actor.<ref name="McGilligan" /> While accepting the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] at the [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], he recalled that his first day as a working actor was May 5, 1955, which he considered lucky, as "5" was the jersey number of his boyhood idol, [[Joe DiMaggio]].<ref> [https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=lifetime+achievement+award+at+the+1999+golden+globes&view=detail&mid=EFD5B0206462231450B9EFD5B0206462231450B9&FORM=VIRE "Jack Nicholson Receives Cecil B Demille Award - Golden Globes 1999"] via [[Dick Clark Productions]]; retrieved February 24, 2020</ref>
He trained to be an actor with a group called the Players Ring Theater, after which he found small parts performing on the stage and in TV soap operas.<ref name="Katz">Katz, Ephraim. ''The Film Encyclopedia'', HarperCollins (2012) pp. 1079–1080</ref> He made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama ''[[The Cry Baby Killer]]'' (1958), playing the title role. For the following decade, Nicholson was a frequent collaborator with the film's producer, [[Roger Corman]]. Corman directed Nicholson on several occasions, such as in ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as [[sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient and undertaker Wilbur Force, and also in ''[[The Raven (1963 film)|The Raven]]''; ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'', where he plays a French officer seduced by an evil ghost; and ''[[The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (film)|The St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]''.

Nicholson also frequently worked with director [[Monte Hellman]] on low-budget westerns, though two in particular—''[[Ride in the Whirlwind]]'' and ''[[The Shooting]]''—initially failed to find interest from any US film distributors but gained cult success on the art-house circuit in France and were later sold to television. Nicholson also appeared in two episodes of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''.

===1960s===
With his acting career heading nowhere, Nicholson seemed resigned to a career behind the camera as a writer/director. His first real taste of writing success was the [[screenplay]] for the 1967 [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] film ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (directed by Corman), which starred [[Peter Fonda]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. After first reading the script, Fonda told Nicholson he was totally impressed by the writing and felt it could become a great film. However, Fonda was disappointed with how the film turned out and blamed the editing which turned it into a "predictable" film and said so publicly. "I was livid", he recalls.<ref name="Fonda">Linderman, Lawrence. "Playboy Interview with Peter Fonda", ''Playboy'' magazine, September 1970</ref> Nicholson also co-wrote, with [[Bob Rafelson]], the movie ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'', which starred [[The Monkees]], and arranged the movie's [[soundtrack]].

Nicholson's first big acting break came when a spot opened up in Fonda and Hopper's ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). He played alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The film cost only $400,000 to make, and became a blockbuster, grossing $40&nbsp;million.<ref name="Parker" /> Biographer John Parker states that Nicholson's interpretation of his role placed him in the company of earlier "[[anti-hero]]" actors, such as [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]], while promoting him into an "overnight number-one hero of the [[counter-culture]] movement".<ref name="Parker">Parker, John. ''Michael Douglas: Acting on Instinct'', Hachette Book Group (2011) e-book</ref>

The part was a lucky break for Nicholson. The role had been written for the actor [[Rip Torn]], who withdrew from the project after an argument with Hopper.<ref>Hill, Lee. ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern''. Bloomsbury, 2001.</ref> In interviews, Nicholson later acknowledged the importance of being cast in ''Easy Rider'': "All I could see in the early films, before ''Easy Rider'', was this desperate young actor trying to vault out of the screen and create a movie career."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/film-cinema/easy-rider-the-Jack-Nicholson-interview-1296590.html|work=Irish Independent|title=Easy rider: The Jack Nicholson interview|date=February 27, 2008}}</ref>

Nicholson was cast by [[Stanley Kubrick]], who was impressed with his role in ''Easy Rider'', in the part of [[Napoleon]] in a film about his life, and although production on the film commenced, the project fizzled out, partly due to a change in ownership at MGM, and other issues.{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=122}}

===1970s===
[[file:Michelle Phillips and Jack Nicholson - 1971 Golden Globes.jpg|thumb|Nicholson with [[Michelle Phillips]] at the 1971 [[Golden Globes]]]]
Nicholson starred in ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' alongside [[Karen Black]] in 1970 in what became his persona-defining role. Nicholson and Black were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. Nicholson played Bobby Dupea, an oil rig worker, and Black played his waitress girlfriend. During an interview about the film, Black noted that Nicholson's character in the film was very subdued, and was very different from Nicholson's real-life personality. She says that the now-famous restaurant scene was partly improvised by Nicholson, and was out of character for Bobby, who wouldn't have cared enough to argue with a waitress.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdIXrF34Bz0 "Hold the Chicken – Five Easy Pieces"], fair use video clip</ref> "I think that Jack really has very little in common with Bobby. I think Bobby has given up looking for love. But Jack hasn't, he's very interested in love, in finding out things. Jack is a very curious, alive human being. Always ready for a new idea."<ref name="Crane">Crane, Robert. ''Jack Nicholson: The Early Years'', Univ. Press of Kentucky (2012)</ref>{{rp|37}} Nicholson himself said as much, telling an interviewer, "I like listening to everybody. This to me is the elixir of life."<ref name="Esquire">D'Agostino, Ryan. ''Esquire the Meaning of Life: Wisdom, Humor, and Damn Good Advice from 64 Extraordinary Lives'', Sterling Publishing (2009) pp. 97–99</ref>

Black later admitted that she had a crush on Nicholson from the time they met, although they only dated briefly. "He was very beautiful. He just looked right at you&nbsp;... I liked him a lot&nbsp;... He really sort of wanted to date me but I didn't think of him that way because I was going with Peter Kastner&nbsp;... Then I went to do ''Easy Rider'', but didn't see him because we didn't have any scenes together&nbsp;... At the premiere, I saw him out in the lobby afterward and I started crying&nbsp;... He didn't understand that, but what it was {{not a typo|was}} <!--WAS WAS is used correctly--> that I really loved him a lot, and I didn't know it until I saw him again, because it all welled up."<ref name="Crane" />{{rp|36}}

Within a month after the film's release that September, the movie became a blockbuster, making Nicholson a [[leading man]] and the "new American anti-hero", according to McDougal.<ref name="McDougal"/>{{rp|130}} Critics began speculating as to whether he might become another [[Marlon Brando]] or [[James Dean]]. His career and income skyrocketed. He said, "I have [become] much sought after. Your name becomes a brand image like a product. You become Campbell's soup, with thirty-one different varieties of roles you can play."<ref name="McDougal"/>{{rp|130}} He told his new agent, Sandy Bresler, to find him unusual roles so he could stretch his acting skill: "I like to play people that haven't existed yet, a 'cusp character'", he said:

{{quote|I have that creative yearning. Much in the way [[Chagall]] flies figures into the air: once it becomes part of the conventional wisdom, it doesn't seem particularly adventurous or weird or wild.<ref name="McDougal"/>{{rp|130}}}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=There is James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, and Henry Fonda. After that, who is there but Jack Nicholson?|source=—[[Mike Nichols]], director<ref name="Eliot" />}}

Also in 1970, he appeared in the movie adaptation of ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)|On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', although most of his performance was left on the [[cutting room floor]]. His agent turned down a starring role in ''[[Deliverance]]'' when the film's producer and director, [[John Boorman]], refused to pay what Nicholson's agent wanted.<ref name="McDougal"/>{{rp|130}}

Nicholson starred in ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' in 1971, a comedy-drama directed by [[Mike Nichols]], which co-starred [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Ann-Margret]], and [[Candice Bergen]]. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]]. As a director, Mike Nichols was limited in the actors who he felt could handle the role, saying, "There is James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Humphrey Bogart, and Henry Fonda. After that, who is there but Jack Nicholson?"<ref name="Eliot" /> During the filming, Nicholson struck up what became a lifelong friendship with co-star Garfunkel. When he visited Los Angeles, Garfunkel would stay at Nicholson's home in a room Nicholson jokingly called "the Arthur Garfunkel Suite".<ref name="McDougal"/>{{rp|127}}

Other Nicholson roles included [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''[[The Last Detail]]'' (1973), with [[Randy Quaid]], for which Nicholson won [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and he was nominated for his third Oscar and a Golden Globe. Television journalist [[David Gilmour (writer)|David Gilmour]] writes that one of his favorite Nicholson scenes from all his films was in this one when Nicholson slaps his gun on the bar yelling he ''was'' the Shore Patrol.<ref>Gilmour, David. ''The Film Club: A Memoir'', Hachette Book Group (2008) e-book</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnY88imrH78 Shore Patrol scene in ''The Last Detail''], fair use clip</ref> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] called it a very good movie, but credited Nicholson's acting as the main reason: "He creates a character so complete and so complex that we stop thinking about the movie and just watch to see what he'll do next."<ref>Ebert, Roger. ''Roger Ebert's Four Star Reviews—1967–2007'', Andrews McMeel Publishing (2007) p. 405</ref>

In 1974, Nicholson starred in [[Roman Polanski]]'s noir thriller ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and was again nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role as Jake Gittes, a private detective. The film co-starred [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[John Huston]], and included a cameo role with Polanski. Roger Ebert described Nicholson's portrayal as sharp-edged, menacing, and aggressive, a character who knew "how to go over the top", as he did in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. It is that edge that kept ''Chinatown'' from becoming a typical genre crime film.<ref>Ebert, Roger. ''The Great Movies, Volume 1'', Broadway Books (2002) p. 106</ref> Ebert also notes the importance of the role for Nicholson's career, seeing it as a major transition from the exploitation films of the previous decade. "As Jake Gittes, he stepped into [[Bogart]]'s shoes", says Ebert. "As a man attractive to audiences because he suggests both comfort and danger&nbsp;... From Gittes forward, Nicholson created the persona of a man who had seen it all and was still capable of being wickedly amused."<ref>Ebert, Roger. ''27 Movies from the Dark Side: Ebert's Essentials'', Andrews McMeel Publishing (2012) e-book</ref>

Nicholson had been friends with the director Roman Polanski long before the [[Tate–LaBianca murders#Tate murders|murder]] of Polanski's wife, [[Sharon Tate]] and others, at the hands of the [[Manson Family]], and supported him in the days following their deaths.<ref name="McDougal"/>{{rp|109–110}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Murder Most Unforgettable|first=Dominick|last=Dunne|work=Vanity Fair |date=April 2001}}</ref> After Tate's death, Nicholson began sleeping with a hammer under his pillow<ref name="McDougal"/> and took breaks from work to attend the Manson trial.<ref name="McGilligan">{{cite book|title=Jack's Life: A Biography of Jack Nicholson|url={{Google books|AdQDYqBmmJYC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|first=Patrick|last=McGilligan|publisher=W.

[[File:Jack Nicholson - 1976 (new).jpg|thumb|upright|Nicholson in 1976]]
In 1977, three years after ''Chinatown'', Polanski was arrested at Nicholson's home for the [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|sexual assault]] of 13-year-old Samantha Geimer, who was modeling for Polanski during a magazine photo shoot around the pool. At the time of the incident, Nicholson was out of town making a film, but his steady girlfriend, actress [[Anjelica Huston]], had dropped by unannounced to pick up some items. She heard Polanski in the other room say, "We'll be right out."<ref name="Huston" /> Polanski then came out with Geimer, and he introduced her to Huston, and they chatted about Nicholson's two large dogs, which were sitting nearby. Huston recalled Geimer was wearing platform heels and appeared quite tall.<ref name="Huston" /> After a few minutes of talking, Polanski had packed up his camera gear and Huston saw them drive off in his car. Huston told police the next day, after Polanski was arrested, that she "had witnessed nothing untoward" and never saw them together in the other room.<ref name="Huston">Huston, Anjelica. ''Watch Me'', Simon and Schuster (2014) e-book</ref>

Geimer learned afterward that Huston herself wasn't supposed to be at Nicholson's house that day, since they had recently broken up, but stopped over to pick up some belongings. Geimer described Nicholson's house as "definitely" a guy's house, with lots of wood and shelves crowded with photos and mementos.<ref>Geimer, Samantha. ''The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski'', Simon and Schuster (2013) p. 79</ref>

One of Nicholson's greatest successes came in 1975, with his role as [[Randle Patrick McMurphy|Randle P. McMurphy]] in ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]''. The movie was an adaptation of [[Ken Kesey]]'s novel, and was directed by [[Miloš Forman]] and co-produced by [[Michael Douglas]]. Nicholson plays an anti-authoritarian patient at a mental hospital where he becomes an inspiring leader for the other patients. Playing one of the patients was [[Danny DeVito]] in an early role. Nicholson learned afterward that DeVito grew up in the same area of New Jersey, and they knew many of the same people.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-uJ9A5XISk|title=Danny DeVito speaks at the 22nd AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute To Jack Nicholson|date=1994}}</ref> The film swept the Academy Awards with nine nominations, and won the top five, including Nicholson's first for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

The role seemed perfect for Nicholson, with biographer Ken Burke noting that his "smartass demeanor balances his genuine concern for the treatment of his fellow patients with his independent spirit too free to exist in a repressive social structure".<ref name="Burke">Burke, Ken. Ed. ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'', Bowling Green State Univ. Press (2001) p. 578</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc0_Xnvl3t4 "You're Not Crazy!" – a scene in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''], fair use clip</ref> Forman allowed Nicholson to improvise throughout the film, including most of the group therapy sequences.<ref name="McGilligan" /> {{rp|273}} Reviewer [[Marie Brenner]] notes that his bravura performance "transcends the screen" and continually inspires the other actors by lightening their mental illnesses with his comic dialogue. She describes his performance:

{{quote|Nicholson is everywhere; his energy propels the ward of loonies and makes of them an ensemble, a chorus of people caught in a bummer with nowhere else to go, but still fighting for some frail sense of themselves. ... There are scenes in ''Cuckoo's Nest'' that are as intimate—and in their language, twice as rough—as the best moments in ''The Godfather'' ... [and] far above the general run of Hollywood performances.<ref>Brenner, Marie. ''Texas Monthly'', January 1976, p. 32</ref>}}

Also in 1975, Nicholson starred in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975), which co-starred [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]]. Nicholson plays the role of a journalist, David Locke, who during an assignment in North Africa decides to quit being a journalist and simply disappear by taking on a new hidden identity. Unfortunately, the dead person whose identity he takes on turns out to have been a weapons smuggler on the run. Antonioni's unusual plot included convincing dialogue and fine acting, states film critic [[Seymour Chatman]].<ref name="Chatman">Chatman, Seymour; Duncan, Paul. ''Michelangelo Antonioni: The Investigation'', [[Taschen]] (2004) p. 134</ref> It was shot in Algeria, Spain, Germany, and England.

The film received good reviews and revived Antonioni's reputation as one of cinema's great directors.<ref name="Chatman" /> He says he wanted the film to have more of a "spy feeling [and] be more political".<ref name="Chatman" /> Nicholson began shooting the film from an unfinished script, notes [[Judith Crist]],<ref>Crist, Judith. "The Plot Slickens", ''New York Magazine', April 14, 1975 p. 76</ref> yet upon its completion he thought so highly of the film that he bought the world rights and recorded a reminiscence of working with Antonioni.<ref name="Chatman" /> Critic and screenwriter [[Penelope Gilliatt]] provides an overview of Nicholson's role:

{{quote|'' The Passenger'' is an unidealized portrait of a drained man whose one remaining stimulus is to push his luck. Again and again, in the movie, we watch him court danger. It interests him to walk the edge of risk. He does it with passivity as if he were taking part in an expressionless game of double-dare with life. Jack Nicholson's performance is a wonder of insight. How to animate a personality that is barely there.<ref name="McGilligan" /> {{rp|443}}}}

He continued to take more unusual roles. He took a small role in ''[[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|The Last Tycoon]]'', opposite [[Robert De Niro]]. He took a less sympathetic role in [[Arthur Penn]]'s western ''[[The Missouri Breaks]]'' (1976), specifically to work with [[Marlon Brando]]. Nicholson was especially inspired by Brando's acting ability, recalling that in his youth, as an assistant manager at a theater, he watched ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' about forty times.<ref>Wild, David. "Rolling Stone Interview with Jack Nicholson", ''Rolling Stone'', May 3, 2007, p. 110</ref> "I'm part of the first generation that idolized Marlon Brando", he said.<ref>Nicholson, Jack. "Remembering Marlon", ''Rolling Stone'', August 19, 2004</ref>

{{quote|Marlon Brando influenced me strongly. Today, it's hard for people who weren't there to realize the impact that Brando had on an audience. ... He's always been the patron saint of actors.<ref name="Eliot">Eliot, Marc. ''Nicholson: A Biography'', Random House (2013) Title page</ref>}}

Nicholson has observed that while both De Niro and Brando were noted for their skill as [[method actor]]s, he himself has seldom been described as a method actor, a fact which he sees as an accomplishment: "I'm still fooling them", he told [[Sean Penn]] during a phone conversation. "I consider it an accomplishment because there's probably no one who understands Method acting better academically than I do—or actually uses it more in his work. But it's funny, nobody really sees that. It's perception versus reality, I guess."<ref name="Esquire" />

===1980s===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=His work is always interesting, clearly conceived, and has the X-factor, magic.

Although he garnered no [[Academy Award]] for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), it remains one of his more significant roles. He was Kubrick's first choice to play the lead role, although the book's author, [[Stephen King]], wanted the part played by more of an "everyman". However, Kubrick as a director won the argument, and described Nicholson's acting quality as being "on a par with the greatest stars of the past, like [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[James Cagney|Jimmy Cagney]]".<ref name="LoBrutto">LoBrutto, Vincent. ''Stanley Kubrick: A Biography'', Da Capo Press (1997) p. 420</ref>

On the set, Nicholson always appeared in character, and if Kubrick felt confident that he knew his lines well enough, he encouraged him to improvise and go beyond the script.<ref name="LoBrutto" /> {{rp|434}} For example, Nicholson improvised his now-famous "Here's Johnny!" line,<ref name="LoBrutto" /> {{rp|433}} along with a scene in which he unleashes his anger upon his wife while she interrupts his writing.<ref name="LoBrutto" /> {{rp|445}} There were also extensive takes of scenes, due to Kubrick's perfectionism. Nicholson shot a scene with the ghostly bartender thirty-six times.<ref>{{cite book |title=Love and Death in Kubrick: A Critical Study of the Films |last= Webster |first=Patrick |year= 2010 |publisher= McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-5916-2 |page=221 |url= }}</ref> Nicholson states that "Stanley's demanding.

In 1982, he starred as an immigration enforcement agent in ''[[The Border (1982 film)|The Border]]'', directed by [[Tony Richardson]]. It co-starred [[Warren Oates]], who played a corrupt border official.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_2FTJXTGsw Trailer: ''The Border''], fair use clip</ref> Richardson wanted Nicholson to play his role less expressively than he had in his earlier roles. "Less is more", he told him, and wanted him to wear reflecting sunglasses to portray what patrolmen wore.<ref name="McGilligan" /> {{rp|318}} Richardson recalled that Nicholson worked hard on the set:
{{quote|He's what the Thirties and Forties stars were like. He can come on the set and deliver, without any fuss, without taking a long time walking around getting into it. "What do you want? Okay." And he just does it straight off. And then if you want him to do it another way on the next take, he can adapt to that too.<ref name="McGilligan" /> {{rp|318}}}}

Nicholson won his second Oscar, an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], for his role of retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove in ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1983), directed by [[James L. Brooks]]. It starred [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Debra Winger]]. McGilligan claims it was one of Nicholson's most complex and unforgettable characters. He and MacLaine played many of their scenes in different ways, constantly testing and making adjustments. Their scenes together gave the film its "buoyant edge", states McGilligan, and describes Nicholson's acting as "Jack floating like a butterfly".<ref name="McGilligan" /> {{rp|330}}

Nicholson continued to work prolifically in the 1980s, starring in such films as: ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (1981); ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' (1981), where Nicholson portrays the writer [[Eugene O'Neill]] with a quiet intensity; ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]'' (1985); ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' (1986); ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]'' (1987); ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'' (1987); and ''[[Ironweed (film)|Ironweed]]'' (1987).

In the 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' movie, Nicholson played the psychotic murderer and villain, [[Joker (character)|the Joker]]. The film was an international smash hit, and a lucrative percentage deal earned him a percentage of the [[box office]] gross estimated at $60&nbsp;million to $90&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/08/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/jack-nicholson-you-dont-know-jack/|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=December 22, 2013|publisher=CNN|title=You don't know Jack (Nicholson)|author=Matt Carey}}</ref> Nicholson said that he was "particularly proud" of his performance as the Joker: "I considered it a piece of [[pop art]]", he said.<ref name="Esquire" />

===1990s===
For his role as hot-headed Col. Nathan R. Jessup in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), a movie about a murder in a [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] unit, Nicholson received yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<ref name="oscar1993">{{cite web|title=The 65th Academy Awards: 1993|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993|website=Academy Awards Database|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk "You Can't Handle the Truth! – A Few Good Men"], fair use clip</ref> One review describes his performance as "spellbinding", adding that he portrayed "the essence of the quintessential military mindset".<ref>Bleiler, David, Ed. ''TLA Video & DVD Guide'', St. Martin's Griffin (2003) p. 206</ref> Critic David Thomson notes that Nicholson's character "blazed and roared".<ref name="Thomson" />

The film's director, [[Rob Reiner]], recalls how Nicholson's level of acting experience affected the other actors during rehearsals: "I had the luck of having Jack Nicholson there. He knows what he's doing, and he comes to play, every time out, full-out performance! And what it says to a lot of the other actors is, 'Oooooh, I better get on my game here because this guy's coming to play! So I can't hold back; I've got to come up to him.' He sets the tone."<ref name="Kagan">Kagan, Jeremy. ''Directors Close Up'', Scarecrow Press (2006) p. 148</ref>

In 1996, Nicholson collaborated once more with ''Batman'' director [[Tim Burton]] on ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', pulling double duty as two contrasting characters, President James Dale and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] property developer Art Land. At first, studio executives at Warner Bros. disliked the idea of killing off Nicholson's character, so Burton created two characters and killed them both off.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Not all of Nicholson's performances have been well received. He was nominated for [[Razzie Awards]] as worst actor for ''[[Man Trouble]]'' (1992) and ''[[Hoffa (film)|Hoffa]]'' (1992). However, Nicholson's performance in ''Hoffa'' also earned him a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.razzies.com/forum/1992-razzie-nominees-winners_topic342.html|title=Razzie nominations 1992|access-date=March 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831204725/http://www.razzies.com/forum/1992-razzie-nominees-winners_topic342.html|archive-date=August 31, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/?param=/member/29118 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312134700/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/?param=%2Fmember%2F29118 |archivedate=March 12, 2013 |title=Golden Globe actor reference |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> While David Thomson states that the film was terribly neglected, since Nicholson portrayed one of his best screen characters, someone who is "snarly, dumb, smart, noble, rascally—all the parts of 'Jack'"<ref name="Thomson" />

Nicholson went on to win his next [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in the romantic comedy, ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'' (1997), his third film directed by [[James L. Brooks]]. He played Melvin Udall, a "wickedly funny",<ref name="Bona" /> mean-spirited, obsessive-compulsive novelist. "I'm a studio [[Method actor]]", he said. "So I was prone to give some kind of clinical presentation of the disorder."<ref name="RS98">Schruers, Fred. "Rolling Stone Interview with Jack Nicholson", ''Rolling Stone'', March 19, 1998 pp. 38–40</ref> His Oscar was matched with the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for [[Helen Hunt]], who played a Manhattan wisecracking, single-mother waitress drawn into a love/hate friendship with Udall, a frequent diner in the restaurant. The film was a tremendous box office success, grossing $314&nbsp;million, which made it Nicholson's second-best-grossing film of his career, after ''Batman''.<ref name="Eliot" />

Nicholson admits he initially didn't like playing the role of a middle-aged man alongside much younger Hunt, seeing it as a movie cliché. "But Helen disarmed that at the first meeting", he says, "and I stopped thinking about it." They got along well during the filming, with Hunt saying that he "treated me like a queen", and they connected immediately: "It wasn't even what we said", she adds. "It was just some frequency we both could tune into that was very, very compatible."<ref name="Bona">Bona, Damien. ''Inside Oscar 2'', Random House (2002) e-book</ref>

Critic Jack Mathews of ''[[Newsday]]'' described Nicholson as being "in rare form", adding that "it's one of those performances that make you aware how much fun the actor is having".<ref name="Bona" /> Author and screenwriter Andrew Horton describes their on-screen relationship as being like "fire and ice, oil and water—seemingly complete opposites".<ref>Horton, Andrew. ''Laughing Out Loud: Writing the Comedy-centered Screenplay'', Univ. of California Press (2000) p. 64</ref> Nonetheless, Hunt was Nicholson's perfect counterpart and delivered "a simply stunning performance", wrote critic Louise Keller.<ref>[http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=738&s=video_files ''AS GOOD AS IT GETS'' reviews], ''Urban Cinefile'', August 13, 2015</ref>

===2000s===
[[File:Jack Nicholson 2002.jpg|thumb|Nicholson in 2002]]
In ''[[About Schmidt]]'' (2002), Nicholson portrayed a retired [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], [[actuary]] who questions his own life following his wife's death. His quietly restrained performance earned him an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor. In ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]'' (2003), he played an aggressive therapist assigned to help an overly pacifist man ([[Adam Sandler]]). In 2003, Nicholson also starred in ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'', as an aging playboy who falls for the mother ([[Diane Keaton]]) of his young girlfriend. In late 2006, Nicholson marked his return to the dark side as [[Frank Costello (The Departed)|Frank Costello]], a nefarious [[Boston]] [[Irish Mob]] boss, based on [[Whitey Bulger]] who was still on the run at that time, presiding over [[Matt Damon]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in [[Martin Scorsese's]] Oscar-winning film ''[[The Departed]]'', a remake of [[Andrew Lau]]'s ''[[Infernal Affairs]]''. The role earned Nicholson worldwide critical praise, along with various award wins and nominations, including a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for best-supporting actor.

In 2007, Nicholson co-starred with [[Morgan Freeman]] in [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[The Bucket List]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiy-sT9JgRo "He Saved My Life", a scene in ''The Bucket List''], fair use clip</ref> Nicholson and Freeman portrayed dying men who fulfill their list of goals. In researching the role, Nicholson visited a [[Los Angeles]] hospital to see how cancer patients coped with their illnesses.

===2010s===
Nicholson's next film role saw him reunite with [[James L. Brooks]], director of ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'', ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'', and ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', for a supporting role as [[Paul Rudd]]'s character's father in the 2010 film ''[[How Do You Know]]''.

Nicholson's only marriage was to Sandra Knight from June 17, 1962, to August 8, 1968; they had been separated for two years prior to the divorce.

===Assault charge and lawsuits===
In a criminal [[complaint]] filed on February 8, 1994, Robert Blank stated that Nicholson, then 56, approached Blank's [[Mercedes-Benz]] while he was stopped at a red light in [[North Hollywood]]. After accusing the other man of cutting him off in traffic, Nicholson used a golf club to bash the roof and windshield of Blank's car. A witness confirmed Blank's account of the incident, and [[misdemeanor]] charges of assault and vandalism were filed against Nicholson. Charges were dropped after Nicholson apologized to Blank, and the two reached an undisclosed settlement, which included a reported $500,000 check from Nicholson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pn/Jack_Nicholson.html|title=The religion of Jack Nicholson, actor|website=www.adherents.com}}</ref>

In 1996, a [[lawsuit]] was brought against Nicholson for rupturing a woman's breast implants. Later that same year, a second lawsuit was brought against Nicholson alleging that he promised a woman named Catherine Shaheen $1,000 for sex and then assaulted her when she asked for the money. Though Shaheen received a settlement of about $40,000, she argued that this was insufficient to cover the injuries inflicted upon her, including [[Traumatic brain injury|brain trauma]], which she stated were "actually killing her."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Staff|first=Guardian|date=2000-05-15|title=Jack Nicholson sued for assault|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/15/news1|access-date=2020-10-02|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Celebrity friendships===
Nicholson lived next door to [[Marlon Brando]] for a number of years on [[Mulholland Drive]] in [[Beverly Hills]]. [[Warren Beatty]] also lived nearby, earning the road the nickname "Bad Boy Drive". After Brando's death in 2004, Nicholson purchased his bungalow for $6.1&nbsp;million, with the purpose of having it demolished.
