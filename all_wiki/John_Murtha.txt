'''John Patrick Murtha Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜr|θ|ə}}; June 17, 1932 – February 8, 2010) was an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] from the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Murtha, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], represented [[Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1974 until his death in 2010.<ref>Obituary ''[[New York Times]]'', February 9, 2010.</ref><ref>Obituary ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 9, 2010.</ref><ref>Obituary ''[[Washington Post]]'', February 9, 2010.</ref><ref>Obituary ''[[The Independent|London Independent]]'', February 10, 2010.</ref> He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)#Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]].

A former Marine Corps officer, Murtha was the first [[Vietnam War]] veteran elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. A member of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Pennsylvania House]] from 1969 to 1974, he narrowly won a special election to Congress in 1974 and was successively reelected every two years until his death. In the first decade of the 21st century, Murtha had been best known for his calls for a withdrawal of American forces in [[Iraq]], as well as questions about his ethics.<ref>Jackson, Peter.

He had previously chaired this subcommittee from 1989 to 1995 and served as its [[ranking member]] from 1995 to 2007.

==Background==
Murtha was born into an Irish-American family in [[New Martinsville, West Virginia]], near the border with [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]], and grew up in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], a largely suburban county east of [[Pittsburgh]]. He was the son of Mary Edna (née Ray) and John Patrick Murtha Sr.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40419591/|title=Simpson's Leader-Times from Kittanning, Pennsylvania|publisher=Simpson's Leader-Times|date=May 21, 1975|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>

As a youth, he became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. He also worked delivering newspapers and at a gas station before graduating from [[The Kiski School]], an all-male [[boarding school]] in [[Saltsburg, Pennsylvania]].

Murtha left [[Washington and Jefferson College]] in 1952 to join the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and was awarded the [[American Spirit Honor Medal]] for displaying outstanding leadership qualities during training. He became a [[drill instructor]] at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]] and was selected for [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer Candidate School]] at [[Quantico, Virginia]]. He was then assigned to the [[Second Marine Division]], [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]]. As an undergraduate, Murtha was initiated into the [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]].

Murtha remained in the [[Marine Forces Reserve]] and ran a [[small business]], Johnstown Minute Car Wash (which still operates in the West End section of Johnstown). He also attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]] on the [[G.I. Bill]], and received a degree in [[economics]]. Murtha later took graduate courses from the [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]].

Murtha left the Marines in 1955. He remained in the Reserves after his discharge from active duty until he volunteered for service in the [[Vietnam War]], serving from 1966 to 1967, serving as a [[battalion]] [[staff officer]] (S-2 [[Military Intelligence|Intelligence]] Section), receiving the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [[Valor device]], two [[Purple Heart]]s, and the [[Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry]]. He retired from the Marine Corps Reserve as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in 1990, receiving the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].

==Political career==
Soon after returning from Vietnam, Murtha won the Democratic nomination for what was then the 22nd District, which was based in Johnstown. He lost fairly handily to longtime [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[John P. Saylor|John Saylor]].

Murtha was elected to represent the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 72|72nd legislative district]] in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] in a special election on May 20, 1969. The election was triggered by the death of Representative [[Edward McNally (Pennsylvania)|Edward McNally]], who died in November 1968.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Cox | first = Harold | title = Pennsylvania House of Representatives – 1969–1970| publisher = Wilkes University | work = [[Wilkes University Election Statistics Project]]| date = November 3, 2004| url = http://staffweb.wilkes.edu/harold.cox/legis/153H.pdf}}</ref> He was elected to a full term in 1970.

Congressman Saylor died in October 1973, nine months into his 13th term. Murtha immediately jumped into the special election contest in what was now the 12th District. In the February 1974 special election, which took place during the burgeoning [[Watergate scandal]], Murtha defeated one of Saylor's former aides, Harry Fox, by only 242 votes. He defeated Fox by a significantly wider margin that November and was reelected 17 times.

Murtha faced tough primary challenges in 1982, 1990 and again in 2002. The 1982 challenge occurred when the Republican-controlled state legislature took advantage of Murtha's connection to [[Abscam]], and incorporated most of the district of fellow Democrat and Vietnam War veteran [[Donald A. Bailey|Don Bailey]] of Westmoreland County into the 12th District.

[[File:John Murtha.jpg|right|thumb|Murtha dedicates the [[National Drug Intelligence Center]] in Johnstown in 1993.]]

The 2002 challenge occurred when the state legislature redrew the district of fellow Democrat [[Frank Mascara]] to make it more Republican-friendly, shifting a large chunk of Mascara's former territory into Murtha's district. Mascara opted to run against Murtha in the Democratic primary, since the new 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Mascara was badly defeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/12/08/the-great-election-grab|title=The Great Election Grab|author=Jeffrey Toobin|author-link=Jeffrey Toobin|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=December 12, 2003}}</ref>

In 2006, Murtha's Republican challenger was Diana Irey, a county commissioner from [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]], the heart of Mascara's former district. Irey attacked Murtha for his criticism of the Iraq war. Even though Irey was Murtha's strongest Republican opponent in decades, she polled well behind Murtha throughout the campaign. A poll by the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' on October 12, 2006, showed Murtha with a commanding lead over Irey, 57%–30%.<ref name="Octoberpoll">{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_474587.html|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|title=Poll: Murtha has big lead|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=2006-10-05|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021075642/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_474587.html|archive-date=October 21, 2006}}</ref> In the November election, Murtha won 61%–39%.<ref>Josh Krysak, [http://www.heraldstandard.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17441645&BRD=2280&PAG=461&dept_id=480247&rfi=6 "Murtha captures 61 percent of vote"], ''Herald Standard'', November 9, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204914/http://www.heraldstandard.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17441645&BRD=2280&PAG=461&dept_id=480247&rfi=6 |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

On June 9, 2006, Murtha informed [[House Minority Leader|Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] that he would run for [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] if the Democrats gained control of the House in the [[2006 United States House of Representatives elections|2006 midterm elections]]. Despite Murtha receiving Pelosi's support, current Democratic Whip [[Steny Hoyer]] was elected to the post.<ref name=Murtharun />

On March 18, 2008, Murtha endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]], former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] and then [[United State Senate|Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], in [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|her bid for the presidency]].<ref>The Tribune-Democrat.

In 2009, Murtha heard details from [[Fort Benning]] U.S. Army soldiers on how their current uniforms and equipment were not providing camouflage in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] during a personal visit. Murtha immediately took action and convinced the army to fix the camouflage problem, resulting in [[MultiCam]] being selected by the Secretary of the Army [[John M. McHugh|John McHugh]] for all incoming soldiers deploying to Afghanistan in 2010, only weeks after Murtha had died.<ref name="armytimes multicam">{{Cite news|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2010/02/army_camo_decision_021710w/|title=MultiCam recommended for Afghanistan|last=Cox|first=Matthew|date=February 19, 2010|publisher=ArmyTimes|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Abscam investigation===
{{Main|Abscam}}
[[File:Murtha Casey.jpg|thumb|John Murtha with [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[Robert P. Casey]].]]
In 1980, during his fourth term as a Congressman, Murtha became embroiled in the [[Abscam]] investigation, which targeted dozens of congressmen. The investigation entailed FBI operatives posing as intermediaries for Saudi nationals hoping to bribe their way through the immigration process into the United States. Murtha met with these operatives and was videotaped. He did agree to testify against [[Frank Thompson]] (D-NJ) and [[John Michael Murphy|John Murphy]] (D-NY), the two Congressmen mentioned as participants in the deal at the same meeting and who were later videotaped placing the cash bribes in their trousers. The FBI videotaped Murtha responding to an offer of $50,000, with Murtha saying, "I'm not interested... at this point. [If] we do business for a while, maybe I'll be interested, maybe I won't," right after Murtha had offered to provide names of businesses and banks in his district where money could be invested legally.<ref>[http://spectator.org/archives/2006/09/29/murtha-and-the-fbi-the-directo The American Spectator<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526060727/http://spectator.org/archives/2006/09/29/murtha-and-the-fbi-the-directo |date=May 26, 2013 }}</ref> The U.S. Attorney's Office reasoned that Murtha's intent was to obtain investment in his district. Full length viewing of the tape shows Murtha citing prospective investment opportunities that could return "500 or 1000" miners to work.

In September 2006, the [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) listed Murtha under Five Members to Watch in its Second Annual Most Corrupt Members of Congress Report. The report cited Murtha's steering of defense appropriations to clients of KSA Consulting, which employed his brother Robert, and the PMA Group, founded by Paul Magliocchetti, a former senior staffer on the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beyonddelay.org/summaries/murtha.php |title=Rep.

Still, in early 2005 Murtha argued against the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. "A premature withdrawal of our troops based on a political timetable could rapidly devolve into a civil war which would leave America's foreign policy in disarray as countries question not only America's judgment but also its perseverance," he stated.<ref name=CBSexit>{{Cite news |title=Murtha Details His Exit Strategy |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/13/60minutes/main1208423_page3.shtml|work=[[60 Minutes]] |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>

Brent Bozell III]]'s [[Media Research Center]]) published an article that "quoted Murtha opponents as questioning the circumstances surrounding the awarding of his two Purple Hearts."<ref name=wp>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/13/AR2006011301736.html |title=Web Site Attacks Critic of War |accessdate=2007-09-26 | work=The Washington Post | first1=Howard | last1=Kurtz | first2=Shailagh | last2=Murray | date=2006-01-14}}</ref> The attack recalled the "[[swiftboating]]" tactic used against Senator [[John Kerry]] two years early.<ref name=wp /> A Murtha spokesman called the allegations "an attempt to distract attention from what's happening in Iraq."<ref name=wp />

===2005 Resolution on removing American forces from Iraq===
On November 17, 2005, Murtha submitted H.J. Res. 73 in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], calling for the redeployment of U.S. troops in Iraq, saying, "The U.S. cannot accomplish anything further in Iraq militarily. It is time to bring them home."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Edward |last=Epstein |title=Murtha calls for immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/17/MNGV2FPT755.DTL |work=SFGate.com |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2005-11-17 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>

The bill cited lack of progress towards stabilizing Iraq, the possibility that a draft would be required to sustain sufficient troop numbers, Iraqi disapproval of US forces and approval of attacks on the soldiers, and the increasing costs of the war. The bill proposed that deployment to Iraq be suspended and that US Marines establish an "over-the-horizon" presence in nearby countries.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=hj109-73 H.J. Res. 73]</ref>

Murtha's comments forced a heated debate on the floor of the House on November 18.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Lawmakers reject calls for troop pullout Conflict in Iraq |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10097801 |work=NBC News |publisher=Associated Press|date=2005-11-19 |accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> Republicans led by [[Duncan L. Hunter|Duncan Hunter]] of [[California]], chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]], responded by proposing their own resolution (H. Res. 571), which many Republicans said was intended to demonstrate that those calling for immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq were "out of the mainstream." Murtha himself took the floor during debate on the resolution after the Democrats yielded all their time to him, and denounced the Hunter resolution as a sham. As expected, Hunter's resolution was defeated, with only three congressmen voting aye.

===Jean Schmidt and the "coward" controversy===
On November 19, 2005, during debate on adopting the rule for the resolution, Congresswoman [[Jean Schmidt]] (R-Ohio) made a statement attributed to [[Danny Bubp]], an [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio state Representative]] and Marine Corps reservist. The statement, "He also asked me to give Congressman Murtha a message: that cowards cut and run; Marines never do," was seen as an unwarranted "cheap shot" against Murtha, and outraged Democrats brought House business to a halt for ten minutes until Schmidt herself asked and received permission to withdraw her comments. Bubp has since stated that he never mentioned Murtha when making the quoted comment. He added that he would never question the courage of a fellow Marine. Bubp later said, "I don't want to be interjected into this. I wish (Congresswoman Schmidt) never used my name."<ref>''Cincinnati Enquirer'':{{cite web|url=http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/NEWS01/511220352/1020 |title=Schmidt in war of words |accessdate=2013-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060211084403/http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/NEWS01/511220352/1020 |archive-date=2006-02-11 }} .

===Haditha, Iraq, killings===
{{Main|Haditha killings}}
The [[Haditha killings|Haditha incident]] occurred on November 19, 2005, and since then there have been differing accounts of exactly what took place.

In November 2005 Murtha announced that a military investigation into the Haditha killings had concluded that U.S. Marines had intentionally killed innocent civilians.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/587/story/629869.html |title=Everything I said has turned out to be true |publisher=McClatchy News Services |date=2006-08-22 |first=Margaret |last=Talev |accessdate = 2006-10-18 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Referring to the first report about Haditha<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1174682,00.html |title=One Morning in Haditha: U.S. Marines killed 15 Iraqi civilians in their homes last November.

<blockquote>It's much worse than reported in Time magazine. There was no fire fight. There was no IED that killed these innocent people. Our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood. And that's what the report is going to tell.</blockquote>

The Marine Corps responded to Murtha's announcement by stating that "there is an ongoing investigation; therefore, any comment at this time would be inappropriate and could undermine the investigatory and possible legal process."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12838343|title=Lawmaker: Marines killed Iraqis 'in cold blood'|publisher=NBC News|date=2006-05-17|first=Mike |last=Viqueira |accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref> Murtha was criticized by conservatives for presenting a version of events as simple fact before an official investigation had been concluded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTFmYmY2N2E5MmEwZTdkMWI0NjVmYWI2NmU5N2VhOTQ= |title=Profile in Disgrace |accessdate=2006-10-28 |last=Editors |date=2006-05-23 |work=National Review Online |publisher=[[National Review]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019011314/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTFmYmY2N2E5MmEwZTdkMWI0NjVmYWI2NmU5N2VhOTQ= |archive-date=2006-10-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In August 2006, Staff Sergeant [[Frank Wuterich]] filed a lawsuit against Murtha for character defamation during an ongoing investigation into the Haditha incident. In April 2009 this suit was dismissed by a federal appeals court, which ruled that Murtha could not be sued because he was acting in his official role as a lawmaker when he made the statements.<ref>Pickler, Nedra.
