Present Laos traces its historic and cultural identity to [[Lan Xang]], which existed from the 14th century to the 18th century as one of the largest kingdoms in Southeast Asia.<ref name="Stuart-Fox">{{Cite book|title=The Lao Kingdom of Lan Xang: Rise and Decline|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|publisher=White Lotus Press|year=1998|isbn=974-8434-33-8|pages=49}}</ref> Because of its central geographical location in Southeast Asia, the kingdom became a hub for overland trade and became wealthy economically and culturally.<ref name="Stuart-Fox" /> After a period of internal conflict, Lan Xang broke into three separate kingdoms—[[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], and [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]]. In 1893, the three territories came under a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]] and were united to form what is now known as Laos. It briefly gained independence in 1945 after [[History of Laos to 1945#Japanese occupation of Laos|Japanese occupation]] but was recolonised by [[France]] until it won autonomy in 1949. Laos became independent in 1953, with a [[constitutional monarchy]] under [[Sisavang Vong]]. A post-independence [[Laotian Civil War|civil war]] began, which saw the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|communist resistance]], supported by the [[Soviet Union]], fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the United States. After the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, the [[Communism|communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] came to power, ending the civil war. Laos was then dependent on military and economic aid from the Soviet Union until its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] in 1991.

Laos is a member of the [[Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement]], the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]], [[East Asia Summit]], and [[La Francophonie]]. Laos applied for membership of the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1997; on 2 February 2013, it was granted full membership.<ref name="wto">{{cite web | url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/lao_e.htm | title=Lao People's Democratic Republic and the WTO | publisher=World Trade Organization | access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> It is a [[One-party state|one-party]] socialist republic, espousing [[Marxism–Leninism]] governed by the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]].

The politically and culturally dominant [[Lao people]] make up 53.2% of the population, mostly in the lowlands. [[Austroasiatic languages|Mon-Khmer]] groups, the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], and other indigenous hill tribes live in the foothills and mountains. Laos' strategies for development are based on [[Electricity generation|generating electricity]] from rivers and selling the power to its neighbours, namely Thailand, China, and Vietnam, as well as its initiative to become a "land-linked" nation, as evidenced by the [[Transport in Laos#Railways|construction of four new railways connecting Laos and neighbours]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/china-train-project-runs-roughshod-over-laos/|title=China train project runs roughshod over Laos|last=Janssen|first=Peter|work=Asia Times|access-date=19 January 2019}}</ref><ref name="bbcdam">{{cite news |title=Laos approves Xayaburi 'mega' dam on Mekong |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20203072 |newspaper=BBC News |date=5 November 2012}}</ref> Laos has been referred to as one of Southeast Asia and Pacific's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest growing economies]] by the [[World Bank]] with annual GDP growth averaging 7.7% since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/lao/overview|title=Lao PDR [Overview]|website=World Bank|date=March 2018|access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news|url = https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2011/01/10/454221/laos-securities-exchange-to-start-trading/?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true |title = Laos Securities Exchange to start trading |work= Financial Times |date = 10 January 2011 |access-date = 23 January 2011}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The English word ''Laos'' was coined by the [[French colonial empire|French]], who united the three Lao kingdoms in [[French Indochina]] in 1893 and named the country as the plural of the dominant and most common ethnic group, the [[Lao people]].<ref name="tripsavvy" /> English speakers often mispronounce the word 'Laos', falsely believing that it should be pronounced with a silent 's', however the 's' in Laos should not be silent.<ref name="tripsavvy">{{cite web |last1=Rodgers |first1=Greg |title=How to Say "Laos" |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/how-to-say-laos-3976795 |website=TripSavvy |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="fodors">{{cite web |last1=Ragusa |first1=Nina |title=10 Things You Need to Know Before Visiting Laos |url=https://www.fodors.com/world/asia/laos/experiences/news/10-things-you-need-to-know-before-visiting-laos |website=Fodors |access-date=18 March 2020 |date=4 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Meaning of Laos in English|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/laos|website=Cambridge Dictionary|access-date=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Laos – definition and synonyms|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/laos|website=Macmillan Dictionary|access-date=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of Laos by Merriam-Webster |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Laos |website=Merriam-Webster |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> In the [[Lao language]], the country's name is ''[[Mueang#Laos|Muang Lao]]'' ({{lang|lo|ເມືອງລາວ}}) or ''Pathet Lao'' ({{lang|lo|ປະເທດລາວ}}), both of which literally mean 'Lao Country'.<ref name="Kislenko2009">{{cite book |last=Kislenko |first=Arne |title=Culture and customs of Laos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6CuONua48MC&pg=PR20 |year=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn = 978-0-313-33977-6 |page = 20}}</ref>

=== Lan Xang ===
{{Main|Lan Xang}}
[[File:Fa Ngum-Vtne1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Fa Ngum]], founder of the [[Lan Xang]] Kingdom]]

Laos traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang ('million elephants'), which was founded in the 14th century by a Lao prince, [[Fa Ngum]],<ref name="Coedes">{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|author-link= George Coedès|editor= Walter F.

Fa Ngum, with 10,000 [[Khmer people|Khmer]] troops, conquered many Lao principalities in the [[Mekong]] river basin, culminating in the capture of [[Vientiane]]. Ngum was descended from a long line of Lao kings that traced back to Khoun Boulom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fa-Ngum|title=Fa Ngum|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=December 23, 2019}}</ref> He made [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] the state religion, and Lan Xang prospered.

Fa Ngum's eldest son, Oun Heuan, ascended to the throne under the name [[Samsenethai]] and reigned for 43&nbsp;years. Lan Xang became an important trade centre during Samsenthai's reign, but after his death in 1421 it collapsed into warring factions for nearly a century.<ref>Sanda Simms, ch. 3, "Through Chaos to a New Order", in ''The Kingdoms of Laos'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2013). {{ISBN|9781136863370}}</ref>

In 1520, [[Photisarath]] came to the throne and moved the capital from [[Luang Prabang]] to Vientiane to avoid a Burmese invasion. [[Setthathirath]] became king in 1548, after his father was killed, and ordered the construction of what became the symbol of Laos, [[Pha That Luang|That Luang]]. Settathirath disappeared in the mountains on his way back from a military expedition into Cambodia, and Lan Xang fell into more than seventy years of instability, involving both Burmese invasion and civil war.<ref>Sanda Simms, ch. 6, "Seventy Years of Anarchy", in ''The Kingdoms of Laos'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2013). {{ISBN|9781136863370}}; see also P.C.

In 1637, when [[Sourigna Vongsa]] ascended the throne, Lan Xang further expanded its frontiers. His reign is often regarded as Laos's golden age. When he died without an heir, the kingdom split into three principalities. Between 1763 and 1769, Burmese armies overran northern Laos and annexed [[Luang Prabang]], while [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] eventually came under [[Thailand|Siamese]] [[suzerainty]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Askew, Marc.|title=Vientiane : transformations of a Lao landscape|year=2010|orig-year= 2007|publisher=Routledge|others=Logan, William Stewart, 1942–, Long, Colin, 1966–|isbn=978-0-415-59662-6|location=London|oclc=68416667}}</ref>

[[File:FrenchLaos1953.png|thumb|French [[Raoul Salan|General Salan]] and [[Sisavang Vatthana|Prince Sisavang Vatthana]] in Luang Prabang, 4 May 1953]]
The First Indochina War took place across French Indochina and eventually led to French defeat and the signing of a peace accord for Laos at the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference of 1954]]. In 1960, amidst a series of rebellions in the [[Kingdom of Laos]], fighting broke out between the [[Royal Lao Army]] (RLA) and the communist [[North Vietnam]]ese and [[Soviet Union]]-backed Pathet Lao guerillas. A second Provisional Government of National Unity formed by Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] in 1962 was unsuccessful, and the situation steadily deteriorated into large scale [[Laotian Civil War|civil war]] between the Royal Laotian government and the Pathet Lao. The Pathet Lao were backed militarily by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and the [[Viet Cong]].<ref name="bbc" /><ref name="britannica" />

Laos was a key part of the [[Vietnam War]] since parts of Laos were invaded and occupied by [[North Vietnam]] for use as a supply route for its war against [[South Vietnam]]. In response, the United States initiated a bombing campaign against the PAVN positions, supported regular and irregular anticommunist forces in Laos, and supported [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[CIA activities in Laos|incursions into Laos]].<ref name=bbc /><ref name=britannica />

In 1968, the PAVN launched a multi-division attack to help the Pathet Lao to fight the RLA. The attack resulted in the RLA largely demobilising, leaving the conflict to irregular ethnic [[Hmong people|Hmong]] forces of the "Secret Army" backed by the United States and Thailand, and led by General [[Vang Pao]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Massive aerial bombardment against the PAVN/Pathet Lao forces were carried out by the United States to prevent the collapse of the Kingdom of Laos central government, and to deny the use of the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] to attack U.S. forces in South Vietnam.<ref name=bbc /> Between 1964 and 1973, the U.S. dropped two million tons of bombs on Laos, nearly equal to the 2.1&nbsp;million tons of bombs the U.S. dropped on Europe and Asia during all of World War II, making Laos the most heavily bombed country in history relative to the size of its population; ''[[The New York Times]]'' notes this was "nearly a ton for every person in Laos".<ref>{{cite web|author-link1=Ben Kiernan|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|last2=Owen|first2=Taylor|url=http://apjjf.org/2015/13/16/Ben-Kiernan/4313.html|title=Making More Enemies than We Kill?

{{Main|Geography of Laos}}
[[File:Mekong River (Luang Prabang).jpg|thumb|[[Mekong River]] flowing through [[Luang Prabang]] ]]
[[File:Laos ricefields.JPG|thumb|[[Paddy fields]] in Laos]]
Laos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, and it lies mostly between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14°]] and [[23rd parallel north|23°N]] (a small area is south of 14°), and longitudes [[100th meridian east|100°]] and [[108th meridian east|108°E]]. Its thickly forested landscape consists mostly of rugged mountains, the highest of which is [[Phou Bia]] at {{convert|2818|m|ft|0}}, with some plains and plateaus. The Mekong River forms a large part of the western boundary with Thailand, where the mountains of the [[Annamite Range]] form most of the eastern border with Vietnam and the [[Luang Prabang Range]] the northwestern border with the [[Thai highlands]]. There are two plateaux, the [[Xiangkhoang Plateau|Xiangkhoang]] in the north and the [[Bolaven Plateau]] at the southern end. Laos can be considered to consist of three geographical areas: north, central, and south.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|title=Nsc Lao Pdr|url=http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/Populationcensus2005/PopulationCensus2005_chapter2.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123082302/http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/Populationcensus2005/PopulationCensus2005_chapter2.htm|archive-date=23 January 2012|publisher=Nsc.gov.la}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map LAO present.svg|thumb|Laos map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The climate is mostly tropical savanna and influenced by the [[monsoon]] pattern.<ref name="climate">{{cite web|title=Laos – Climate|url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/45.htm|access-date=23 January 2011|publisher=Countrystudies.us}}</ref> There is a distinct rainy season from May to November, followed by a dry season from December to April.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Laos}}

Laos is divided into 17 [[Provinces of Laos|provinces]] (''khoueng'') and one prefecture (''kampheng nakhon''), which includes the capital city Vientiane (''Nakhon Louang Viangchan'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: Laos – The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref> A new province, [[Xaisomboun Province]], was established on 13 December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tourismlaos.org/show_province.php?Cont_ID=919|title=ABOUT XAYSOMBOUN|website=www.tourismlaos.org|access-date=23 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507160148/http://tourismlaos.org/show_province.php?Cont_ID=919|archive-date=7 May 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Provinces are further divided into [[Districts of Laos|districts]] (''muang'') and then villages (''ban'').

The Lao People's Democratic Republic is one of the world's only [[socialist state]]s openly endorsing [[communism]]. The only legal political party is the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] (LPRP). With [[one-party state]] status of Laos, the [[General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party|General Secretary]] ([[party leader]]) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the [[supreme leader]].<ref name=bbc>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15355605|title=Laos profile|date=9 January 2018|access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref> The head of state is [[President of Laos|President]] [[Bounnhang Vorachith]], who is also [[General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: Laos — The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>

The head of government is Prime Minister [[Thongloun Sisoulith]], who is also a member of the Lao People's Revolutionary [[Politburo of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party|Party's Politburo]]. Government policies are determined by the party through the all-powerful eleven-member [[Politburo of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party]] and the 61-member [[Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party]].

Laos's first French-written and monarchical constitution was promulgated on 11 May 1947, and declared Laos an independent state within the [[French Union]]. The revised constitution of 11 May 1957 omitted reference to the French Union, though close educational, health and technical ties with the former colonial power persisted. The 1957 document was abrogated in December 1975, when a communist people's republic was proclaimed. A new constitution was adopted in 1991 and enshrined a "leading role" for the LPRP.<ref name=bbc />
[[File:Flag of LPRP.svg|thumb|200px|Flag of the ruling [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party]]]]

The National Assembly, which essentially acts as a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for the LPRP, approves all new laws, although the executive branch retains authority to issue binding decrees.

=== Hmong conflict ===
Some Hmong groups fought as CIA-backed units on the royalist side in the [[Laotian Civil War]]. After the Pathet Lao took over the country in 1975, the conflict continued in isolated pockets. In 1977, a communist newspaper promised the party would hunt down the "American collaborators" and their families "to the last root".<ref name="timesonline2006">{{cite news |url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article690367.ece |work=The Times |date = 30 July 2006 |title = No way out |location=London}}</ref> As many as 200,000 Hmong went into exile in Thailand, with many ending up in the U.S. Other Hmong fighters hid out in mountains in Xiangkhouang Province for many years, with a remnant emerging from the jungle in 2003.<ref name="timesonline2006" />

In 1989, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), with the support of the U.S. government, instituted the [[Comprehensive Plan of Action]], a programme to stem the tide of [[Vietnamese boat people|Indochinese refugees]] from Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Under the plan, refugee status was evaluated through a screening process. Recognised asylum seekers were given resettlement opportunities, while the remaining refugees were to be repatriated under guarantee of safety. After talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to repatriate the 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including several thousand Hmong people. Very few of the Lao refugees, however, were willing to return voluntarily.<ref>"Laos agrees to voluntary repatriation of refugees in Thailand", U.P.I., 5 June 1991.</ref> Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the Thai government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to Laos voluntarily, with development assistance from UNHCR, allegations of forced repatriation surfaced.<ref>"Lao Refugees Return Home Under European Union Repatriation Program", Associated Press Worldstream, 22 11, 1994.

In 1993, Vue Mai, a former Hmong soldier and leader of the largest Hmong refugee camp in Thailand, who had been recruited by the U.S.&nbsp;Embassy in [[Bangkok]] to return to Laos as proof of the repatriation programme's success, disappeared in Vientiane. According to the U.S.&nbsp;Committee for Refugees, he was arrested by Lao security forces and was never seen again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-05-01/news/25827599_1_vang-pao-vientiane-lao-government|title=Hmong Leader's Vanishing In Laos Reverberates in U.S.|access-date=6 September 2016}}</ref> Following the Vue Mai incident, debate over the Hmong's planned repatriation to Laos intensified greatly, especially in the United States, where it drew strong opposition from many [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] and some human rights advocates. In a 23 October 1995 ''[[National Review]]'' article, [[Michael Johns (policy analyst)|Michael Johns]], the former [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy expert and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[White House]] aide, labelled the Hmong's repatriation a [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] "betrayal", describing the Hmong as a people "who have spilled their blood in defense of American geopolitical interests".<ref name="web.archive.org">Johns, Michael (23 October 1995) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705214752/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n20_v47/ai_17443642 "Acts of Betrayal: Persecution of Hmong"]. ''National Review''.</ref> Debate on the issue escalated quickly. In an effort to halt the planned repatriation, the Republican-led [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] both appropriated funds for the remaining Thailand-based Hmong to be immediately resettled in the United States; Clinton, however, responded by promising a veto of the legislation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In their opposition of the repatriation plans, Democratic and Republican Members of Congress challenged the Clinton administration's position that the government of Laos was not systematically violating Hmong human rights. U.S. Representative [[Steve Gunderson]], for instance, told a Hmong gathering: "I do not enjoy standing up and saying to my government that you are not telling the truth, but if that is necessary to defend truth and justice, I will do that."<ref name="web.archive.org" /> Republicans called several Congressional hearings on alleged persecution of the Hmong in Laos in an apparent attempt to generate further support for their opposition to the Hmong's repatriation to Laos.

Ostensibly, the [[Constitution of Laos]] that was promulgated in 1991 and amended in 2003 contains most key safeguards for human rights. For example, Article 8 makes it clear that Laos is a [[multinational state]] and is committed to equality between ethnic groups. The constitution also contains provisions for [[gender equality]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]], and freedom of press and assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2003 Laos Constitution|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Laos_2003.pdf?lang=en}}</ref> On 25 September 2009, Laos ratified the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], nine years after signing the treaty.

[[Luang Prabang]] and [[Vat Phou]] are both [[UNESCO World Heritage]] sites. Major festivals include Lao New Year celebrated around 13–15 April and involves a [[water festival]] similar but more subdued than that of Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.

The Lao National Tourism Administration, related government agencies and the private sector are working together to realise the vision put forth in the country's National Ecotourism Strategy and Action Plan. This includes decreasing the environmental and cultural impact of tourism; increasing awareness in the importance of ethnic groups and biological diversity; providing a source of income to conserve, sustain and manage the Lao protected area network and cultural heritage sites; and emphasizing the need for tourism zoning and management plans for sites that will be developed as [[ecotourism]] destinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotourismlaos.com/laoecotourism.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122030330/http://ecotourismlaos.com/laoecotourism.htm|archive-date=22 November 2010|title=The Lao People's Democratic Republic's Vision for Ecotourism |access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref>

=== Infrastructure ===
{{Main|Transport in Laos|Telecommunications in Laos}}
[[File:nam ou 1.jpg|thumb|Rivers are an important means of transport in Laos.]]
The main international airports are Vientiane's [[Wattay International Airport]] and [[Luang Prabang International Airport]] with [[Pakse International Airport]] also having a few international flights. The national carrier is [[Lao Airlines]]. Other carriers serving the country include [[Bangkok Airways]], [[Vietnam Airlines]], [[AirAsia]], [[Thai Airways]], [[China Eastern Airlines]] and [[SilkAir]].

Much of Laos lacks adequate infrastructure. Laos has no railways, except a short link to connect Vientiane with Thailand over the [[First Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge|Thai–Lao Friendship Bridge]]. A short [[portage railway]], the [[Don Det–Don Khon railway|Don Det–Don Khon narrow gauge railway]] was built by the French in [[Don Det]] and Don Khon in [[Champasak Province]] but has been closed since the 1940s. In the late 1920s, work began on the Thakhek–Tan Ap railway that would have run between [[Thakhek]], [[Khammouane Province]] and [[Tân Ấp station]] in Vietnam through the [[Mụ Giạ Pass]]. The scheme was aborted in the 1930s. The major roads connecting the major urban centres, in particular [[Route 13 (Laos)|Route 13]], have been significantly upgraded in recent years, but villages far from major roads can be reached only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year-round.

There is limited external and internal telecommunication, but mobile phones have become widespread in urban centres. In many rural areas electricity is at least partly available. [[Songthaew]]s (pick-up trucks with benches) are used in the country for long-distance and local public transport.

=== Water supply ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Laos}}
According to the World Bank data conducted in 2014, Laos has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets on water and sanitation regarding UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme. However, as of 2018, there are approximately 1.9&nbsp;million Lao population could not access to improved water supply and 2.4&nbsp;million people without access to improved sanitation.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/295731467999376153/pdf/100892-WSP-P131116-AUTHOR-Susanna-Smets-Box393244B-PUBLIC-WSP-SERIES-WSP-LaoPDR-WSS-Turning-Finance-into-Service-for-the-Future.pdf|title=Water Supply and Sanitation in Lao PDR|website=www.worldbank.org|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Laos}}
The term "Laotian" does not necessarily refer to the Lao language, ethnic Lao people, language or customs. It is a political term that includes the non-ethnic Lao groups within Laos and identifies them as "Laotian" because of their political citizenship. Laos has the youngest population of any country in Asia with a median age of 21.6 years.<ref name=factbook>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html|title=Laos|date=17 February 2019|website=Central Intelligence Agency: The World Factbook|access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>

Laos's population was estimated at 7.45&nbsp;million in 2020, dispersed unevenly across the country. Most people live in valleys of the Mekong River and its tributaries. Vientiane prefecture, the capital and largest city, had about 683,000 residents in 2020.<ref name=factbook />

=== Ethnicity ===
The people of Laos are often categorised by their distribution by [[elevation]]: (lowlands, midlands and upper high lands) as this somewhat correlates with ethnic groupings. More than half of the nation's population is ethnic Lao—the principal lowland inhabitants, and the politically and culturally dominant people of Laos.<ref name="UN Demographic Yearbooks">[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2.htm#2001 UN Demographic Yearbooks]</ref> The Lao belong to the [[Tai languages|Tai]] linguistic group<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0lmQAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA680&ots=TpEnWhLSgV&dq=kra%3DKadai&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=kra=Kadai&f=false Diller, Anthony; Edmondson, Jerry; Luo, Yongxian (2004).

In the central and southern mountains, [[Mon-Khmer]]-speaking groups, known as [[Lao Theung]] or mid-slope Laotians, predominate. Other terms are Khmu, Khamu (Kammu) or Kha as the Lao Loum refer to them to indicate their [[Austroasiatic]] language affiliation. However, the latter is considered pejorative, meaning 'slave'. They were the indigenous inhabitants of northern Laos. Some [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Laotian Chinese]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno%3D1163%26no%3D1163%26level%3DB |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104195124/http://www.ocac.gov.tw/english/public/public.asp?selno=1163&no=1163&level=B |archive-date=2011-01-04 }}</ref> and [[Thai people|Thai]] minorities remain, particularly in the towns, but many left after independence in the late 1940s, many of whom relocated either to Vietnam, Hong Kong, or to France.

[[Hill people]] and minority cultures of Laos such as the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Yao people|Yao (Mien)]] ([[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]]), [[Yao people|Dao]], [[Shan people|Shan]], and several [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] speaking peoples have lived in isolated regions of Laos for many years. Mountain/hill tribes of mixed ethno/cultural-linguistic heritage are found in northern Laos, which include the [[Lua people|Lua]] and [[Khmu people]] who are indigenous to Laos. Collectively, they are known as [[Lao Sung|Lao Soung]] or highland Laotians. Lao Soung account for about 10% of the population.<ref name="britannica" />

=== Languages ===
The official and majority language is [[Lao language|Lao]], a language of the [[Tai languages|Tai-Kadai]] [[language family]]. However, only slightly more than half of the population speaks Lao natively. The remainder, particularly in rural areas, speak ethnic minority languages. The [[Lao alphabet]], which evolved sometime between the 13th and 14th centuries, was derived from the ancient [[Khmer script]] and is very similar to Thai script.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2049433|jstor=2049433|title=Languages and Literatures of Indochina|journal=The Far Eastern Quarterly|volume=6|issue=4|pages=379–389|year=1947|last1=Benedict|first1=Paul K.}}</ref> Languages like [[Khmu language|Khmu]] (Austroasiatic) and [[Hmong language|Hmong]] ([[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]]) are spoken by minorities, particularly in the midland and highland areas. A number of [[Laotian sign languages]] are used in areas with high rates of congenital deafness.<ref name=britannica />

[[French language|French]] is still commonly used in government and commerce. Over a third of Laos's students are educated through the medium of French, with French being compulsory for all other students. Throughout the country signage is bilingual in Lao and French, with French being predominant. [[English language|English]], the language of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[ASEAN]]), has become increasingly studied in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/asie/Laos.htm |title=Languages of Laos |publisher=[[Laval University]] |access-date=9 July 2012}}</ref> It is also a member of the French organisation [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]].

=== Religion ===

Sixty-six percent of Laotians were [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], 1.5 percent Christian, 0.1 percent Muslim, 0.1 percent Jewish, and 32.3 percent were other or traditional (mostly practitioners of [[Tai folk religion|Satsana Phi]]) in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Global Religious Landscape; Table: Religious Composition by Country |url=https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf |website=Pew Research |access-date=16 April 2020 |page=47 |date=2010}}</ref><ref name="cia.gov" /> Buddhism has long been one of the most important social forces in Laos.

Theravada Buddhism is a dominant influence in Lao culture. It is reflected throughout the country from language to the temple and in art, literature, and performing arts. Many elements of Lao culture predate Buddhism, however. For example, Laotian music is dominated by its national musical instrument, the [[Khene|khaen]], a type of bamboo [[Pan flute|pipe]] that has prehistoric origins. The khaen traditionally accompanied the singer in ''[[Mor lam|lam]]'', the dominant style of [[folk music]].

[[Glutinous rice|Sticky rice]] is a staple food and has cultural and religious significance to the Lao people. Sticky rice is generally preferred over [[jasmine rice]], and sticky rice cultivation and production is thought to have originated in Laos. There are many traditions and rituals associated with rice production in different environments and among many ethnic groups. For example, Khammu farmers in Luang Prabang plant the rice variety [[Khao Kam]] in small quantities near the hut in memory of dead parents, or at the edge of the rice field to indicate that parents are still alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/case-studies/LAO/Evaluation-Synthesis-on-Rice.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702234215/http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/case-studies/LAO/Evaluation-Synthesis-on-Rice.pdf|archive-date=2 July 2007|title=Evaluation Synthesis of Rice in Lao PDR|access-date=27 June 2010}}</ref>
