'''Tropicana Products, Inc.''' is an American multinational [[company]] which primarily makes fruit-based beverages. It was founded in 1947 by [[Anthony T. Rossi]] in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Florida]]. Since 1998, it has been owned by [[PepsiCo]]. Tropicana's headquarters are in [[Chicago]]. The company specializes in the production of [[orange juice]].

== History ==

=== Anthony T. Rossi ===
[[Anthony T. Rossi]] was born in [[Sicily]] and educated to high school level. He immigrated to the United States when he was 21 years old. He drove a taxi, was a grocer in New York, farmer in Virginia, and then moved to Florida in 1940 where he farmed and was a restaurateur. His first involvement with the [[Florida]] [[citrus]] industry was fresh fruit gift boxes sold by [[Macy's]] and [[Gimbels]] department stores in [[New York City, New York|New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name="fundinguniverse">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Tropicana-Products-Inc-Company-History.html|title=History of Tropicana Products, Inc. – FundingUniverse|work=fundinguniverse.com}}</ref>

In 1947, Rossi settled in Palmetto, Florida and began packing fruit gift boxes and jars of sectioned fruit for salads under the name Manatee River Packing Company. As the fruit segment business grew, the company moved to a larger location in East Bradenton, Florida and changed its name to Fruit Industries.<ref name="fundinguniverse" /> The ingredients for the fresh fruit salads on the menu of New York’s famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel were supplied by Fruit Industries.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/27/us/anthony-rossi-92-tropicana-founder-and-industry-leader.html "Anthony Rossi, 92, Tropicana Founder And Industry Leader"], Jan. 27, 1993</ref> At the East Bradenton location, Rossi began producing frozen concentrated orange juice as a natural extension of the fruit section business.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

=== Evolution of Tropicana Pure Premium ===
In 1952, with growth of the orange juice business in mind, Rossi purchased the Grapefruit Canning Company in Bradenton.<ref name="History" /> The fresh fruit segments and orange juice business were so successful that he discontinued production of fruit boxes.<ref>Bonocore, Joseph J: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnWkRheZoHYC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=The+fresh+fruit+segments+and+orange+juice+business+were+so+successful+that+he+discontinued+production+of+fruit+boxes.&source=bl&ots=9t-sTWkcem&sig=7kMOZqTp745hpH_2V6h3LxM-5cM&hl=en&ei=WdsWSrX8HeOVlAeKkdHdCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 "Raised Italian-American]". Page 167. iUniverse, 2005. Google Book Search. Retrieved on May 26, 2009.</ref> He developed [[flash pasteurization]] in 1954, a process that rapidly raised the temperature of juice for a short time to preserve its fresh taste.<ref name="fundinguniverse" /> For the first time, consumers could have the fresh taste of pure not-from-concentrate juice in a ready to serve chilled package.<ref name="garybeene">{{cite web|url=http://www.garybeene.com/pepsi/pep-now.htm|title=Tropicana North America|work=garybeene.com}}</ref> The juice, Tropicana Pure Premium, became the company’s flagship product.<ref name="garybeene" />

The company developed a trademarked cartoon [[mascot]] for the brand called Tropic-Ana, a barefoot young girl carrying oranges on her head and wearing clothing that resembles a Hawaiian [[grass skirt]] and [[lei (garland)|lei]]. She appeared prominently on the juice cartons and even the train cars used to transport the juice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropic-Ana, the mascot of Tropicana orange juice|url=http://www.brandlandusa.com/2008/10/30/wheres-tropic-ana-bring-her-back/|publisher=BrandlandUSA|accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref> Her image was diminished and finally phased out during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Meyer|title=Bring Back Tropic Ana|url=http://allenmeyerdesign.com/2010/02/bring-back-tropic-ana/|publisher=Allen Meyer|accessdate=13 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222190911/http://allenmeyerdesign.com/2010/02/bring-back-tropic-ana/|archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref>

[[Ed Price (Florida politician)|Ed Price]] was hired as executive vice president and director in 1955 and represented the company as chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission.<ref name=OBIT>{{cite news|last=Jones, Jr.|first=James A.|title=Former senator and community leader Edgar H.

In 1957, the company’s name was changed to Tropicana Products, Inc. to reflect the growing appeal of the Tropicana brand.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

=== Shipping innovations ===
{{Main|Juice Train}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}} 
Tropicana purchased{{when|date=December 2018}} one million dollars worth of refrigerated trucks to deliver Pure Premium.<ref name="History">Nickel, K., Stout, M. & Snyder, L.  (2003).  A History of Tropicana.  Tropicana Products, Inc.</ref> Soon, 2,000 dairies delivered Pure Premium orange juice to the doorsteps of consumers each morning.<ref name="History" /> By 1958, a ship, S.S. Tropicana, was taking {{convert|1.5|e6USgal|impgal m3}} of juice to New York each week from the new base at [[Cape Canaveral, Florida|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]].<ref name="fundinguniverse" /> From 1960 to 1970, Tropicana utilized TOFC (trailers on flatbed cars) to move the juice more efficiently.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

In 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped as finished goods via refrigerated [[boxcars]] in one weekly round-trip from Florida to [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[New Jersey]]. By the following year, the company was operating two 65-car unit trains a week, each carrying around {{convert|1|e6USgal|impgal m3}} of juice. The "Great White Juice Train" (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 100-[[short ton]] insulated boxcars fabricated in the [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]] shops of [[Fruit Growers Express]]) commenced service on June 7, 1971 over the {{convert|1,250|mi|km|adj=on}} route. An additional 100 cars were soon incorporated into the fleet, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant on hot days. In 2004, Tropicana’s rail fleet of 514 cars traveled over {{convert|35,000,000|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} – a method that is three times more fuel-efficient than other shipping methods.

=== Going public and expansion: 1969–1997 ===
Tropicana Products, Inc. went public in 1969. The stock was first sold over the counter but gained a listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the symbol TOJ. In the same year, it became the first company in the citrus industry to operate its own plastic container manufacturing plant.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

Executive vice president Ed Price, who served two terms in the Florida Senate (1958–1966), resigned his position in 1972, but remained on the board of directors until 1983.<ref name=OBIT />

Rossi sold Tropicana to [[Beatrice Foods]] in 1978. He then retired and was inducted into the ''Florida Agricultural Hall of Fame'' in 1987. Under Beatrice, Tropicana had the financial resources to develop more products. In 1985, Tropicana debuted Tropicana Pure Premium HomeStyle orange juice, which featured added pulp.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

In the 1980s, Tropicana made history by being the first company to be acquired by [[Seagram|The Seagram Company, Ltd.]]. In the decade that followed, they introduced new juice beverage creations, including the orange line of bottled and frozen juice blends.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

In the early nineties under Seagram, Tropicana also began to expand distribution to global markets. They formed a partnership to process and distribute Kirin-Tropicana juices in [[Japan]]. By that time, the company was also distributing Tropicana Pure Premium in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Argentina]], [[Panama]] and [[Sweden]]. As the 1990s continued, Tropicana further expanded internationally, entering several more [[Latin America]]n countries, [[Hong Kong]] and [[China]].<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

Seagram Beverage Group acquired [[Dole Food Company]]'s global juice business in 1995, including the Dole brands in North America, and Dole, Fruvita, Looza and Juice Bowl juices and nectars in Europe.  Dole was operated under Tropicana Dole Beverages North America and Tropicana Dole Beverages International.<ref name="fundinguniverse" />

=== Sold to PepsiCo and twenty-first century: 1998–present ===
Tropicana was acquired by [[PepsiCo]] in 1998, which combined it with the Dole brand for marketing purposes.<ref name="fundinguniverse" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Roundup|first=An Interactive Journal News|date=1998-07-20|title=Pepsi Agrees to Acquire Tropicana From Seagram Co. for $3.3 Billion|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB900939840388734500|access-date=2020-11-09|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> It has become the world’s leading producer of branded fruit juices.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bradenton-Based Tropicana is the World's Largest Producer of Branded Juice|url=https://www.sarasotamagazine.com/eat-and-drink/2017/03/tropicana-orange-juice|access-date=2020-11-09|website=Sarasota Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> Tropicana headquarters moved to Chicago in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web| last = REPORTS| first = STAFF AND WIRE| title = Tropicana headquarters to leave Bradenton for Chicago| work = Sarasota Herald| accessdate = 2018-07-29| url = http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20031202/News/605236188}}</ref>

Due to the decreased productivity of Florida's orange crop in the wake of several damaging touches of frost, Tropicana began using a blend of Florida and [[Brazil]]ian oranges in 2007.<ref>[http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070505/NEWS/705050456/1039 "With Fla. Crop Down, Brazilian OJ Flows In"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614061549/http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070505%2FNEWS%2F705050456%2F1039 |date=2011-06-14 }}, May 5, 2007</ref> Citing an increased consumer interest in the origin of food products, the company announced in February 2012 that its Tropicana Pure Premium line would return to sourcing oranges only from Florida<ref>[http://brownfieldagnews.com/2012/01/19/tropicana-pure-premium-switching-to-all-florida-oranges/ "Tropicana Pure Premium switching to all Florida oranges"], February 19, 2012</ref>. Tropicana later reverted to sourcing its oranges from both Florida and Brazil.

=== 2009 failed redesign ===
In February 2009, Tropicana switched the design on all cartons sold in the United States to a new image created by the [[Arnell Group]]. The new image showed the actual orange juice and redesigned the cap to look like the outside of an orange. After less than two months and a 20 percent drop in sales, Tropicana switched back to its original design of an orange skewered by a drinking straw.<ref>[http://adage.com/video/article?article_id=134889 "3 Minute Ad Age"], February 26, 2009</ref>

=== 2010 carton size ===
In early 2010, Tropicana reduced the size of its traditional {{cvt|64|USfloz|impfloz L|2}} carton to {{cvt|59|USfloz|impfloz L|2}} in the U.S. market, and maintained the original price. This change represented a 7.8 percent price-per-ounce increase for consumers.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tropicana Raising Prices on OJ | first = Tom | last = Sellen| url = https://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704655004575113593765269442.html | newspaper = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = March 10, 2010 | accessdate = August 23, 2010 }}</ref>

=== 2018 carton size ===
In 2018, Tropicana reduced the size again of its container from {{cvt|59|USfloz|impfloz L|2}} to {{cvt|52|USfloz|impfloz L|2}}.<ref>https://www.mouseprint.org/2018/08/13/tropicana-orange-juice-downsizes-again/</ref>

== Making the juice ==
Tropicana works with more than 12 established Florida groves, which are selected for sandy [[soil]] conditions and advanced [[irrigation]] practices.<ref name="GroveGlass">{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicana.com/#/trop_grovetoglass/grovetoglass.swf|title=Tropicana – 100% Pure Squeezed Sunshine|author=Copyright #dateFormat(now(), 'yyyy')#. Tropicana Products, Inc. All Rights Reserved.|work=tropicana.com}}</ref> The company is the largest single buyer of Florida fruit and processes about 60 million boxes of fruit.

The oranges are then washed and the orange [[oil]] is extracted from the peel, which is later blended into the juice. The oranges are squeezed and the fresh juice is flash [[pasteurized]]. Tropicana developed flash pasteurization to minimize the time the orange juice is exposed to heat.<ref name="GroveGlass" />

Oranges have a limited growing season, and because there is demand for juice year round, an unspecified quantity of juice is [[Degasification|deaerated]]<ref name="alissa_hamilton_squeezed">Alissa Hamilton. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=5AUjN-B4LfsC "Squeezed: What You Don't Know About Orange Juice."] Yale University Press, 2009.</ref> and then stored for future packaging in chilled tanks to preserve quality. The [[aseptic]] tanks protect the juice from oxygen and light and hold the liquid at optimal temperatures just above freezing to maintain maximum nutrition. It has been reported that deaerated juice no longer tastes like oranges, and must be supplemented before consumption with orange oils in order to recreate the orange flavor.<ref name="alissa_hamilton_squeezed" /> Pulp may be blended in at this point depending on the product.<ref name="GroveGlass" />

Tropicana's carton and plastic packaging are engineered to maintain freshness. The packaging materials ensure the juice stays fresh inside by preventing outside moisture and light from affecting its quality.<ref name="GroveGlass" />

== Not-for-profit affiliations ==
In 2008, Tropicana joined forces with charity [[Cool Earth]] and started the 'Rescue Rainforest' campaign in the U.S.<ref>[http://newsroom.mbooth.com/Tropicana/CoolEarth-NewsRelease.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409115240/http://newsroom.mbooth.com/Tropicana/CoolEarth-NewsRelease.html |date=April 9, 2009 }}</ref> People could buy special promotional packs of Tropicana and enter the pack's code online.

Trop50, introduced by Tropicana in 2009, is orange juice with 50 percent less sugar and calories, and no artificial sweeteners (this has [[Reb A]] or [[PureVia]] which is a form of the plant [[Stevia]], but is chemically altered.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trop50.com/?rd=1#/trop_home/home.swf?/trop_trop50/faq.swf|title=Tropicana – 100% Pure Squeezed Sunshine|author=Copyright #dateFormat(now(), 'yyyy')#. Tropicana Products, Inc. All Rights Reserved.|work=trop50.com}}</ref> Trop50 is available in several varieties including Farmstand Apple, Pomegranate Blueberry, Pineapple Mango, Orange, Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade. 

A number of their juice products, designed for 'extended shelf life', are colored with the extract of cochineal beetles. As this previously embarrassed the company, they use 'Carmine' on the label which is an alternate name for the dye.

In March 2011, the [[IRI Company|IRI]] named Trop50 as one of the “Top 10 Food and Beverage Brands in 2010”<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110329005973/en/SymphonyIRI-Announces-Successful-Packaged-Goods-Brands-2011 "SymphonyIRI Announces Successful Packaged Goods Brands 2011"], March 29, 2011, Retrieved April 19, 2011</ref>

In 2010, the company announced the impending limited release of [[Tropolis]], a liquid fruit snack drink, for January 2011.

== Naming rights ==
Tropicana holds sponsorship to [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]], the home to the [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] team [[Tampa Bay Rays]]. The name of the [[Bradenton Juice]] baseball team of the [[South Coast League]] was loosely related to Tropicana.

== Headquarters ==
Tropicana Products has its headquarters in [[Chicago]]. PepsiCo, the parent company of Tropicana, planned to begin moving Tropicana employees into its existing Chicago facility in the first quarter of 2004. PepsiCo moved Tropicana into Chicago so all of its juice brands would be consolidated into one Chicago-based unit.<ref>Quigley, Kelly.

Until 2004, Tropicana Products was headquartered in the four-story Rossi Office Building in [[Bradenton, Florida]]. In 2004 the building, which was completed in 2002, was offered for $20 million. In 2007, it was sold to [[Bealls (Florida)|Bealls of Florida]].<ref>"[http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2007/01/01/daily11.html Beall's acquires Tropicana property in Bradenton]."
