The source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5–0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260–880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes in this area with magnitudes of about 7 since 1926 had only released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.<ref>[http://www.aob.geophys.tohoku.ac.jp/download/ronbun/EPS_uchida2011.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207195402/http://www.aob.geophys.tohoku.ac.jp/download/ronbun/EPS_uchida2011.pdf |date=7 December 2011 }}</ref>

The first sign international researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the Earth's rotation came from the United States Geological Survey which monitors Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) stations across the world. The Survey team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS station located nearest the epicenter moved almost {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}}. This motivated government researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale effects on the planet.

According to the JMA {{interlanguage link|Meteorological Research Institute|ja|気象研究所}}, reasons for the underestimation include a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, failure to fully take into account the area of the [[hypocenter]], and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than that which would be predicted by an empirical relationship.<ref>干場充之 (2011) [http://www2.jpgu.org/meeting/2011/yokou/MIS036-P67.pdf 経験則からのずれ ―はじめの数秒と強震動：τc, Pd，スペクトル，簡易震源域推定方法―] 日本地球惑星科学連合 2011年 MIS036-P67</ref><ref>[http://www2.jpgu.org/meeting/2011/yokou/MIS036-P66.pdf 緊急地震速報と観測された震度の特徴] JMA {{interlanguage link|Meteorological Research Institute|ja|気象研究所}} 日本地球惑星連合 2011年予稿集</ref><ref name="zisin.64.155">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.4294/zisin.64.155|title = Earthquake Early Warning and Tsunami Warning of JMA for the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake|journal = Zisin (Journal of the Seismological Society of Japan. 2Nd Ser.)|volume = 64|issue = 3|pages = 155–168|year = 2012|last1 = Hoshiba|first1 = Mitsuyuki|last2 = Ozaki|first2 = Tomoaki|doi-access = free}}</ref>

There were also cases where large differences between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning system and the actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes.

Among the factors in the high death toll was the unexpectedly large water surge. The [[sea wall]]s in several cities had been built to protect against tsunamis of much lower heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami thought they were on high enough ground to be safe.<ref>Watts, Jonathan, "Quake survivors search for hope and shelter", ''Japan Times'', 26 March 2011, p. 13.</ref> According to a special committee on disaster prevention designated by the Japanese government, the tsunami protection policy had been intended to deal with only tsunamis that had been scientifically proved to occur repeatedly. The committee advised that future policy should be to protect against the highest possible tsunami. Because tsunami walls had been overtopped, the committee also suggested, besides building taller tsunami walls, also teaching citizens how to evacuate if a large-scale tsunami should strike.<ref>{{cite news

A Japanese government study found that 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground. Of those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent were caught in the tsunami. Of those who didn't heed the warning, 49% were hit by the water.<ref>[[Jiji Press]], "42% didn't immediately flee tsunami", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 18 August 2011, p. 2.</ref>

Delayed evacuations in response to the warnings had a number of causes. The tsunami height that had been initially predicted by the [[tsunami warning system]] was lower than the actual tsunami height; this error contributed to the delayed escape of some residents. The discrepancy arose as follows: in order to produce a quick prediction of a tsunami's height and thus to provide a timely warning, the initial earthquake and tsunami warning that was issued for the event was based on a calculation that requires only about 3 minutes. This calculation is, in turn, based on the maximum amplitude of the seismic wave. The amplitude of the seismic wave is measured using the [[:ja:マグニチュード#.E6.B0.97.E8.B1.A1.E5.BA.81.E3.83.9E.E3.82.B0.E3.83.8B.E3.83.81.E3.83.A5.E3.83.BC.E3.83.89 Mj|JMA magnitude scale]], which is similar to [[Richter magnitude scale]]. However, these scales "saturate" for earthquakes that are above a certain magnitude (magnitude 8 on the JMA scale); that is, in the case of very large earthquakes, the scales' values change little despite large differences in the earthquakes' energy. This resulted in an underestimation of the tsunami's height in initial reports. Problems in issuing updates also contributed to delays in evacuations. The warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after the earthquake occurred, by which time the calculation for the [[moment magnitude scale]] would normally be completed. However, the strong quake had exceeded the measurement limit of all of the [[seismometer#teleseismometer|teleseismometer]]s within Japan, and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those seismometers. Another cause of delayed evacuations was the release of the second update on the tsunami warning long after the earthquake (28 minutes, according to observations); by that time, power failures and similar circumstances reportedly prevented the update from reaching some residents. Also, observed data from tidal meters that were located off the coast were not fully reflected in the second warning. Furthermore, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters reported a fluctuation of "{{convert|20|cm}}", and this value was broadcast throughout the mass media and the warning system, which caused some residents to underestimate the danger of their situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation.<ref name="JMA20110912">

In response to the aforementioned shortcomings in the tsunami warning system, JMA began an investigation in 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for a powerful earthquake that is capable of causing the JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning; instead, there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. There are plans to install new teleseismometers with the ability to measure larger earthquakes, which would allow the calculation of a quake's moment magnitude scale in a timely manner. JMA also implemented a simpler empirical method to integrate, into a tsunami warning, data from GPS tidal meters as well as from undersea water pressure meters, and there are plans to install more of these meters and to develop further technology to utilize data observed by them. To prevent under-reporting of tsunami heights, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than the expected amplitude will be overridden and the public will instead be told that the situation is under observation. About 90 seconds after an earthquake, an additional report on the possibility of a tsunami will also be included in observation reports, in order to warn people before the JMA magnitude can be calculated.<ref name="JMA20110912" /><ref name="JMA2013" />

For the purpose of relief fund distribution, an "earthquake-related death" is defined as a case where the earthquake did not directly kill a person, but acted as a contributory factor that indirectly caused their death. Some of the most widely reported reason for these deaths include "Physical and mental fatigue caused by life in temporary shelter", "Physical and mental fatigue caused by evacuation", "Delayed treatment due to an inoperative hospital", "Physical and mental fatigue caused by stress from the earthquake and tsunami". A few cases of suicide are also included. Most of these deaths occurred during the first six months after the earthquake and the number dropped thereafter, but as time has passed, the number has continued to increase. Most of these deaths occurred in Fukushima prefecture, where the prefecture government has suggested that they could be due to evacuations caused by the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].<ref>[https://nc.chukyo-u.ac.jp/gendaisyakai/kiyou/2014/2014_08_02_08noguchi.pdf ３．11「震災関連死」という問い 福島県の分析を通して] 野口典子</ref> These indirect casualties have already resulted in more deaths than the number of people killed directly by earthquake and tsunami within the Fukushima prefecture.<ref>[https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLASDG28HAN_Y5A221C1CR8000/ 福島の震災関連死2000人超す　原発避難の長期化影響 ] 28 December 2015 Nikkei</ref><ref name="Smith">{{cite news |last=Smith|first=Alexander|title=Fukushima evacuation has killed more than earthquake and tsunami, survey says|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/10/20420833-fukushima-evacuation-has-killed-more-than-earthquake-and-tsunami-survey-says?lite|access-date=11 September 2013|date=10 September 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131027031039/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/10/20420833-fukushima-evacuation-has-killed-more-than-earthquake-and-tsunami-survey-says?lite |archive-date= 27 October 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="mainichi.jp">{{cite news |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130909p2a00m0na009000c.html |title=Stress-induced deaths in Fukushima top those from 2011 natural disasters |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927033901/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130909p2a00m0na009000c.html |archive-date= 27 September 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=manichi>{{cite news |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130909p2a00m0na009000c.html |title=Stress-induced deaths in Fukushima top those from 2011 natural disasters. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927033901/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130909p2a00m0na009000c.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 }}</ref>

Tōhoku Electric Power was not able to provide the Kanto region with additional power because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the earthquake. [[Kansai Electric Power Company]] (Kepco) could not share electricity, because its system operated at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their systems at 50 hertz; the disparity is due to early industrial and infrastructure development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national [[power grid]].<ref>[http://www.itworld.com/business/140626/legacy-1800s-leaves-tokyo-facing-blackouts A legacy from the 1800s leaves Tokyo facing blackouts], ITworld, 18 March 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407005141/http://www.itworld.com/business/140626/legacy-1800s-leaves-tokyo-facing-blackouts |date=7 April 2011 }}</ref> Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to Kanto and Tōhoku, but their capacity was limited to 1 GW.

To help alleviate the shortage, three steel manufacturers in the Kanto region contributed electricity produced by their in-house conventional power stations to TEPCO for distribution to the general public.

The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20&nbsp;minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5&nbsp;minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]], [[Yokosuka Line]], [[Sōbu Main Line]] and [[Chūō-Sōbu Line]] were all stopped for the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0314/TKY201103130323.html |title=asahi.com（朝日新聞社）：計画停電で影響が出る主な鉄道（午前７時現在） – 社会 |website=Asahi Shimbun |location=Japan |access-date=14 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407005107/http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0314/TKY201103130323.html |archive-date=7 April 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Rescued from Tsunami at Ishinomaki.JPG|thumb|upright|Rescue operations in the floodwaters in downtown [[Ishinomaki]]]]
<!-- (This is a summary only – see main article for supporting references.) -->{{Main|Aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami}}

The aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami included both a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact. The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the Tōhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine, and fuel for survivors. In response the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force – Tōhoku, led by Lieutenant General [[Eiji Kimizuka]]), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1&nbsp;billion in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at ¥10&nbsp;trillion ($122&nbsp;billion). In comparison to the [[1995 Great Hanshin earthquake]], the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range.<ref>{{cite book | title=East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami: Evacuation, Communication, Education and Volunteerism | publisher=Research Publishing Services |author1=Rajib Shaw |author2=Yukiko Takeuchi | year=2012 | location=Singapore | page=288 | isbn=978-981-07-0186-4}}</ref>

The aftermath of the twin disasters also left Japan's coastal cities and towns with nearly 25&nbsp;million tons of debris. In Ishinomaki alone, there were 17 trash collection sites {{convert|180|m}} long and at least {{convert|4.5|m}} high. An official in the city's government trash disposal department estimated that it would take three years to empty these sites.<ref>{{cite news | title=Japan tackles mountains of trash | newspaper=Christian Science Monitor | author=Peter Ford | date=18 July 2011 | page=12 | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0715/Japan-tackles-mountains-of-trash-left-in-tsunami-s-wake}}</ref>

In April 2015, authorities off the coast of [[Oregon]] discovered debris that is thought to be from a boat destroyed during the tsunami. Cargo contained yellowtail jack fish, a species that lives off the coast of Japan, still alive. KGW estimates that more than 1&nbsp;million tons of debris still remain in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mejia|first1=Paula|title=Piece of Ship from Japan's 2011 Tsunami Surfaces in Oregon|url=http://www.newsweek.com/piece-ship-japans-2011-tsunami-surfaces-oregon-321793|website=Newsweek|access-date=13 April 2015|date=12 April 2015}}</ref>

According to [[Jake Adelstein]], most Japanese media accepted and parroted the misinformation put out by the Japanese government and TEPCO about the unfolding Fukushima nuclear crisis. Notable exceptions, according to Adelstein, were newspapers ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' and ''[[Chunichi Shimbun]]'' which questioned the accuracy of the information coming from the government and TEPCO. Because of the unquestioning nature of most Japanese media to hold to the "party line", many Japanese mid-level officials and experts spoke to foreign media to get their opinions and observations publicized.<ref>[[Jake Adelstein|Adelstein, Jake]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/01/01/national/what-2011-means-for-japan-in-2012-and-beyond/ What 2011 means for Japan in 2012 and beyond]," ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 January 2012, p. 20.</ref>

[[Atsushi Funahashi]], director of ''Nuclear Nation'' notes that "when the overseas media was calling Fukushima a '[[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]],' the Japanese government and media waited two months before admitting it."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/03/japans-radioactive-nightmare.html|title=JAPAN'S RADIOACTIVE NIGHTMARE|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

Nine days after the earthquake hit, a [[Scientific visualization|visualization]] and [[sonification]] were uploaded to [[YouTube]] allowing listeners to hear the earthquake as it unfolded in time. Two days of seismic activity made available by the [[IRIS Consortium]] were compressed into two minutes of sound. The large number of views made the video one of the most popular examples of sonification on the web.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PJxUPvz9Oo|title=Sonification of Tohoku Earthquake / Sendai Coast, Japan, 2011/03/11|date=20 March 2011|via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Scientific and research response==
Seismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] — in the [[Sagami Trough]], southwest of Tokyo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/03/110315-japan-earthquake-tsunami-big-one-science/ |title=Japan Earthquake Not the "Big One"? |last=Lovett |first=Richard A. |date=14 March 2011 |work=[[National Geographic News]] |access-date=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316002506/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/03/110315-japan-earthquake-tsunami-big-one-science/ |archive-date=16 March 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref name="Achenbach">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/11/AR2011031102415_pf.html |title=Japan: The 'Big One' hit, but not where they thought it would |last=Achenbach |first=Joel |date=11 March 2011 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428005820/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/11/AR2011031102415_pf.html |archive-date=28 April 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Japanese government had tracked plate movements since 1976 in preparation for the so-called [[Tōkai earthquakes|Tokai earthquake]], predicted to take place in that region.<ref name="Powell">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/japan-earthquake-surpise/ |title=Japan Quake Epicenter Was in Unexpected Location |last=Powell |first=Devin |date=17 March 2011 |work=[[Wired News]] |access-date=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319200346/http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/03/japan-earthquake-surpise/ |archive-date=19 March 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> However, occurring as it did {{convert|373|km|mi|abbr=on}} north east of Tokyo, the Tōhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists.

The quake gave scientists the opportunity to collect a large amount of data to model the seismic events that took place in great detail.<ref name="DW" /> These data are expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing unprecedented information about how buildings respond to shaking, and other effects.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-sci-japan-quake-science-20110313,0,5782113.story |title=Japan earthquake shifted Earth on its axis |last=Brown |first=Eryn |date=12 March 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316002534/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-sci-japan-quake-science-20110313,0,5782113.story |archive-date=16 March 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> [[Gravimetry|Gravimetric]] data from the quake have been used to create a model for [[Earthquake warning system|increased warning time]] compared to seismic models, as gravity fields travel faster than seismic waves.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prompt gravity signal induced by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake |doi=10.1038/ncomms13349 |pmid=27874858 |pmc=5121411 |volume=7 |journal=Nature Communications |page=13349|year=2016 |last1=Montagner |first1=Jean-Paul |last2=Juhel |first2=Kévin |last3=Barsuglia |first3=Matteo |last4=Ampuero |first4=Jean Paul |last5=Chassande-Mottin |first5=Eric |last6=Harms |first6=Jan |last7=Whiting |first7=Bernard |last8=Bernard |first8=Pascal |last9=Clévédé |first9=Eric |last10=Lognonné |first10=Philippe |bibcode=2016NatCo...713349M }}</ref>

Researchers soon after the full extent of the disaster was known launched a project to gather all digital material relating to the disaster into an online searchable archive to form the basis of future research into the events during and after the disaster. The Japan Digital Archive is presented in English and Japanese and is hosted at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at [[Harvard University]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the first research to come from the archive was a 2014 paper from the Digital Methods Initiative in Amsterdam about patterns of [[Twitter]] usage around the time of the disaster.

After the 2011 disaster the UNISDR, [[United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction]], held its [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction]] in Tohoku in March 2015, which produced the [[Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction|Sendai Framework]] document to guide efforts by international development agencies to act before disasters instead of reacting to them after the fact. At this time Japan's Disaster Management Office (Naikakufu Bosai Keikaku) published a bi-lingual guide in Japanese and English, ''Disaster Management in Japan'', to outline the several varieties of natural disaster and the preparations being made for the eventuality of each. In the fall of 2016 Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED; Japanese abbreviation, Bosai Kaken; full name Bousai Kagaku Gijutsu Kenkyusho) launched the online interactive "Disaster Chronology Map for Japan, 416–2013" (map labels in Japanese) to display in visual form the location, disaster time, and date across the islands.

An expedition named [[Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project]] have been conducted in year 2012–2013 to drill oceanfloor boreholes through the fault-zone of the earthquake and gathered important data about the rupture mechanism and physical properties of the fault that caused the huge earthquake and tsunami which devastated much of northeast Japan.<ref name="smithsonian">Smithsonian.com [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/fault-that-caused-japans-2011-earthquake-is-thin-and-slippery-180948057/?no-ist Fault that Caused Japan's 2011 Earthquake is Thin and Slippery], 5 December 2013</ref><ref name="christsci">Christian Science Monitor [http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/1206/Japan-s-monster-quake-Do-scientists-have-key-to-decode-future-temblors Japan's monster quake: Do scientists have key to decode future tremblors?], 6 December 2013</ref>

==Cultural impact==
The Japanese government's response to the earthquake, the efforts of Japanese citizens to help with recovery, and the disaster itself have inspired many works from Japanese creators. Director [[Hideaki Anno]]'s 2016 film ''[[Shin Godzilla]]'' portrays the titular [[kaiju]] as a representation of disasters such as the Tōhoku earthquake and the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], and criticizes the Japanese government's response to such disasters. Two months after the earthquake, [[mangaka]] [[Hirohiko Araki]] incorporated the earthquake itself into the story of ''[[JoJolion]]'', the eighth installment of the ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' series; while ''JoJolion'' is set several months after the fictional town of Morioh was devastated by the earthquake, the earthquake has a key role in the plot as it is the cause behind the emergence of the Wall Eyes, mysterious stone structures that ultimately set the story into motion.

The earthquake and the tragic losses had been served as a significant inspiration for the [[Japan women's national football team]], in which, in the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]], managed to create the greatest giant-killing ever in the history where Japan came from nothing to become world champions despite the devastating earthquake and lack of funding for the team; the Nadeshiko itself also unveiled banner to thank global support despite adverse situations at home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/sports/soccer/japans-world-cup-team-lifts-a-country.html|title=Japanese Team Comes of Age, and Lifts a Country (Published 2011)|first1=JERE|last1=LONGMAN|first2=KANTARO|last2=SUZUKI|date=15 July 2011|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>
