The '''cosmetic industry''' describes the industry that manufactures and distributes cosmetic products.  These include colour cosmetics, like foundation and mascara, skincare such as moisturisers and cleansers, haircare such as shampoos, conditioners and hair colours, and toiletries such as bubble bath and soap.  The manufacturing industry is dominated by a small number of [[multinational corporation]]s that originated in the early 20th century, but the distribution and sale of cosmetics is spread among a wide range of different businesses. The largest cosmetic companies are Johnson & Johnson, L'Oreal Paris,Gillette, Neutrogena, Nivea and Chanel, Inc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalcosmeticsnews.com/top-50-brands/|title=Top 50 Brands|website=Global Cosmetics News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> The [[market volume]] of the cosmetics industry in Europe and the United States is about EUR €70b per year, according to a 2005 publication.<ref name=Ullmann>Günther Schneider, Sven Gohla, Jörg Schreiber, Waltraud Kaden, Uwe Schönrock, Hartmut Schmidt-Lewerkühne, Annegret Kuschel, Xenia Petsitis, Wolfgang Pape, Hellmut Ippen and Walter Diembeck "Skin Cosmetics" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_219}}</ref> The worldwide cosmetics and perfume industry currently generates an estimated annual turnover of US$170 billion (according to Eurostaf – May 2007). Europe is the leading market, representing approximately €63 billion.

== By region ==

=== United States ===

Within the United States, the state of California has the largest concentration of beauty establishments in America at 25.5%, followed by New Jersey at 8.1% of American beauty establishments.<ref name="Industry Research Reports">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry-trends/market-research-reports/|title=Industry Research Reports|website=www.ibisworld.com.au|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Since 2016, the number of cosmetic stores rises between 3 and 4% each year and employment in this division is rising each year 13-16%.<ref>(NAICS 44612): Cosmetics & Beauty Supplies Stores.” United States Remediation Services Industry Report, Jan. 2019, pp. 1–196. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=134174715&site=eds-live&scope=site.</ref>
California has the largest concentration due to social media marketing from celebrities and ‘beauty gurus’. For example, Kylie Jenner's company [[Kylie Cosmetics]], is valued at $800 million and sold an estimated $330 million worth of makeup in 2017. YouTube and social media influencers [[Jeffree Star]] (Jeffree Star Cosmetics), and [[Michelle Phan]] (Ipsy), and pop-star Rihanna with her [[Fenty Beauty]] line of cosmetics, have also contributed to California's rising popularity in the beauty industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IBISWorld industry reports|publisher=IBISWorld Pty Ltd. |isbn=2008242280|oclc=61400111}}</ref>

Because the US dollar is so valuable to other countries around the world, it has become extremely expensive for most countries to import American beauty products and to export their own products to America. However, there are a few countries with beauty products that are in popular demand in America due to their quality and value including France, Canada, Italy, and the United Kingdom. As of 2018, “These four countries account for 45.2% of all industry imports as domestic consumers demand luxury products”.<ref name="Industry Research Reports"/> South Korean and Japanese skincare products which are designed to be more gentle and innovative, are also becoming more popularized in the United States due to their quality and affordability. The U.S has held the same regulation over this industry since 1938 under the FD&C Act, which has gained additional amendments over time.<ref>Salvador, Amparo, and Alberto Chisvert.

=== Canada ===
Canada is a big influencer in the American beauty industry due to its proximity to the United States and because it falls under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). This agreement “eliminates most tariffs on products traded between Canada, Mexico, and the United States,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/naftas-economic-impact|title=NAFTA's Economic Impact|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> and allows Canada to trade superfluously. Canada accounts for an estimated 13.6% of imports and 19.9% of cosmetic exports in 2018.<ref name="Industry Research Reports"/> {{Citation needed|reason=Existing citation appears invalid|date=July 2019}}Because Mexico also benefits from the NAFTA trade agreement, they represent another top cosmetic importer and exporter for lower-priced beauty products which are manufactured in mass and sold in large drug store chains in America.

===France===
{{further|Made in France}}
Cosmetic sales in [[France]] reached €6.5 billion in 2006, according to FIPAR (Fédération des Industries de la Parfumerie – the French federation for the perfume industry).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clickpress.com/releases/Detailed/82987005cp.shtml|title=France continues to lead the way in cosmetics|accessdate= 2010-08-04}}</ref> France is another country in which the cosmetic industry plays an important role, both nationally and internationally. Most products with a label, "[[Made in France]]" are valued on the international market. According to data from 2008, the cosmetic industry has grown constantly in France for 40 consecutive years. Famous cosmetic brands produced in France include Vichy, [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Yves Rocher]], [[Bioderma]] and [[L'Oréal|L'Oreal]]. L'Oreal is known for its mass production of hair and makeup products which are produced in mass and sold in drug stores in America as well as internationally. L'Oreal has gained popularity especially due to its app Makeup Genius which allows users to try on makeup using their phone camera in addition to working with Los Angeles-based [[NYX Cosmetics]] and Estee Lauder's [[MAC Cosmetics]], L'Oreal is one of the leading cosmetic brands in the United States. According to the company's latest financial report of 2017, North America accounted for 13.6% of the company's global cosmetic sales.<ref name="Cosmetic Industry" />

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the cosmetic industry generated €12.6 billion of [[Retail sales#Retail Sales|retail sales]] in 2008,<ref name="Cosmetic Industry">{{cite web|url=http://www.german-business-portal.info/GBP/Navigation/en/Business-Location/Manufacturing%20Industries/cosmetics-industry,did=326082.html|title=Cosmetic Industry|accessdate=2010-08-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908122058/http://www.german-business-portal.info/GBP/Navigation/en/Business-Location/Manufacturing%20Industries/cosmetics-industry%2Cdid%3D326082.html|archive-date=2010-09-08}}</ref> which, at the time, made the German cosmetic industry the third largest in the world after Japan and the United States. It has been shown that Germany's cosmetic  industry grew nearly 5 percent in one year, from 2007 to 2008. German [[exports]] in this industry reached €5.8 billion in 2008, whereas imports of cosmetics totaled €3 billion.<ref name="Cosmetic Industry"/>  Germany gains most of its imported cosmetics from France, Switzerland, the United States and Italy.

===Italy===
{{further|Made in Italy}}
The Italian cosmetic industry is also an important player in the European cosmetic market. Although not as large as in other European countries, the cosmetic industry in Italy was estimated to reach €9 billion in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchwikis.com/Cosmetics_-_Europe_%28Italy%29_2008_Marketing_Research|title=Cosmetics – Europe (Italy) 2008 Marketing Research|accessdate= 2010-08-04}}</ref> The Italian cosmetic industry is however dominated by [[hair]] and body products and not makeup as in many other European countries. In Italy, hair and body products make up approximately 30% of the cosmetic market. Makeup and facial care, however, are the most common cosmetic products exported to the United States.

=== Belarus ===

The Belarusian cosmetics market consists of Belarusian companies.  There are more than 20 cosmetic companies in Belarus - Belita, Vitex, Lux Visage, Mastige, Modum, Rekish Cosmetics. The volume of the cosmetic market is more than 300 million euros per year

=== Asia ===
The cosmetic industry in Asia is mainly dominated by regional cosmetic brands. Shiseido Co. LTD, A popular cosmetic brand based in Japan, has 82.1% of its sales in Asia.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hoon Oh|first=Chang|date=June 2006|title=Regional Sales of Multinationals in the World Cosmetics Industry|journal=European Management Journal|volume=24|issue=2–3|pages=163–173|doi=10.1016/j.emj.2006.03.006|url=http://kelley.iu.edu/riharbau/RePEc/iuk/wpaper/bepp2006-20-oh-rugman.pdf}}</ref> No other Western company in the top 10 match these kinds of regional sales. Furthermore, geographic dispersion of sales by Asian cosmetic companies in Asia accounted for 92.42% of sales, while geographic dispersion of assets of Asian cosmetic companies in Asia was 87.05%.<ref name=":0" /> Western cosmetic companies often have failed to gain footholds in various countries. For example, in Japan, many advertisement campaigns that find success in the West, such as celebrity appearances and references to science, did not sway a sample group of respondents to purchase the foreign brands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Bradley|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Maki|s2cid=167830492|date=2008-04-28|title=Exploring international cosmetics advertising in Japan|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=24|issue=3–4|pages=299–316|doi=10.1362/026725708X306112|issn=0267-257X}}</ref> However, despite the lack of Western cosmetic presence, the growing trend of “fair skin”, or whiting one's skin, can expose consumers skin to harmful chemicals when using “fairness creams”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Palaian|first1=Subish|last2=Giri|first2=Bishnu Rath|last3=Shankar|first3=P. Ravi|date=2006-07-25|title=Fairness Creams in South Asia—A Case of Disease Mongering?|journal=PLOS Medicine|language=en|volume=3|issue=7|pages=e315|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030315|issn=1549-1676|pmc=1518681|pmid=16848620}}</ref>

Due to recent significant economic growth in many Asian markets, regulation pertaining to chemicals in cosmetic products has been lacking. SK-II, a cosmetic product owned by P&G, was found to contain banned heavy metals in China in 2006.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tai|first=Susan H.

==Fashion designer collaboration==
Due to the popularity of cosmetics, especially [[fragrance]]s and [[perfume]]s, many designers who are not necessarily involved in the cosmetic industry came up with different perfumes carrying their names. Moreover, some [[actors]] and [[singers]] have their own perfume line (such as [[Celine Dion]]). Designer perfumes are, like any other designer products, the most expensive in the industry as the consumer pays not only for the product but also for the brand. .

==Marketing==
The cosmetic industry worldwide seems to be continuously developing, now more than ever with the advent of the Internet companies. Many famous companies sell their cosmetic products online also, in countries in which they do not have representatives.

Research on the [[email marketing]] of cosmetics to consumers suggests they are goal-oriented with email content that is seen as useful, motivating recipients to visit a store to test the cosmetics or talk to sales representatives. Useful content included special sales offerings and new product information rather than information about makeup trends.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Martin Brett A. S., Joel , Durme Van, Raulas Mika, Merisavo Marko | year = 2003 | title = E-mail Marketing: Exploratory Insights from Finland | url = http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-et-al-2003.pdf | journal = Journal of Advertising Research | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 293–300 | doi=10.1017/s0021849903030265}}</ref>

== Colorism ==
Many companies advertise white or light skin as not only a cosmetic change, but a lifestyle change. White beauty implies a lifestyle of “sophistication, beauty, power, and wealth.” Mass advertising and marketing from the US and Europe, as well as multiple mass media forms are used to reach other cultures to influence their purchasing habits. Many of the [[Skin-lightening|skin lightening]] products sold usually have celebrity endorsements, further increasing sales and the desire for lighter skin. These products can cause serious damage to skin and pose a health risk to the consumer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Margaret L.|title=Buying Racial Capital: Skin-Bleaching and Cosmetic Surgery in a Globalized World|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edsglr&AN=edsgcl.306514739&site=eds-live&scope=site|journal=Journal of Pan African Studies|volume=4|pages=142|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref>

In a study done by S. S. Agrawal and Pallavi Sharma on eleven skin lightening products sold in India, it was found that “[[Mercury (element)|mercury]] was detected in all the samples of the skin lightening creams in the range of 0.14–0.36 ppm.” This study also observed that none of the brands tested include mercury as an ingredient on the packaging, which may mislead consumers regarding health risks. In a report by the [[World Health Organization]], it was stated that “skin whitening products can cause leukemia, liver and kidney cancer and could also result in severe skin conditions.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Agrawal|first1=S.S.|last2=Sharma|first2=Pallavi|date=March 2017|title=Current status of mercury level in skin whitening creams|journal=Current Medicine Research and Practice|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=47–50|doi=10.1016/j.cmrp.2017.02.001}}</ref> Though these health risks exist, women of color in many parts of the world are purchasing skin lightening creams.

Choma and Prusaczyk's survey of women of color in the US and India “show[s] that chronic surveillance of skin tone predicts skin tone dissatisfaction and skin bleaching.” Some companies in the cosmetic industry have capitalized off of the cultural pressure and standards for having lighter skin. &nbsp;This study concluded that “skin bleaching is not merely a physical or aesthetic change, but one with potentially wide-ranging implications on psychological well-being and, more broadly, the perpetuation of racist ideologies and beauty standards.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Kathryn|last2=Choma|first2=Becky L.|s2cid=150156045|date=2018-10-05|title=Internalised White Ideal, Skin Tone Surveillance, and Hair Surveillance Predict Skin and Hair Dissatisfaction and Skin Bleaching among African American and Indian Women|journal=Sex Roles|volume=80|issue=11–12|pages=735–744|language=en|doi=10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|issn=0360-0025}}</ref>

==Palm oil==
[[Palm oil]] is found in lipstick, and shampoo. Palm oil is connected to the destruction of forests and habitats of endangered species, including orangutans, tigers, elephants, and rhinos<ref>[https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/which-everyday-products-contain-palm-oil Products containing palm oil]</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/feb/19/palm-oil-ingredient-biscuits-shampoo-environmental How the world got hooked on palm oil]</ref>

== Animal Testing ==
[[Animal testing]] has been a large controversy in the cosmetic industry. Animal tests performed include the [[Draize test|Draize eye irritancy test]], where test chemicals are applied to rabbits’ eyes and left on for several days,<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Winders|first=Delcianna|date=April 2006|title=Combining Reflexive Law and False Advertising Law to Standardize Cruelty-Free Labeling of Cosmetics|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/nylr81&id=470&men_tab=srchresults|journal=New York University Law Review|volume=81|pages=454–486|via=HeinOnline}}</ref> and toxicity tests such as [[LD50]], where a substance's toxicity is tested by determining the concentration at which it will kill 50% of the test animals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rowan|first=Andrew|date=1983|title=The LD50--The Beginning of the End|url=https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&context=acwp_arte|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|volume=4|pages=4–7|via=Animal Studies Repository}}</ref>

Due to public outcry as well as financial and temporal considerations, animal testing in cosmetics has steadily been decreasing over time and replaced with non-animal tests.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Rowan|first=Andrew|date=2015|title=Ending the Use of Animals in Toxicity Testing and Risk Evaluation|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=448–458|doi=10.1017/S0963180115000109|pmid=26364779|id={{ProQuest|1711663923}}}}</ref> One of these non-animal tests is the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]’s ToxCast which has a similar accuracy compared to animal tests but achieves results with fewer economic costs and less time.<ref name=":1" />

An EU ban of marketing cosmetic products which have been tested on animals became effective in 2013.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Kristian|date=2015|title=Animal Testing and Marketing Bans of the EU Cosmetics Legislation|journal=European Journal of Risk Regulation : EJRR|volume=6|issue=4|pages=613–621|doi=10.1017/S1867299X00005158|id={{ProQuest|1752184361}}}}</ref> There are a few exceptions to this law. Animal testing data for cosmetics can be used if the data for the ingredient used in the cosmetic originated from testing for non-cosmetic products.<ref name=":2" /> Secondly, if a country outside of the EU requires animal testing and the cosmetic product was tested in that country, the ban also does not apply.<ref name=":2" /> Cosmetic tests on animals are still legal in several countries, such as the US, Japan, Russia,<ref name=":1" /> and China.

There are a number of cosmetics companies that claim they are “cruelty-free,” such as [[Bath & Body Works]], [[Aveda]], [[Elf (cosmetics)|ELF]], and Milani,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/living/personal-care-fashion/these-companies-dont-test-on-animals/|title=These Companies DON'T Test on Animals|date=January 13, 2016|website=PETA|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref> but some argue that because the label of “cruelty-free” both lacks regulation and standardized third-party certification, it has little real weight.<ref name=":02" /> Brands that claim to be cruelty free often advertize this with a logo of a rabbit on their products.
