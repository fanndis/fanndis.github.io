{{short description|A tax on the transfer of the property of a deceased person}}
{{UStaxation}}
The '''estate tax''' in the [[United States]] is a [[tax]] on the transfer of the [[Estate (law)|estate]] of a deceased person. The tax applies to property that is transferred via a [[will (law)|will]] or according to state laws of [[intestacy]]. Other transfers that are subject to the tax can include those made through an [[intestate]] estate or trust, or the payment of certain [[life insurance]] benefits or financial account sums to beneficiaries. The estate tax is one part of the ''Unified Gift and Estate Tax'' system in the United States. The other part of the system, the [[Gift tax in the United States|gift tax]], applies to transfers of property during a person's life.

In addition to the federal estate tax, many states have enacted similar taxes. These taxes may be termed an "[[inheritance tax]]" to the extent the tax is payable by a person who inherits money or property of a person who has died, as opposed to an estate tax, which is a levy on the estate (money and property) of a person who has died. The tax is often the subject of political debate, and opponents of the estate tax call it the '''"death tax"'''.<ref name="Inception of Death Tax Pejorative">[http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=meet_mr_death "Meet Mr. Death"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916061743/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=meet_mr_death |date=2011-09-16 }}.

If an asset is left to a spouse or a federally recognized [[Charitable organization|charity]], the tax usually does not apply. In addition, a maximum amount, varying year by year, can be given by an individual, before and/or upon their death, without incurring federal gift or estate taxes:<ref>"Estate Tax" irs.gov, Retrieved 2011-09-29</ref> $5,340,000 for estates of persons dying in 2014<ref>Revenue Procedure 2013-35, Section 3.32, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.</ref> and 2015,<ref>Revenue Procedure 2014-61, Section 3.33, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.</ref> $5,450,000 (effectively $10.90 million per married couple, assuming the deceased spouse did not leave assets to the surviving spouse) for estates of persons dying in 2016.<ref name="What's New - Estate and Gift Tax">{{Cite web|title = What's New – Estate and Gift Tax|url = https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Whats-New-Estate-and-Gift-Tax|website = www.irs.gov|access-date = 2015-12-11}}</ref> Because of these exemptions, it is estimated that only the largest 0.2% of estates in the U.S. will pay the tax.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|last1=Huang|first1=Chye-Ching|last2=DeBot|first2=Brandon|title=Ten Facts You Should Know About the Federal Estate Tax|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=2655|website=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|access-date=18 April 2015}}</ref> For 2017, the exemption increased to $5.49 million.

==Federal estate tax==

The federal ''estate tax'' is imposed "on the transfer of the taxable estate of every decedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States."<ref>See {{uscsub|26|2001|a}}.</ref> The starting point in the calculation is the "gross estate."<ref>Defined at {{usc|26|2031}} and {{usc|26|2033}}.</ref> Certain [[tax deduction|deductions]] from the "gross estate" are allowed to arrive at the "taxable estate."

===The "gross estate"===
The "gross estate" for federal estate tax purposes often includes more property than that included in the "probate estate" under the property laws of the state in which the decedent lived at the time of death. The gross estate (before the modifications) may be considered to be the value of all the property interests of the decedent at the time of death. To these interests are added the following property interests generally not owned by the decedent at the time of death:
* the value of property to the extent of an interest held by the surviving spouse as a "[[dower]] or [[curtesy]]";<ref>See {{usc|26|2034}}.</ref>
* the value of certain items of property in which the decedent had, at any time, made a transfer during the three years immediately preceding the date of death (i.e., even if the property was no longer owned by the decedent on the date of death), other than certain gifts, and other than property sold for full value;<ref>See {{usc|26|2035}}.</ref>
* the value of certain property transferred by the decedent before death for which the decedent retained a "[[life estate]]", or retained certain "powers";<ref>See {{usc|26|2036}}.</ref>
* the value of certain property in which the recipient could, through ownership, have possession or enjoyment only by surviving the decedent;<ref>See {{uscsub|26|2037|a|1}}.</ref>
* the value of certain property in which the decedent retained a "[[Future interest|reversionary interest]]", the value of which exceeded five percent of the value of the property;<ref>See {{uscsub|26|2037|a|2}}.</ref>
* the value of certain property transferred by the decedent before death where the transfer was revocable;<ref>See {{usc|26|2038}}.</ref>
* the value of certain annuities;<ref>See {{usc|26|2039}}.</ref>
* the value of certain jointly owned property, such as assets passing by operation of law or survivorship, i.e. [[joint tenants with rights of survivorship]] or [[tenants by the entirety]], with special rules for assets owned jointly by spouses.;<ref>See {{usc|26|2040}}.</ref>
* the value of certain "powers of appointment";<ref>See {{usc|26|2041}}.</ref>
* the amount of proceeds of certain life insurance policies.<ref>See {{usc|26|2042}}.</ref>

The above list of modifications is not comprehensive.

As noted above, [[life insurance]] benefits may be included in the gross estate (even though the proceeds arguably were not "owned" by the decedent and were never received by the decedent). Life insurance proceeds are generally included in the gross estate if the benefits are payable to the estate, or if the decedent was the owner of the life insurance policy or had any "incidents of ownership" over the life insurance policy (such as the power to change the beneficiary designation). Similarly, bank accounts or other financial instruments which are [[Totten trust|"payable on death" or "transfer on death"]] are usually included in the taxable estate, even though such assets are not subject to the [[probate]] process under state law.

===Deductions and the taxable estate===
Once the value of the "gross estate" is determined, the law provides for various deductions (in Part IV of Subchapter A of Chapter 11 of Subtitle B of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) in arriving at the value of the "taxable estate." Deductions include but are not limited to:
* Funeral expenses, administration expenses, and claims against the estate;<ref>See {{usc|26|2053}}.</ref>
* Certain [[charitable organization|charitable]] contributions;<ref>See {{usc|26|2055}}.</ref>
* Certain items of property left to the surviving spouse.<ref>See {{usc|26|2056}}.</ref>
* Beginning in 2005, inheritance or estate taxes paid to states or the District of Columbia.<ref>See {{usc|26|2058}}.</ref>

Of these deductions, the most important is the deduction for property passing to (or in certain kinds of trust, for) the surviving spouse, because it can eliminate any federal estate tax for a married decedent.  However, this unlimited deduction does not apply if the surviving spouse (not the decedent) is not a U.S. citizen.<ref>See {{uscsub|26|2056|d}}.</ref> A special trust called a Qualified Domestic Trust or QDOT must be used to obtain an unlimited marital deduction for otherwise disqualified spouses.<ref>See {{usc|26|2056A}}.</ref>

===Tentative tax===
The tentative tax is based on the tentative tax base, which is the sum of the taxable estate and the "adjusted taxable gifts" (i.e., taxable gifts made after 1976). For decedents dying after December 31, 2009, the tentative tax will, with exceptions, be calculated by applying the following tax rates:

--Internal Revenue Code section 2001(c), as amended by section 302(a)(2) of the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] (H.R. 4853), Pub. L. No. 111-312, 124 Stat. 3296, 3301 (Dec. 17, 2010), as amended by section 101(c)(1) of the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]]; see "Instructions for Form 706 (Rev. August 2013)," page 5, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i706.pdf (PDF)]

The tentative tax is reduced by gift tax that would have been paid on the adjusted taxable gifts, based on the rates in effect on the date of death (which means that the reduction is not necessarily equal to the gift tax actually paid on those gifts).

===Credits against tax===
There are several credits against the tentative tax, the most important of which is a "unified credit" which can be thought of as providing for an "exemption equivalent" or [[tax exemption|exempted value]] with respect to the sum of the taxable estate and the taxable gifts during lifetime.

For a person dying during 2006, 2007, or 2008, the "applicable exclusion amount" is $2,000,000, so if the sum of the taxable estate plus the "adjusted taxable gifts" made during lifetime equals $2,000,000 or less, there is no federal estate tax to pay. According to the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]], the applicable exclusion increased to $3,500,000 in 2009, and the estate tax was repealed for estates of decedents dying in 2010, but then the Act was to "sunset" in 2011 and the estate tax was to reappear with an applicable exclusion amount of only $1,000,000.

The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 became law on December 17, 2010. The 2010 Act changed, among other things, the rate structure for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2009, subject to certain exceptions.  It also served to reunify the estate tax credit (aka exemption equivalent) with the federal gift tax credit (aka exemption equivalent). The gift tax exemption is equal to $5,250,000<ref name="Rev. Proc. 2013-15 (see page 11, item 13)">{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-13-15.pdf|title=(PDF) Rev. Proc. 2013-15 (see page 11, item 13)|website=irs.gov|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref> for estates of decedents dying in 2013, and $5,340,000 for estates of decedents dying in 2014.<ref>Rev. Proc. 2013-35, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.</ref>

The 2010 Act also provided portability to the credit, allowing a surviving spouse to use that portion of the pre-deceased spouse's credit that was not previously used (e.g. a husband died, used $3 million of his credit, and filed an estate tax return.  At his wife's subsequent death, she can use her $5 million credit plus the remaining $2 million of her husband's). If the estate includes property that was inherited from someone else within the preceding 10 years, and there was estate tax paid on that property, there may also be a credit for property previously taxed.

Because of these exemptions, only the largest 0.2% of estates in the US will have to pay any estate tax.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Before 2005, there was also a credit for non-federal estate taxes, but that credit was phased out by the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]].

===Portability===
[[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010|The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] authorizes the personal representative of estates of decedents dying on or after January 1, 2011, to elect to transfer any unused estate tax exclusion amount to the surviving spouse, in a concept known as portability. The amount received by the surviving spouse is called the deceased spousal unused exclusion, or DSUE, amount. If the personal representative of the decedent's estate elects transfer, or portability, of the DSUE amount, the surviving spouse may apply the DSUE amount received from the estate of his or her last deceased spouse against any tax liability arising from subsequent lifetime gifts and transfers at death. The portability exemption is claimed by filing Form 706, specifically Part 6 of the estate tax return.  Whether the personal representative has an obligation to make the portability election is presently unclear.

===Requirements for filing return and paying tax===
For estates larger than the current federally exempted amount, any estate tax due is paid by the [[executor]], other person responsible for administering the estate, or the person in possession of the decedent's property. That person is also responsible for filing a Form 706 return with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). In addition, the form must be filed if the decedent's spouse wishes to claim any of the decedent's remaining estate/gift tax exemption.

The return must contain detailed information as to the valuations of the estate assets and the exemptions claimed, to ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid. The deadline for filing the Form 706 is 9 months from the date of the decedent's death. The payment may be extended, but not to exceed 12 months, but the return must be filed by the 9-month deadline.

As noted above, a certain amount of each estate is exempted from taxation by the law. Below is a table of the amount of exemption by year an estate would expect. Estates above these amounts would be subject to estate tax, but only for the amount above the exemption.

For example, assume an estate of $3.5 million in 2006. There are two beneficiaries who will each receive equal shares of the estate. The maximum allowable credit is $2 million for that year, so the taxable value is therefore $1.5 million. Since it is 2006, the tax rate on that $1.5 million is 46%, so the total taxes paid would be $690,000. Each beneficiary will receive $1,000,000 of untaxed inheritance and $405,000 from the taxable portion of their inheritance for a total of $1,405,000. This means the estate would have paid a taxable rate of 19.7%.

As shown, [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001#Estate and gift tax rules|the 2001 tax act]] would have repealed the estate tax for one year (2010) and would then have readjusted it in 2011 to the year 2002 exemption level with a 2001 top rate. That is, had no further legislation been passed, the estate of a person who died in the year 2010 would have been entirely exempt from tax while that of a person who died in the year 2011 or later would have been taxed as heavily as in 2001. However, on December 17, 2010, Congress passed the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]. Section 301 of the 2010 Act reinstated the federal estate tax. The new law set the exemption for U.S. citizens and residents at $5 million per person,<ref>Internal Revenue Code section 2010(c), as amended by section 302(a)(1) of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4853), Pub. L. No. ___-___, ___ Stat. ___ (Dec. 17, 2010).</ref> and it provided a top tax rate of 35 percent for the years 2011 and 2012.<ref>See Title III of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4853), Pub. L. No. ___-___, ___ Stat. ___ (Dec. 17, 2010).</ref>

On January 1, 2013, the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] was passed which permanently establishes an exemption of $5 million (as 2011 basis with inflation adjustment) per person for U.S. citizens and residents, with a maximum tax rate of 40% for the year 2013 and beyond.<ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr8eas/pdf/BILLS-112hr8eas.pdf</ref>

The permanence of this regulation is not ensured: the fiscal year 2014 budget called for lowering the estate tax exclusion, the generation-skipping transfer tax and the gift-tax exemption back to levels of 2009 as of the year 2018.<ref>[http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/04/29/coming-soon-more-estate-tax-battles/ Coming soon: More estate-tax battles], Market Watch, Wall Street Journal, 29 April 2013 (downloaded 18 July 2013)</ref> The exemption amounts of $11,180,000 in 2018 and $11,400,000 in 2019 are also currently (as of December 2018) scheduled to sunset 12/31/2025 ([[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]).

===Puerto Rico and other U.S. possessions===

A decedent who is a U.S. citizen born in Puerto Rico and resident at the time of death in a U.S. possession (i.e., PR) is generally treated, for federal tax purposes, as though he or she were a nonresident who is not a citizen of the United States,<ref>26 USC section 2209, at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2209 law.cornell.edu]</ref> so the $5 million exemption does not apply to such a person's estate. For U.S. estate tax purposes, a U.S. resident is someone who had a [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in the United States at the time of death. A person acquires a domicile by living in a place for even a brief period of time, as long as the person had no intention of moving from that place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i706.pdf|title=IRS Form 706 at|website=irs.gov|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>

===Non-residents===
The $11.2 million exemption specified in the Acts of 2010 and 2012 (cited above) applies only to U.S. citizens or residents, not to [[non-resident alien]]s. Non-resident aliens have a $60,000 exclusion instead; this amount may be higher if a [[Tax treaty#Provisions unique to inheritance taxes|gift and estate tax treaty]] applies.

For estate tax purposes, the test is different in determining who is a non-resident alien, compared to the one for income tax purposes (the inquiry centers around the decedent's domicile). This is a subjective test that looks primarily at intent. The test considers factors such as the length of stay in the United States; frequency of travel, size, and cost of home in the United States; location of family; participation in community activities; participation in U.S. business and ownership of assets in the United States; and voting. A foreigner can be a U.S. resident for income tax purposes, but not be domiciled for estate tax purposes.

A non-resident alien is subject to a different regime for estate tax than U.S. citizens and residents. The estate tax is imposed only on the part of the gross non-resident alien's estate that at the time of death is situated in the United States. These rules may be ameliorated by an estate tax treaty. The U.S. does not maintain as many estate tax treaties as income tax treaties, but there are estate tax treaties in place with many of the major European countries, Australia, and Japan.

U.S. real estate owned by a non-resident alien through a foreign corporation is not included in a non-resident alien's estate. The corporation must have a business purpose and activity, lest it be deemed a sham designed to avoid U.S. estate taxes.
{{See also|Gift tax in the United States#Non-residents}}

===Noncitizen spouse===
The estate tax of a deceased spouse depends on the citizenship of the surviving spouse.

All property held jointly with a surviving noncitizen spouse is considered to belong entirely to the [[#Gross estate|gross estate]] of the deceased, except for the extent the [[executor]] can substantiate the contributions of the noncitizen surviving spouse to the acquisition of the property.<ref>William P. Elliott, [http://www.wakm.com/static/fm/US%20Estate%20and%20Gift%20Panning%20for%20Non-Citizens%20and%20nonresident%20alients.pdf (PDF) U.S. estate and gift planning for noncitizens and non-resident aliens]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, downloaded 18 July 2013</ref>

U.S. citizens with a noncitizen spouse do not benefit from the same [[#Deductions and the taxable estate|marital deductions]] as those with a U.S. citizen spouse.

Furthermore, the estate tax exemption is not portable among spouses if one of the spouses is a noncitizen.

==Estate and inheritance taxes at the state level==
Currently, fifteen states and the District of Columbia have an estate tax, and six states have an inheritance tax. Maryland has both.<ref name="Blog">{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/does-your-state-have-estate-or-inheritance-tax|title=Does Your State Have an Estate or Inheritance Tax?|work=Blog}}</ref> Some states exempt estates at the federal level. Other states impose tax at lower levels; New Jersey estate tax was abolished for deaths after Jan 1, 2018.<ref name="Blog"/>

In states that impose an Inheritance tax, the tax rate depends on the status of the person receiving the property, and in some jurisdictions, how much they receive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irs.com/articles/inheritance-tax-vs-estate-tax|title=Inheritance Tax vs. Estate Tax|work=US Tax Center}}</ref> Inheritance taxes are paid not by the estate of the deceased, but by the inheritors of the estate. For example, the Kentucky inheritance tax "is a tax on the right to receive property from a decedent's estate; both tax and exemptions are based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itep.org/itep_reports/2014/07/state-estate-and-inheritance-taxes-1.php#.VV9GdvlViko|title=ITEP Reports}}</ref>

For decedents dying in calendar year 2014, 12 states (Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia impose only estate taxes. Delaware and Hawaii allowed their taxes to expire after Congress repealed the credit for state estate taxes, but reenacted the taxes in 2010. Exemption amounts under the state estate taxes vary, ranging from the federal estate tax exemption amount or $5.34 million, indexed for inflation (two states) to $675,000 (New Jersey). The most common amount is $1 million (three states and the District of Columbia). In 2014, four states increased their exemption amounts: Minnesota (phased up to $2 million for 2018 deaths), Rhode Island ($1.5 million for 2015 deaths), and Maryland and New York (both phased their exemptions up to the federal amount for 2019 deaths). Top rates range from 12 percent to 19 percent with most states, like Minnesota, imposing a top rate of 16 percent.

Five states (Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee) impose only inheritance taxes. The Tennessee tax was eliminated for deaths after December 31, 2015. The exemptions under state inheritance taxes vary greatly, ranging from $500 (Kentucky and New Jersey) for bequests to unrelated individuals to unlimited exemptions (Iowa and Kentucky) for bequests to lineal heirs, such as children or parents of the decedent. No states tax bequests to surviving spouses. Top tax rates range from 4.5 percent (Pennsylvania on lineal heirs) to 18 percent (Nebraska on collateral heirs). Tennessee's inheritance tax is calculated more like an estate tax (i.e., the tax does not vary based on the beneficiary).

One state— Maryland —imposes both types of taxes, but the estate tax paid is a credit against the inheritance tax, so the total tax liability is not the sum of the two, but the greater of the two taxes. Neither state taxes bequests to lineal heirs.<ref>http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/ss/ssestinh.pdf</ref>

==Tax mitigation==
Estate tax rates and complexity have driven a vast array of support services to assist clients with a perceived eligibility for the estate tax to develop [[tax avoidance]] techniques. Many [[life insurance|insurance companies]] maintain a network of [[life insurance]] [[agency (law)|agents]], all providing [[Certified Financial Planner|financial planning services]], guided towards providing death benefit that covers paying estate taxes.  Brokerage and financial planning firms, and charities, also use [[estate planning]] and estate tax avoidance as a marketing technique.  Many [[law firm]]s also specialize in estate planning, tax avoidance, and minimization of estate taxes.

Many techniques recommended by those selling products with high fees do not really avoid the estate tax.  Instead they claim to provide a leveraged way to have liquidity to pay for the tax at the time of death. It is very important for those whose primary wealth is in a business they own, or real estate, or stocks, to seek professional legal advice. In one technique marketed by commissioned agents, an irrevocable life insurance trust is recommended, where the parents give their children funds to pay the premiums on life insurance on the parents.

Structured in this way, life insurance proceeds can be free of estate tax. However, if the parents have a very high net worth and the life insurance policy would be inadequate in size due to the limits in premiums, a charitable remainder trust (CRT) may be recommended, but should be critically reviewed.  The client, however, may lose access to the asset placed in the CRT. Proponents of the estate tax, and lobbyists for high commission financial products, argue the tax should be maintained to encourage this form of charity.

==History==
[[File:US Top Estate Tax Rate.png|thumb|350px|Top Estate Tax Rate, 1914–2018<ref>Darien B. Jacobson, Brian G. Raub, and Barry W. Johnson, "The Estate Tax: Ninety Years and Counting", Internal Revenue Service.</ref>]]

Taxes which apply to estates or to inheritance in the United States trace back to the 18th century.  According to the IRS, a temporary stamp tax in 1797 applied a tax of varying size depending on the size of the bequest, ranging from 25 cents for a bequest between $50 and $100, to 1 dollar for each $500.  The tax was repealed in 1802.  In the 19th century, the Revenue Act of 1862 and the [[War Revenue Act of 1898]] also imposed rates, but were each repealed shortly thereafter.  The modern estate tax was enacted in 1916.<ref>https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/ninetyestate.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=9706 |title=Estate Tax History Versus Myth |work=ncpa.org}}</ref>

The modern estate tax was temporarily phased out and repealed by tax legislation in 2001.  This legislation gradually dropped the rates until they were eliminated in 2010. However, the law did not make these changes permanent and the estate tax returned in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/itax/Edit/basics/Final_filing/basic_1a.asp |title=2014-2015 Estate Tax And Gift Tax Amounts |work=bankrate.com}}</ref>

<blockquote>But late in 2010, before that clause took effect, Congress passed superseding legislation that imposed a 35 percent tax in 2011 and 2012 on estate in excess of $5 million. Like the 2001 legislation, the 2010 legislation had a sunset clause so that in 2013 the estate tax would return to its 2001 level. But then on New Year's Day 2013, Congress made permanent an estate tax on estates in excess of $5 million at a rate of 40 percent.<ref>Dikeminier & Sitkoff, ''Wills, Trusts, and Estates'', 9th Edition (2013), p. 921</ref></blockquote>

==Debate==
The estate tax is a recurring source of contentious political debate and [[political football]].  Generally the debate breaks down between a side which opposes any tax on inheritance, and another which considers it good policy.

===Arguments in support===
Proponents of the estate tax argue that large inheritances (currently those over $5 million) are a progressive and fair source of government funding. Removing the estate tax, they argue, favors only the very wealthy and leaves a greater share of the total tax burden on working taxpayers.  Proponents further argue that campaigns to repeal the tax rely on public confusion about the estate tax and about tax policy more generally.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/36498159/wealth_tax.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060646/http://www.regjeringen.no/pages/36498159/wealth_tax.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45305-2005Apr11.html | work=The Washington Post | first=E.

"First, the probate process may reveal information about lifetime economic well-being that is difficult to obtain in the course of enforcement of the income tax but is nevertheless relevant to societal notions of who should pay tax.  Second, taxes imposed at death may have smaller disincentive effects on lifetime labor supply and saving than taxes that raise the same revenue (in present value terms) but are imposed during life.  Third, if society does wish to tax lifetime transfers among adult households, it is difficult to see any time other than death at which to assess the total transfers made."

In response to the concern that the estate tax interferes with a middle-class family's ability to pass on wealth, proponents point out that the estate tax currently affects only estates of considerable size (over $5 million, and $10 million for couples) and provides numerous credits (including the unified credit) that allow a significant portion of even large estates to escape taxation.<ref name="NYT 2006">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/business/23tax.html | work=[[The New York Times]]| title=I.R.S. to Cut Tax Auditors | date=July 23, 2006}}</ref> Proponents note that abolishing the estate tax will result in tens of billions of dollars being lost annually from the federal budget.<ref name="Atlantic">Stuart Taylor, [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200606u/nj_taylor_2006-06-13 "Gay Marriage and the Estate Tax"], ''The Atlantic Monthly'', June 13, 2006.</ref> Proponents of the estate tax argue that it serves to prevent the perpetuation of wealth, free of tax, in wealthy families and that it is necessary to a system of [[progressive taxation]].<ref name="WAPO">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/05/AR2006060501360.html "Death and Taxes"], ''Washington Post'', Editorial, June 6, 2006.</ref>

A driving force behind support for the estate tax is the concept of [[equal opportunity]] as a basis for the [[social contract]].  This viewpoint highlights the association between wealth and power in society – material, proprietary, personal, political, social.  Arguments that justify wealth disparities based on individual talents, efforts, or achievements, do not support the same disparities where they result from the [[Rule Against Perpetuities|dead hand]].  These views are bolstered by the concept that those who enjoy a privileged position in society should have a greater obligation to pay for its costs.  The strength of political opposition to the estate tax, proponents argue, would not be found under a [[veil of ignorance]], in which policy makers were kept from knowing the wealth of their own families.<ref>Generally, see [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3999&context=fss_papers Equal opportunity and Inheritance Taxation], by Anne L.

[[Winston Churchill]] argued that estate taxes are "a certain corrective against the development of a race of idle rich". This issue has been referred to as the "Carnegie effect," for [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Carnegie once commented, "The parent who leaves his son enormous wealth generally deadens the talents and energies of the son, and tempts him to lead a less useful and less worthy life than he otherwise would'." Some research suggests that the more wealth that older people inherit, the more likely they are to leave the labor market.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10024733 | work=The Economist | title=The case for death duties | date=October 25, 2007}}</ref> A 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that eliminating the estate tax would reduce charitable giving by 6–12 percent.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5650&type=0 The Estate Tax and Charitable Giving], Congressional Budget Office, July 2004.</ref> Chye-Ching Huang and Nathaniel Frentz of the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] assert that repealing the estate tax "would not substantially affect private saving...." and that repeal would increase government deficits, thereby reducing the amount of capital available for investment.<ref name="cbpp.org">Chye-Ching Huang & Nathaniel Frentz, "Myths and Realities About the Estate Tax," Aug. 29, 2013, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Washington, D.C., at [http://www.cbpp.org/files/estatetaxmyths.pdf cbpp.org] (PDF)</ref>
In the 2006 documentary, ''[[The One Percent (film)|The One Percent]]'', [[Robert Reich]] commented, "If we continue to reduce the estate tax on the schedule we now have, it means that we are going to have the children of the wealthiest people in this country owning more and more of the assets of this country, and their children as well.... It's unfair; it's unjust; it's absurd."

Proponents of the estate tax tend to object to characterizations that it operates as a "double tax." They point out many of the earnings subject to estate tax were never taxed because they were "unrealized" gains.<ref name="NYT 2006"/> Others describe this point as a red herring given common overlapping of taxes. Chye-Ching Huang and Nathaniel Frentz of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities assert that large estates "consist to a significant degree of 'unrealized' capital gains that have never been taxed...."<ref name="cbpp.org"/>

Supporters of the estate tax argue there is longstanding historical precedent for limiting inheritance, and note current generational transfers of wealth are greater than they have been historically. In ancient times, funeral rites for lords and chieftains involved significant wealth expenditure on sacrifices to religious deities, feasting, and ceremonies. The well-to-do were literally buried or burned along with most of their wealth. These traditions may have been imposed by religious edict but they served a real purpose, which was to prevent accumulation of great disparities of wealth, which, estate tax proponents suggest, tended to prevent social destabilization, revolution, or disruption of functioning economic systems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020|reason=who argues this?}}

Economist [[Jared Bernstein]] has said: "People call it the 'Paris Hilton tax' for a reason, we live in an economy now where 40 percent of the nation's wealth accumulates to the top 1 percent.

[[Free market]] supporters of the tax, including [[Adam Smith]]<ref name="Spectator - Inheritance Tax Is Good" /> and the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]<ref name="Estate tax and the founding fathers">{{cite web|title=Estate tax and the founding fathers|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/2010/10/estate_tax_and_founding_fathers|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref> would argue that people should be able to get to the top of the market through earning wealth, based on meritocratic competition, not through unearned, inherited handouts, which were central to the [[aristocratic]] systems they were opposed to, and fought the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] to free American citizens from. Smith wrote:

{{block quote|A power to dispose of estates for ever is manifestly absurd. The earth and the fulness of it belongs to every generation, and the preceding one can have no right to bind it up from posterity. Such extension of property is quite unnatural.<ref name="Estate tax and the founding fathers"/>}}

Unearned transfers of wealth work against the free market by creating a disincentive of hard work in the recipients, and others in the market.<ref name="FT - Inheritance should not be an alternative to hard work" /> If the income from estate tax is reduced, this would have to be made up broadly through taxes on working people. Accordingly, if estate tax was increased relative to other taxes, [[Irwin Stelzer]] argues it could pay for "lowering the marginal tax rate faced by all earners. Reduce taxes on the pay for that extra work, and you will get more of it; reduce taxes on the profits from risk-taking, and entrepreneurs will take more chances and create more jobs. Reduce the taxes on recipients of inheritances, on the other hand, and they will work less and be less likely to start up new businesses..".<ref name="Spectator - Inheritance Tax Is Good">{{cite web|last1=Stelzer|first1=Irwin|title=Listen to Adam Smith: inheritance tax is good|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2007/10/listen-to-adam-smith-inheritance-tax-is-good/|website=www.spectator.co.uk|publisher=Spectator|access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref>

Unhindered inheritance has another possible influence on some in the market; if many of the wealthiest in the country acquired their wealth through inheritance, while contributing nothing to the market personally to get there, people at the lower end of the market may have equal economic potential as many of those receiving some of this 40 percent of wealth, but did not have the luck of being born to wealthy parents. The disparity in fair chance of acquiring initial wealth, on top of pre-existing differences in non fiscal sustenance like differing qualities of education, inherited work ethic, and valuable connections, causes resentment and the perception that hard work is of diminished importance, when some, due to bad luck will struggle to afford the basics of living even at maximum effort, while others may never need to work, and even present this lifestyle as ideal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. The disparity in initial gifted wealth also means a reduced ability for some to accumulate wealth; it is a lot easier to put money aside if you inherited a house and do not have to rent one.<ref name="FT - Inheritance should not be an alternative to hard work">{{cite web|last1=Harding|first1=Robin|title=Inheritance should not be an alternative to hard work|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8b97920-76eb-11e3-807e-00144feabdc0|website=Financial Times|publisher=FT|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref> These factors create a system perceived to be rigged against those who are not lucky enough to be born into wealthy families, along with political instability; continuous infighting and even civil wars.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James|publisher=Crown Business Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9780307719225|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/whynationsfailor0000acem/page/369 369–403]|chapter="Why Nations Fail Today"|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/whynationsfailor0000acem/page/369}}</ref> Reducing estate tax exacerbates this situation, while increasing estate tax promotes a fairer free market, especially if this excess wealth is used to encourage productivity, while also encouraging wealthy parents to focus on providing the best skills and education for their children.<ref name="Spectator - Inheritance Tax Is Good"/> Michael J.

Some proponents of a steep estate tax argue that concentrating wealth in the hands of a few is harmful to both the economy and to democracy itself. [[Oscar F. Mayer|Oscar Mayer]] heir [[Chuck Collins]] writes "Billionaires are expanding their shares of the pie at the expense of investments in our social safety net, infrastructure, and education systems," and notes that "Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis observed, 'You can have concentrated wealth in the hands of a few or democracy. But you can’t have both.'"<ref>{{cite web|website=CNBC.com|title=Oscar Mayer heir: It's time for a 100% tax on billionaire estates|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/24/its-time-for-a-100percent-tax-on-billionaire-estates-oscar-mayer-heir-says.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&par=sharebar|date=July 24, 2019|access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref>

===Arguments against===
Some people oppose the estate tax on principle of individualism and a market economy. In their view, proponents of the tax often argue that "excess wealth" should be taxed without defining "excess" or explaining why taxing it is undesirable if it was acquired by legal means. Such arguments are seen to have a predilection for collectivist principles that opponents of the estate tax oppose.<ref name="auto" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bisonsurvivalblog.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808032122/http://bisonsurvivalblog.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html|archive-date=2010-08-08|access-date=2009-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acton.org/publications/mandm/mandm_101article05.php|title=Vol 10, No 1 – Markets & Morality|date=2007|work=acton.org}}</ref> In arguing against the estate tax, the ''[[Investor's Business Daily]]'' has editorialized that "People should not be punished because they work hard, become successful and want to pass on the fruits of their labor, or even their ancestors' labor, to their children. As has been said, families shouldn't be required to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the same day.".<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=517003|title=A Good Year To Die|work=Investor's Business Daily|access-date=2010-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205055622/http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=517003|archive-date=2010-02-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A similar argument is based on a distrust of governments to use taxes for the public good. In an article in ''[[Washington Examiner]]'', Michael Shindler argued that "inheritance of multigenerational wealth allows people, especially young people, to comfortably pursue callings that, despite their vital importance to human flourishing, are typically uncompensated by the market" and cites [[Lord Byron]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as examples of such individuals. Similarly, Shindler also argues that "whereas in Europe museums, theaters, symphony halls, and other cultural institutions are typically government-subsidized, here they gain the bulk of their funding from the generosity of philanthropic foundations founded and sustained by the stewards of multigenerational wealth....Consequently, American culture is less an expression of the whims of bureaucrats and more a manifestation of the will of its citizenry."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|date=24 October 2017|title=Trump is right: Kill the Death Tax, once and for all|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-is-right-kill-the-death-tax-once-and-for-all/article/2638490|journal=Washington Examiner|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

Other arguments against an estate tax are based on its economic effects. The [[Tax Foundation]] published research suggesting that the estate tax is a strong disincentive to entrepreneurship. Its 1994 study found that a 55% tax rate had roughly the same effect as doubling an entrepreneur's top effective marginal income tax rate. Also, the estate tax was found to impose a large compliance burden on the U.S. economy. Past studies by the same group estimated compliance costs to be roughly equal to the revenue raised – nearly five times more cost per dollar of revenue than the federal income tax – making it one of the nation's most inefficient revenue sources.<ref name="Tax Foundation">"Noting that this compliance burden is largely the result of widespread tax avoidance, Aaron and Munnell conclude that estate taxes are effectively 'penalties imposed on those who neglect to plan ahead or who retain unskilled estate planners' rather than actual taxes." Aaron and Munnell, [http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sr142.pdf The Economics of Federal Estate Taxes] (page no longer available)
{{clear}}</ref>

Another argument is that tax obligation can overshadow more fundamental decisions about the assets. In certain cases, it is claimed to create an undue burden. For example, pending estate taxes could be a disincentive to invest in a viable business or an incentive to liquidate, downsize, divest from or retire one. This is especially true when an estate's value is about to surpass the exemption amount. Older people may see less value in maintaining a farm or small business than reducing risk and preserving their capital, by shifting resources, liquidating assets, and using tax avoidance techniques such as insurance, gift transfer, trusts and tax-free investments.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/BG1428.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719065255/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/BG1428.cfm |archive-date=2006-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another argument is that the estate tax burdens farmers because agriculture requires more capital assets, such as land and equipment, to generate the same income that other types of businesses generate with fewer assets. Individuals, partnerships and family corporations own 98% of the nation's 2.2 million farms and ranches. The estate tax may force surviving family members to sell land, buildings, or equipment to continue their operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/amberwaves/june09/features/federalestatetax.htm|title=USDA ERS - Federal Estate Taxes Affecting Fewer Farmers but the Future Is Uncertain|author=Ron Durst|work=usda.gov|access-date=2010-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602131423/http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/June09/Features/FederalEstateTax.htm|archive-date=2010-06-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The [[National Farmers Union (United States)#Current activities|National Farmers Union]] advocated relief for farmers by increasing the exemption per estate to $5 million.<ref name="Policy of the National Farmers Union">{{cite web| title = Estate and Gift Tax Policy| publisher = [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]]| url = http://www.nfu.org/policy-nfu/225-article-8/1047-e-estate-and-gift-tax-policy| archive-url = https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120905182321/http://www.nfu.org/policy%2Dnfu/225%2Darticle%2D8/1047%2De%2Destate%2Dand%2Dgift%2Dtax%2Dpolicy| url-status = dead| archive-date = September 5, 2012| access-date = March 15, 2013}} (enacted by delegates to the 110th anniversary convention, March 4–7, 2012)</ref> [[Americans Standing for the Simplification of the Estate Tax]] advocates relief for farmers and small business owners by eliminating death as a taxable event in what the group describes as a [[down payment]] on their estate taxes during their earning years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://estatetaxsimplification.org/the-asset-proposal/|title=The ASSET Proposal|author=ASSET|work=estatetaxsimplification.org}}</ref> Along these lines, the American Solution for Simplifying the Estate Tax Act, or 'ASSET Act', of 2014 (H.R. 5872) was introduced on December 11, 2014 to the [[113th Congress]] by Rep.

Another set of arguments against the estate tax is based on its enforcement. The [[Tax Foundation]] notes that because the tax can be avoided with careful estate planning, estate taxes are just "penalties imposed on those who neglect to plan ahead or who retain unskilled estate planners".<ref name="Tax Foundation" /> A [[Tax competition|disparity between tax rates]] may encourage wealthy people to minimize taxation by moving their wealth outside the United States. As a result, the collected tax will be far less than claimed by proponents and will lower the tax base, opponents argue.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} However, most countries have inheritance tax at similar or higher rates.<ref>"Twenty-seven of the 34 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development levied some form of estate tax, inheritance tax, or other wealth or wealth transfer tax in 2012 (the latest year for which full data are available).

===The term "death tax"===

While the use of terms like "death duty" had been known earlier, specifically calling ''estate tax'' the "death tax" was a move that entered mainstream public discourse in the 1990s, as an attempt to give it a devastating new nickname in a manner similar to a [[neologism]]. This happened after a proposal was shelved that would have reduced the threshold from $600,000 to $200,000, after it proved to be more unpopular than expected, and awakened political interest in reducing the tax.<ref name="Economist - Taxing inheritances is falling out of favour">{{cite web |title=Taxing inheritances is falling out of favour |url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2017/11/23/taxing-inheritances-is-falling-out-of-favour |website=The Economist |access-date=10 February 2019 |date=23 November 2017 |quote=In 1992 something happened which changed the terms of the debate...

Many opponents of the estate tax refer to it as the "death tax" in their public discourse partly because a [[death]] must occur before any [[tax]] on the deceased's [[asset]]s can be realized and also because the tax rate is determined by the value of the deceased's persons assets rather than the amount each inheritor receives. Neither the number of inheritors nor the size of each inheritor's portion factors into the calculations for rate of the estate tax.

Proponents of the tax say the term "death tax" is imprecise, and that the term has been used since the nineteenth century to refer to ''all'' the death duties applied to transfers at death: estate, inheritance, succession and otherwise.<ref name="NYT 1897">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903EEDB1230E333A25757C2A9639C94669ED7CF The Tax That Suits the Farmer], ''New York Times'', May 24, 1897. ("It will escape these death taxes, even, by removal from the State or by to heirs during life instead of by testament.")</ref>

Chye-Ching Huang and Nathaniel Frentz of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities assert that the claim that the estate tax is best characterized as a "death tax" is a myth, and that only the richest 0.14% of estates owe the tax.<ref>Chye-Ching Huang & Nathaniel Frentz, "Myths and Realities About the Estate Tax," Aug. 29, 2013, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Washington, D.C., at  [http://www.cbpp.org/files/estatetaxmyths.pdf cbpp.org] (PDF)</ref>

Political use of "death tax" as a synonym for "estate tax" was encouraged by Jack Faris of the National Federation of Independent Business<ref name="NYT 2001">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD61239F934A15757C0A9679C8B63 Capitol Hill Memo; In 2 Parties' War of Words, Shibboleths Emerge as Clear Winner], ''New York Times'', April 27, 2001.</ref> during the Speakership of [[Newt Gingrich]].

Well-known [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[opinion poll|pollster]] [[Frank Luntz]] wrote that the term "death tax" "kindled voter resentment in a way that 'inheritance tax' and 'estate tax' do not".<ref name="excerpt">{{cite web|url=http://www.60plus.org/deathtax.asp?docID=347|title=Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes|website=60plus.org|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060724111947/http://www.60plus.org/deathtax.asp?docID=347|archive-date=24 July 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2016, [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential candidate Donald Trump]] released a health care plan which used the term "death penalty" in the context of [[health savings account]]s which would pass tax-free to the heirs of an estate.<ref name="death penalty">{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Avik |date=March 3, 2016 |title=The Most Important Thing About Donald Trump's Health Reform Plan Is That Trump Didn't Write It |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/03/03/the-most-important-thing-about-donald-trumps-health-reform-plan-is-that-donald-didnt-write-it/ |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |access-date=April 13, 2016 }}</ref>

== IRS audits ==
In July 2006, the IRS confirmed that it planned to cut the jobs of 157 of the agency's 345 estate tax lawyers, plus 17 support personnel, by October 1, 2006.  Kevin Brown, an IRS deputy commissioner, said that he had ordered the staff cuts because far fewer people were obliged to pay estate taxes than in the past.

==Related taxes==
The federal government also imposes a [[gift tax]], assessed in a manner similar to the estate tax. One purpose is to prevent a person from avoiding paying estate tax by giving away all his or her assets before death.

There are two levels of exemption from the gift tax.  First, transfers of up to (as of 2020) $15,000 per (recipient) person per year are not subject to the tax. Individuals can make gifts up to this amount to each of as many people as they wish each year. In a marriage, a couple can pool their individual gift exemptions to make gifts worth up to $30,000 per (recipient) person per year without incurring any gift tax.  Second, there is a lifetime credit on total gifts until a combined total of $5,250,000 (not covered by annual exclusions) has been given.

In many instances, an estate planning strategy is to give the maximum amount possible to as many people as possible to reduce the size of the estate, the effectiveness of which depends on the lifespan of the donor and the number of donees.  (This also gives the donees immediate use of the assets, while the donor is alive to see them enjoy it.)

Furthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $5 million (tied to inflation in the same manner as the estate tax exemption) may be subject to a [[generation-skipping transfer tax]] if certain other criteria are met.
