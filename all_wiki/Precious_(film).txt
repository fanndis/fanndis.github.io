==Plot==

In 1987, 16-year-old Precious ([[Gabourey Sidibe]]) lives in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of [[New York City]] with her unemployed mother Mary ([[Mo'Nique]]), who has long subjected her to physical, verbal, and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]]. Precious has also been [[rape]]d by her now-absent father, Carl (Rodney "Bear" Jackson), resulting in two pregnancies. The family resides in a [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] [[tenement]] and survives on [[American welfare state|welfare]]. Her first child, daughter Mongo (short for [[Mongoloid]]), has [[Down syndrome]] and is being cared for by Precious' grandmother, though Mary forces the family to pretend that Mongo lives with her and Precious so she can receive extra money from the government. When Precious' second pregnancy is discovered, her high-school principal arranges for her to attend an [[alternative school]], where she hopes Precious can change her life's direction. Precious finds a way out of her traumatic daily life by escaping into daydreams in which she is loved and appreciated.

Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain ([[Paula Patton]]), Precious finally learns to read and write. She meets sporadically with a new social worker Ms. Weiss ([[Mariah Carey]]), who learns about the sexual assault in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child Abdul, she meets John McFadden ([[Lenny Kravitz]]), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness, and develops a crush on him. Upon returning home, Mary asks to hold Abdul. When Precious's back is turned, her mother purposely drops baby Abdul on the ground and attacks her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the abuse has resulted in them being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away with Abdul, while Mary tries to drop the television set on them; she eventually breaks into her school classroom for shelter. When Ms. Rain discovers them the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious and Abdul to live in, but they end up staying with Ms. Rain and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Ms. Rain takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them; Precious will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a [[halfway house]].

Mary soon returns to inform Precious of her father's death from [[AIDS]]. Precious later learns that she is [[HIV-positive]], even though Abdul is not. Feeling dejected, she steals her case file from Ms. Weiss's office. As she shares the details of her file with her fellow students, she begins to hope for the future. Later, Precious meets with her mother, who brings Mongo, at Ms. Weiss's office. Ms. Weiss confronts Mary about her and Carl's abuse of Precious, going back to when Precious was a toddler. Mary tearfully confesses that she's always hated Precious for "stealing her man" by "letting him" abuse her, and for eventually "making him leave." Precious tells Mary that she finally sees her for what she really is, and tells her mother that she will never see her or the children ever again, leaving with both Mongo and Abdul. Mary begs Ms. Weiss to retrieve her daughter and her grandchildren, but Ms. Weiss silently rejects her and walks away, leaving a distraught Mary alone in the room.

Precious plans to complete a [[General Educational Development|GED]] test to receive a high-school diploma equivalency. She walks out into the city with both children in tow, ready to start a new life and have a brighter future.

==Production==
Daniels had said that he was attracted to the initial novel based on how "raw and honest" it felt.<ref name="AVClubinterview">{{cite web|last1=Rabin|first1=Nathan|title=Lee Daniels and Gabby Sidibe|website=AV Club}}</ref> In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident was the first time he saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her&nbsp;— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too."<ref name="AMCstraighttodvd">{{cite web|title=Q&A&nbsp;– Lee Daniels Expected Precious to Go Straight to DVD|url=http://www.amc.com/talk/2010/02/qa-lee-daniel|website=AMC|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of [[incest]].<ref name="PWeekly">{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Monica|title=Lee Daniels' 'Precious' Moment|url=http://philadelphiaweekly.com/2009/nov/11/Lee-Daniels-Uncut/#.V7bVnZgrLIU|website=Philadelphia Weekly|accessdate=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917215324/http://philadelphiaweekly.com/2009/nov/11/Lee-Daniels-Uncut/#.V7bVnZgrLIU|archive-date=September 17, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Despite the dark subject matter, Sidibe has stated that the mood on the set was lighthearted, that "Every day was a party" and that the cast would frequently sing and tell jokes to "lighten the atmosphere."<ref name="AVClubinterview"/>  The production budget was $10&nbsp;million.<ref name="boxofficemojo" />

Critic Jack Mathews wrote: "Without being familiar with the source material, you really have no idea how much work went into the adaptation or how well it was done....

Erin Aubry Kaplan wrote on ''Salon.com'' that the question posed by the film is how to assess the "hopeless story of a ghetto teen... in the Age of Obama." She went on to say that "'Precious' proves you don't always have to choose between artistic and commercial success; the film's first opening weekend was record-breaking. It's a sign how much we needed to tell this story. And, perhaps, how many stories there are left to tell."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/feature/2009/11/09/precious_feature/print.html |title=Precious in the Age of Obama |work=[[Salon.com]] |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

[[A. O. Scott]] identified the script's precise use of force and adept use of language, including a memorable line created by Fletcher for the adaptation: a "risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Precious's life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as ''Push'' achieves an eloquence that makes it far more than a fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does ''Precious'' avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice. 'These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,' she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/movies/06precious.html |title=Lee Daniels Gives Us Howls of a Life, Buried Deep Within |work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 2, 2010 | first=A.

Conversely, reflecting the transformation from script to screen, [[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of ''Slate'' disagreed with Gleiberman's suggestion that the "film makes you think" and argued that the film's "eagerness" to "drag" the audience "through the lower depths of human experience" leaves little space for independent "conclusions". Stevens noted that, while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, "it wields an awfully large cudgel", in contrast to Scott's view of balance: "unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)". Perhaps sharing Mathews' view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of ''Push'', Stevens' observed that "Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2234728/ |title=Sorry I didn't like Precious |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|slate.com]] |accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

''Precious'' also received some negative responses from critics. Writing for the ''[[New York Press]]'', [[Armond White]] compared the film to the landmark but controversial ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) as "demeaning the idea of black American life," calling it "an orgy of [[prurience]]" and the "con job of the year."<ref>Armond White, Pride and Precious [http://hiphopandpolitics.com/2009/11/19/armond-white-precious-is-the-most-damaging-film-to-the-black-image-since-birth-of-a-nation/].

Peter Bradshaw wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the film catalogues a "horrendous, unending nightmare of abuse" and then abruptly turns into something resembling the 1980s musical ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]''.

Noting Daniels' admiration of the work of [[John Waters (director born 1946)|John Waters]] and [[Pedro Almodóvar]] and the joking attitude he and the actors sometimes took towards their material while making the movie, Jim Emerson argued that ''Precious'' is best understood as a deliberately over-the-top piece of [[Camp (style)|camp]] in the vein of Waters's ''[[Female Trouble]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/scanners/precious-based-on-the-movie-female-trouble-by-john-waters|title=Precious Based on the Movie Female Trouble by John Waters|first=Jim|last=Emerson|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>
