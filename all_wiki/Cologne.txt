With slightly over a million inhabitants (1.09 million) within its [[city proper|city boundaries]], Cologne is the largest city on the [[Rhine]] and also the most populous city both of the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]], which is [[Metropolitan regions in Germany#Metropolitan regions|Germany's largest]] and one of [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe#Metropolitan areas|Europe's major metropolitan areas]], and of the [[Rhineland]]. Centered on the left bank of the Rhine, Cologne is about {{convert|45|km}} southeast of North Rhine-Westphalia's capital of [[Düsseldorf]] and {{convert|25|km}} northwest of [[Bonn]]. It is the largest city in the [[Central Franconian]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] dialect areas.

The city's [[Cologne Cathedral]] (''Kölner Dom'') is the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]. There are many institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the [[University of Cologne]] (''Universität zu Köln''), one of Europe's oldest and largest universities,<ref name="Cologneeconomy">{{cite web |title= Economy |url= http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/economy |publisher= KölnTourismus |accessdate= 18 April 2011}}</ref> the [[Technical University of Cologne]] (''Technische Hochschule Köln''), Germany's largest university of applied sciences, and the [[German Sport University Cologne]] (''Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln''), Germany's only sport university. [[Cologne Bonn Airport]] (''Flughafen Köln/Bonn'') is Germany's seventh-largest airport and lies in the southeast of the city. The main airport for the Rhine-Ruhr region is [[Düsseldorf Airport]].

Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks|Franks]] in 462. During the [[Middle Ages]] the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and western Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the [[Hanseatic League]] and one of the largest cities north of the [[Alps]] in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to [[World War II]], the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) dropping {{convert|34,711|long ton|tonne|abbr= off}} of [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|bombs on the city]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|title= bomber command – mines laid – flight august – 1945 – 1571 – Flight Archive|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190704161459/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|archive-date= 4 July 2019}}</ref> The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city centre. With the intention of restoring as many historic landmarks as possible, the postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.

Cologne is a major cultural centre for the [[Rhineland]]; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The [[Cologne Trade Fair]] hosts a number of [[trade show]]s such as [[Art Cologne]], [[imm Cologne]], [[Gamescom]], and the [[Photokina]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cologne|Timeline of Cologne}}

===Roman Cologne===
[[File:Wall painting with Dionysian scenes from a luxurious Roman villa excavated to the south of the cathedral, Romisch-Germanisches Museum, Cologne (8119154487).jpg|thumb|Fresco with [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysian scenes]] from a Roman villa of Cologne, [[Germany]] (site of the ancient city [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]), 3rd century AD, [[Romano-Germanic Museum]]]]
The first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', founded in 38&nbsp;BC by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germani cisrhenani|Cisrhenian]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]. In 50&nbsp;AD, the Romans founded ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'' (Cologne) on the river [[Rhine]]<ref name="Cologne History"/><ref name="Facts and figures"/> and the city became the provincial capital of [[Germania Inferior]] in 85&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Facts and figures">{{cite web|title=Facts and figures|url=https://www.cologne.de/facts-and-figures.html|publisher=City of Cologne|accessdate=3 May 2019}}</ref> Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a 1,900-year-old Roman boat was discovered in late 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18208 |title=C.Michael Hogan, ''Cologne Wharf'', The Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham, 2007 |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> From 260 to 271, Cologne was the capital of the [[Gallic Empire]] under [[Postumus]], [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]], and [[Victorinus]]. In 310, under emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.<ref name="Cologne History"/> Cologne is shown on the [[4th century]] [[Peutinger Map]].

Maternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opened in 1890.

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]]. In 716, [[Charles Martel]] commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when [[Chilperic II]], King of [[Neustria]], invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the [[Battle of Cologne]]. Charles fled to the [[Eifel]] mountains, rallied supporters and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the [[Battle of Amblève]]. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].<ref name="Cologne History"/> In the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]] Cologne fell into the dominion of [[Lothair I]]'s [[Middle Francia]] – later called [[Lotharingia]] ([[Lower Lorraine]]).

In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]]. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his archiepiscopal successors with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of [[Jülich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was [[Archchancellor]] of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.

Following the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced to reside in [[Bonn]].<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia">Harry de Quetteville. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.</ref> The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the "Greve". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, [[Rainald of Dassel]], gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they, in fact, had been taken from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.</ref>

Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west as well as the main south–north Western Europe trade route, Northern Italy to Flanders. The intersection of these trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000–55,000.<ref>''The Population of European Cities'', Bairoch</ref> Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name="Cologne History"/>

===Early modern history===

[[File:Rekonstruktion der Stadt Köln im 17. Jahrhundert.webm|thumb|Reconstruction of Cologne in the 17th century (German, English subtitles available)]]
The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.

As a [[free imperial city]], Cologne was a self-ruling state within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], an [[imperial estate]] with seat and vote at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], and as such had the right (and obligation) to contribute to the defense of the Empire and maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire ("Reichskontingent") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken – Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823 e.V. – Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

The Free Imperial City of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Electorate of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century the majority of archbishops were drawn from the [[Bavaria]] [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.

===From the 19th century until World War II===

[[File:Hängebrücke - Köln (1).tif|thumb|Hängebrücke]]
Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].

The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.

Cologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[https://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254&id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung Köln |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.

During [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 15 February 1926</ref>
In contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.

As part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].

The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919–1933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.

===World War II===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]
During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[Münster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[Jülich]], [[Düren]], and [[Monschau]]. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.

The Allies dropped 44,923.2 tons of bombs on the city during World War II, destroying 61% of its built up area. During the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II]], Cologne endured 262 air raids<ref>{{cite web|author=koelnarchitektur |url=http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |title=on the reconstruction of Cologne |publisher=Koelnarchitektur.de |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of "[[Operation Millennium]]", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the [[Royal Air Force]] in World War&nbsp;II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.<ref>Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al.

</ref> By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 percent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas.

===Post-war Cologne until today===
[[File:KölnFromTheISS.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|Cologne, seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
Despite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby [[Düsseldorf]] was chosen as the political capital of the [[States of Germany|federated state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became–and still is–home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.

In 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the "world's greatest heap of rubble". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.

The destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.

In 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&nbsp;million again.

In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to [[Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

Cologne was the focus of the [[2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]], with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne|title=Tensions rise in Germany over handling of mass sexual assaults in Cologne|last=Connolly|first=Kate| newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="waz2">{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/politik/1075-anzeigen-nach-koelner-silvesternacht-73-verdaechtige-id11567004.html|title=1075 Anzeigen nach Kölner Silvesternacht – 73 Verdächtige|trans-title=1,075 assaults by Cologne New Year's Eve – 73 suspects|work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=German|accessdate=15 February 2016}}</ref>

==Government==
{{See also|Cologne City Hall}}
The city's administration is headed by the [[List of mayors of Cologne|mayor]] and the three deputy mayors.

===Political traditions and developments===
The long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) have created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a "waste scandal" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.

The inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War&nbsp;II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ay8mnbMwYesC&pg=PT35|title=Heidi Klum & Seal The truth about the divorce|last=Hombach|first=Jean-Pierre|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4716-2190-1|location=|pages=31|language=en}}</ref> Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.

Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately {{convert|75|m2|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=KölnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>

==Wildlife==
The presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. [[Pigeon]]s are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of [[Feral organism|feral]] exotics, most visibly [[parrots]] such as the [[rose-ringed parakeet]]. The sheltered climate in southeast [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green [[parrots]] is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=In NRW behaupten sich immer mehr exotische Vögel|url=http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|publisher=RP Online|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>

===Landmarks===

====Churches====
* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most loved landmark. It is a [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church, started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], which supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des Kölner Doms &#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |accessdate=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703064357/http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as "the eternal construction site" (''die ewige Baustelle'').
* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.&nbsp;Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World War&nbsp;II. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.

===Streets===
{{Main|Streets in Cologne}}
* The [[Cologne Ring]] boulevards (such as ''Hohenzollernring'', ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ring'', ''Hansaring'') with their medieval city gates (such as ''Hahnentorburg'' on ''Rudolfplatz'') are also known for their night life.
* [[Hohe Straße]] (literally: ''High Street'') is one of the main shopping areas and extends past the cathedral in an approximately southerly direction. The street contains many gift shops, clothing stores, fast food restaurants and electronic goods dealers.
* [[Schildergasse]] – connects ''Neumarkt'' square at its western end to the ''Hohe Strasse'' shopping street at its eastern end and has been named the busiest shopping street in Europe with 13,000 people passing through every hour, according to a 2008 study by [[GfK]].
* Ehrenstraße – the shopping area around ''Apostelnstrasse'', ''Ehrenstrasse'', and ''Rudolfplatz'' is a little more on the quirky and stylish side.

===Bridges===
[[File:Bridge in Cologne over the Rhine River.jpg|thumb|left |Bridge in Cologne over the Rhine River.]][[File:Rhine River at Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Rhine River at Cologne, Germany.]]Several bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from south to north): the [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge]], [[South Bridge (Cologne)|South Bridge]] (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, [[Hohenzollern Bridge]] (railway), Zoo Bridge (''Zoobrücke'') and [[Cologne Mülheim Bridge]]. In particular the iron [[tied arch bridge|tied arch]] Hohenzollern Bridge (''Hohenzollernbrücke'') is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine crossing of a special kind is provided by the [[Cologne Cable Car]] (German: ''Kölner Seilbahn''), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the [[Cologne Zoological Garden]] in Riehl and the [[Rheinpark]] in Deutz.

===High-rise structures===
Cologne's tallest structure is the [[Colonius]] telecommunication tower at {{convert|266|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}. The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne is listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925 – it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at [[Rheinauhafen]], and the [[Messeturm Köln]] ("trade fair tower").

Cologne has [[List of museums in Cologne|several museums]]. The famous [[Roman-Germanic Museum]] features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]] in Europe, including a [[Picasso]] collection matched only by the museums in [[Museu Picasso|Barcelona]] and [[Musée Picasso|Paris]]. The [[Museum Schnütgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]].
Many art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. [[Galerie Karsten Greve]], one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.

Several orchestras are active in the city, among them the [[Gürzenich Orchestra]], which is also the orchestra of the [[Cologne Opera]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]] (''German State Radio Orchestra''), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building ([[Kölner Philharmonie]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=Kölner Philharmonie |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archivedate = 11 December 2007}}</ref> Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] and the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln]], and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor Köln]]. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.

[[File:Water feature in Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|Water feature in Cologne, Germany, summer of 2017.]]The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer [[Heinrich Böll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

Cologne is well known for its beer, called [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]. [[Colognian language|Kölsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.

Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: "Water of Cologne"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand Mülhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[Mäurer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.

===Carnival===
The [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called "Tolle Tage" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Zülpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archivedate=25 January 2008 |title=Carnival – Cologne's "fifth season" – Cologne Sights & Events – Stadt Köln |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>

===Road transport===
[[File:Koelner Ring.png|thumb|left|Major [[List of streets in Cologne|roads through and around Cologne]]]]
Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße ("Federal Road") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this, the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.

In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.
