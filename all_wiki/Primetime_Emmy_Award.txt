The '''Primetime Emmy Award''' is an American award bestowed by the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] (ATAS) in recognition of excellence in [[Television in the United States|American]] [[prime time|primetime]] [[television]] programming. First given out in [[1st Primetime Emmy Awards|1949]], the award was originally referred to as simply the "[[Emmy Award]]s" until the first [[Daytime Emmy Award]] ceremony was held in [[1st Daytime Emmy Awards|1974]] and the word "[[prime time]]" was added to distinguish between the two.

The Primetime Emmy Awards generally air in mid-September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season. They are currently seen in rotation among the four major networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], [[NBC]]). Each network airs the ceremony every four years. The ceremony is typically moved to late-August if it is broadcast by NBC (such as in [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards|2006]], [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards|2010]], and [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards|2014]]), so that it does not conflict with NBC's commitment to [[NBC Sunday Night Football|broadcasting]] Sunday-night [[National Football League|NFL]] games (due to another conflict, this time with the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards|2014 ceremony]] was also shifted to a Monday).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2014/08/emmys-emmy-awards-traffic-la-street-closures-nokia-television-academy-822429/ |title=Emmygeddon: Can TV Academy Avoid Monday Night Traffic Nightmare? |last=Hammond |first=Pete |date=August 20, 2014 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref> However, the [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards|2018 ceremony]], broadcast by NBC, was moved back to September and aired on a Monday.

They are considered television's equivalent to the [[Academy Awards]] ([[film]]), [[Grammy Award]]s ([[music]]), and [[Tony Award]]s ([[theatre|theater]]). The awards are divided into three categories: Primetime Emmy Awards, [[Creative Arts Emmy Award|Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards]], and [[Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards]].

==Rules==
Among the Primetime Emmy Award rules, a show must originally air on American television during the eligibility period between June 1 and May 31 of any given year. In order to be considered a ''national primetime'' show, the program must air between 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and 2:00&nbsp;a.m., and to at least 50 percent of the country. A show that enters into the Primetime Emmy Awards cannot also be entered into the [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s or any other national Emmy competition. For [[Broadcast syndication|shows in syndication]], whose air times vary between media markets, they can either be entered in the Daytime or Primetime Emmy Awards (provided they still reach the 50 percent national reach), but not in both. For game shows that reach the 50 percent threshold, they can be entered into the Daytime Emmy Awards if they normally air before 8 p.m (including the former "[[Prime Time Access Rule|access hour]]" from 7:00&nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.); otherwise, they are only eligible for the Primetime Emmy Awards. For [[web television]] programs, they must be available for downloading or streaming to more than 50 percent of the country, and like shows in syndication they can only enter in one of the national Emmy competitions.

Shows that are offered for pre-sale to consumers, whether on home video devices or via the Web, are ineligible if the pre-sale period starts more than 7 days before the show's initial airing. Also, a show that receives what the Academy calls a "general theatrical release" before its first airing (either via television or the Internet) is ineligible. The definition of this phrase excludes limited releases for the specific purpose of award qualification, such as screenings at film festivals or the one-week releases in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] (and, for documentaries, [[New York City]] as well) required for [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] eligibility.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/Downloads/2017-rules-procedures-v1a.pdf |title=69th Primetime Emmy Awards: 2016 – 2017 Rules and Procedures |date=March 17, 2017 |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref>

Entries must be submitted by the end of April, even if a show is not scheduled to originally air until the following month when the eligibility period ends in May. Most award categories also require entries to include [[DVD]]s or tape masters of the show. For most series categories, any six episodes that originally aired during the eligibility period must be submitted (programs that were cancelled before airing their sixth episode are thus ineligible). For most individual achievement categories, only one episode is required to be submitted; if an episode is a two-parter, both parts may be included on the submitted DVD.

Ballots to select the nominations are sent to Academy members in June. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting poll to determine the winners is held in August, and is done by judging panels. In June, the Academy solicits volunteers among its active members to serve on these panels. All active members may serve on the program panels; otherwise they are restricted to those categories within their own branch.
