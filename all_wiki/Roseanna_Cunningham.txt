'''Roseanna Cunningham''' (born 27 July 1951) is a Scottish politician who has served as [[Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform]] since 2016. She was previously [[Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training]] from 2014 until 2016. A member of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), she has served as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Perthshire South and Kinross-shire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Perthshire South and Kinross-shire]] since [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]], having previously represented [[Perth (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Perth]] from [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] to 2011. She was formerly [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] from [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|1995]] to [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] then for [[Perth (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth]] 1997 to [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]].

==Early life, education and legal practice==
Cunningham was born on 27 July 1951 in [[Glasgow]] to Catherine and Hugh Cunningham,<ref name=":0">{{Citation|chapter=Cunningham, Roseanna, (born 27 July 1951), Member (SNP) Perthshire South and Kinross-shire, Scottish Parliament, since 2011 (Perth, 1999–2011); Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, since 2016|date=2007-12-01|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-12569|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u12569|access-date=2019-04-22|title=Who's Who}}</ref> and spent her early years living in [[East Lothian]] and [[Edinburgh]]. In 1960, she emigrated with her family to [[Perth]] in [[Australia]], and completed her schooling at [[John Curtin College of the Arts|John Curtin High School]] in [[Fremantle]]. As a teenager she became interested in politics, and in 1969 joined the SNP as an overseas member. In 1975 Cunningham graduated from the [[University of Western Australia]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA Hons]] in politics.<ref name=":0" /> She returned to Scotland in 1976.

She worked as a research assistant at SNP headquarters from 1977 to 1979,<ref name=":0" /> and was a member of the left-wing [[79 Group]] inside the SNP during the early 1980s, but avoided expulsion as she was not a member of its steering committee (future SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]] by contrast who served on the 79 Group committee was expelled, while [[Margo MacDonald]] resigned from the party in protest before she could be expelled).

Cunningham returned to university in 1980, graduating from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1982 with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree, followed in 1983 by a [[Diploma in Legal Practice]] from the [[University of Aberdeen]].<ref name=":0" /> She worked as a [[solicitor]] for Dumbarton District Council and Glasgow District Council. After a brief period in private practice, she was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1990.<ref name=":0" />

==Political career==
In the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] Cunningham stood in the Perth and Kinross constituency, only losing by around 2,000 votes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fisxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=deYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4739%2C1658322 |title=Nationalist movement gains strength on moors and glens. An Independent Scotland? |first=Maureen |last=Johnson |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=3 April 1995 |page=2 |accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>

In 1995, she gained the seat in the [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|Perth and Kinross by-election]] succeeding the recently deceased [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, [[Nicholas Fairbairn|Sir Nicholas Fairbairn]]. She had initially been left off the SNP's candidate shortlist over her brief relationship in the 1970s with Donald Bain, then husband of SNP MP [[Margaret Ewing]], on the grounds that the issue could prove an embarrassment to the party. Cunningham said the affair had begun after the couple had separated.<ref>{{cite news|last=Arlidge|first=John|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/snp-candidates-past-haunts-her-1609454.html|title=SNP candidate's past haunts her|date=1 March 1995|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 November 2017}}</ref> She was put back in contention following an intervention by the then party leader Alex Salmond, and after Ewing made clear she had no objection to Cunningham's candidature. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], she stood for the Perth constituency and was elected.

In [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] she became the MSP for [[Perth (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Perth]] and continues to represent the area in the [[Scottish Parliament]] to this day. In 2000, [[2000 Scottish National Party leadership election|she was elected]] the SNP Senior Vice-Convener (depute leader). Also in that year, she helped establish the ''[[Scottish Left Review]]'' publication. She stood down as an MP in 2001, to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament.

[[John Swinney]] announced his resignation as leader of the SNP on 22 June 2004, and on the same day Cunningham announced that she would be a candidate in the subsequent [[2004 Scottish National Party leadership election|election for the party leadership]]. In the early stages of the campaign she appeared to be the clear front-runner, but the entirely unexpected decision of the former leader Alex Salmond to enter the race just before nominations closed changed everything, and Cunningham ultimately finished a distant second.

In December 2006, she led an unsuccessful attempt to prevent same-sex couples gaining the right to adopt children,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6215838.stm |title=MSPs vote for same-sex adoption |work=BBC News |date=7 December 2006}}</ref> despite having previously been named [[ScotsGay]] Parliamentarian of the Year in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsgay.co.uk/sg25/sg.html|title=ScotsGay Magazine - 25|website=www.scotsgay.co.uk}}</ref>  When legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland was passed by the Scottish Parliament in February 2014, she had voted against the bill.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26041921 |title=Scotland's same-sex marriage bill: How MSPs voted |date= 4 February 2014}}</ref>

In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government in February 2009, Cunningham was appointed as [[Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform|Minister for the Environment]].<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2009/02/12171922 Cunningham relishing new challenge], ''Scottish Government'', 12 February 2009</ref> In December 2010, she also took on portfolio responsibility for climate change, becoming Minister for the Environment and Climate Change. After the 2011 election, which saw a SNP landslide, she was appointed [[Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs]] with special responsibility for tackling [[sectarianism]].

In [[Nicola Sturgeon]]'s first reshuffle in November 2014, she was promoted to Cabinet as [[Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training]].

She announced on 21 August 2020 that she would step down as an MSP in the 2021 Scottish election.<ref>{{cite web |title=SNP's Roseanna Cunningham to stand down as MSP |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-53873493 |website=BBC News |accessdate=22 August 2020 |date=22 August 2020}}</ref>
