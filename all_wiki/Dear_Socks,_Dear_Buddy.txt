The idea for the book originated with Clinton's publisher, [[Simon & Schuster]], who were interested in a follow-up to Clinton's best-selling 1996 volume ''[[It Takes a Village]]''.<ref name="nyt-announce">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/08/business/media-talk-the-first-pets-get-their-own-book.html | title=Media Talk: The First Pets Get Their Own Book | first=Doreen | last=Carvajal | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 8, 1998}}</ref> It also followed in the pawsteps of prior First Lady [[Barbara Bush]]'s popular 1990 effort ''[[Millie's Book]]'', about [[Millie (dog)|the prior White House dog]].<ref name="sr-announce"/> Plans for ''Dear Socks, Dear Buddy'' were announced in June 1998<ref name="sr-announce">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19980605&id=Z4BXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uvEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4264,2334094&hl=en | title=First Lady's book deal is animal act | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] | location=Spokane, Washington | date=June 5, 1998 | page=A4}}</ref> and it was stated that [[Linda Kulman]], a reporter based in Washington, would assist Clinton in the writing.<ref name="sr-announce"/> [[Book Magazine|''Book'']] magazine would subsequently characterize Kulman's role as that of a [[ghostwriter]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-82260536 | title= Master Class: Want to Write a Book?

==Proceeds==
Clinton received no advance for writing the book.<ref name="tsj-announ">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/1098961/?terms=%22dear+socks,+dear+buddy%22 | title=Book based on letters to Clintons' pets | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[The Salina Journal]] | date=June 4, 1998 | page=A4 | via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  }}</ref> All of her proceeds from book sales and related publishing rights were donated to the [[National Park Foundation]], the official charity of America's [[National Park Service]].<ref name="cst-about"/> The publisher said it would donate some of its proceeds to the foundation as well.<ref name="tsj-announ"/>

The foundation was given possession of the copyright to the book, which simplified the tax aspects related to awarding profits to the foundation, thus eliminating some complexities that Clinton had encountered in donating the proceeds of ''It Takes a Village''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/us/the-clintons-pay-92104-in-federal-income-taxes.html | title=The Clintons Pay $92,104 In Federal Income Taxes | first=David Cay | last=Johnston | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date= April 15, 2000}}</ref>
