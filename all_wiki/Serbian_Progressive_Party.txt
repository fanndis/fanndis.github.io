The '''Serbian Progressive Party''' ({{lang-sr|Српска напредна странка|Srpska napredna stranka}}; abbr. СНС or '''''SNS''''') is a [[National conservatism|national-conservative]]<ref name="GandO">{{cite journal|last=Zulianello|first=Mattia|date=April 2020|title=Varieties of Populist Parties and Party Systems in Europe: From State-of-the-Art to the Application of a Novel Classification Scheme to 66 Parties in 33 Countries|journal=[[Government and Opposition]]|volume=55|issue=2|pages=327–347|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi=10.1017/gov.2019.21|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Zurnić">{{cite book |last=Zurnić |first=Marija |title=Corruption and Democratic Transition in Eastern Europe: The Role of Political Scandals in Post-Milošević Serbia |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-90101-5 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzFgDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48}}</ref> and [[Populism|populist]] [[List of political parties in Serbia|political party]] in [[Serbia]] which has been the ruling party since 2012.

Founded in 2008 as a split from the far-right [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS), the culmination of a decade-long conflict within the SRS between the party's moderate and hard-line wings, the SNS managed to retain the former's [[national conservatism|national conservative]] outlook, while adopting distinct [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] and [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] policies. [[Tomislav Nikolić]] served as the party president until he got elected as the [[President of Serbia]] in [[2012 Serbian presidential election|2012]]. After his resignation, former Deputy President [[Aleksandar Vučić]] was elected as the new president of the party. After coming to power in [[2012 Serbian parliamentary election|2012]] they became the [[ruling party]] of Serbia. Having over 750,000 members as of 2020 places SNS as the biggest party in Europe (excluding [[United Russia]]) and they have adopted [[populist]] policies as well as becoming a major [[big tent]] party in the country. 

They are the leading party in the [[For Our Children (Serbia)|current government coalition]] which includes [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-leaning]] political parties that support the current President of Serbia [[Aleksandar Vučić]] and his party. As of November 2020, the party holds 157 seats in the National Assembly while the whole coalition holds 188 out of 250 seats which makes Serbia a [[Dominant-party system|dominant-party state]] in which the opposition in parliament only holds 7 seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/national-assembly/composition/political-parties/political-parties.500.html|title=National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia - Political Parties|website=www.parlament.gov.rs}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Nikolić & Vučić.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić at the SNS founding convention on 21 October 2008.]]
The Serbian Progressive Party was formed by a group of 21 former [[Serbian Radical Party]] (SRS) [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] led by [[Tomislav Nikolić]].

Of the Serbian Radical Party's representatives elected in the [[2008 Serbian parliamentary election|2008 parliamentary election]], 21 moved to the Serbian Progressive Party, while 57 remained in the SRS.

In 2011, the SNS formed a pre-election coalition with [[New Serbia (political party)|New Serbia]], the [[Strength of Serbia Movement]] and the [[Movement of Socialists]] to participate in the 2012 election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pressonline.rs/vesti.html|title=Press Green|website=Press Online}}</ref>

In the [[2012 Serbian parliamentary election|2012 parliamentary election]], the party led the "[[Let's Get Serbia Moving]]" coalition and gained 55 seats out of 73 won by the coalition in the National Assembly. Party leader Tomislav Nikolić defeated [[Boris Tadić]] of the [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]] in the second round of the [[2012 Serbian presidential election|2012 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=05&dd=20&nav_id=80345 |title=Tomislav Nikolić wins in presidential runoff |publisher=B92 |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523070408/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=05&dd=20&nav_id=80345 |archivedate=23 May 2012 }}</ref>

== Allegations of crime and corruption ==
{{Main|SNS-related allegations of crime and corruption}}

The SNS is widely allegated for connections with crime and corruption, and a significant role in eroding rule of law in Serbia, and a drift towards authoritarianism. <ref>{{cite book|last=Voltmer|first=Katrin |title=Media, Communication and the Struggle for Democratic Change: Case Studies on Contested Transitions|publisher=Springer Nature|isbn=978-3-030-16747-9|year=2019|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bieber |first1=Florian |title=Patterns of competitive authoritarianism in the Western Balkans|journal=East European Politics|date=July 2018|volume=38|issue=3|pages=337–54|doi=10.1080/21599165.2018.1490272|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/637944/EPRS_BRI(2019)637944_EN.pdf</ref>

Freedom House's annual Nations in Transit report in the beginning of 2020 reported that, due to democratic backsliding, Serbia was no longer a democracy (as they had been classified since 2003) but had instead become a hybrid regime (in the "gray zone" between "democracies and pure autocracies"). The report cited "years of increasing state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics employed" by Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić. "Although the current SNS-led government came to power in 2012 promising to battle Serbia’s widespread corruption, the problem appears to have worsened, not improved, in the years since." <ref>https://freedomhouse.org/country/serbia/nations-transit/2020</ref>

University of Gothenburg's V-DEM institute Deputy Director Anna Luhmann said that "the indexes of liberal democracy" have drastically deteriorated in Serbia, from 0.53 in 2009 to 0.25 in 2019 becoming the lowest in Western Balkans, putting it on 139th place of 179 countries ranked, therefore labeling it an "electoral autocracy", “mainly due to media censorship, the government’s attempt to influence the work of the media,” but also “a reduced space for the work of civil societies and academic institutions,” as well as “the concern over the quality of the election system.” <ref>https://betabriefing.com/news/politics/12299-v-dem-institute-democratic-traits-drastically-decline-in-serbia</ref>

Various media owned by people linked to be close to the party have been sold to the state-owned Telekom, for prices tenth-fold higher than their estimated worth, effectively transferring public money into hands of several individuals, while capturing them into government control. One of the largest examples is the purchase of "Kopernikus Corporation", which has been sold for staggering 195.5 million euros, which experts estimate that it is several scales lower. <ref>https://safejournalists.net/calls-investigate-purchase-two-serbian-tv-stations/</ref><ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/kopernikus-ma-telekom-srbija-idUSL8N1XH2GP</ref>, of "Radijus Vektor", sold for 108 million euros, of "Wireless Media", sold for 38 million euros, and various acquisitions of minor cable television and internet providers (such as Avcom d.o.o, Belgrade, Radijus Vektor d.o.o, Belgrade, Masko d.o.o, Belgrade BPP Ing d.o.o and Grocka) <ref>https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2020/08/31/telekom-srbija-for-whom-the-golden-chicken-lays-its-eggs/</ref>. The aforementioned acquisitions led to the worsening of financial situation for Telekom, leading the company to issue bonds of value of 23.5 billion dinars<ref>https://seenews.com/news/telekom-srbija-shareholders-approve-235-bln-dinars-200-mln-euro-bond-issue-713775</ref>, to refinance debts. The Serbian Anti-Corruption Council, however, remained silent.<ref>http://rs.n1info.com/English/NEWS/a636215/Serbia-s-Anti-Corruption-Council-still-silent-about-Telekom-Wireless-Media-agreement.html</ref> President Vučić, in 2017, labeled N1, the Serbian main independent media, a "Luxembourg TV with American capital" and a "CIA controlled TV".
