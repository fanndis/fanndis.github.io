'''Crack cocaine''', also known simply as '''crack''' or '''rock''', is a [[free base]] form of [[cocaine]] that can be smoked. Crack offers a short, intense [[Euphoria (emotion)|high]] to smokers. The Manual of Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment calls it the most addictive form of cocaine.<ref name="MASAT">{{cite book|first=Todd Wilk|last=Estroff|title=Manual of Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Publishing]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=2008|pages=44–45|ISBN=9781585627929|quote=It is the most addictive form of cocaine}}</ref> Crack first saw widespread use as a [[recreational drug]] in primarily [[Poverty in the United States|impoverished]] neighborhoods in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Miami]] in late 1984 and 1985; its rapid increase in use and availability is sometimes termed as the "[[crack epidemic]]".<ref>{{cite book |first=Craig |last=Reinarman |first2=Harry G. |last2=Levine |editor-last=Reinarman |editor-first=Craig |editor2-last=Levine |editor2-first=Harry G. |chapter=Crack in Context: America's Latest Demon Drug |title=Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice |year=1997 |location=Berkeley, California|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|ISBN=978-0520202429}}</ref>

==Physical and chemical properties==
In purer forms, crack rocks appear as off-white nuggets with jagged edges,<ref name=AMCcrac/> with a slightly higher density than candle wax. Purer forms of crack resemble a hard plastic in crystalline form, which is brittle.<ref name=AMCcrac/> Like [[cocaine]] in other forms, crack rock acts as a [[local anesthetic]], numbing the tongue or mouth only where directly placed. Purer forms of crack will sink in water or melt at the edges when near a flame (crack vaporizes at 90&nbsp;°C, 194&nbsp;°F).<ref name=MASAT/>

Crack cocaine as sold on the streets may be [[adulterants|adulterated]] or "cut" with other substances mimicking the appearance of crack cocaine to increase bulk.

===Synthesis===
[[File:Crack Ingredients.JPG|thumb|In order for cocaine (in plastic bag at bottom) to be converted to crack, several supplies are needed. Pictured here are [[baking soda]], a commonly used base in making crack, a metal spoon, a [[tealight]], and a cigarette lighter. The spoon is held over the heat source in order to "cook" the cocaine into crack.]]
[[File:Cooking Crack.JPG|thumb|A close up of the "cooking" process that creates crack.]]

[[Sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, common baking soda) is a base used in preparation of crack, although other [[weak base]]s may substitute for it.<ref name="Treadwell2007">{{cite journal |last1=Treadwell |first1=SD |last2=Robinson |first2=TG |title=Cocaine use and stroke |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |date=June 2007 |volume=83 |issue=980 |pages=389–94 |pmid=17551070|pmc=2600058|type=Review |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2006.055970}}</ref><ref name="NYCCocaineAbuse">{{cite web |title=Cocaine Abuse & Addiction |url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/cocaine-abuse-and-addiction.page |website=www1.nyc.gov |publisher=City of New York}}</ref> The net reaction when using sodium bicarbonate is
:Coc-H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> → Coc + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> + NaCl

With [[ammonium bicarbonate]]:

:Coc-H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> + NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> → Coc + [[ammonium chloride|NH<sub>4</sub>Cl]] + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

With [[ammonium carbonate]]:

:2(Coc-H<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup>) + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> → 2 Coc + 2 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O

Crack cocaine is frequently purchased already in rock form,<ref name=AMCcrac/> although it is not uncommon for some users to "wash up" or "cook" powder cocaine into crack themselves. This process is frequently done with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), water, and a spoon. Once mixed and heated, the bicarbonate reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder cocaine, forming free base cocaine and [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) in a reversible acid-base reaction. The heating accelerates the degradation of carbonic acid into [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water. Loss of CO<sub>2</sub> prevents the reaction from reversing back to cocaine hydrochloride. Free base cocaine separates as an oily layer, floating on the top of the now leftover aqueous phase. It is at this point that the oil is picked up rapidly, usually with a pin or long thin object. This pulls the oil up and spins it, allowing air to set and dry the oil, and allows the maker to roll the oil into the rock-like shape.

Crack vaporizes near temperature 90&nbsp;°C (194&nbsp;°F),<ref name=MASAT/> much lower than the cocaine hydrochloride melting point of 190&nbsp;°C (374&nbsp;°F).<ref name=MASAT/> Whereas cocaine hydrochloride cannot be smoked (burns with no effect),<ref name=MASAT/> ''crack cocaine'' when smoked allows for quick absorption into the blood stream, and reaches the brain in eight seconds.<ref name=MASAT/> 

Crack cocaine can also be injected intravenously with the same effect as powder cocaine. However, whereas powder cocaine dissolves in water, crack must be dissolved in an acidic solution such as lemon juice (containing [[citric acid]]) or white vinegar (containing [[acetic acid]]), a process that effectively reverses the original conversion of powder cocaine to crack.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ponton |first1=Rhys |last2=Scott |first2=Jenny |title=Injection preparation processes used by heroin and crack cocaine injectors |journal=Journal of Substance Use |date=12 July 2009 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1080/14659890410001665041}}</ref> [[Harm reduction]] and [[public health]] agencies may distribute packets of citric acid or [[ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) for this purpose.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=Magdalena |last2=Scott |first2=Jenny |last3=Wright |first3=Talen |last4=Brathwaite |first4=Rachel |last5=Ciccarone |first5=Daniel |last6=Hope |first6=Vivian |title=Injecting-related health harms and overuse of acidifiers among people who inject heroin and crack cocaine in London: a mixed-methods study |journal=Harm Reduction Journal |date=13 November 2019 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=60 |doi=10.1186/s12954-019-0330-6|pmid=31722732 |pmc=6854679 }}</ref>

==Recreational use==
[[File:Smoking Crack.jpg|thumb|A woman smoking crack cocaine.]]
Crack cocaine is commonly used as a recreational drug.

==Adverse effects{{anchor|Health issues}}==
Because crack is an illicit drug, users may consume impure or fake ("bunk") drugs, which may pose additional health risks.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Hesketh|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/benzocaine-crack-scam-nets-drug-18238984|title=Benzocaine 'crack' scam nets drug dealers massive profits|newspaper=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|date=22 August 2010|access-date=17 June 2020}}</ref>

===Physiological===
[[File:Physiological effects of Crack cocaine.png|thumb|right|250px|Main physiological effects of crack cocaine]]
The short-term physiological effects of cocaine include<ref name=DEAC/> constricted blood vessels, [[Mydriasis|dilated pupils]], and increased temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Some users of cocaine report feelings of restlessness, irritability, and anxiety. In rare instances, sudden death can occur on the first use of cocaine or unexpectedly thereafter.<ref name=DEAC/> Cocaine-related deaths are often a result of [[cardiac arrest]] or seizures followed by respiratory arrest.

Like other forms of cocaine, smoking crack can increase heart rate<ref name=PP/> and blood pressure, leading to long-term cardiovascular problems. Some research suggests that smoking crack or freebase cocaine has additional health risks compared to other methods of taking cocaine. Many of thes issues relate specifically to the release of [[methylecgonidine]] and its effect on the heart,<ref name="PP">{{cite journal |first1=Karl|last1=Scheidweiler|first2=Mark A.|last2=Plessinger|first3=Jalil|last3=Shojaie|first4=Ronald W.|last4=Wood|first5=Tai C.|last5=Kwong|title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methylecgonidine, a crack cocaine pyrolyzate |journal=[[Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics]] |publisher=[[American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics]]|location=Rockville, Maryland|volume=307 |issue=3 |pages=1179–1187 |year=2003 |pmid=14561847 |doi=10.1124/jpet.103.055434 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b70c/b72a01c30205621d07ca2c667b8b19894ce1.pdf }}</ref> lungs,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang Y, Ke Q, Cai J, Xiao YF, Morgan JP |title=Evidence for cocaine and methylecgonidine stimulation of M(2) muscarinic receptors in cultured human embryonic lung cells |journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=451–460 |year=2001 |pmid=11159694 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0703819 |pmc=1572570}}</ref> and liver.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fandiño AS, Toennes SW, Kauert GF |year=2002 |title=Studies on hydrolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways of anhydroecgonine methyl ester (methylecgonidine) using microsomal preparations from rat organs |journal=[[Chemical Research in Toxicology]] |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1543–1548 |doi=10.1021/tx0255828 |pmid=12482236}}<!--|accessdate=2008-02-24--></ref>

*Toxic [[adulterant]]s: Many substances may have been added in order to expand the weight and volume of a batch, while still appearing to be pure crack. Occasionally, highly toxic substances are used, with a range of corresponding short and long-term health risks. Adulturants used with crack and cocaine include [[milk powder]], sugars such as [[glucose]], [[starch]], [[caffeine]], [[lidocaine]], [[benzocaine]], [[paracetamol]], [[amphetamine]], [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] and [[strychnine]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cole |first1=Claire |last2=Jones |first2=Lisa |last3=McVeigh |first3=Jim |last4=Kicman |first4=Andrew |last5=Syed |first5=Qutub |last6=Belis |first6=Mark A. |date=2010 |title=Cut: A Guide to Adulturants, Bulkinh Agents and other Contaminants found in Illicit Drugs |publisher=Centre for Public Health, Liverpool John Moores University |pages=6–25 }}</ref>
*Smoking problems: Any [[route of administration]] poses its own set of health risks; in the case of crack cocaine, smoking tends to be more harmful than other routes. Crack users tend to smoke the drug because that has a higher [[bioavailability]] than other routes typically used for drugs of abuse such as [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Crack has a melting point of around {{nowrap|90&nbsp;°C}} {{nowrap|(194&nbsp;°F)}},<ref name=MASAT/> and the smoke does not remain potent for long. Therefore, crack pipes are generally very short, to minimize the time between evaporating and ingestion (thereby minimizing loss of potency).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Having a very hot pipe pressed against the lips often causes cracked and blistered lips, colloquially known as "crack lip". The use of "convenience store crack pipes"<ref name=WP/> – glass tubes which originally contained small [[Love rose|artificial roses]] – may contribute to this condition. These 4-inch (10-cm) pipes<ref name="WP">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2006/04/05/a-rose-with-another-name-crack-pipe/430fc938-18e4-4457-bcd1-72601deb118d/ |title=A Rose With Another Name: Crack Pipe |first=Allan |last=Lengel |work=The Washington Post |date=April 5, 2006 |access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref> are not durable and will quickly develop breaks; users may continue to use the pipe even though it has been broken to a shorter length. The hot pipe might burn the lips, tongue, or fingers, especially when passed between people who take hits in rapid succession, causing the short pipe to reach higher temperatures than if used by one person alone.
*Pure or large doses: Because the quality of crack can vary greatly, some people might smoke larger amounts of diluted crack, unaware that a similar amount of a new batch of purer crack could cause an overdose. This can trigger heart problems or cause unconsciousness.
*Pathogens on pipes: When pipes are shared, bacteria or viruses can be transferred from person to person.

====Crack lung====
In crack users, acute respiratory symptoms have been reported, sometimes termed "crack lung". Symptoms include fever, [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]] and difficulty breathing.<ref name=Chem-Bio>{{cite journal |title=The large spectrum of pulmonary complications following illicit drug use: features and mechanisms |pmid=24144776 |last1=Mégarbane |first1=B |last2=Chevillard |first2=L |journal=[[Chemico-Biological Interactions]] |date=5 December 2013 |volume=206 |issue=3 |pages=444–51 |doi=10.1016/j.cbi.2013.10.011}}</ref> In the 48-hour period after use, people with these symptoms have also had associated radiographic findings on chest X-ray of [[pulmonary edema|fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)]], [[interstitial pneumonia]], [[diffuse alveolar hemorrhage]], and [[eosinophil]] infiltration.<ref name=Chem-Bio />

===Psychological===
Stimulant drug abuse (particularly [[amphetamine]] and cocaine) can lead to [[delusional parasitosis]] (aka Ekbom's Syndrome: a mistaken belief they are infested with parasites).<ref name=UCDpar/> For example, excessive cocaine use can lead to [[formication]], nicknamed "cocaine bugs" or "coke bugs", where the affected people believe they have, or feel, parasites crawling under their skin.<ref name=UCDpar/> (Similar delusions may also be associated with high fever or in connection with alcohol withdrawal, sometimes accompanied by visual hallucinations of insects.)<ref name="UCDpar">

  [http://delusion.ucdavis.edu/delusional UCDavis-delusional]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
</ref>

People experiencing these hallucinations might scratch themselves to the extent of serious skin damage and bleeding, especially when they are delirious.<ref name=Cr90/><ref name=UCDpar/>

Paranoia and anxiety are among the most common psychological symptoms of crack cocaine use. Psychosis is more closely associated with smoking crack cocaine than intranasal and intravenous use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Morton |first1= W. Alexander |date= August 1999 |title= Cocaine and Psychiatric Symptoms |pmc= 181074 |journal= Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages= 109–113 |doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0403 |pmid=15014683}}</ref>

===Pregnancy and nursing===
{{main|Prenatal cocaine exposure}}
''Crack baby'' is a term for a child born to a mother who used crack cocaine during her pregnancy. The threat that cocaine use during [[pregnancy]] poses to the [[fetus]] is now considered exaggerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/health/27coca.html | work=The New York Times | first=Susan | last=Okie | title=The Epidemic That Wasn't | date=2009-01-27}}</ref> Studies show that prenatal cocaine exposure (independent of other effects such as, for example, alcohol, tobacco, or physical environment) has no appreciable effect on childhood growth and development.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Growth, Development, and Behavior in Early Childhood Following Prenatal Cocaine Exposure, Frank et al. 285 (12): 1613 – JAMA |journal=JAMA |publisher=Jama.ama-assn.org |date=2001-03-28 |volume=285 |issue=12 |pages=1613–1625 |doi=10.1001/jama.285.12.1613 |last1=Zuckerman |first1=Barry |last2=Pell |first2=Tripler |last3=Knight |first3=Wanda Grant |last4=Augustyn |first4=Marilyn |last5=Frank |first5=Deborah A. |pmid=11268270 |pmc=2504866 }}</ref>
However, the official opinion of the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] of the United States warns about health risks while cautioning against stereotyping:
<blockquote>Many recall that "crack babies", or babies born to mothers who used crack cocaine while pregnant, were at one time written off by many as a lost generation. They were predicted to suffer from severe, irreversible damage, including reduced intelligence and social skills. It was later found that this was a gross exaggeration. However, the fact that most of these children appear normal should not be over-interpreted as indicating that there is no cause for concern. Using sophisticated technologies, scientists are now finding that exposure to cocaine during fetal development may lead to subtle, yet significant, later deficits in some children, including deficits in some aspects of cognitive performance, information-processing, and attention to tasks—abilities that are important for success in school.<ref>[http://www.drugabuse.gov/ResearchReports/Cocaine/cocaine4.html#maternal NIDA – Research Report Series – Cocaine Abuse and Addiction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234838/http://www.drugabuse.gov/ResearchReports/Cocaine/cocaine4.html#maternal |date=September 26, 2007 }}</ref></blockquote>

There are also warnings about the threat of [[breastfeeding]]: The [[March of Dimes]] said "it is likely that cocaine will reach the baby through breast milk," and advises the following regarding cocaine use during pregnancy:
<blockquote>Cocaine use during pregnancy can affect a pregnant woman and her unborn baby in many ways. During the early months of pregnancy, it may increase the risk of miscarriage. Later in pregnancy, it can trigger preterm labor (labor that occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or cause the baby to grow poorly. As a result, cocaine-exposed babies are more likely than unexposed babies to be born with low birthweight (less than {{convert|5.5|lb|kg|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Low-birthweight babies are 20 times more likely to die in their first month of life than normal-weight babies, and face an increased risk of lifelong disabilities such as mental retardation and cerebral palsy. Cocaine-exposed babies also tend to have smaller heads, which generally reflect smaller brains. Some studies suggest that cocaine-exposed babies are at increased risk of birth defects, including urinary-tract defects and, possibly, heart defects. Cocaine also may cause an unborn baby to have a stroke, irreversible brain damage, or a heart attack.<ref name="mod">{{cite web |url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/illicit-drug-use-during-pregnancy.aspx |title=Street Drugs and pregnancy |work=March of Dimes |access-date=2009-05-26}}</ref></blockquote>

===Reinforcement disorders===

====Tolerance====
An appreciable tolerance to cocaine's high may develop, with many addicts reporting that they seek but fail to achieve as much pleasure as they did from their first experience.<ref name=DEAC/> Some users will frequently increase their doses to intensify and prolong the euphoric effects. While tolerance to the high can occur, users might also become more sensitive ([[drug sensitization]]) to cocaine's local anesthetic (pain killing) and convulsant (seizure inducing) effects, without increasing the dose taken; this increased sensitivity ''may'' explain some deaths occurring after apparent low doses of cocaine.<ref name=DEAC/>

====Addiction====
{{Main|Substance dependence}}
Crack cocaine is popularly thought to be the most addictive form of cocaine.<ref name=MASAT/> However, this claim has been contested: Morgan and Zimmer wrote that available data indicated that "...smoking cocaine by itself does not increase markedly the likelihood of dependence.... The claim that cocaine is much more addictive when smoked must be reexamined."<ref>{{Cite book

</ref> They argued that cocaine users who are already prone to abuse are most likely to "move toward a more efficient mode of ingestion" (that is, smoking).

The intense desire to recapture the initial high is what is so addictive for many users.<ref name=AMCcrac/> On the other hand, Reinarman et al. wrote that the nature of crack addiction depends on the social context in which it is used and the psychological characteristics of users, pointing out that many heavy crack users can go for days or weeks without using the drugs.<ref>{{Cite book

==Overdose==

A typical response among users is to have another hit of the drug; however, the levels of [[dopamine]] in the brain take a long time to replenish themselves, and each hit taken in rapid succession leads to progressively less intense highs.<ref name=AMCcrac/> However, a person might binge for 3 or more days without sleep, while inhaling hits from the pipe.<ref name=Cr90/>

Use of cocaine in a binge, during which the drug is taken repeatedly and at increasingly high doses, leads to a state of increasing irritability, restlessness, and [[paranoia]].<ref name=DEAC/> This may result in a full-blown paranoid psychosis, in which the individual loses touch with reality and experiences auditory hallucinations.<ref name=DEAC/>

Large amounts of crack cocaine (several hundred milligrams or more) intensify the user's high, but may also lead to bizarre, erratic, and violent behavior.<ref name=DEAC/> Large amounts can induce tremors, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], muscle twitches, [[paranoia]], or, with repeated doses, a toxic reaction closely resembling [[amphetamine]] poisoning.<ref name=DEAC/>
