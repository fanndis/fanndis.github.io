'''Wyoming''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Wyoming.ogg|w|aɪ|ˈ|oʊ|m|ɪ|ŋ}}) is a [[landlocked]] state in the [[western United States]]. The [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|10th largest state by area]], it is also the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|least populous]] and [[List of U.S. states by population density|second most sparsely populated state]] in the country. It is bordered by [[Montana]] to the north and northwest, [[South Dakota]] and [[Nebraska]] to the east, [[Colorado]] to the south, [[Utah]] to the southwest, and [[Idaho]] to the west. The state population was estimated at 578,759 in 2019. The [[state capital]] and the [[List of municipalities in Wyoming|most populous city]] is [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], which had an estimated population of 63,957 in 2018.<ref name="Cheyenne Pop Estimate">{{cite web|title=City and Town Population Totals: 2010-2018|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=March 1, 2020}}{{dead link|date=April 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Wyoming's western half is mostly covered by the ranges and rangelands of the [[Rocky Mountains]], while the eastern half of the state is high-elevation [[prairie]] called the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]]. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government.<ref name="maineenvironment.org"/> Federal lands include two national parks—[[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]]—two national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.

Original inhabitants of the region include the [[Arapaho]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and [[Shoshone]]. Southwest Wyoming was claimed by the [[Spanish Empire]] and then as Mexican territory until it was ceded to the U.S. in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican–American War]]. The region acquired the name "Wyoming" when a bill was introduced to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in 1865 to provide a temporary government for [[Wyoming Territory|the territory of Wyoming]]. The name had been used earlier for the [[Wyoming Valley]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and is derived from the [[Munsee language|Munsee]] word ''{{lang|umu|xwé:wamənk}}'', meaning "at the big river flat".<ref name="Bright, William 2004 pg. 576">Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576</ref><ref name="State of Wyoming—Narrative">[http://wyoming.gov/general/narrative.asp State of Wyoming—Narrative] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515091433/http://wyoming.gov/general/narrative.asp |date=May 15, 2008 }}</ref>

The main drivers of Wyoming's economy are tourism and extraction of minerals such as [[Coal mining|coal]], [[Petroleum industry|oil]], [[natural gas]], and [[trona]]. Agricultural commodities include livestock, hay, [[sugar beet]]s, grain (wheat and barley), and wool. The climate is [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] and [[continental climate|continental]], drier and windier than the rest of the country with greater temperature extremes. Wyoming has been a politically conservative state since the 1950s, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee carrying the state in every presidential election since [[1968 United States presidential election in Wyoming|1968]].<ref name=leip>{{cite web |title = Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections |accessdate = November 18, 2016 |url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180709214827/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ |archive-date = July 9, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>

===Climate===

Wyoming's climate is generally [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] and [[continental climate|continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''[[Cold steppe|''BSk'']]''), and is drier and windier in comparison to most of the United States with greater temperature extremes. Much of this is due to the topography of the state. Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between {{convert|85|and|95|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in most of the state. With increasing elevation, however, this average drops rapidly with locations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} averaging around {{convert|70|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Summer nights throughout the state are characterized by a rapid cooldown with even the hottest locations averaging in the {{convert|50|–|60|F|C}} range at night. In most of the state, most of the precipitation tends to fall in the late spring and early summer. Winters are cold, but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods, with [[Chinook winds]] providing unusually warm temperatures in some locations. Wyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than {{convert|10|in|mm}} of rainfall per year. Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the [[Bighorn Basin|Big Horn Basin]] averaging {{convert|5|-|8|in|mm}} (making the area nearly a true [[desert]]). The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around {{convert|10|-|12|in|mm}}, making the climate there [[semi-arid]]. Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation, {{convert|20|in|mm}} or more, much of it as snow, sometimes {{convert|200|in|cm}} or more annually. The state's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} at [[Basin, Wyoming|Basin]] on July 12, 1900 and the lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|-66|F|C}} at [[Riverside, Wyoming|Riverside]] on February 9, 1933.

The number of [[thunderstorm]] days vary across the state with the southeastern plains of the state having the most days of thunderstorm activity. Thunderstorm activity in the state is highest during the late spring and early summer. The southeastern corner of the state is the most vulnerable part of the state to [[tornado]] activity. Moving away from that point and westwards, the incidence of tornadoes drops dramatically with the west part of the state showing little vulnerability. Tornadoes, where they occur, tend to be small and brief, unlike some of those that occur farther east.

===Location and size===

As specified in the designating legislation for the [[Territory of Wyoming]], Wyoming's borders are lines of [[latitude]] [[41st parallel north|41°N]] and [[45th parallel north|45°N]], and [[longitude]] 104°3'W and 111°3'W (27 and 34 west of the [[Washington Meridian]])—a [[geodesic]] quadrangle.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Willam J.

[[File:Barns grand tetons.jpg|thumb|[[Teton Range]]]]
[[File:Cattle Drive near Pinedale, WY (14963962303).jpg|thumb|[[Green River (Colorado River tributary)|Green River]] valley]]

The [[Great Plains]] meet the [[Rocky Mountains]] in Wyoming. The state is a great [[plateau]] broken by many [[mountain range]]s. Surface elevations range from the summit of [[Gannett Peak]] in the [[Wind River Range|Wind River Mountain Range]], at {{convert|13804|ft|m}}, to the [[Belle Fourche River]] valley in the state's northeast corner, at {{convert|3125|ft|m}}. In the northwest are the [[Absaroka Range|Absaroka]], [[Owl Creek Mountains|Owl Creek]], [[Gros Ventre Range|Gros Ventre]], [[Wind River Range|Wind River]], and the [[Teton Range|Teton]] ranges. In the north central are the [[Big Horn Mountains]]; in the northeast, the [[Black Hills]]; and in the southern region the [[Laramie Mountains|Laramie]], [[Medicine Bow Mountains|Snowy]], and [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre]] ranges.

The Snowy Range in the south central part of the state is an extension of the Colorado [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] both in geology and in appearance. The Wind River Range in the west central part of the state is remote and includes more than 40 mountain peaks in excess of {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in addition to Gannett Peak, the highest peak in the state. The Big Horn Mountains in the north central portion are somewhat isolated from the bulk of the Rocky Mountains.

The Teton Range in the northwest extends for {{convert|50|mi|km}}, part of which is included in [[Grand Teton National Park]]. The park includes the [[Grand Teton]], the second highest peak in the state.

The [[Continental Divide]] spans north–south across the central portion of the state. Rivers east of the divide drain into the [[Missouri River Basin]] and eventually the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. They are the [[North Platte River|North Platte]], [[Wind River (Wyoming)|Wind]], [[Bighorn River|Big Horn]] and the [[Yellowstone River|Yellowstone]] rivers. The [[Snake River]] in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the [[Columbia River]] and the Pacific Ocean, as does the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] through the [[Colorado River]] Basin.

The Continental Divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the [[Great Divide Basin]] where water that precipitates onto or flows into it cannot reach an ocean—it ''all'' sinks into the soil and eventually evaporates.

Several rivers begin in or flow through the state, including the Yellowstone River, Bighorn River, Green River, and the Snake River.

====Islands====

{{Main list|List of islands of Wyoming}}

Wyoming has 32 named islands; the majority are in [[Jackson Lake (Wyoming)|Jackson Lake]] and [[Yellowstone Lake]], within [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the northwest portion of the state. The [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] in the southwest also contains a number of islands.

==History==

{{Main|History of Wyoming}}
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Fort Laramie - Walters 37194049.jpg|thumb|The first [[Fort Laramie]] as it looked before 1840 (painting from memory by Alfred Jacob Miller)]]

Several Native American groups originally inhabited the region now known as Wyoming. The [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Arapaho]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], and [[Shoshone]] were but a few of the original inhabitants white explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and later Mexican territory of [[Alta California]], until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the [[Mexican–American War]]. French-Canadian trappers from Québec and Montréal went into the state in the late 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as Téton and [[Jacques La Ramee|La Ramie]]. [[John Colter]], a member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], itself guided by French Canadian [[Toussaint Charbonneau]] and his young Shoshone wife, [[Sacagawea]], first described the region in 1807. At the time, his reports of the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Yellowstone]] area were considered to be fictional.<ref>{{Gutenberg |no=42112 |name=The Yellowstone National Park |bullet=none }}</ref> [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]] and a party of five men returning from [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] discovered [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1812. The [[Oregon Trail]] later followed that route. In 1850, [[Jim Bridger]] located what is now known as [[Bridger Pass]], which the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] used in 1868—as did [[Interstate 80 in Wyoming|Interstate 80]], 90 years later. Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that, like those of Colter, were largely regarded as [[tall tale]]s at the time.

The region acquired the name ''Wyoming'' by 1865, when Representative [[James Mitchell Ashley]] of [[Ohio]] introduced a bill to Congress to provide a "temporary government for [[Wyoming Territory|the territory of Wyoming]]". The territory was named after the [[Wyoming Valley]] in Pennsylvania, made famous by the 1809 poem ''[[Gertrude of Wyoming]]'' by [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]], based on the [[Battle of Wyoming]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The name ultimately derives from the [[Munsee language|Munsee]] word ''{{lang|umu|xwé:wamənk}}'', meaning "at the big river flat".<ref name="Bright, William 2004 pg. 576"/><ref name="State of Wyoming—Narrative"/>
[[File:Wyoming Jeep Trail.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|A backcountry road in the [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre Range]] of southeastern Wyoming, near Bridger Peak]]

The region's population grew steadily after the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] reached the town of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] in 1867, and the federal government established the Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868.<ref>[http://wyoming.gov/state/wyoming_news/general/history.asp State of Wyoming—General Facts About Wyoming] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200649/http://wyoming.gov/state/wyoming_news/general/history.asp |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> Unlike mineral-rich [[Colorado]], Wyoming lacked significant deposits of gold and silver, as well as Colorado's subsequent population boom. However, [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City]] did experience a short-lived boom after the Carissa Mine began producing gold in 1867.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wyoparks.state.wy.us/Site/Brochure/SouthPassCity.pdf |title=South Pass City Historic Site |format=PDF |publisher=Wyoming State Parks, Historic Sites & Trails |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227040747/http://wyoparks.state.wy.us/Site/Brochure/SouthPassCity.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Furthermore, copper was mined in some areas between the [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre Mountains]] and the Snowy Range near [[Grand Encampment, Wyoming|Grand Encampment]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M8pIAAAAMAAJ |title=Mines Register: Successor to the Mines Handbook and the Copper Handbook, Describing the Non-ferrous Metal Mining Companies in the Western Hemisphere |year=1911 |last1=Stevens |first1=Horace Jared |last2=Weed |first2=Walter Harvey |last3=Neale |first3=Walter Garfield |last4=Rand |first4=Lenox Hawes |last5=Sturgis |first5=Edward Barney |last6=Zimmerman |first6=Joseph |display-authors=2}}</ref>

Once government-sponsored expeditions to the Yellowstone country began, reports by Colter and Bridger, previously believed to be apocryphal, were found to be true. This led to the creation of [[Yellowstone National Park]], which became the world's first [[national park]] in 1872. Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming.

On December 10, 1869, territorial Governor [[John Allen Campbell]] extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and then United States state to grant [[suffrage]] to women. In addition, Wyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into politics. Women first served on juries in Wyoming ([[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] in 1870); Wyoming had the first female court bailiff ([[Mary Atkinson (bailiff)|Mary Atkinson]], Laramie, in 1870); and the first female [[justice of the peace]] in the country ([[Esther Hobart Morris]], South Pass City, in 1870). Also, in 1924, Wyoming became the first state to elect a female governor, [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], who took office in January 1925.<ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=T.

Wyoming was the location of the [[Johnson County War]] of 1892, which erupted between competing groups of cattle ranchers. The passage of the federal [[Homestead Act]] led to an influx of small ranchers. A [[range war]] broke out when either or both of the groups chose violent conflict over commercial competition in the use of the public land.

As of 2015, Wyoming had an estimated population of 586,107, which was an increase of 1,954, or 0.29%, from the prior year and an increase of 22,481, or 3.99%, since the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 4,035 into the state. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 2,264 and migration within the country produced a net increase of 1,771. In 2004, the foreign-born population was 11,000 (2.2%).

==Government and politics==

{{Further|Elections in Wyoming}}
[[File:Wyoming State Capitol.jpg|thumb|Wyoming State Capitol building, Cheyenne]]

===State government===

Wyoming's Constitution established three branches of government: the [[List of Governors of Wyoming|executive]], [[Wyoming Legislature|legislative]], and [[Wyoming Supreme Court|judicial]] branches. The [[Wyoming State Legislature|state legislature]] comprises a [[Wyoming House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 60 members and a [[Wyoming Senate|Senate]] with 30 members. The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Wyoming|governor]] and includes a [[Secretary of State of Wyoming|secretary of state]], [[Wyoming State Auditor|auditor]], treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Wyoming does not have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Wyoming|lieutenant governor]]. The secretary of state is first in the line of succession.

Wyoming's sparse population warrants it only one [[at-large]] seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], and hence only three votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].

The [[Wyoming State Liquor Association]] is the state's sole legal wholesale distributor of spirits, making it an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]. With the exception of wine, state law prohibits the purchase of alcoholic beverages for resale from any other source.<ref name=WYlaws>{{cite web|url=http://wyoliquor.org/html/common_questions.htm |title=WSLA common questions |last=WSLA |publisher=Wyoming State Liquor Association |accessdate=18 Feb 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212185550/http://wyoliquor.org/html/common_questions.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2014 }}</ref>

===Judicial system===

Wyoming's highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Wyoming]], with five justices presiding over appeals from the state's lower courts. Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate [[appellate court]], like most states. This is largely attributable to the state's population and correspondingly lower caseload. Appeals from the state district courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Wyoming also has state circuit courts (formerly county courts), of limited jurisdiction, which handle certain types of cases, such as civil claims with lower dollar amounts, misdemeanor criminal offenses, and [[felony]] [[arraignment]]s. Circuit court judges also commonly hear small claims cases as well.

Before 1972, Wyoming judges were selected by popular vote on a nonpartisan ballot. This earlier system was criticized by the state bar who called for the adoption of the [[Missouri Plan]], a system designed to balance judiciary independence with judiciary accountability. In 1972, an amendment to Article{{nbsp}}5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which incorporated a modified version of the plan, was adopted by the voters. Since the adoption of the amendment, all state court judges in Wyoming are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the Governor. They are then subject to a [[retention vote]] by the electorate one year after appointment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubble |first1=Larry |title=The Equality State: Government and Politics in Wyoming |date=2008 |publisher=Eddie Bowers Publishing Co. |location=Peosta, Iowa |isbn=978-1-57879-076-0 |pages=91–92 |edition=6th|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

While the state elected notable [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics have become decidedly more conservative since the 1980s as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] came to dominate the state's congressional delegation. Today, Wyoming is represented in Washington by its two Senators, [[Mike Enzi]] and [[John Barrasso]], and its one member of the House of Representatives, Congresswoman [[Liz Cheney]]. All three are Republicans; a Democrat has not represented Wyoming in the Senate since 1977 or in the House since 1978. The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, one of only eight times since statehood. At present, there is only one relatively reliably Democratic county, affluent [[Teton County, Wyoming|Teton]], and one swing county, college county [[Albany County, Wyoming|Albany]]. In the 2004 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] won his second-largest victory, with 69% of the vote. Former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] is a Wyoming resident and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.

Republicans are no less dominant at the state level. They have held a majority in the state senate continuously since 1936 and in the state house since 1964. However, Democrats held the [[governor of Wyoming|governorship]] for all but eight years between 1975 and 2011. Uniquely, Wyoming elected Democrat [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] as the first woman in United States history to serve as state governor. She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, [[William Bradford Ross]], unexpectedly died a little more than a year into his term.<ref>{{cite book |author=Teva J.

===Sports===

Due to its sparse population, Wyoming lacks any major professional sports teams. However, the [[Wyoming Cowboys and Cowgirls]]—particularly the football and basketball teams—are quite popular. Their stadiums in Laramie are about 7,200 feet (2,200 m) above sea level, the highest in [[NCAA Division I|NCAA Division{{nbsp}}I]]. The [[Wyoming High School Activities Association]] also sponsors twelve sports.

[[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]] has hosted the [[College National Finals Rodeo]] since 2001.

The composition of Wyoming's economy differs significantly from that of other states with most activity in tourism, agriculture, and energy extraction; and little in anything else.<ref name=NYT71515 />

The mineral extraction industry and travel and tourism sector are the main drivers behind Wyoming's economy. The federal government owns about 50% of its landmass, while 6% is controlled by the state. Total taxable values of mining production in Wyoming for 2001 was over $6.7&nbsp;billion. The [[Tourism|tourism industry]] accounts for over $2&nbsp;billion in revenue for the state.

In 2002, more than six million people visited Wyoming's [[national park]]s and monuments. The key tourist attractions in Wyoming include [[Grand Teton National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Devils Tower National Monument]], [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] and [[Fossil Butte National Monument]]. Each year Yellowstone National Park, the world's first national park, receives three million visitors.

Historically, agriculture has been an important component of Wyoming's economy. Its overall importance to the performance of Wyoming's economy has waned. However, agriculture is still an essential part of Wyoming's culture and lifestyle. The main agricultural commodities produced in Wyoming include livestock (beef), [[hay]], [[sugar beets]], grain (wheat and barley), and [[wool]]. More than 91% of land in Wyoming is classified as rural.

Wyoming is the home of only a handful of companies with a regional or national presence. [[Taco John's]] and [[Sierra Trading Post]], both in Cheyenne, are privately held. [[Cloud Peak Energy]] in Gillette and U.S. Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: USEG) in Riverton are Wyoming's only publicly traded companies.

Wyoming's mineral commodities include coal, natural gas, [[coalbed methane]], [[crude oil]], [[uranium]], and [[trona]].
* Coal: Wyoming produced 395.5&nbsp;million short tons (358.8&nbsp;million metric tons) of coal in 2004, greater than any other state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=WY |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Wyoming |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117132905/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=WY |archive-date=November 17, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Wyoming possesses a reserve of 68.7&nbsp;billion tons (62.3&nbsp;billion metric tons) of coal. Major coal areas include the [[Powder River Basin]] and the [[Green River Basin]]
* Coalbed methane (CBM): The boom for CBM began in the mid-1990s. CBM is characterized as methane gas that is extracted from Wyoming's coal bed seams. It is another means of natural gas production. There has been substantial CBM production in the [[Powder River Basin]]. In 2002, the CBM production yield was 327.5&nbsp;billion cubic feet (9.3&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>).
* Crude oil: Wyoming produced {{convert|53.4|Moilbbl}} of crude oil in 2007. The state ranked fifth nationwide in oil production in 2007.<ref name="petro"/> Petroleum is most often used as a motor fuel, but it is also utilized in the manufacture of plastics, paints, and synthetic rubber.
* Diamonds: The [[Kelsey Lake Diamond Mine]], located in Colorado less than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} from the Wyoming border, produced gem quality diamonds for several years. The [[Wyoming craton]], which hosts the [[kimberlite]] [[volcanic pipe]]s that were mined, underlies most of Wyoming.
* Natural gas: Wyoming produced 1.77&nbsp;trillion cubic feet (50.0&nbsp;billion m<sup>3</sup>) of natural gas in 2016. The state ranked 6th nationwide for natural gas production in 2016.<ref>US Energy Information Administration, [https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_a_EPG0_VGM_mmcf_a.htm Natural Gas Production] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623195724/https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_a_EPG0_VGM_mmcf_a.htm |date=June 23, 2017 }}, accessed 14 June 2017.</ref> The major markets for natural gas include industrial, commercial, and domestic heating.

* Uranium: Although [[uranium mining in Wyoming]] is much less active than it was in previous decades, recent increases in the price of [[uranium]] have generated new interest in uranium prospecting and mining.

===Taxes===

Unlike most other states, Wyoming does not levy an individual or corporate [[income tax]]. In addition, Wyoming does not assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Wyoming has a state [[sales tax]] of 4%. Counties have the option of collecting an additional 1% tax for general revenue and a 1% tax for specific purposes, if approved by voters. Food for human consumption is not subject to sales tax.<ref>[http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2006/03/03/news/wyoming/32-food-tax.prt ''Votes back repeal of food tax''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414230521/https://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2006/03/03/news/wyoming/32-food-tax.prt |date=April 14, 2006 }}, [[Billings Gazette]], March 3, 2006</ref> There also is a county lodging tax that varies from 2% to 5%. The state collects a [[use tax]] of 5% on items purchased elsewhere and brought into Wyoming.
All [[property tax]] is based on the assessed value of the property and Wyoming's Department of Revenue's Ad Valorem Tax Division supports, trains, and guides local government agencies in the uniform assessment, valuation and taxation of locally assessed property. "Assessed value" means taxable value; "taxable value" means a percent of the fair market value of property in a particular class. Statutes limit property tax increases. For county revenue, the property tax rate cannot exceed 12 [[Mill (currency)|mills]] (or 1.2%) of assessed value. For cities and towns, the rate is limited to eight [[Mill (currency)|mills]] (0.8%). With very few exceptions, state law limits the property tax rate for all governmental purposes.

In addition, the state is served by the [[State highways in Wyoming|Wyoming state highway system]].

[[Interstate 25 in Wyoming|Interstate 25]] enters the state south of Cheyenne and runs north, intersecting Interstate 80 immediately west of Cheyenne. It passes through Casper and ends at Interstate 90 near [[Buffalo, Wyoming|Buffalo]]. [[Interstate 80 in Wyoming|Interstate 80]] crosses the Utah border west of [[Evanston, Wyoming|Evanston]] and runs east through the southern third of the state, passing through Cheyenne before entering Nebraska near [[Pine Bluffs, Wyoming|Pine Bluffs]]. [[Interstate 90 in Wyoming|Interstate 90]] comes into Wyoming near [[Parkman, Wyoming|Parkman]] and cuts through the northeastern part of the state. It serves [[Gillette, Wyoming|Gillette]] and enters South Dakota east of [[Sundance, Wyoming|Sundance]].

U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 14|14]], [[U.S. Route 16|16]], and [[U.S. Route 20#Eastern Section|the eastern section of U.S. 20]] all have their western terminus at the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National Park and pass through [[Cody, Wyoming|Cody]].

Outside of [[Moran, Wyoming|Moran]], U.S. 287 is part of a large interchange with U.S. Highways 26, 191, and 89, before continuing north to the southern entrance of Yellowstone. U.S. 287 continues north of Yellowstone, but the two sections are separated by the national park.

Other [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. highways]] that pass through the state are [[U.S. Highway 18 (Wyoming)|18]], [[U.S. Highway 26 (Wyoming)|26]], [[U.S. Highway 30 (Wyoming)|30]], [[U.S. Highway 85 (Wyoming)|85]], [[U.S. Highway 87 (Wyoming)|87]], [[U.S. Highway 89 (Wyoming)|89]], [[U.S. Highway 189 (Wyoming)|189]], [[U.S. Highway 191 (Wyoming)|191]], [[U.S. Highway 212 (Wyoming)|212]], and [[U.S. Highway 287 (Wyoming)|287]].

[[Public education]] is directed by the state superintendent of public instruction, an elected state official. Educational policies are set by the State Board of Education, a nine-member board appointed by the governor. The constitution prohibits the state from establishing curriculum and textbook selections; these are the prerogatives of local school boards. The [[Wyoming School for the Deaf]] was the only in-state school dedicated to supporting [[deaf]] students in Wyoming before its closure in the summer of 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trib.com/news/local/deaf-alumni-saddened-by-school-s-fate/article_94be7523-5bc5-5031-97ee-9431a205cfe9.html|title=Deaf alumni saddened by school's fate|last=Watt|first=Meghan|date=October 1, 2007|work=Casper Star-Tribune|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194600/http://trib.com/news/local/deaf-alumni-saddened-by-school-s-fate/article_94be7523-5bc5-5031-97ee-9431a205cfe9.html|archive-date=December 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main list|List of colleges and universities in Wyoming}}

Wyoming has one public four-year institution, the [[University of Wyoming]] in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] and one private four-year college, [[Wyoming Catholic College]], in [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]], Wyoming. In addition, there are seven two-year [[community college]]s spread throughout the state.

Before the passing of a new law in 2006, Wyoming had hosted unaccredited institutions, many of them suspected [[diploma mill]]s.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/education/2002174735_diploma09.html Alleged "diploma mills" flocking to Wyoming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223021228/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/education/2002174735_diploma09.html |date=December 23, 2007 }}, by Mead Gruver, ''The Seattle Times'', February 9, 2005</ref> The 2006 law is forcing unaccredited institutions to make one of three choices: move out of Wyoming, close down, or apply for accreditation. The [[Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization]] predicted in 2007 that in a few years the problem of diploma mills in Wyoming might be resolved.<ref>[http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.aspx Unaccredited Colleges] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715144241/http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.aspx |date=July 15, 2007 }}, Potential problems with degree suppliers located in these states—Wyoming, ''[[Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization]]''</ref>
