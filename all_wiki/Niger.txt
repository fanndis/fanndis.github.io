[[Demographics of Niger|Nigerien society]] reflects a diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions and their relatively short period living in a single state. Historically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states. Since independence, Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of [[military dictatorship|military rule]]. After the military coup in 2010, Niger became a democratic, multi-party state. A majority of the population lives in rural areas and has little access to advanced education.

==Etymology==
The country's name comes from the [[Niger River]] which flows through the west of the country; the origin of the river's name is uncertain, though a popular theory is that it comes from the [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] ''n'eghirren'', meaning 'flowing water'.<ref>{{cite book | title =Atlas A-Z | publisher =Dorling Kindersley | year =2004 | location =New York City | page =289 }}</ref> The most common pronunciation is the French one of {{IPAc-en|n|iː|ˈ|ʒ|ɛər}}, though in Anglophone media {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aɪ|dʒ|ər}} is also occasionally used.

=== Empires and kingdoms in pre-colonial Niger ===
Our knowledge of early Nigerien history is limited by the lack of written sources, though it is known that by at least the 5th century BC the territory of modern Niger had become an area of trans-Saharan trade. Led by [[Tuareg]] tribes from the north, camels were as a well-adapted means of transportation through what was now an immense desert.<ref>Lewicki, T. (1994).

The Mali Empire was a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] empire founded by [[Sundiata Keita]] (r. 1230–1255) in circa 1230 and existed up to 1600. As detailed in the ''[[Epic of Sundiata]]'', Mali emerged as a breakaway region of the [[Sosso Empire]], which itself had split from the earlier [[Ghana Empire]].

The [[Fulani]] (also called Peul, Fulbe etc.), a pastoral people found throughout the Sahel, began migrating to Hausaland during the 1200s–1500s.<ref name=countrystudy/><ref name="ancient3"/> During the later 18th century many Fulani were unhappy with the syncretic form of Islam practised there; exploiting also the populace's disdain with corruption amongst the Hausa elite, the Fulani scholar [[Usman Dan Fodio]] (from Gobir) declared a [[Fulani jihad|jihad]] in 1804.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/><ref name="Bradt"/><ref name=fisher1975>H.

Other smaller kingdoms of the period include the [[Dosso Kingdom]], a [[Zarma people|Zarma]] polity founded in 1750 which resisted the rule of Hausa and Sokoto states; and the [[Dendi Kingdom]] on the Niger river, which had been founded by refugees fleeing the collapse of the Songhai Empire in 1591.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/>

=== French Niger (1900–58) ===
{{Main|Senegambia and Niger|Upper Senegal and Niger|French West Africa|Colony of Niger}}
In the 19th century Europeans began to take a greater interest in Africa; several European explorers travelled in the area of modern Niger, such as [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] (in 1805–06), the [[Walter Oudney|Oudney]]-[[Dixon Denham|Denham]]-[[Hugh Clapperton|Clapperton]] expedition (1822–25), [[Heinrich Barth]] (1850–55; with [[James Richardson (explorer)|James Richardson]] and [[Adolf Overweg]]), [[Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs]] (1865–67), [[Gustav Nachtigal]] (1869–74) and [[Parfait-Louis Monteil]] (1890–92).<ref name="Bradt"/>

Several European countries already possessed littoral colonies in Africa, and in the latter half of the century they began to turn their eyes towards the interior of the continent. This process, known as the '[[Scramble for Africa]]', culminated in the [[Berlin Conference|1885 Berlin conference]] in which the colonial powers outlined the division of Africa into spheres of influence. As a result of this, [[France]] gained control of the upper valley of the [[Niger River]] (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern [[Mali]] and Niger).<ref name="IBS093">{{citation|url=https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS093.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 93 – Niger-Nigeria Boundary|date=15 December 1969|access-date=6 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001160001/https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS093.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> France then set about making a reality of their rule on the ground. In 1897 the French officer [[Marius Gabriel Cazemajou]] was sent to Niger; he reached the [[Sultanate of Damagaram]] in 1898 and stayed in [[Zinder]] at the court of Sultan [[Amadou Kouran Daga]]—however he was later killed as Daga feared he would ally with the Chad-based warlord Rabih az-Zubayr.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> In 1899–1900 France coordinated three expeditions—the [[Émile Gentil|Gentil Mission]] from [[French Congo]], the [[Amédée-François Lamy|Foureau-Lamy Mission]] from [[Algeria]] and the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]] from [[Timbuktu]]—with the aim of linking France's African possessions.<ref name="IBS093"/> The three eventually met at [[Kousséri]] (in the far north of [[Cameroon]]) and defeated Rabih az-Zubayr's forces at the [[Battle of Kousséri]]. The Voulet-Chanoine Mission was marred by numerous atrocities, and became notorious for pillaging, looting, raping and killing many local civilians on its passage throughout southern Niger.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/><ref name="Bradt"/> On 8 May 1899, in retaliation for the resistance of queen [[Sarraounia]], captain Voulet and his men murdered all the inhabitants of the village of [[Birni-N'Konni]] in what is regarded as one of the worst massacres in French colonial history.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> The brutal methods of Voulet and Chanoine caused a scandal and Paris was forced to intervene; however when Lieutenant-Colonel [[Jean-François Klobb]] caught up with the mission near [[Tessaoua]] to relieve them of command he was killed. Lt. [[Paul Joalland]], Klobb's former officer, and Lt. [[Octave Meynier]] eventually took over the mission following a mutiny in which Voulet and Chanoine were killed.<ref name="Bradt"/>

The Military Territory of Niger was subsequently created within the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony (modern Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger) in December 1904 with its capital at [[Niamey]], then little more than a large village.<ref name="Bradt"/> The [[Niger-Nigeria border|border]] with Britain's colony of Nigeria to the south was finalised in 1910, a rough delimitation having already been agreed by the two powers via several treaties during the period 1898–1906.<ref name="IBS093"/> The capital of the territory was moved to Zinder in 1912 when the Niger Military Territory was split off from Upper Senegal and Niger, before being moved back to Niamey in 1922 when Niger became a fully-fledged colony within [[French West Africa]].<ref name="Bradt"/><ref name="H-Dictionary"/> The borders of Niger were drawn up in various stages and had been fixed at their current position by the late 1930s. Various territorial adjustments took place in this period: the areas west of the Niger river were only [[Burkina Faso–Niger border|attached]] to Niger in 1926–27, and during the dissolution of Upper Volta (modern Burkina Faso) in 1932–47 much of the east of that territory was added to Niger;<ref name="IBS146">{{citation|url=https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS146.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 146 – Burkina Faso-Niger Boundary|date=18 November 1974|access-date=5 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001160026/https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS146.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="H-Dictionary"/> and in the east the [[Tibesti Mountains]] were [[Chad-Niger border|transferred]] to Chad in 1931.<ref name="IBS73">{{citation|url=https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS073.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 73 – Chad-Niger Boundary|date=1 August 1966|access-date=5 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001160014/https://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS073.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The French generally adopted a form of indirect rule, allowing existing native structures to continue to exist within the colonial framework of governance providing that they acknowledged French supremacy.<ref name="Bradt"/> The Zarma of the Dosso Kingdom in particular proved amenable to French rule, using them as allies against the encroachments of Hausa and other nearby states; over time the Zarma thus became one of the more educated and westernised groups in Niger.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> However, perceived threats to French rule, such as the Kobkitanda rebellion in [[Dosso Region]] (1905–06), led by the blind cleric Alfa Saibou, and the Karma revolt in the Niger valley (December 1905–March 1906) led by Oumarou Karma were suppressed with force, as were the latter [[Hamallayya]] and [[Hauka]] religious movements.<ref name="Bradt"/><ref name="H-Dictionary">{{cite book |authors=Decalo, Sameul & Idrissa, Abdourahmane |title=Historical Dictionary of Niger |date=1 June 2012 |isbn=9780810870901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFFjEMjKrWkC&pg=PA286 |accessdate=25 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725153320/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=GFFjEMjKrWkC&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286 |archive-date=25 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>''UNESCO General History of Africa'', Vol. VIII: Africa Since 1935.

During the [[Second World War]], during which time mainland France was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]], [[Charles de Gaulle]] issued the Brazzaville Declaration, declaring that the French colonial empire would be replaced post-war with a less centralised [[French Union]].<ref>Joseph R. De Benoist, "The Brazzaville Conference, or Involuntary Decolonization." ''Africana Journal'' 15 (1990) pp: 39–58.</ref> The French Union, which lasted from 1946–58, conferred a limited form of French citizenship on the inhabitants of the colonies, with some decentralisation of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies. It was during this period that the [[Nigerien Progressive Party – African Democratic Rally|Nigerien Progressive Party]] (''Parti Progressiste Nigérien'', or PPN, originally a branch of the African Democratic Rally, or ''[[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain]]'' – RDA) was formed under the leadership of former teacher [[Hamani Diori]], as well as the left-wing [[Mouvement Socialiste Africain-Sawaba]] (MSA) led by [[Djibo Bakary]]. Following the Overseas Reform Act (''Loi Cadre'') of 23 July 1956 and the establishment of the [[Fifth French Republic]] on 4 December 1958, Niger became an autonomous state within the [[French Community]]. On 18 December 1958, an autonomous Republic of Niger was officially created under the leadership of Hamani Diori. The MSA was banned in 1959 for its perceived excessive anti-French stance.<ref name=djibo03>Mamoudou Djibo. Les enjeux politiques dans la colonie du Niger (1944-1960). Autrepart no 27 (2003), pp. 41–60.</ref> On 11 July 1960, Niger decided to leave the French Community and acquired full independence on 3 August 1960; Diori thus became the first [[List of Presidents of Niger|president]] of the country.

For its first 14 years as an independent state Niger was run by a single-party civilian regime under the presidency of Hamani Diori.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hamani-Diori|title=Encyclopedia Britannica - Hamni Diori|accessdate=19 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903003241/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hamani-Diori|archive-date=3 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The 1960s were largely peaceful, and saw a large expansion of the education system and some limited economic development and industrialisation.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> Links with France remained deep, with Diori allowing the development of French-led [[uranium]] mining in [[Arlit]] and supporting France in the [[Algerian War]].<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> Relations with other African states were mostly positive, with the exception of [[Dahomey]] (Benin), owing to an ongoing [[Benin-Niger border|border]] dispute. Niger remained a one-party state throughout this period, with Diori surviving a planned coup in 1963 and an assassination attempt in 1965; much of this activity was masterminded by Djibo Bakary's MSA-Sawaba group, which had launched an abortive rebellion in 1964.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Jon Abbink |author2=Mirjam de Bruijn, Klaas van Walraven |title=Rethinking Resistance: revolt and violence in African history |year=2003 |url= https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/9606/ASC_1267345_058.pdf?sequence=1 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=90-04-12624-4 |chapter= ''Sawaba's Rebellion in Niger (1964-64)''}}</ref> In the early 1970s, a combination of economic difficulties, devastating [[drought]]s and accusations of rampant corruption and mismanagement of food supplies resulted in a [[1974 Nigerien coup d'état|coup d'état]] that overthrew the Diori regime.

==== First military regime: The Supreme Military Council and Second Republic (1974–1991) ====
The coup had been masterminded by Col. [[Seyni Kountché]] and a small military group under the name of the ''Conseil Militaire Supreme'', with Kountché going on to rule the country until his death in 1987.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> The first action of the military government was to address the food crisis.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://perspective.usherbrooke.ca/bilan/servlet/BMEve?codeEve=574 Renversement du président Hamani Diori au Niger] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022153822/http://perspective.usherbrooke.ca/bilan/servlet/BMEve?codeEve=574 |date=22 October 2014 }}.

There were several attempted coups (in 1975, 1976 and 1984) which were thwarted, their instigators being severely punished.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/>

Despite the restriction in freedom, the country enjoyed improved economic development as Kountché sought to create a 'development society', funded largely by the uranium mines in [[Agadez Region]].<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> Several [[parastatal]] companies were created, major infrastructure (building and new roads, schools, health centres) constructed, and there was minimal corruption in government agencies, which Kountché did not hesitate to punish severely.<ref>[https://nigerdiaspora.net/index.php/societe/2547-niamey-une-forte-tendance-a-la-depravation-des-moeurs Kountché: 30 ans après son coup d'état] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727084909/https://nigerdiaspora.net/index.php/societe/2547-niamey-une-forte-tendance-a-la-depravation-des-moeurs |date=27 July 2018 }}.

[[Ali Saibou]], who was confirmed as Chief of the Supreme Military Council four days later.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/>

Saibou significantly curtailed the most repressive aspects of the Kountché era (such as the secret police and media censorship), and set about introducing a process of political reform under the overall direction of a single party (the ''Mouvement National pour la Société du Développement'', or MNSD).<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> A Second Republic was declared and a new constitution was drawn up, which was adopted following a [[1989 Nigerien constitutional referendum|referendum]] in 1989.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> General Saibou became the first president of the Second Republic after winning the [[1989 Nigerien general election|presidential election]] on 10 December 1989.<ref name="auto1">Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p685 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}</ref>

President Saibou's efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of trade union and student demands to institute a [[multi-party democracy|multi-party democratic system]]. On 9 February 1990, a violently repressed student march in Niamey led to the death of three students, which led to increased national and international pressure for further democratic reform.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> The Saibou regime acquiesced to these demands by the end of 1990.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> Meanwhile, trouble re-emerged in Agadez Region when a group of armed Tuaregs attacked the town of Tchintabaraden (generally seen as the start of the first [[Tuareg rebellion (1990–1995)|Tuareg Rebellion]]), prompting a severe military crackdown which led to many deaths (the precise numbers are disputed, with estimates ranging from 70 to up to 1,000).<ref name="H-Dictionary"/>

==== National Conference and Third Republic (1991–1996) ====
The National Sovereign Conference of 1991 marked a turning point in the post-independence history of Niger and brought about multi-party democracy. From 29 July to 3 November, a national conference gathered together all elements of society to make recommendations for the future direction of the country. The conference was presided over by Prof. [[André Salifou]] and developed a plan for a [[transitional government]]; this was then installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993. After the National Sovereign Conference, the transitional government drafted a new constitution that eliminated the previous single-party system of the 1989 Constitution and guaranteed more freedoms. The new constitution was adopted by a [[1992 Nigerien constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 26 December 1992.<ref>Walter S.

The violence in Agadez Region continued during this period, prompting the Nigerien government to sign a truce with Tuareg rebels in 1992 which was however ineffective owing to internal dissension within the Tuareg ranks.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> Another rebellion, led by dissatisfied [[Toubou]] peoples claiming that, like the Tuareg, the Nigerien government had neglected their region, broke out in the east of the country.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/> In April 1995 a peace deal with the main Tuareg rebel group was signed, with the government agreeing to absorb some former rebels into the military and, with French assistance, help others return to a productive civilian life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Publications|first1=USA International Business|title=Niger Foreign Policy and Government Guide|date=2007|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781433036873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwInUH18i8wC&q=The+niger+agreed+to+absorb+some+of+the+former+rebels+into+the+military+and%2C+with+French+assistance%2C+to+help+others+return+to+a+productive+civilian+life.&pg=PA28|language=en}}</ref>

After winning the election in November 1999, President [[Tandja Mamadou]] was sworn in office on 22 December 1999 as the first president of the Fifth Republic. Mamadou brought about many administrative and economic reforms that had been halted due to the military coups since the Third Republic, as well as helped peacefully resolve a decades-long boundary dispute with Benin.<ref>{{citation|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2005/07/144962-un-world-court-decides-niger-benin-border-dispute|publisher=UN News|title=UN World Court decides Niger, Benin border dispute|date=13 July 2019|accessdate=8 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108193311/https://news.un.org/en/story/2005/07/144962-un-world-court-decides-niger-benin-border-dispute|archive-date=8 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Fabio Spadi (2005) [http://www.ljil.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=5&c=186 The ICJ Judgment in the Benin-Niger Border Dispute: the interplay of titles and ‘effectivités’ under the uti possidetis juris principle, ''Leiden Journal of International Law''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929032048/http://www.ljil.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=5&c=186 |date=29 September 2006 }} 18: 777-794</ref> In August 2002, serious unrest within military camps occurred in [[Niamey]], [[Diffa]], and [[Nguigmi]], but the government was able to restore order within several days.

Proponents of the extended presidency, rallied behind the 'Tazartche' (Hausa for 'overstay') movement, were countered by opponents ('anti-Tazartche') composed of opposition party militants and civil society activists.<ref name="H-Dictionary"/>

The situation in the north also deteriorated significantly in this period, resulting in the outbreak of a [[Second Tuareg Rebellion]] in 2007 led by the ''[[Niger Movement for Justice|Mouvement des Nigériens pour la justice]]'' (MNJ).

In 2009, President Tandja Mamadou decided to organize a constitutional referendum seeking to [[2009–2010 Nigerien constitutional crisis|extend his presidency]], which was opposed by other political parties, as well as being against the decision of the Constitutional Court which had ruled that the referendum would be unconstitutional.

==Geography, climate, and ecology==
{{Main|Geography of Niger}}

[[File:Ng-map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A map of Niger]]
{{MapLibrary|Niger sat.png|Niger}}
Niger is a [[landlocked]] nation in West Africa located along the border between the [[Sahara]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] regions. It borders [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]] to the south, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]] to the west, [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] to the north and [[Chad]] to the east.

Niger lies between latitudes [[11th parallel north|11°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0°]] and [[16th meridian east|16°E]]. Niger's area is {{convert|1267000|km2|sqmi|0}} of which {{convert|300|km2|sqmi|0}} is water. This makes it slightly less than twice the size of [[France]], and the world's twenty-second largest country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Africa :: Niger — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html |website=www.cia.gov |accessdate=1 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919105120/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook//geos/ng.html |archive-date=19 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Niger borders seven countries and has a total perimeter of {{convert|5697|km|mi|0}}. The longest border is with [[Nigeria]] to the south ({{convert|1497|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). This is followed by [[Chad]] to the east, at {{convert|1175|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Algeria]] to the north-northwest ({{convert|956|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and [[Mali]] at {{convert|821|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Niger also has small borders in its far southwest with [[Burkina Faso]] at {{convert|628|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and [[Benin]] at {{convert|266|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and to the north-northeast [[Libya]] at {{convert|354|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The lowest point is the [[Niger River]], with an elevation of {{convert|200|m|ft|0}}. The highest point is [[Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès]] in the [[Aïr Mountains]] at {{convert|2022|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map NER present.svg|thumb|Niger map of Köppen climate classification.]]

Niger's climate is mainly very hot and very dry, with much [[desert]] area. In the extreme south there is a tropical climate on the edges of the Niger River basin. The terrain is predominantly desert plains and [[sand dune]]s, with flat to rolling savanna in the south and hills in the north.

=== Environment ===
{{Further|Wildlife of Niger}}
[[File:Elephant dust bath park w niger.jpg|thumb|An elephant in the [[W National Park]].]]
The north of Niger is covered by large deserts and semi deserts. The typical mammal fauna consists of [[addax]] antelopes, [[scimitar-horned oryx]], gazelles, and in the mountains, Barbary sheep. One of the largest reserves of the world, the [[Aïr and Ténéré National Nature Reserve]], was founded in the northern parts of the Niger to protect these rare species.

The southern parts of Niger are naturally dominated savannahs. The [[W National Park]], situated in the bordering area to [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Benin]], belongs to one of the most important areas for wildlife in Western Africa, which is called the WAP (W–[[Arli National Park|Arli]]–[[Pendjari National Park|Pendjari]]) Complex. It has the most important population of the rare [[West African lion]] and one of the last populations of the [[Northwest African cheetah]].

Other wildlife includes elephants, buffaloes, [[roan antelopes]], [[Kob|kob antelopes]] and warthogs. The [[West African giraffe]] is currently not found in the W National Park, but further north in Niger, where it has its last relict population.

Environmental issues in Niger include destructive farming practices as a result of population pressure. Illegal hunting, bush fires in some areas and human encroachment upon the flood plains of the Niger River for paddy cultivation are environmental issues. Dams constructed on the Niger River in the neighboring countries of Mali and Guinea and also within Niger itself are also cited as a reason for a reduction of water flow in the Niger River—which has a direct effect upon the environment. A lack of adequate staff to guard wildlife in the parks and reserves is another factor cited for loss of wildlife.<ref name="Geels2006" />

==Governance and politics==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2020}}
{{Main|Politics of Niger|Government of Niger}}
[[File:Mahamadou Issoufou-IMG 3628.jpg|thumb|[[Mahamadou Issoufou]], President of Niger.]]
Niger's new constitution was approved on 31 October 2010. It restored the semi-presidential system of government of the 1999 constitution (Fifth Republic) in which the president of the republic, elected by [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term, and a prime minister named by the president share [[executive power]].

As a reflection of Niger's increasing population, the [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Niger|National Assembly]] was expanded in 2004 to 113 deputies elected for a five-year term under a majority system of representation. Political parties must attain at least 5 percent of the vote in order to gain a seat in the legislature.

The constitution also provides for the popular election of municipal and local officials, and the first-ever successful municipal elections took place on 24 July 2004. The National Assembly passed in June 2002 a series of decentralization bills. As a first step, administrative powers will be distributed among 265 communes (local councils); in later stages, regions and departments will be established as decentralized entities. A new electoral code was adopted to reflect the decentralization context. The country is currently divided into 8 regions, which are subdivided into 36 districts (departments). The chief administrator (Governor) in each department is appointed by the government and functions primarily as the local agent of the central authorities.

On 26 May 2009, President Tandja dissolved parliament after the country's constitutional court ruled against plans to hold a referendum on whether to allow him a third term in office. According to the constitution, a new parliament was elected within three months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/05/2009526174440137316.html |title=Africa&nbsp;– Niger leader dissolves parliament |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207122542/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/05/2009526174440137316.html |archive-date=7 February 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> This began a political struggle between Tandja, trying to extend his term-limited authority beyond 2009 through the establishment of a Sixth Republic, and his opponents who demanded that he step down at the end of his second term in December 2009. See [[2009 Nigerien constitutional crisis]]. The military took over the country and President Tandja was put in prison, charged with corruption.

The military kept their promise to return the country to democratic civilian rule. A constitutional referendum and national elections were held. A presidential election was held on 31 January 2011, but as no clear winner emerged, run-off elections were held on 12 March 2011. [[Mahamadou Issoufou]] of the [[Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism]] was elected president. A parliamentary election was held at the same time.<ref>Ahmad, Romoke W.

===Foreign relations===
[[File:Drapeau Niger ambassade Paris.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Niger's flag waving at the embassy in Paris.]]
{{Main|Foreign relations of Niger}}
Niger pursues a moderate foreign policy and maintains friendly relations with the West and the Islamic world as well as non-aligned countries. It belongs to the UN and its main specialized agencies and in 1980–81 served on the [[UN Security Council]]. Niger maintains a special relationship with former colonial power France and has close relations with its West African neighbors.

It is a charter member of the [[African Union]] and the [[West African Monetary Union]] and also belongs to the [[Niger Basin Authority]] and [[Lake Chad Basin Commission]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]). The westernmost regions of Niger are joined with contiguous regions of Mali and Burkina Faso under the [[Liptako-Gourma Authority]].

The border dispute with Benin, inherited from colonial times and concerning inter alia [[Lété Island]] in the [[Niger River]], was solved by the [[International Court of Justice]] in 2005 to Niger's advantage.

=== Government finance ===
Government finance is derived revenue exports (Mining, oil and agricultural exports) as well as various forms of taxes collected by the government. In the past, foreign aid has contributed to large percentages of the budget. In 2013, Niger's government has adopted a zero-deficit budget of 1.279 trillion CFA francs ($2.53 billion) which is claimed to balance revenues and expenditures by an 11% reduction in the budget from the previous year.<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/22/niger-budget-idINL5E8KM1TI20120922 Niger government adopts $2.53 bln budget for 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028043246/http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/22/niger-budget-idINL5E8KM1TI20120922 |date=28 October 2014 }}. [[Reuters]], 22 September 2012.</ref>

The 2014 budget was 1.867 trillion CFA which is distributed as follows according to: public debt (76,703,692,000 CFA), personnel expenditures (210,979,633,960 CFA), operating expenditures (128,988,777,711 CFA); subsidies and transfers: 308,379,641,366 CFA) and Investment (1,142,513,658,712 CFA).<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://nigerexpress.info/2013/11/28/niger-le-budget-2014-porte-a-1-867-milliards/ Niger : le budget 2014 porté à 1.867 milliards]. ''Niger Express'', 28 November 2013.</ref>

==== Foreign aid ====
The importance of external support for Niger's development is demonstrated by the fact that about 45% of the government's FY 2002 budget, including 80% of its capital budget, derives from donor resources.<ref name=ussd2009>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm Background Notes for Niger: January 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524232128/https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm |date=24 May 2019 }} Bureau of African Affairs, United States State Department.

Other principal donors include the United States, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and [[Saudi Arabia]]. While [[USAID]] does not have an office in Niger, the United States is a major donor, contributing nearly $10 million each year to Niger's development. The U.S. also is a major partner in policy coordination in such areas as food security and HIV/AIDS.

=== Judicial system ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Niger}}
The current Judiciary of Niger was established with the creation of the Fourth Republic in 1999. The constitution of December 1992 was revised by national referendum on 12 May 1996 and, again, by referendum, revised to the current version on 18 July 1999. It is based on the [[Code Napoleon]] "''[[Inquisitorial system]]''", established in Niger during French colonial rule and the 1960 Constitution of Niger. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law, while the Supreme Court reviews application of the law and constitutional questions. The High Court of Justice (HCJ) deals with cases involving senior government officials. The justice system also includes civil criminal courts, customary courts, traditional mediation, and a military court.<ref name=Sory>[http://www.etat.sciencespobordeaux.fr/institutionnel/niger.html#Syst%E8me%20judiciaire Niger:Système judiciaire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081126022100/http://www.etat.sciencespobordeaux.fr/institutionnel/niger.html |date=26 November 2008 }}.

=== Law enforcement ===
{{Main|Law enforcement in Niger}}
Law enforcement in Niger is the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense through the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|National Gendarmerie]] and the Ministry of the Interior through the [[National Police (Niger)|National Police]] and the [[National Guard of Niger|National Guard]]. The [[National Police (Niger)|National Police]] is primarily responsible for law enforcement in urban areas. Outside big cities and in rural areas, this responsibility falls on the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|National Gendarmerie]] and the [[National Guard of Niger|National Guard]].

===Military===
{{Further|Niger Armed Forces}}
The Niger Armed Forces (Forces armées nigériennes) are the military and paramilitary forces of Niger, under the president as supreme commander. They consist of the Niger Army (Armée de Terre), the Niger Air Force (Armée de l'Air) and the auxiliary paramilitary forces, such as the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale)]] and the [[National Guard of Niger|National Guard (Garde Nationale)]]. Both paramilitary forces are trained in military fashion and have some military responsibilities in wartime. In peace time their duties are mostly policing duties.

The armed forces are composed of approximately 12,900 personnel, including 3,700 [[Gendarmerie Nationale (Niger)|gendarmes]], 3200 [[National Guard of Niger|national guards]], 300 air force personnel, and 6,000 army personnel. The armed forces of Niger have been involved several military coups over the years with the most recent in 2010. Niger's armed forces have a long history of military cooperation with France and the United States. {{As of|2013}}, Niamey is home to a U.S. drone base.

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Niger administrative divisions.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Administrative divisions of Niger]]
{{Main|Regions of Niger|Departments of Niger|Communes of Niger}}
Niger is divided into 7 [[Regions of Niger|Regions]] and one capital district. These Regions are subdivided into 36 [[Departments of Niger|departments]]. The 36 Departments are currently broken down into Communes of varying types. {{As of|2006}} there were 265 communes, including communes urbaines (Urban Communes: as subdivisions of major cities), communes rurales (Rural Communes), in sparsely populated areas and postes administratifs (Administrative Posts) for largely uninhabited desert areas or military zones.

Rural communes may contain official villages and settlements, while Urban Communes are divided into quarters. Niger subvisions were renamed in 2002, in the implementation of a decentralisation project, first begun in 1998. Previously, Niger was divided into 7 Departments, 36 Arrondissements, and Communes. These subdivisions were administered by officials appointed by the national government. These offices will be replaced in the future by democratically elected councils at each level.

The ''pre-2002'' departments (renamed as regions) and capital district are:
* [[Agadez Region]]
* [[Diffa Region]]
* [[Dosso Region]]
* [[Maradi Region]]
* [[Tahoua Region]]
* [[Tillabéri Region]]
* [[Zinder Region]]
* [[Niamey]] {{smaller|(capital district)}}

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Niger}}

[[File:Niamey night.jpg|thumb|[[Niamey]], Niger's capital and economic hub.]]
The economy of Niger centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 2.9% population growth rate, and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut the economy.

Niger shares a common currency, the [[CFA franc]], and a common central bank, the [[Central Bank of West African States]] (BCEAO), with seven other members of the [[West African Monetary Union]]. Niger is also a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).<ref name="ohada.com">{{cite web | title = OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa | url = http://www.ohada.com/index.php | accessdate = 22 March 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033744/http://www.ohada.com/index.php | archive-date = 26 March 2009 | url-status = live }}</ref>

In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund for [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction.

In December 2005, it was announced that Niger had received 100% multilateral [[debt relief]] from the [[IMF]], which translates into the forgiveness of approximately US$86&nbsp;million in debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Uranium prices have recovered somewhat in the last few years. A drought and locust infestation in 2005 led to food shortages for as many as 2.5&nbsp;million Nigeriens.

Niger has a wide variety of ethnic groups as in most West African countries. The ethnic makeup of Niger in 2001 is as follows: [[Hausa people|Hausa]] (55.4%), [[Zarma people|Zarma-Songhai]] (21%), [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (9.3%), [[Fula people|Fula]] ({{lang-fr|Peuls}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) (8.5%), [[Kanuri people|Kanuri Manga]] (4.7%), [[Tubu people|Tubu]] (0.4%), [[Diffa Arabs|Arab]] (0.4%), [[Gurma people|Gourmantche]] (0.4%), other (0.1%).<ref name="ins-demographics"/> The [[Zarma people|Zarma-Songhai]] dominate the Dosso, Tillabéri, and Niamey régions, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dominate the Zinder, Maradi, and Tahoua regions, [[Kanuri people|Kanuri Manga]] dominate the Diffa region, and [[Touaregs]] dominate the Agadez region in Northern Niger.<ref name="auto3"/>

=== Languages ===
{{Main| Languages of Niger}}
French, inherited from the colonial period, is the [[official language]]. It is spoken mainly as a second language by people who have received a formal western education and serves as the administrative language. Niger has been a member of the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.

Niger has ten recognized [[national language]]s, namely [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Buduma language|Buduma]], [[Fula language|Fulfulde]], [[Gurma language|Gourmanchéma]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], [[Songhay languages|Zarma & Songhai]], [[Tuareg languages|Tamasheq]], [[Tasawaq language|Tassawaq]], [[Tebu languages|Tebu]].<ref name="axl.cefan.ulaval.ca"/> Each is spoken as a first language primarily by the ethnic group with which it is associated.<ref>Ethologue.

Niger is a [[secular country]] and separation of state and religion is guaranteed by Articles 3 and 175 of the 2010 Constitution, which dictate that future amendments or revisions may not modify the secular nature of the republic of Niger. [[Religious freedom]] is protected by Article 30 of the same constitution. [[Islam]], widespread in the region since the 10th century, has greatly shaped the culture and mores of the people of Niger. Islam is the most dominant religion, practiced by 99.3% of the population according to the 2012 census.<ref name="census">{{cite web | url = http://www.stat-niger.org/statistique/file/RGPH2012/ETAT_STRUCTURE_POPULATION.pdf | title = Recensement général de la population et de l'habitat 2012 | last = Institut national de la statistique | date = November 2015 | access-date = 12 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180713042241/http://www.stat-niger.org/statistique/file/RGPH2012/ETAT_STRUCTURE_POPULATION.pdf | archive-date = 13 July 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>

The other two main religions of Niger are [[Christianity]], practiced by 0.3% of the population, and Animism ([[African traditional religion|traditional indigenous religious beliefs]]), practiced by 0.2% of the population.<ref name="census" /> Christianity was established earlier in the country by missionaries during the French colonial years. Other urban Christian expatriate communities from Europe and West Africa are also presented. Religious persecution is rare in Niger which is ranked last (#50) on the [[World Watch List]] for severity of persecution that Christians face for actively pursuing their faith.

The numbers of Animist practitioners are a point of contention. As recently as the late 19th century, much of the south center of the nation was unreached by Islam, and the conversion of some rural areas has been only partial. There are still areas where animist based festivals and traditions (such as the [[Bori (religion)|Bori religion]]) are practiced by [[syncretic]] Muslim communities (in some Hausa areas as well as among some [[Toubou]] and [[Wodaabe]] pastoralists), as opposed to several small communities who maintain their pre-Islamic religion. These include the Hausa-speaking [[Maouri people|Maouri]] (or ''Azna'', the Hausa word for "pagan") community in [[Dogondoutci]] in the south-southwest and the [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] speaking Manga near [[Zinder]], both of whom practice variations of the pre-Islamic Hausa [[Maguzawa]] religion. There are also some tiny Boudouma and Songhay animist communities in the southwest.<ref name=Decalo79/>

Both [[Zarma people|Zarma]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] areas were greatly influenced by the 18th- and 19th-century [[Fula jihads|Fula led]] [[Sufi]] brotherhoods, most notably the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] (in today's Nigeria). Modern Muslim practice in Niger is often tied to the [[Tijaniya]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Tariqah|brotherhoods]], although there are small minority groups tied to [[Hammallism]] and [[Nyassist]] Sufi orders in the west, and the [[Sanusiya]] in the far northeast.<ref name=Decalo79>Decalo, James.

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Niger}}

The child mortality rate in Niger (deaths among children between the ages of 1 and 4) is high (248 per 1,000) due to generally poor health conditions and inadequate nutrition for most of the country's children. According to the organization [[Save the Children]], Niger has the world's highest [[infant mortality rate]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Green |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/parenting/05/08/mothers.index/index.html |title=U.S. has second worst newborn death rate in modern world, report says |publisher=CNN |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209065002/http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/parenting/05/08/mothers.index/index.html |archive-date=9 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Niger also has the highest [[fertility rate]] in the world (6.49 births per woman according to 2017 estimates<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028133713/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |archive-date=28 October 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>); this means that nearly half (49%) of the Nigerien population is under age 15.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Niger}}
[[File:Zinder sultans horsemen festival.jpg|thumb|Horsemen at the traditional [[Ramadan]] festival at the [[Sultanate of Damagaram|Sultan's]] Palace in the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] city of [[Zinder]].]]
[[File:Ancient home zinder niger.jpg|thumb|A traditional home in [[Zinder]].]]

Nigerien culture is marked by variation, evidence of the cultural crossroads which [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]] formed into a unified state from the beginning of the 20th century. What is now Niger was created from four distinct cultural areas in the pre-colonial era: the [[Zarma people|Zarma]] dominated [[Niger River]] valley in the southwest; the northern periphery of [[Hausaland]], made mostly of those states which had resisted the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], and ranged along the long southern border with Nigeria; the [[Chad basin|Lake Chad basin]] and [[Kaouar]] in the far east, populated by [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] farmers and [[Toubou]] pastoralists who had once been part of the [[Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]]; and the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] nomads of the [[Aïr Mountains]] and Saharan desert in the vast north.

Each of these communities, along with smaller ethnic groups like the pastoral [[Wodaabe]] [[Fula people|Fula]], brought their own cultural traditions to the new state of Niger. While successive post-independence governments have tried to forge a shared national culture, this has been slow forming, in part because the major Nigerien communities have their own cultural histories, and in part because Nigerien ethnic groups such as the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], Tuareg and Kanuri are but part of larger ethnic communities which cross borders introduced under colonialism.

Until the 1990s, government and politics was inordinately dominated by [[Niamey]] and the [[Zarma people]] of the surrounding region. At the same time the plurality of the population, in the Hausa borderlands between [[Birni-N'Konni]] and [[Maine-Soroa]], have often looked culturally more to Hausaland in Nigeria than Niamey. Between 1996 and 2003, primary school attendance was around 30%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/Niger_statistics.html |title=At a glance: Niger |accessdate=22 June 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130170853/http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/Niger_statistics.html |archive-date=30 November 2009 }}</ref> including 36% of males and only 25% of females.

[[File:1997 274-5 Gerewol.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Participants in the [[Guérewol]] perform the ''Guérewol'' dance, 1997.]]
The Guérewol festival is a traditional Wodaabe cultural event that takes place in [[Abalak]] in [[Tahoua Region|Tahoua region]] or [[In-Gall|In'Gall]] in [[Agadez Region]]. It is an annual traditional courtship ritual practiced by the Wodaabe (Fula) people of Niger. During this ceremony, young men dressed in elaborate ornamentation and made up in traditional face painting gather in lines to dance and sing, vying for the attention of marriageable young women. The Guérewol festival is an international attraction and was featured in films and magazines as prominent as the [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].

==== Cure Salée festival ====
{{Main|Cure Salee}}

"La Cure salée" (English: Salt Cure) is a yearly festival of Tuareg and Wodaabe nomads in [[In-Gall|In'Gall]] in [[Agadez Region]] traditionally to celebrate the end of the rainy season. For three days, the festival features a parade of [[Tuareg]] camel riders followed with camel and horse races, songs, dances, and storytelling.

Prior to the Third Republic, Nigeriens only had access to tightly controlled state media.<ref name=sainforeport2002fr>[http://africa.ifj.org/pdfs/sainforeport2002fr.pdf SEMINAIRE-ATELIER DE FORMATION ET DE SENSIBILISATION "Mission de service public dans les entreprises de presse d’Etat et privée"] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170119090642/http://www.ifj.org/regions/africa |date=19 January 2017 }}.

In addition to the national and regional radio services of the state broadcaster [[Office of Radio and Television of Niger|ORTN]], there are four privately owned radio networks which total more than 100 stations. Three of them—the [[Anfani FM|Anfani Group]], Sarounia and Tenere—are urban-based commercial-format [[FM broadcasting|FM]] networks in the major towns.<ref name=ussd9506>U.S. Department of State.

The independent-sector radio networks are collectively estimated by CPRP officials to cover some 7.6&nbsp;million people, or about 73% of the population (2005).

Aside from Nigerien radio stations, the [[BBC]]'s Hausa service is listened to on FM repeaters across wide parts of the country, particularly in the south, close to the border with Nigeria. [[Radio France Internationale]] also rebroadcasts in French through some of the commercial stations, via satellite. Tenere FM also runs a national independent television station of the same name.<ref name=ussd9506 />

Despite relative freedom at the national level, Nigerien [[Journalism|journalists]] say they are often pressured by local authorities.<ref name="issa04">[http://www.panos-ao.org/ipao/spip.php?article39 Niger : Conseil de presse. Les journalistes refusent la mise sous tutelle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510075744/http://www.panos-ao.org/ipao/spip.php?article39|date=10 May 2011}}. Ousseini Issa. Médi@ctions n°37, Institut PANOS Afrique de l'Ouest. March 2004.</ref> The state ORTN network depends financially on the government, partly through a surcharge on electricity bills, and partly through direct subsidy. The sector is governed by the [[High Council for Communication (Niger)|Conseil Supérieur de Communications]], established as an independent body in the early 1990s, since 2007 headed by [[Daouda Diallo]]. International human rights groups have criticised the government since at least 1996 as using regulation and police to punish criticism of the state.<ref name=cpj2006>[http://cpj.org/2007/02/attacks-on-the-press-2006-niger.php Attacks on the press: Niger 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920053522/http://www.cpj.org/2007/02/attacks-on-the-press-2006-niger.php |date=20 September 2011 }}.
