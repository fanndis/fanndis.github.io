==History==
===Colonial history===
Sagana Lodge was built in 1949â€“1950 as a royal residence. It was a wedding present in 1947 to the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh (later [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]] and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] respectively) from the colony whilst they were in Kenya. The lodge was leased to the couple by the government of Kenya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/princess-elizabeth-and-prince-philip-on-a-bridge-in-the-news-photo/693928953|title=Royal Couple At Sagana Lodge|website=Gettyimages.ca}}</ref><ref name="Bolton1962">{{cite book|author=Kenneth Bolton|title=The Lion and the Lily: - a Guide to Kenya|url=https://archive.org/details/lionlilyguidetok0000bolt|url-access=registration|year=1962|publisher=Bles}}</ref>

In 1952 the Duchess of Edinburgh was staying at Sagana Lodge on their return from [[Treetops Hotel]]. The beginning of the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau Rebellion]] had made Kenya less secure and [[Ian Henderson (police officer)|Ian Henderson]], of [[Kenya Police|Kenya Police Force]] Special Branch, was appointed head of the security detail at Sagana Lodge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10011292/Ian-Henderson.html |title=Honour for Mau Mau leader who ate victims |publisher=Daily Telegraph |date=2013-04-22 |website=telegraph.co.uk |access-date=2019-07-06}}</ref> While staying at Sagana Lodge, she received the news that her father [[George VI|King George VI]] had died and she had [[Order of succession|succeeded]] to the throne as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2002/DiaryofeventsintheearlylifeofHMTheQueen.aspx | title = Diary of events in the early life of The Queen|website=Royal.gov.uk}}</ref> This was a unique circumstance for such an event. She was the first [[British monarch]] since the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] to be outside Great Britain at the moment of succession, and also the first in modern times not to know the exact time of her accession (because her father had died in his sleep at an unknown time).
