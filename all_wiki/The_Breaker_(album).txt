It was released on February 24, 2017, through [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]]. Reviews for the album were positive. ''The Breaker'' debuted atop the [[Top Country Albums]] chart and number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album also charted in countries like New Zealand, Canada and Australia.

''The Breaker'' received widespread critical acclaim.[https://www.epicor.com/en-us/customers/insights-docstar/get-ready/entertainment/] At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 78 based on 4 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."<ref name="MC">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-breaker/little-big-town|title=Reviews for The Breaker by Little Big Town|website=Metacritic|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>

[[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] rated the album four out of five stars and states, "Little Big Town cherish the gentler moments, and this ease with sensitivity turns ''The Breaker'' into something of a quiet triumph: it's intended as a balm, and it succeeds."<ref name="allmusic" /> Chuck Arnold of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the record an "A−" grade saying, "Although the rest of ''The Breaker'' may not be blessed with the T-Swizzle magic, there are some more strong contenders for your next breakup playlist."<ref name="EWreview" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Jonathan Bernstein praised the album for putting the spotlight back on the group's "unmatched ability to transform subtle Nashville lyricism into major pop drama", concluding that, "[A]t the top of their game, Little Big Town are taking an unlikely path: respectable, mid-career album artist."<ref name="rsreview" />
