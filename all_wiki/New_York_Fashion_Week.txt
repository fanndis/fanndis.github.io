'''New York Fashion Week''', held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events (generally lasting 7–9 days) when international [[Fashion design|fashion collections]] are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. It is one of four major [[fashion week]]s in the world, collectively known as the "Big 4", along with those in [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]], [[London Fashion Week|London]], and [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bradford |first1=Julie |title=Fashion Journalism |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2xeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Susan |last=Dillon |title=The Fundamentals of Fashion Management |publisher=A&C Black |year=2011 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFMAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA115}}</ref> The [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized “New York Fashion Week” in 1993, although cities like London were already using their city’s name in conjunction with the words ''fashion week'' in the 1980s. NYFW is based on a much older series of events called "Press Week", founded in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/history-of-new-york-fashion-week |title=History of New York Fashion Week – New York Fashion Week |publisher= |access-date=April 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505222105/http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/history-of-new-york-fashion-week |archive-date=May 5, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Origin ==
The first New York Fashion Week was created in 1943 by [[Eleanor Lambert]], press director of the American fashion industry’s first promotional organization, the New York Dress Institute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfda.com/about/history |title=History |work=cfda.com}}</ref>

The event, the world's first organized [[fashion week]], was called "Press Week", and was created to attract attention away from French fashion during [[World War II]], when fashion industry insiders were unable to travel to Paris to see French fashion shows.<ref name="slate">{{cite web |last=Fortini |first=Amanda |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2135561 |title=A brief history of the fashion show |work=Slate.com |date=2006-02-08 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> It was also meant to showcase American designers for [[fashion journalism|fashion journalists]], who had neglected U.S. fashion innovations.

Press Week was a success, and fashion magazines like ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', which were normally filled with French designs, increasingly featured American fashion.<ref name="slate" />

By the mid-1950s, the event was known as "Press Week of New York". Spring 1951 (held February 1951) was the 16th Annual Press Week of New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inv.stparchive.com/Archive/INV/INV02011951P10.php |title=Indian Valley Record  February 1, 1951 Page   10 |publisher=}}</ref>

On December 12, 2014, a New York state court approved a settlement in a lawsuit by community activists over whether allowing the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week tents in [[Damrosch Park]] was a violation of the [[public trust doctrine]]. In accordance with the settlement, the City of New York, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] agreed not to renew their contract with IMG.

In December 2015, the CFDA announced that it had hired the Boston Consulting Group to study revising the format of New York Fashion Week to adapt to changes brought about by social media.

Fall/winter 2016 events took place February 11–18, 2016<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyorkfashionweeklive.com/schedule |title=NYFW Schedule – New York Fashion Week |publisher=}}</ref>  at a variety of locations around New York City, including Skylight Moynihan, Skylight Clarkson, Chelsea Piers, MADE Studios, and showrooms around town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwd.com/runway/fall-ready-to-wear-2016/new-york/ |title=2016 Fall Ready-to-Wear – WWD |publisher=}}</ref>

The season ended with a number of designers either experimenting with, or planning to adopt, a "see now, buy now model," with items available from the runway immediately after (or even during) the show, rather than six months later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week-fall-2016/news/a14169/fashion-week-changes/ |title=Is This The Last Traditional New York Fashion Week? |date=February 14, 2016 |publisher=}}</ref> The charge was led by brands such as [[Burberry]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/fashion/burberry-announces-a-see-now-buy-now-system-for-new-collections.html |title=Burberry Announces a See Now/Buy Now System for New Collections |date=February 6, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> although experiments in the format can be traced back to earlier shows by designers such as [[Diane von Furstenberg]].

Spring/summer 2017 events will be held September 8–15, 2016. (Fashion weeks are traditionally named for the season the clothes will appear at retail, six months after the events, although the trend may be changing due to fundamental shifts in the retail cycle.)<ref name="auto" />

The advent of "see now, buy now" shopping is expected to further transform fashion week, as collections become "in season" and select items are offered from the runway in real time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week-fall-2016/news/a14169/fashion-week-changes/ |title=Is This The Last Traditional New York Fashion Week? |date=2016-02-14 |website=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>

==Attendance==
Admission to shows at New York Fashion Week is typically in the form of [[accreditation]], with specific events by invitation only.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=Fashion Week: Not Open to the Public |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/fashion-week-not-open-to-the-public |work=The New York Times |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref>

==No "official" New York Fashion Week==
In spite of CFDA's claim to run the "official" New York Fashion Week calendar,<ref>https://cfda.com/fashion-calendar/official-schedules</ref> and as further purported by publications such as ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'',<ref>http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/the-tentative-official-nyfw-calendar-is-here-10953303/</ref> it has been pointed out in publications such as ''The Fashion Law'' that CFDA has "little, in any, legal rights in the NYFW name".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160405222304/http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-has-little-if-any-rights-in-the-nyfw-name</ref> Therefore, trademark rights remain unclear, at best.

==Trademark litigation==
In 2013 Fashion Week Inc., founded by business executive Trisha Paravas, registered the [[trademark]]s “New York Fashion Week,” “NYFW”, and “NYFW The Runway Shows” to use in conjunction with the production of its consumer-based fashion shows after realizing the current slate of New York Fashion Shows were invitation-only and designed for industry professionals and media.

Trisha Paravas launched bi-yearly shows in December 2013 and initially called them "New York Fashion Shows." After her first few shows drew increasing interest, she decided to rebrand it. At the time, Paravas claimed there was no trademark filed for "New York Fashion Week," and filed for “New York Fashion Week” trademark, along with the abbreviation "NYFW."<ref>{{cite web|url=

The Council of Fashion Designers of America, Inc. (CFDA) lacked registrations for the “New York Fashion Week” trademarks, and tried to cancel Fashion Week Inc's registrations. Nonetheless, the CFDA was unsuccessful in its effort to have Fashion Week, Inc.’s “New York Fashion Week” trademark cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |title=The CFDA Has Little – If Any – Legal Rights in the NYFW Name |url=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-has-little-if-any-rights-in-the-nyfw-name |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405222304/http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-has-little-if-any-rights-in-the-nyfw-name |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 5, 2016 |website=The Fashion Law |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=

On June 28, 2016 Fashion Week Inc. and its CEO Trisha Paravas filed a lawsuit for $10 million against [[Council of Fashion Designers of America|CFDA]] and [[WME-IMG]] for trademark counterfeiting, [[trademark infringement]], [[false designation of origin]], dilution, and [[unfair competition]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cullins |first1=A |title=WME-IMG and CFDA Facing $10M Lawsuit for "Usurping" New York Fashion Week Trademark. |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/wme-img-cfda-facing-10m-908838 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hoshikawa |first1=K |title=The CFDA is being sued over 'NYFW' trademark |url=http://fashionista.com/2016/07/cfda-nyfw-trademark-lawsuit |website=Fashionista |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Drain |first1=K |title=New York Fashion Week Logo Lawsuit: CFDA, WME-IMG Sued |url=http://www.fashiontimes.com/articles/26917/20160706/new-york-fashion-week-logo-lawsuit-cfda-wme-img-sued.htm |website=Fashion Times |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=UPDATED: CFDA, WME-IMG Sued for Using New York Fashion Week Trademark |url=http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/the-cfda-wme-img-sued-over-new-york-fashion-week-trademark |website=The Fashion Law |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>

On August 12, 2016, the court denied Paravas and Fashion Week Inc.'s motion for a [[preliminary injunction]].<ref name=hballp>{{Cite web |url=http://hballp.com/wp-content/uploads/PI-decision.pdf |title=Memorandum Opinion and Order |last= |first= |date=August 12, 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> Judge Koeltl held that although Fashion Week, Inc. does have rights in the New York Fashion Week trademark, those rights are “limited” to “online entertainment ticket agency sales.” On the other hand, the court held that the CFDA and WME IMG enjoy rights in the mark for the “broad ambit of organizing and producing fashion shows.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion+Week+Inc.+Presents+a+Zang+Toi+Collection+at+Fashion+Week+New...-a0381908079 |title=Fashion Week Inc.
