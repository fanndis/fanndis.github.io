"'''No, No, No'''" is a song by American girl group [[Destiny's Child]]. It was written by Calvin Gaines, [[Abstrac|Mary Brown]], [[Rob Fusari]] and [[Vincent Herbert]] and recorded for their first studio album, ''[[Destiny's Child (album)|Destiny's Child]]'' (1998), with production helmed by Fuasri und Herbert. A sensual mid-tempo ballad that blends [[contemporary R&B]] with lush [[soul music|1970s soul]], it was renamed "No, No, No (Part 1)" after musician [[Wyclef Jean]] was consulted to produce and appear on a remix of the song. Built around a hard-sliding bassline and sung in a [[staccato]], rhythmic style, featuring co-production from Che Greene and [[Jerry Duplessis]], it was titled  "No, No, No (Part 2)".

"No, No, No" was released as Destiny's Child debut single on November 11, 1997 by [[Columbia Records]], with both versions serviced to radio stations and music video networks. In the [[United States]], the song reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became the ninth best-selling single of the year, selling more than 1.3 million copies. It was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Elsewhere, "No, No, No" reached the top forty on the charts in appeared on and became a top ten hit in the [[Flemish]] region of Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

[[Darren Grant]] directed accompanying music videos for each version of "No, No, No" in October 1997. "Part 1" features the group performing at a [[nightclub]] stage, while "Part 2" begins with a choreographed dance in a large gold room. Destiny's Child performed "No, No, No" on several television and award show ceremonies, such as ''[[Teen Summit]]'', ''[[The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show]]'', and the [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award]]s. It has been performed at almost every one of the band's concert tours, and is featured on their remix album ''[[This Is the Remix (Destiny's Child album)|This Is the Remix]]'' (2002) and on their compilation albums, ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'' (2005) and ''[[Playlist: The Very Best of Destiny's Child]]'' (2012). 

==Background and recording==
"No, No, No" was written by Calvin Gaines, former [[Abstrac]] member Mary Brown, [[Rob Fusari]] and [[Vincent Herbert]].<ref name="liner notes">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Destiny's Child (album)|Destiny's Child]]|others=[[Destiny's Child]] |date=1998|type=liner notes |publisher=[[Columbia Records]]}}</ref> The original track was based on an idea and produced by Fusari.<ref name="songwriteruniverse">{{cite web|first= Dale |last=Kawashima|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/fusari.htm|title=Rob Fusari Co-Writes & Produces Top Hits For Destiny's Child, Will Smith And Other Artists|website=songwriteruniverse.com|accessdate=January 4, 2020}}</ref> Heavily influenced by R&B, he was inspired to start writing "No, No, No" on one of his [[synthesizer]] after listening to "[[Stroke You Up]]" (1994), written by singer [[R.

==Music videos==
As with the single, two videos were made to promote both versions of the song, directed by [[Darren Grant]] and shot in October 1997. In the video for "Part 2", [[Wyclef Jean]] plays his [[guitar]] as Destiny's Child sings the chorus. Beyoncé stops Wyclef, saying, "That ain't right."  Wyclef says to the group, "Nah, nah, it's phat; all we need to do is drop a phat beat for the clubs. I'm tellin' you, they gon' lose their minds; I can see it right now." The group begins a choreographed dance in a large gold room. Wyclef Jean also makes an appearance in a room next to the room where the group is. In the video for "Part 1", the group performs a choreographed dance at a [[nightclub]]. [[Marques Houston]], along with his [[IMx|Immature]] bandmates Romeo and LDB, make cameo appearances in the video.

Both versions are included in the video compilation ''[[The Platinum's on the Wall]]''. Part 2 is in the DualDisc edition of the album ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'', Part 1 as an enhanced video is in the Australian edition of ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]''.

==Commercial and chart success==
The single entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number five, and spent eight weeks in the Top 75. In Europe, the single experienced modest success, entering the top 40 and top 20 of several national charts. The single performed better in Norway and the Netherlands, where it hit the top ten, while it had the least success in France, where it barely made an appearance in the top 100.

In the United States, the single had greater commercial popularity. The success of the song on radio stations and its healthy sales propelled it into the top ten of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Eventually, the song peaked within the top three of that chart, becoming their first single to do so.

The commercial success of the song failed to translate into high album sales for the group. Destiny Child's first album struggled to chart strongly on any chart and was barely certified in the United States, mainly thanks to the subsequent momentum of their second studio album.

By the end of its chart run, "No, No, No" had sold over 146,000 copies in the UK and over a million copies worldwide.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The song won two Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Single by a Group, Band or Duo and Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist.
