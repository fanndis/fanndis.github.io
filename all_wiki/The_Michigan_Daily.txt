'''''The Michigan Daily''''' is the daily [[student newspaper]] of the [[University of Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.michiganpress.org/list |title=Michigan Press Association list of members |publisher=Michigan Press Association |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405165934/http://members.michiganpress.org/list |archivedate=April 5, 2017 }}</ref> Its first edition was published on September 29, 1890. The newspaper is financially and editorially independent of the University's administration and other student groups, but shares a university building with other student publications on 420 Maynard Street, north of the [[Michigan Union]] and Huetwell Student Activities Center. In 2007, renovations to the historic building at 420 Maynard were completed, funded entirely by private donations from alumni. To dedicate the renovated building, a reunion of the staffs of ''The Michigan Daily'', the ''Michiganensian'' yearbook, and the ''Gargoyle'' humor magazine was held on October 26–28, 2007.

''The Michigan Daily'' is published in broadsheet form five days a week, Monday through Friday, during the Fall and Winter semesters. It is published weekly in tabloid form from May to August. Mondays contain a lengthy ''SportsMonday'' Sports section. Every other Thursday, the Arts section publishes an extended, themed issue called ''The B-Side''. Wednesdays include a magazine, originally titled ''Weekend Magazine.'' In the fall of 2005, the magazine was renamed ''The Statement,'' a reference to former Daily Editor in Chief [[Tom Hayden]]'s ''[[Port Huron Statement]].'' School year circulation is 7,500 copies per day. It has over 230,000 unique visitors per month to its website.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==History==
[[File:The Michigan Daily (first issue).png|thumb|left|First issue of ''The Daily'' in 1890]]
In 1952, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegate to the [[United Nations]], [[Novikov|F. A. Novikov]], singled out the newspaper as emblematic of [[United States|American]] warmongering. On April 12, 1955, when the success of [[Jonas Salk]]'s polio vaccine was announced at the University of Michigan the ''Daily'' was the first newspaper to report it. In 1957, the ''Daily'' sent a staff member to Little Rock, Arkansas who, pretending to be a student, attended classes on the first day of integration.

Activist and politician [[Tom Hayden]], a former ''Daily'' editor in chief who helped found [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] while editing the ''Daily'', came to personify the publication's editorial philosophy during the 1960s. The paper was the subject of national press coverage when, in 1967, it urged the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and again during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, when it called for the reinstatement of the military draft.

The ''Daily'' was instrumental in the spread of the [[Paul is dead]] [[urban legend]]. An October 14, 1969 ''Daily'' article by [[Fred LaBour]] and John Gray, entitled "McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light", itemized various "clues", many of them of their own invention. Their "reporting" of McCartney's death is claimed by Beatleologist Andru J. Reeve to have been "the single most significant factor in the breadth of the rumor's spread."<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9359339/the_rs_interview_paul_mccartney McCartney interview - barefoot: Jan 31, 1974] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001221000/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9359339/the_rs_interview_paul_mccartney |date=2009-10-01 }} rollingstone.com - Retrieved: 5 August 2007</ref><ref name=Glenn>[http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2009/11/story.php?id=7565&tr=y&auid=5578331 Glenn, Allen, "Paul is dead (said Fred)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228202339/http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2009/11/story.php?id=7565&tr=y&auid=5578331 |date=2010-12-28 }}, ''Michigan Today'' (November 11, 2009)</ref>

The first female editor-in-chief of the ''Daily'' was [[Harriett Woods]], who later served in Missouri State government, ran for the Senate twice in the 1980s nearly beating John Danforth the first time, and led the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] through its Year of the Woman in 1992.

On January 28, 2014, the ''Daily'' earned national recognition for breaking news that a Michigan football player had been separated from the University for sexual misconduct.
