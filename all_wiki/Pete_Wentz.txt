==Music career==

===Arma Angelus (1998–2002)===
Wentz was primarily involved in the Chicago [[hardcore punk]] scene and was in several bands in the late 1990s. He formed his first band, First Born, in 1993.<ref name="Snapshot"/> By the mid-1990s, he became an infrequent bass player for [[Racetraitor]].<ref name="Our Lawyer" />

Wentz formed the metalcore band Novena (later renamed to [[Arma Angelus]]) soon after, along with Adam Bishop of XshroudX and Extinction; Daniel Binaei of Racetraitor; and Timothy Miller. The band cycled through six bassists before recruiting [[Tim McIlrath]], who had recently departed from [[Baxter (punk band)|Baxter]]. They released their debut EP ''the Grave End of the Shovel'' in 2000. Around this time, Binaei's partial relocation of [[California]] led to hiring of Jay Jancetic of Extinction. McIlrath then departed from the band in 2000, in order to focus on [[Rise Against|Transistor Revolt]] and [[The Killing Tree]], leading to the band's recruitment of, XshroudX and Restraint member, Christopher Gutierrez. In 2001, the released their debut album ''Where Sleeplessness Is Rest From Nightmares''. In support of the album they toured with [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]] and [[Hatebreed]], and performed at [[Hellfest (American music festival)|Hellfest]]. These tours also saw the recruitment of bassist [[Joe Trohman]], after Gutierrez's departure, however Trohman's severe stage fright led to the band bringing him back mid-tour, and residing Trohman to selling merchandise.<ref name="Our Lawyer">{{cite book |last1=Welch |first1=Ben |title=Fall Out Boy - Our Lawyer Made Us Change The Name of This Book So We Wouldn't Get Sued}}</ref>

Around this time, Wentz also played in Birthright, Extinction and Yellow Road Priest. He and Arma Angelus' bassist [[Joe Trohman]] founded the [[pop-punk]] band [[Fall Out Boy]] after Trohman introduced Pete to a musical acquaintance, [[Patrick Stump]]. [[Andy Hurley]] agreed to drum part-time, but only joined the band full-time later. In 2002, Arma Angelus, the band in which Wentz was the vocalist, played its last show.<ref name=RAW>Norris, John (June 5, 2006).

===Fall Out Boy (2001–2009, 2013–present)===
{{main|Fall Out Boy}}
In 2002, Fall Out Boy released an EP called ''[[Fall Out Boy/Project Rocket Split EP]]''. Soon after, in 2003, the band released their mini-LP ''[[Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend]]'' on Uprising Records.<ref name=AOL>Loftus, Johnny. [http://music.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=bio&artistid=533936&albumid=0 "Biography: Fall Out Boy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20121202015615/http://music.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=bio&artistid=533936&albumid=0 |date=December 2, 2012 }}. ''All Music Guide''. Accessed April 14, 2006.</ref> This album would later be digitally remastered and reissued after the band's third, successful full-album release ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', on the major label [[Island Records]]. In 2003, the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Take This to Your Grave]]'' through [[Fueled By Ramen]]. Fall Out Boy signed with major label [[Island Records]] in 2003 and in 2004 released an [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] [[Extended play|EP]] and DVD entitled, ''[[My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue]]''.

Their third album, ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', was released in 2005.
Wentz wrote the lyrics to the lead single, "[[Sugar, We're Goin Down]]" with his dad in Chicago; the song peaked at #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/2006-04-15/hot-100 ''Billboard Hot 100 Charts''.] Billboard.com. March 15, 2006.</ref> and spent months in the top 50 of the Hot 100, marking five weeks in the top 10 and fourteen weeks in the top 20. The band's major label debut album has since been certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] as well as "Sugar, We're Goin Down."

In 2007, Fall Out Boy's fourth album, ''[[Infinity on High]]'' was released to major success, debuting at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 with 260,000 sales, spurred by the lead single, "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]", which reached the top ten in the US & UK and topped the charts in New Zealand.

The band's fifth studio album, ''[[Folie à Deux (album)|Folie à Deux]]'' was released on December 13, 2008, and debuted at #8 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The band toured extensively in support of their albums.

In November 2009, the four band members announced they will be taking an indefinite hiatus, saying they were unsure of the future of the band. Wentz has said that his personal reason for taking a break is that he feels that his name and marriage to pop singer [[Ashlee Simpson]] had become a hindrance for the band. He added: "I think the world needs a little less Pete Wentz".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/fall_out_boy_to_take_an_indefinite_break.html |title=Ultimate-guitar.com |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref>

On February 4, 2013, Fall Out Boy unexpectedly announced their return, along with an album and single with which all four members contributed.

{{main|Black Cards}}
[[File:Black Cards 2011.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Wentz with [[Bebe Rexha]] in 2011.]]
In July 2010, Wentz, with singer [[Bebe Rexha]], guitarist Nate Patterson, and drummer Spencer Peterson, formed the ska/electropop band [[Black Cards]]. Originally, the band had planned to release a full-length LP in the summer of 2011. However, after several delays, the departures of both Patterson and Rexha, and general uncertainty about the band's future, the group reshuffled, scrapping the original album and announcing plans to release a mixtape, write new material, and continue to remix tracks by other artists.

With regards to the band's sound, Wentz has said that during the time he took off to spend with his family, he began to be inspired by [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] [[reggae]] songs such as [[Culture (band)|Culture]]'s "[[Two Sevens Clash]]" and [[The Gladiators (band)|The Gladiators]]' "Warriors".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/38988 |title=Pete Wentz (formally) unveils Black Cards |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref><ref name="Black Cards">{{cite web|url=http://blackcardsmusic.com/ |title=Black Cards |publisher=Blackcardsmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> Wentz then contacted producer [[Sam Hollander]] ([[Gym Class Heroes]], [[Cobra Starship]], [[Hey Monday]]) and discussed the idea with him to mash up [[ska]], dance and [[reggae]] with 80s [[British rock]] and pop to create a new [[experimental music|experimental]] sound.

On January 12, 2012, the band announced via Facebook that vocalist Bebe Rexha was no longer a member of the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzznet.com/2012/01/bebe-rexha-pete-wentz-comment/|title=Bebe Rexha And Pete Wentz Comment On The Black Cards Situation|date=2012-01-13|website=buzznet|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref>

===Writing===
Wentz has written a book entitled ''[[The Boy with the Thorn in His Side (book)|The Boy With the Thorn in His Side]],'' a story based on nightmares he had as a child.<ref name=thorn>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0960357440/ Product page]. ''[[Amazon.com]]''. Accessed April 12, 2001987.</ref> The title is a reference to [[The Boy with the Thorn in His Side (song)|a track]] on The Smiths' album ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]''. Wentz explained that writing books serves as another mode of self-expression other than songwriting: "My inspiration and my ideas don't begin and end at the beginning and the ending of a song. It is too limiting."<ref name="Hardcore"/> It was reported that he was to publish another book, entitled ''Rainy Day Kids'', but years went by without any word on the book's progress, and Wentz even expressed on his Twitter account that he didn't think it would ever come to fruition.<ref>''The Music Edge''. Accessed April 12, 2009.</ref> However, in February 2012, he posted a photo on his personal blog of what appeared to be a rough draft of the book's manuscript, explaining that he was currently in the process of editing ''Rainy Day Kids'' and that it would be 40–50 pages longer than he originally expected. On December 13, 2012, Wentz revealed the cover for the book, now titled ''Gray'', on his personal blog. The book, which was written with [[MTV News]] writer and former [[FNMTV]] co-host [[James Montgomery (MTV)|James Montgomery]], was released on February 26, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://petewentz.com/post/17669320565/status-of-rainy-day-kids-deep-in-editing |title=Pete Wentz |publisher=Pete Wentz |accessdate=2013-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200557/http://petewentz.com/post/17669320565/status-of-rainy-day-kids-deep-in-editing |archivedate=January 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Film and television work===
Wentz also has a film production company called [[Bartskull Films]], which put out the DVD ''Release the Bats'', starring Wentz, his bandmates, and several of his personal friends. Wentz has told several sources that he has all the footage to release a sequel, but editing and time constraints have kept him from doing so, and therefore the fate of the project is still up in the air.

Wentz was in a multi-episode arc of the show ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', appearing at Tric (the local all-ages club in Tree Hill) with the entire band. The band first appeared in an episode "An Attempt to Tip the Scales", where they played their single "Dance, Dance" and went on to appear on Peyton and Ellie's (also One Tree Hill's album) tribute album, "Friends with Benefit" to support cancer awareness. Pete made his first solo cameo in the episode "When It Isn't Like It Should Be" as the romantic interest of Peyton Sawyer, a senior at Tree Hill who had booked the band to play at Tric.

He also made a brief cameo appearance in the show ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''. On February 6, 2008, it was reported that Wentz was the leading candidate for writer [[Diablo Cody]]'s follow-up film to ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', ''[[Jennifer's Body]]''. The role ended up going to [[Adam Brody]]. On February 24, 2008, Wentz appeared in comedian [[Jimmy Kimmel]]'s video "I'm Fucking [[Ben Affleck]]" as a chorus member (along with many other celebrities). The video was in response to one made by Kimmel's then-girlfriend, [[Sarah Silverman]], "I'm Fucking [[Matt Damon]]".

In 2009, he made a cameo appearance as himself in ''[[Degrassi Goes Hollywood]]''. In 2016, he made a guest appearance on the [[Nickelodeon]] series, ''[[School of Rock (TV series)|School of Rock]]''.

In 2012, he appeared as himself on ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title="The Eric Andre Show" J-Moe (TV Episode 2012) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2260560/fullcredits|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>

In 2017, Wentz guest starred, with his bandmates, in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' playing himself in the first, third and fourth parts of "The Night Begins to Shine". Their cover of [[The Night Begins to Shine|the title song]] from the special was commercially released.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Nick|title=Watch Fall Out Boy appear on superhero show 'Teen Titans'|url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/watch-fall-boy-appear-superhero-show-teen-titans-2098395|accessdate=March 2, 2019|work=NME|date=July 4, 2017}}</ref>

Wentz hosts the TV show ''Best Ink''. Wentz directed a music video for the song "[[If It's Love (Train song)|If It's Love]]" by American rock band [[Train (band)|Train]]. He was a contestant in an episode of the Nickelodeon game show ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Double Dare]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2019/02/28/tiffany-haddish-and-pete-wentz-heading-to-double-dare/|title=Tiffany Haddish and Pete Wentz heading to 'Double Dare'|work=Page Six|first=Jaclyn|last=Hendricks|date=February 28, 2019|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref>
