''Cosmopolitan'' originally began as a family magazine, first published based in [[New York City]] in March 1886 by Schlicht & Field of New York as ''The Cosmopolitan''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tassin |first=Algernon |date=December 1915 |title=The Magazine In America, Part X: The End Of The Century |journal=The Bookman: An Illustrated Magazine of Literature and Life |volume=XLII |issue=4 |pages=396–412 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d04DAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA396 |access-date=August 3, 2008 |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Co. }}</ref> Authors and their writings in the first issue included:

Paul Schlicht told his first-issue readers inside of the front cover that his publication was a "first-class family magazine", then adding, "There will be a department devoted exclusively to the concerns of women, with articles on fashions, on household decoration, on cooking, and the care and management of children, etc. There was also a department for the younger members of the family."<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Cosmopolitan |date=March 1886|volume=1| number=1}}</ref>

''Cosmopolitan'''s circulation reached 25,000 that year, but by November 1888, Schlicht & Field were no longer in business. [[John Brisben Walker]] acquired the magazine in 1889.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/February-2007/Westchester-Chronicles/|title=Westchester Chronicles|website=www.westchestermagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> That same year, he dispatched [[Elizabeth Bisland]] on a race around the world against [[Nellie Bly]] to draw attention to the magazine.<ref name="marksbook">{{cite book|author=Marks, Jason|title=Around the World in 72 Days: The race between Pulitzer's Nellie Bly and Cosmopolitan's Elizabeth Bisland|publisher=Gemittarius Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-9633696-2-8|url=https://archive.org/details/aroundworldin72d0000mark}}</ref>

Under John Brisben Walker's ownership, E. D. Walker, formerly with ''Harper's Monthly'', took over as the new editor, introducing colour illustrations, serials and book reviews. It became a leading market for fiction, featuring such authors as [[Annie Besant]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Jack London]], [[Edith Wharton]], and [[H.G.

In 1897, ''Cosmopolitan'' announced plans for a free correspondence school: "No charge of any kind will be made to the student. All expenses for the present will be borne by the ''Cosmopolitan''. No conditions, except a pledge of a given number of hours of study." When 20,000 immediately signed up, Walker could not fund the school and students were then asked to contribute 20 dollars a year. Also in 1897, [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' was serialized, as was his ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' (1900). [[Olive Schreiner]] contributed a lengthy two-part article about the [[Boer War]] in the September<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Schreiner,Olive|title=The African Boer |magazine=The Cosmopolitan|date=September 1900|volume=29| number=5| pages=451–468}}</ref> and October<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Schreiner,Olive|title=The African Boer, II |magazine=The Cosmopolitan|date=October 1900|volume=29| number=6| pages=593–602}}</ref> issues of 1900.

In 1905, [[William Randolph Hearst]] purchased the magazine for [[US$]]400,000 ({{Inflation|US|400,000|1905|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) and brought in journalist [[Charles Edward Russell]], who contributed a series of investigative articles, including "The Growth of Caste in America" (March 1907),<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Russell |first=Charles |author-link=Charles_Edward_Russell |date=March 1907 |title=The Growth of Caste in America |magazine=Cosmopolitan |location=New York, NY |publisher=International Magazine Company |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=524–534 }}</ref> "At the Throat of the Republic" (December 1907 – March 1908)<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Russell |first=Charles |author-link=Charles_Edward_Russell |date=December 1907 |title=At the Throat of the Republic: No. 1, Before the Election |magazine=Cosmopolitan |location=New York, NY |publisher=International Magazine Company |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=146–156 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Russell |first=Charles |author-link=Charles_Edward_Russell |date=January 1908 |title= At the Throat of the Republic: No. 2, At the Election |magazine=Cosmopolitan |location=New York, NY |publisher=International Magazine Company |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=259–271 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Russell |first=Charles |author-link=Charles_Edward_Russell |date=March 1908 |title= At the Throat of the Republic 3.

Hearst formed [[Cosmopolitan Productions]] (also known as Cosmopolitan Pictures), a film company based in New York City from 1918 to 1923, then Hollywood until 1938. The vision for this film company was to make films from stories published in the magazine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Cunningham |first1= Guy Patrick |editor-last= Ciment |editor-first= James |date= 2013 |title= Hearst, William Randolph (1863–1951)|journal= Encyclopedia of the Jazz Age: From the End of World War I to the Great Crash |pages= 344–345 }}</ref>

{{anchor|Names}}''Cosmopolitan'' magazine was officially titled as ''Hearst's International Combined with Cosmopolitan'' from 1925 until 1952, but was simply referred to as ''Cosmopolitan''. In 1911, Hearst had bought a middling monthly magazine called ''World To-Day'' and renamed it ''Hearst's Magazine'' in April 1912. In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled ''Hearst's International'' in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points. After Hearst died in 1951, the ''Hearst's International'' disappeared from the magazine cover altogether in April 1952.<ref>{{cite book |last= Landers|first= James |year= 2010|title=The Improbable First Century of Cosmopolitan Magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/improbablefirstc0000land|url-access= registration|publisher= [[University of Missouri Press]]|isbn= 9780826272331|pages = [https://archive.org/details/improbablefirstc0000land/page/169 169–213] }}</ref>

With a circulation of 1,700,000 in the 1930s, ''Cosmopolitan'' had an advertising income of $5,000,000. Emphasizing fiction in the 1940s, it was subtitled ''The Four-Book Magazine'' since the first section had one novelette, six or eight short stories, two serials, six to eight articles and eight or nine special features, while the other three sections featured two novels and a digest of current non-fiction books. During World War II, sales peaked at 2,000,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The magazine began to run less fiction during the 1950s. Circulation dropped to slightly over a million by 1955, a time when magazines were overshadowed during the rise of paperbacks and television. The Golden Age of magazines came to an end as [[mass market]], general interest publications gave way to special interest magazines targeting specialized audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ablongman.com/stovall1e/chap05/05goldagephotog.html |title= Magazines and Photojournalism's Golden Age |last= Stovall |first= James Glen |website= Journalism: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How|access-date= March 21, 2019}}</ref>

===Helen Gurley Brown arrives===
Cosmo was widely known as a "bland" and boring magazine by critics. Cosmopolitan's circulation continued to decline for another decade until [[Helen Gurley Brown]] became chief editor in 1965.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cosmopolitan-magazine|title=Cosmopolitan {{!}} magazine|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=August 23, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Helen Gurley Brown changed the entire trajectory of the magazine during her time as editor.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/08/14/cosmo_covers_how_helen_gurley_brown_changed_cosmopolitan_s_cover_.html|title=A Brief History of Cosmo Covers|last=Jaramillo|first=Juliana|date=August 12, 2014}}</ref> Brown remodeled and re-invented it as a magazine for modern single career women,<ref name=changed>{{cite magazine|author=Benjamin, Jennifer|title=How Cosmo Changed the World|magazine=Cosmopolitan|date=September 2009|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world|access-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> completely transforming the old bland Cosmopolitan magazine into a racy, contentious and well known, successful magazine. As the editor for 32 years, Brown spent this time using the magazine as an outlet to erase stigma around unmarried women not only having sex, but also enjoying it.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/business/media/helen-gurley-brown-who-gave-cosmopolitan-its-purr-is-dead-at-90.html|title=Helen Gurley Brown, Who Gave 'Single Girl' a Life in Full, Dies at 90|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=August 13, 2012|website=New York Times}}</ref> Known as a "devout feminist",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/17/living/helen-gurley-brown-legacy/index.html|title=Helen Gurley Brown's Complicated Feminist Legacy|last=Grinberg|first=Emanuella|date=August 19, 2012|website=CNN}}</ref> Brown was often attacked by critics due to her progressive views on women and sex. She believed that women were allowed to enjoy sex without shame in all cases. She died in 2012 at the age of 90.<ref name=":1" /> Her vision is still evident in the current design of Cosmopolitan Magazine.<ref name=":0" /> The magazine eventually adopted a cover format consisting of a usually young female model (in recent years, an actress, singer, or another prominent female celebrity), typically in a low cut dress, bikini, or some other revealing outfit.

The magazine set itself apart by frankly discussing [[sexuality]] from the point of view that women could and should enjoy sex without guilt. The first issue under Helen Gurley Brown, July 1965,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050816005220/en/Cosmopolitan-Celebrates-40-Years-Worlds-Favorite-Womens|title=Cosmopolitan Celebrates 40 Years as the World's Favorite Women's Magazine|website=www.businesswire.com}}</ref> featured an article on the [[birth control pill]],<ref name=changed/> which had gone on the market exactly five years earlier.<ref name="marks">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Lara|year=2001|title=Sexual Chemistry: A History of the Contraceptive Pill|location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08943-1|url=https://archive.org/details/sexualchemistryh00mark}}</ref><ref name="watkins">{{cite book|last=Watkins|first=Elizabeth Siegel|year=1998|title=On the Pill: A Social History of Oral Contraceptives, 1950–1970|location=Baltimore|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-5876-5}}</ref>

This was not Brown's first publication dealing with sexually liberated women. Her 1962 advice book, ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]'', had been a bestseller.<ref>Ouellette, Laurie. [http://mcs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/3/359 "Inventing the Cosmo Girl: Class Identity and Girl-Style American Dreams"]. ''[[Media, Culture & Society]]'' 21 (1999): 361.

Brown sent the message that a woman should have men complement her life, not take it over. Enjoying sex without shame was also a message she incorporated in both publications.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gianoulis, Tina |title="Cosmopolitan."

In Brown's early years as editor, the magazine received heavy criticism. In 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a "Freedom Trash Can."

In April 1978, a single edition of ''Cosmopolitan Man'' was published as a trial, targeted to appeal to men. Its cover featured [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Aurore Clément]]. It was published twice in 1989 as a supplement to ''Cosmopolitan''.<ref>[http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz2.htm "Men's magazines: an A to Z"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121232506/http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz2.htm |date=November 21, 2007 }}, Magforum.com, accessed November 6, 2006</ref> Hearst abandoned this project after the company purchased ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The magazine, and in particular its cover stories, have become increasingly sexually explicit in tone, and covers have models wearing revealing clothes. [[Kroger]], the second largest grocery chain in the United States after Walmart, used to cover up ''Cosmopolitan'' at checkout stands because of complaints about sexually inappropriate headlines.<ref name="kroger_coverup">[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/2000/01/12/2000-01-12_the_ticker.html New York Daily News – The Ticker], ''New York Daily News''.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The UK edition of ''Cosmopolitan'', which began in 1972, was the first Cosmopolitan magazine to be branched out to another country. It was well known for sexual explicitness, with strong sexual language, male nudity, and coverage of such subjects as rape. In 1999, ''[[CosmoGirl|CosmoGIRL!]]'', a spinoff magazine targeting a teenage female audience, was created for international readership. It shut down in December 2008.

The magazine currently features topics including sex, relationships, beauty, college, fashion, politics, movies, books, music, money , career, and astrology,.

There are 64 worldwide editions of ''Cosmopolitan'', and the magazine is published in 35 languages, with distribution in more than 100 countries making ''Cosmopolitan'' the largest-selling young women's magazine in the world.<ref name="hearst.com-aboutcosmo" /> Some international editions are published in partnerships, such as licenses or joint ventures, with established publishing houses in each local market.  In October 2018, [[Bauer Media Group]] announced that after 45 years, publication of the Australian edition of ''Cosmopolitan'' would stop due to the commercial viability of the magazine no longer being sustainable.<ref>Donoughue, Paul (October 16, 2018) [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-16/australian-edition-of-cosmopolitan-magazine-to-close/10382338 Cosmopolitan magazine to stop publishing its Australian edition after 45 years], [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Retrieved October 16, 2018.</ref>

''Cosmopolitan'' has since the 1960s been a women's magazine discussing such topics as sex, health, fitness, and fashion. ''Cosmopolitan'' also has a section called "Ask Him Anything" where a male writer answers readers' questions about men and dating. There is debate whether the responses in this section are representative of the majority of men or only based on the views of the small number of male writers.

Cosmopolitan has found popularity in its newfound medium, the "discover" section on Snapchat. Cosmopolitan's "discover" has over 3 million readers a day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/media/cosmo-says-getting-3-million-readers-snapchat-discover/|title=Cosmo is getting 3 million readers a day on Snapchat Discover|date=October 14, 2015|work=[[Digiday]]|access-date=September 25, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Practice Safe Sun===
In the May 2006 issue of ''Cosmopolitan'', the magazine launched the Practice Safe Sun campaign, an initiative aimed at fighting [[skin cancer]] by asking readers to stop all forms of [[Sun tanning|tanning]] other than [[Sunless tanning|tanning from a bottle]].<ref name="allbusiness.com">[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html Cosmo to Promote 'Safe Skin' | Business solutions from AllBusiness.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328102238/http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html |date=March 28, 2009 }}</ref> In conjunction with the campaign, ''Cosmo's'' editor-in-chief, Kate White, approached Congresswoman [[Carolyn Maloney]] (D-NY), known for her support of women's health issues, with concerns that women were not fully aware of the dangers of indoor tanning and the effectiveness of the current warning labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html |title=Cosmo to Promote 'Safe Skin' &#124; Mediaweek &#124; Professional Journal archives from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=April 10, 2006 |access-date=November 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328102238/http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html |archive-date=March 28, 2009 }}</ref> After careful review, the Congresswoman agreed that it was necessary to recommend that the FDA take a closer look. She and Representative [[Ginny Brown-Waite]] (R-FL) introduced the [[Tanning Accountability and Notification Act]] (TAN Act – H.R. 4767) on February 16, 2006.<ref name="allbusiness.com"/> President Bush signed the act in September 2007, and the new federal law requires the [[Food & Drug Administration|FDA]] to scrutinize the warning labels on [[tanning bed]]s and issue a report by September 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84045.php|title=American Academy Of Dermatology Association Commends President Bush For Signing Tanning Accountability And Notification (TAN) Act}}</ref>
Tanning beds are very unsafe.

===Cosmopolitan, The Fragrance===
In May 2015, Cosmopolitan UK announced they were launching their first ever fragrance. This is considered a first in the magazine industry.

==Politics==
===Seventeenth Amendment===
''Cosmopolitan'' played a role in passing the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]], which allowed for the popular election of Senators.  In 1906, [[William Randolph Hearst]] hired [[David Graham Phillips]] to write a series of articles entitled "[[The Treason of the Senate]]." These articles, which were largely sensationalized, helped galvanize public support for this cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/SeventeenthAmendment.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Landmark Legislation: The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=July 30, 2017}}</ref>

===Candidate endorsement===
In September 2014, ''Cosmopolitan'' began endorsing political candidates. The endorsements are based on "established criteria" agreed upon by the magazine's editors. Specifically, ''Cosmopolitan'' will only endorse candidates that support [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay laws]], legal [[abortion]], free [[contraceptives]], [[gun control]], and oppose [[voter identification law]]s. Amy Odell, editor of Cosmopolitan.com, has stated that under no circumstances will the magazine endorse a political candidate that is [[anti-abortion]]: "We're not going to endorse someone who is pro-life because that's not in our readers' best interest."<ref name="Politico">{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/the-new-cosmo-love-sex-politics-110586|title=The new Cosmo: Love, sex, politics?|last=Gold|first=Hadas|author-link=Hadas Gold|date=September 4, 2014|publisher=[[Politico]]|access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref> According to Joanna Coles, the magazine's [[Editor-in-chief|Editor-in-Chief]], the endorsements of ''Cosmopolitan'' will focus on "candidates in [[swing state]]s or candidates who are strongly in favor of issues like contraception coverage or gun control."<ref name="Politico" /> In the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 U.S. elections]], ''Cosmopolitan'' officially endorsed twelve [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates. However, only two of them won their respective [[political campaign]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-8-biggest-losers-of-the-war-on-women/article/2555814>|title=The 8 biggest losers of the war on women|author=Ashe Schow|work=Washington Examiner}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Criticism==
===January 1988 and October 1989 issues===
In its January 1988 issue, ''Cosmopolitan'' ran a feature claiming that women had almost no reason to worry about contracting [[HIV]] long after the best available medical science indicated otherwise. The piece claimed that unprotected sex with an [[HIV-positive]] man did not put women at risk of infection and went on to state that "most heterosexuals are not at risk" and that it was impossible to transmit HIV in the [[missionary position]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/17158/index2.html |title=AIDS in New York: A Biography – New York Magazine |publisher=Newyorkmetro.com |date=June 5, 2006 |access-date=November 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719082645/http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/17158/index2.html |archive-date=July 19, 2006 }}</ref> This article angered many educated people, including [[AIDS]] and [[gay rights]] activists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930731&slug=1713646|title=Editorials & Opinion – Cosmo's Deadly Advice To Women About Aids – Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poz.com/article/Cosmo-Confessions-7133-9692|title=Cosmo Confessions|last=Rossi|date=June 1, 1998|access-date=July 30, 2016}}</ref> The protests organised in response to the article's publication were turned into a 30-minute documentary titled "Doctors, Liars and Women: AIDS Activists Say NO to Cosmo" by two members of ACTUP, a New York City based collective of HIV/AIDS activists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html|title=ACT UP/NY Chronology 1988|website=www.actupny.org}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jeancarlomusto.com/doctorsliars&women jeancarlomusto.com], actupny.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821133558/http://www.jeancarlomusto.com/doctorsliars%26women.html |date=August 21, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/55793020|title=Doctors, Liars and Women:AIDS Activists Say No To Cosmo|first=Jean|last=Carlomusto|date=December 17, 2012|via=Vimeo}}</ref>

One of the articles in its October 1989 issue, ''"''The Risky Business of Bisexual Love," promoted the '[[bisexual]] bridge' theory.<ref>Gerrard, Susan and James Halperin. "The Risky Business of Bisexual Love," ''Cosmopolitan,'' October 1989, 202-205. </ref> The bisexual bridge theory suggests that heterosexual women are unknowingly put at risk for contracting HIV through sexual contact with bisexual men who [[Down-low (sexual slang)|covertly have sex with other men]] (colloquially described as being "on the down low").<ref>{{cite journal

===Accusations of targeting minors and other mixed criticisms===
While considered a magazine for adult women, ''Cosmopolitan'' has been accused of subtly targeting children.<ref name=FN>{{cite web|work=[[Fox News]]|title=Victoria Hearst says her family's ''Cosmopolitan'' magazine "pornographic", joins campaign to get it brown bagged|first=Hollie|last=McKay|date=September 6, 2012|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/09/06/victoria-hearst-says-her-family-cosmopolitan-magazine-pornographic-joins/}}</ref> Former model Nicole Weider accused the magazine of using slang "which is used by young people not adults" and using (then) underage celebrities, such as [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Selena Gomez]], as well as other celebrities popular with teens such as [[Ashley Greene]] and [[Dakota Fanning]], in an attempt to gain the attention of underage girls.<ref name=FN/>

Victoria Hearst, a granddaughter of [[William Randolph Hearst]] (founder of ''Cosmopolitan'''s parent company) and sister of [[Patty Hearst]], has lent her support to a campaign which seeks to classify ''Cosmopolitan'' as harmful under the guidelines of "Material Harmful to Minors" laws. Hearst, the founder of an evangelical Colorado church called Praise Him Ministries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praisehimministries.org/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101101557/http://praisehimministries.org/index.htm|title=Praise Him Ministries|publisher=Praise Him Ministries|archive-date=January 1, 2014}}</ref> states that "the magazine promotes a lifestyle that can be dangerous to women's emotional and physical well being. It should never be sold to anyone under 18".<ref name=FN/> Donald Clark, the secretary of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), has also shown interest in the matter.<ref name=FN/>

''Cosmopolitan'' has also received criticism for promoting obesity. Plus-sized model [[Tess Holliday]] received backlash when she was first featured on the magazine in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/fashion/cosmopolitan-magazine-cover-criticised-for-promoting-obesity-1.3616717|title=Cosmopolitan magazine cover criticised for ‘promoting obesity’|last=O'Connell|first=Jennifer|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>

===Walmart's removal of Cosmo magazines===
In 2018, Walmart announced that ''Cosmopolitan'' would be removed from checkout lines after news released by the [[National Center on Sexual Exploitation]] labeling the magazine as "sexually explicit material".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2018/03/27/walmart-to-remove-cosmopolitan-magazine-from-checkout-lines.html|title=Walmart to remove Cosmopolitan magazine from checkout lines|last=Lam|first=Katherine|date=March 27, 2018|work=Fox News|access-date=April 5, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The magazines will continue to be sold elsewhere in the stores.
