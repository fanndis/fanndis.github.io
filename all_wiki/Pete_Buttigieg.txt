====RFRA opposition====
In 2015, during the controversy over [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Indiana)|Indiana Senate Bill 101]]—the original version of which was widely criticized for allowing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people—Buttigieg emerged as a leading opponent of the legislation.

In 2017, after complaints from downtown business owners about an [[homeless encampment]] that had formed under the Main Street railroad [[viaduct]], Buttigieg assembled a 22-member task force to develop recommendations to prevent such encampments from forming. The task force's report recommended a gateway center and permanent supportive housing project, which would have a "housing first" approach that would provide immediate shelter regardless of behavioral or [[substance abuse]] issues. However, this project was scrapped by the city, due to the being unable to find a location due to opposition from prospective neighbors. The city instead opted to attempt a scattered-site housing approach with participating landlords.<ref>{{cite web |last1=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-plans-to-open-new-homeless-shelter-in-wake-of-downtown-tent-encampment/article_7342f5da-9ae3-11ea-a7c7-0face97c0cfe.html |first1=Jeff Parrott |title=South Bend plans to open new homeless shelter in wake of downtown tent encampment |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-plans-to-open-new-homeless-shelter-in-wake-of-downtown-tent-encampment/article_7342f5da-9ae3-11ea-a7c7-0face97c0cfe.html |website=South Bend Tribune |accessdate=November 12, 2020 |language=en |date=May 21, 2020}}</ref>
