{{short description|Proposed U.S. Constitutional amendment to outlaw the acknowledgement of homosexual marriages.}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}
The '''Federal Marriage Amendment''' ('''FMA'''), also referred to by proponents as the '''Marriage Protection Amendment''', was a proposed [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] that would legally define marriage as a union of one man and one woman. The FMA would also prevent judicial extension of marriage rights to [[same-sex couple|same-sex]] or other unmarried homosexual couples. An amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the support of two thirds of each house of Congress and [[ratification]] by three fourths of the states. The last Congressional vote on the proposed amendment occurred in the House of Representatives on July 18, 2006, when the motion failed 236 to 187, falling short of the 290 votes required for passage in that body. The Senate has only voted on [[cloture]] motions with regard to the proposed amendment, the last of which was on June 7, 2006, when the motion failed 49 to 48, falling short of the 60 votes required to allow the Senate to proceed to consideration of the proposal and the 67 votes required to send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification.  President Bush endorsed this proposal and made it part of his campaign during the 2004 and 2006 election cycles.<ref>Robert Draper, ''Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W.

==Background and current law==

===Role of states===
In the United States, civil marriage is governed by [[State law (United States)|state law]]. Each state is free to set the conditions for a valid marriage, subject to limits set by the state's own constitution and the U.S. Constitution. Traditionally, a marriage was considered valid if the requirements of the marriage law of the state where the marriage took place were fulfilled. (First Restatement of Conflicts on Marriage and Legitimacy s.121 (1934)). However, a state can refuse to recognize a marriage if the marriage violates a strong public policy of the state, even if the marriage was legal in the state where it was performed. (Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 283(2) (1971).) States historically exercised this "public policy exception" by refusing to recognize out-of-state polygamous marriages, underage marriages, incestuous marriages, and interracial marriages. Following the ''Windsor'' decision in 2013, nearly all courts that have addressed the issue have held that states with laws defining marriage as a one-man, one-woman union cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages that were legally performed elsewhere and must permit all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, the right to marry.<ref>Scott Dodson, "The Peculiar Federal Marriage Amendment." ''Arizona State Law Journal'' 36 (2004): 783+ [https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2409&context=faculty_scholarship online].</ref>

Same-sex marriage is currently legal in [[Same-sex marriage in the United States#Tables|all US States]].  In 2003 and 2008 respectively, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Massachusetts]] and [[Supreme Court of California|California]] supreme courts ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' and ''[[In Re Marriage Cases]]'' that the states' constitutions required the state to permit same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts decision could be reversed by an amendment to the state constitution; to date, no such amendment has successfully been passed in Massachusetts. On June 2, the [[California Proposition 8|''California Marriage Protection Act'']], commonly referred to as Prop 8 qualified for the 2008 General Election ballot.<ref>[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm#2008General California 2008 General Election ballot propositions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617213215/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_j.htm |date=June 17, 2009 }}</ref> Voted into law on November 4, 2008, it amended the California Constitution to provide that "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California". Prop 8 was later found to be unconstitutional and same-sex marriage was allowed to resume.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf |title=California Marriage Protection Act |access-date=June 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721032937/http://www.ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Thirty states passed state constitutional amendments defining marriage as being between one man and one woman. On June 26, 2015, all amendments banning sex-same marriage were invalidated by the Supreme Court's ruling on ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.

===Federal statutes regulating marriage===
Although individual U.S. states have the primary regulatory power with regard to marriage, the [[United States Congress]] has occasionally regulated marriage. The 1862 [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which made bigamy a punishable federal offense in U.S. territories, was followed by a series of federal laws designed to end the practice of polygamy. In 1996 as a reaction to a state level judicial ruling prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying that may violate Hawaii's constitutional equal protection clause (Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai`i 341), Congress passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), section 3 of which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for the purpose of interpreting federal law. Under DOMA section 3, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages, even if those unions were recognized by state law. For example, members of a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts could not file joint [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax returns]] even if they filed joint [[State income tax|state income tax returns]]. DOMA section 3 was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' on June 26, 2013.

===The United States Constitution and federal courts===
Federal courts have interpreted the U.S. Constitution to place some limits on states' ability to restrict access to marriage. In ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the United States Supreme Court overturned state marriage laws that barred interracial marriages on the basis that marriage is a "basic civil right..." and that "...the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State." The Supreme Court struck down a 1992 Colorado constitutional amendment that barred legislative and judicial remedies to protect homosexuals from discrimination solely on the basis of their sexual orientation in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''.

In 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] dismissed, "for want of a substantial question," an appeal by two men who unsuccessfully challenged Minnesota's marriage statutes in state court. Because the case, ''[[Baker v. Nelson]],'' came to the Court through mandatory appellate review (not ''[[certiorari]]''), the summary dismissal established ''Baker v. Nelson'' as a binding precedent.<ref>Project, ''Developments in the Law: The Constitution and the Family,'' 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1156, 1274 (1980) (discussing ''Baker's'' posture as precedent); ''see, e.g.'' Pamela R. Winnick, Comment, ''The Precedential Weight of a Dismissal by the Supreme Court for Want of a Substantial Federal Question: Some Implications of Hicks v. Miranda,'' 76 Colum. L. Rev. 508, 511 (1976); ''Baker v. Nelson,'' 409 U.S. 810 (1972).</ref>

In 2010, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] ruled<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i//MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20news/Life/gaymarriage.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614223900/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i//MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_U.S.%20news/Life/gaymarriage.pdf |archive-date=June 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that Proposition 8, passed two years earlier by a majority of voters, was unconstitutional. As in Judge Baitaillon's decision about the Nebraska law, Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] stated in his ruling that moral opposition to same-sex marriage is not sufficient reason to make a law valid. Judge Walker ruled the law violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, as well as the Due Process Clause. The proponents of Proposition 8 appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which affirmed the lower court's decision on February 7, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hagan |first=Robyn |url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/ninth_circuit/2012/02/perry-v-brown-ninth-circuit-says-prop-8-is-unconstitutional.html |title=Perry v. Brown: Ninth Circuit Says Prop 8 is Unconstitutional - Civil Rights Law - U.S. Ninth Circuit |publisher=Blogs.findlaw.com |date=February 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}</ref> On June 26, 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], vacated the Ninth Circuit's ruling for lack of jurisdiction. Two days later the Ninth Circuit dissolved its stay of the district court's ruling, allowing same-sex marriage to resume in California.<ref name="latimes.com">[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop-8-gay-marriage-20130628,0,1889039.story Prop 8: Gay marriages can resume in California, court rules]</ref> In 2015 the Supreme Court held in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriage.

==Legislative history==
The Federal Marriage Amendment has been introduced in the [[United States Congress]] many different times: in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2013, and 2015.

The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator [[Wayne Allard]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Colorado|Colo.]]) on November 25, 2003, and designated S.J.Res.26. The amendment changed the language of the proposed amendment, substituting "marriage" for "marital status" and specifying that it applied to "any union other than the union of a man and a woman" rather than "unmarried couples or groups". The changes were intended to make it clear that state legislatures could still recognize civil unions if the amendment were to pass. "This new language makes the intent of the legislation even clearer: to protect marriage in this country as the union between a man and a woman, and to reinforce the authority of state legislatures to determine benefits issues related to civil unions or domestic partnerships," said Sen. Wayne Allard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Federal Marriage Amendment Reworded to Allow Civil Unions|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/marchweb-only/3-22-22.0.html|accessdate=August 3, 2013|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=March 1, 2004}}</ref> It was immediately referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Committee on the Judiciary]].<ref name=sjres26/>

===Influence on 2004 presidential election===
By the time Americans went to the polls, [[John Kerry]] opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment and affirmatively supported civil unions, while [[George W. Bush]] supported the Federal Marriage Amendment but was not opposed to states enacting their own civil union legislation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/us/campaign-2004-renewed-state-efforts-made-against-same-sex-marriage.html?pagewanted=all|title=Renewed State Efforts Made Against Same-Sex Marriage|last=Dao|first=James|date=July 16, 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref>

Previously, on February 24, 2004, Bush called for an amendment which would have outlawed same-sex marriage, and which would have disallowed states from recognizing or enforcing same-sex civil unions. Bush's statement included a requirement that any amendment "leav[e] the state legislatures free to make their own choices in defining legal arrangements other than marriage."<ref>Bush, George W. (February 24, 2004) [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/02/20040224-2.html President Calls for Constitutional Amendment Protecting Marriage] [[United States President]].

(McClellan also stated, however, that Bush did not personally support civil unions.) Similarly, at the February 25, 2004 press conference,<ref>McClellan, Scott.

Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref> McClellan stated that the White House intended to work with Congress to develop language for the FMA that permitted states to enact civil unions. Although Bush frequently spoke about FMA on the campaign from February and November 2004, he avoided mention of the phrase "civil unions" until an ABC News interview of October 26, 2004, aired one week before the election.<ref>(October 26, 2004) [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6338458 "Bush's gay union stance irks conservatives"] [[Associated Press]]. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>

The FMA's Republican co-sponsors, Senator [[Wayne Allard]] (R-CO) and Representative [[Marilyn Musgrave]] (R-CO), announced new language for the proposed amendment on March 23, 2004, replacing the second sentence of the amendment with "Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman." Both Allard and Musgrave called the change purely "technical."<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_amend4.htm Federal Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Recent events up to 2004 MAY] ReligiousTolerance.org. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>

Opponents of the FMA claim polling of the public has shown a cautious response, with many polls indicating opposition, even in states such as [[Arizona]] and [[Colorado]] which are normally thought of as socially conservative. They cite [[Pew Research Center]] exit polls from the 2004 elections finding that 25% of polled voters support same-sex marriage and another 35% support civil unions.<ref>Goodstein, Laurie; Yardley, William.

Retrieved April 26, 2007.</ref>

On the other hand, of the 11 states in which amendments defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including [[Ohio]]. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came out for the first time to cast their ballots for Bush.<!-- Dead Link<ref>[http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20041105/ts_alt_afp/us_vote_bush_religion&cid=1506&ncid=1963&sid=96378801]</ref> --> Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that Bush did not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.

However, Roberta Combs, President of the Christian Coalition of America claims, "Christian evangelicals made the major difference once again this year." In the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 Presidential Election]], there was some speculation that many evangelicals did not go to the polls and vote because of the [[October surprise]] of George W. Bush's drunk-driving arrest record. In a dozen swing states that decided the presidential election, moral values tied with the economy and jobs as the top issue in the campaign, according to Associated Press exit polls.<!-- Dead Link<ref>https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20041104/ap_on_el_pr/eln_how_bush_won_2</ref> -->

==Arguments against the Federal Marriage Amendment==
:''This section contains arguments specific to the Federal Marriage Amendment. For arguments for and against same-sex marriage in general, see [[Same-sex marriage#Controversies]]''

The first sentence of H.J. Res. 56 would provide an official definition of legal marriage in the United States. Proponents{{Who|date=June 2010}} claim that this is a reasonable measure, based on established custom, which defends the family and the institution of marriage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} To others, it is an unfair means of excluding same-sex couples from receiving benefits from that institution. The Federal Marriage Amendment discriminates against the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/frequently-asked-questions-about-federal-marriage-amendment-and-gay-marriage|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Federal Marriage Amendment and Gay Marriage|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

===Federalism===
Opponents of the FMA argued it would violate the [[states' rights]] to regulate marriage by [[Federal government of the United States|federalizing]] the issue, which they said should be left to the states. Many used the federalism argument, including Senator [[John Kerry]], Senator [[John McCain]], and Representative [[Ron Paul]], who opposed the FMA for several reasons, one of which that regulating marriage is not a proper role of the federal government. The author [[Jonathan Rauch]] wrote that "the proposed amendment strips power not from judges but from states," since the amendment would not allow any state to create same-sex marriage even by the rules of its own state-level democracy. "That conservatives would contemplate so striking a repudiation of federalism," Rauch wrote, "is a sign of the panic that same-sex marriage inspires on the right."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Leave Gay Marriage to the States|last=Rauch|first=Jonathan|date=27 July 2001|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Furthermore, constitutionally defining marriage would have reversed the choices already made in states and territories including Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Iowa, and the District of Columbia.

===Unmarried heterosexual couples===
It is argued that the 2003 version of the FMA would have severely affected the ability of heterosexual unmarried couples to seek some degree of legal protection and/or provisions.<ref>(May 28, 2003) [https://www.aclu.org/lgbt/relationships/11820res20030528.html "Marriage Amendment: Oppose Writing Intolerance into the Constitution"], [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>

Opponents of the FMA argue that it may complicate efforts to enforce laws against [[domestic abuse]] in [[heterosexual]] relationships involving unmarried couples.<ref>[http://www.legalmomentum.org/congress/FMADV2pager060206.pdf "Passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment will harm victims of domestic violence"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929022731/http://www.legalmomentum.org/congress/FMADV2pager060206.pdf |date=September 29, 2007 }} [[Legal Momentum]].

===Separation of church and state===
Some religious groups argue that having the government decide whether a same-sex marriage should be legally binding on the grounds of the ideology of other religious groups restricts their religious freedom. They argue that marriage is a religious term that should not be defined by the government. Where same-sex marriage is recognized in the United States, no church or other religious institution is forced to perform same-sex marriages, but the FMA would deny the opportunity for religions which approve of same-sex marriage to perform legally binding same-sex marriages.

===Unnecessary and ineffective===
Opponents of the FMA have claimed that life for those in a heterosexual marriage are not materially affected by a constitutional marriage definition or legalization of same-sex marriage. They stated that the FMA was totally unnecessary because federal and state laws, combined with the state of the relevant constitutional doctrines at the time, already made court-ordered nationwide same-sex marriage unlikely for the foreseeable future. It was claimed therefore, that such an amendment was a solution in search of a problem. It was claimed that neither federal nor state courts were likely to order same-sex marriage under the traditional interpretation of the Constitution's [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]]. Nor, for the foreseeable future, it was claimed, were courts likely to mandate same-sex marriage under substantive federal constitutional doctrines, such as the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause. This claim ultimately became untrue, as the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that denying the right of marriage to same-sex couples was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause in its landmark 2015 ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.

===Institution of Marriage Amendment===
The Concerned Women for America (CWA) were concerned about the wording of the 2004 Federal Marriage Amendment. CWA did not support the language in the amendment because the second sentence is open to differing interpretations, and its drafters acknowledged that it was specifically worded so state legislators could create civil unions and domestic partnerships, because the CWA opposes any legal recognition of same-sex couples. CWA preferred the Institution of Marriage Amendment crafted by Home School Legal Defense Association President Michael Farris. That amendment, which has not been introduced by any member of Congress, states:<ref>[http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=17217 Should a marriage amendment also ban civil unions?]</ref>

{{quote|Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither the United States nor any State shall recognize or grant to any unmarried person the legal rights or status of a spouse.}}

==Arguments in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment==
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2019}}

:''This section contains arguments specific to the Federal Marriage Amendment. For arguments for and against same-sex marriage in general, see [[Same-sex marriage#Controversies]]''

===Restriction of perceived judicial overreach===
Proponents of the FMA initially argued that if it were not for judicial overreach, there would be no need for an FMA; states' rights would not be violated since no state legislatures had recognized same-sex marriage. However, by the end of 2012, a number of states had enacted same-sex marriage both through the actions of their state legislatures ([[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]]), and through popular vote ([[Same-sex marriage in Maine|Maine]], [[Same-sex marriage in Maryland|Maryland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Washington|Washington]]).

Prior to these legislative enactments and popular vote outcomes, proponents of the FMA argues that the federalism proposed by the opponents of a constitutional amendment was a contrivance for permitting federal courts to force same-sex marriage upon the whole nation, no matter what the people of the individual states desire. Proponents supported this claim with ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'', in which a district court struck down Nebraska's marriage amendment, even though it had been passed by a margin of seventy percent (although the amendment was later reinstated.)  Opponents of the FMA argued that no federal court has ever ordered a state to permit same-sex marriage.  However, on February 7, 2012 a federal appeals court in a 2-to-1 decision threw out California's voter-approved restriction on same-sex marriage (Proposition 8) saying that it violated the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|title=Court Strikes Down Ban on Gay Marriage in California|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/us/marriage-ban-violates-constitution-court-rules.html|accessdate=July 2, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Uniform application of Full Faith and Credit===
Under the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], with certain exceptions, a state is obligated to honor the judgments and declarations of other states. While some assert that a "license" could be construed as a "judgment", the majority of legal scholars disagree. However, it is pointed out that a judgment for divorce is required to be honored because judgments are required to be enforced by out-of-state jurisdictions, regardless of whether those judgments are against the public policy of the out state forum (see ''Williams v. North Carolina'', 317 U.S. 287 (1942) (the case also stated that there is no "authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state")). Because of the intricacies of family law and the mobility of married couples, the recognition of marriages in other states varies. The need for clarification on state uniformity in this issue requires a constitutional amendment at the federal level, particularly considering there will be a flood of marriages in out-of-state jurisdictions for purposes of obtaining a same-sex marriage license.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Protection of conjugal marriage===
FMA proponents argue that opposite-sex marriage in the United States has been given special legal protection. This protection has historically been granted only to the unique institution of marriage as the cradle for the family and to legitimize lines of inheritance.<!-- Dead Link<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=114&page=15]</ref> --> Proponents of FMA argue that same-sex marriage advocates want to disregard [[federalism]] and use the judicial system to make same-sex marriage legal nationwide, which only the Federal Marriage Amendment can forestall.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Public opinion varies widely between different states. Only 2 states, [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]], had public opinion generally more opposed to same sex marriage than in favor in 2017, with only Alabama having an absolute majority, 51%, opposed; in Mississippi, there was plurality opposition.<ref>http://ava.prri.org/#lgbt/2017/States/lgbt_ssm/2,3,9</ref> In [[Louisiana]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[West Virginia]], there was plurality support; in all other states, there was absolute majority support. The lowest approval of same sex marriage was 41% in Alabama. The highest was 80% in [[Vermont]] and [[Massachusetts]]. With 48 states more in favor of same sex marriage than opposed, and 44 with absolute majorities in favor, this amendment is very unlikely to ever pass.
