The first and incumbent [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]] (a position equivalent to  [[prime minister]]) of Myanmar, she is also the leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] and played a vital role in the state's transition from military junta to partial democracy.

The youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the United Nations for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, with whom she had two children.

Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the [[1990 Burmese general election|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s. In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named her one of the "Children of [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]" and his spiritual heir to [[nonviolence]].<ref name="TimeTCOG">{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993026,00.html|title=The Children of Gandhi|date=31 December 1999|work=Time|format=excerpt|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013134/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C993026%2C00.html|archivedate=5 October 2013}}</ref>

Her party boycotted the [[2010 Myanmar general election|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[2012 Burmese by-elections|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[2015 Myanmar general election|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] – well more than the 67% [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]].

Since ascending to the office of State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi has drawn criticism from several countries, organisations and figures over Myanmar's inaction in response to the [[Rohingya genocide|genocide of the Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]] and refusal to accept that Myanmar's military has committed massacres.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|title=Did the World Get Aung San Suu Kyi Wrong?|first1=Amanda|last1=Taub|first2=Max|last2=Fisher|date=31 October 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114095109/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|title=What Happened to Myanmar's Human-Rights Icon?|first=Hannah|last=Beech|date=25 September 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114145201/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|title=Dispatches – On Demand – All 4|publisher=Channel 4|access-date=14 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515112236/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001|archive-date=15 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrJ7FgNyTNbhNAA3RtXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1530149261/RO=10/RU=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/myanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-genocide_us_5ab14dd7e4b008c9e5f1fc90/RK=2/RS=g1Tivi.NDd5FfxVlfFFrf5LyFn4-|title=rohingya genocide}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>The Guardian, 12 November 2018 [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal amnesty betrayal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112211037/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal |date=12 November 2018 }}</ref> Under her leadership, Myanmar has also drawn criticism for prosecutions of journalists.<ref name="Reuters-Nebehay" /> In 2019, Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in the [[International Court of Justice]] where she [[Genocide justification|defended the Burmese military]] against allegations of genocide against the Rohingya.<ref name="alj-zarni"/>

She grew up with her mother, [[Khin Kyi]], and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon.

==Political career==

===Political beginning===
Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.<ref name="azjarp" /> However, in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power.

She was offered freedom if she left the country, but she refused. Despite her philosophy of non-violence, a group of ex-military commanders and senior politicians who joined NLD during the crisis believed that she was too confrontational and left NLD.

During her time under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi devoted herself to Buddhist meditation practices and to studying Buddhist thought. This deeper interest in Buddhism is reflected in her writings as more emphasis is put on love and compassion.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements | url=https://archive.org/details/voiceofhope00aungrich | url-access=registration | author=Aung San Suu Kyi | publisher=Seven Stories Press | year=1998 | page=[https://archive.org/details/voiceofhope00aungrich/page/163 163]}}</ref> There also emerged more discussion on the compatibility of democracy and Buddhism and the ability of gaining freedom from an authoritarian government through Buddhism.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Buddhist Political Rhetoric of Aung San Suu Kyi | author=Stephen McCarthy | journal=Contemporary Buddhism |year=2004 | volume=5 | page=68}}</ref>

During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, [[U Nu]], initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu's plan by saying "the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people". Ex-Brigadier General [[Aung Gyi]], another influential politician at the time of the 8888 crisis and the first chairman in the history of the NLD, followed the suit and rejected the plan after Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Between Biographical Myth and Hard Realities | author=Susanne Prager-Nyein | journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |date=February 2013 | volume=3 | issue=43 | pages=546–554 | doi=10.1080/00472336.2013.771942| s2cid=154402781 }}</ref> Aung Gyi later accused several NLD members of being communists and resigned from the party.<ref name=bio/>

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and [[Kyi Maung]], was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 [[kyat]]s (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken.

Although under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi was granted permission to leave Burma under the condition that she never return, which she refused: "As a mother, the greater sacrifice was giving up my sons, but I was always aware of the fact that others had given up more than me.

The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[Burmese military junta|junta]] and Aung San Suu Kyi.<ref name = "azjarp"/> On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed "a new dawn for the country". However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a [[Depayin massacre|government-sponsored mob attacked]] her caravan in the northern village of [[Tabayin|Depayin]], murdering and wounding many of her supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=4 February 2007 |date=30 May 2005 |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Burma Caucus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614185341/http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}</ref> Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching [[Ye-U]].

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time.<ref name="unWrkGrp">[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/wgad/9-2004.html Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v.

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=19 January 2007 |date=18 January 2008 |work=The New York Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417044209/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|work=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2007|date=8 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was "disappointed" with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was "deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity".<ref>{{cite web|author=John Heilprin |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta |work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054213/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |archivedate=14 July 2009  }}</ref>

The court also took the view that the Burmese government's efforts to remedy the situation "do not appear sufficient" enough to protect the Rohingya. Therefore, the court ordered the Burmese government to take "all measures within its power" to protect the Rohingya from genocidal actions.

Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the [[Asian countries]] like [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Indonesia]]."

* [[Freedom Now]], a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organisation, was retained in 2006 by a member of her family to help secure Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest. The organisation secured several opinions from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that her detention was in violation of international law; engaged in political advocacy such as spearheading a letter from 112 former presidents and Prime Ministers to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging him to go to Burma to seek her release, which he did six weeks later; and published numerous opeds and spoke widely to the media about her ongoing detention. Its representation of her ended when she was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204230501/http://www.freedom-now.org/campaign/aung-san-suu-kyi/ www.freedom-now.org]. www.freedom-now.org.
