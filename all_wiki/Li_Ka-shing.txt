== Early life ==
Li was born in [[Chao'an District|Chao'an]], [[Chaozhou]] in [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in 1928 to [[Teochew people|Teochew]] parents. Li and his family fled to Hong Kong in 1940 as [[Refugees in Hong Kong|refugees]] from the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese war]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Olsen|first=Robert|title=Li Ka-shing Is Down $4 Billion, But Still Tops Hong Kong Rich List For 21st Year|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertolsen/2019/02/13/hong-kong-rich-list-2019-li-ka-shing-tops-hong-kong-rich-list-for-21st-year/|access-date=2020-11-15|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> Owing to his father's death from [[tuberculosis]], he was forced to leave school before the age of 15 and found a job in a plastics trading company where he worked 16 hours a day.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Einhorn |first1=Bruce |last2=Ho |first2=Prudence |title=Hong Kong's Richest Man Li Ka-shing Retires |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/li-ka-shing-retires-ending-career-of-one-of-asia-s-top-tycoons |website=Bloomberg |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216184652/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/li-ka-shing-retires-ending-career-of-one-of-asia-s-top-tycoons |archive-date=16 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1950 he started his own company, Cheung Kong Industries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ckh.com.hk/en/about/milestones.php?year=1950 |title=CK Hutchison Holdings Limited – About Us > Milestones |publisher=ckh.com.hk |access-date=8 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327101158/https://www.ckh.com.hk/en/about/milestones.php?year=1950 |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From manufacturing plastics, Li developed his company into a leading real estate investment company in Hong Kong that was listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] in 1972. Cheung Kong expanded by acquiring [[Hutchison Whampoa]] and [[Hongkong Electric Company|Hongkong Electric Holdings Limited]] in 1979 and 1985 respectively.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Business career==
A [[Harvard Business School]] article summarises Li's career in the following way:
{{quote|From his humble beginnings in China as a teacher's son, a refugee, and later as a salesman, Li provides a lesson in integrity and adaptability. Through hard work, and a reputation for remaining true to his internal moral compass, he was able to build a business empire that includes: banking, construction, real estate, plastics, cellular phones, satellite television, cement production, retail outlets (pharmacies and supermarkets), hotels, domestic transportation (sky train), airports, electric power, steel production, ports, and shipping.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=31390 |title=Li Ka-Shing |publisher=Harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu |access-date=2 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102125223/http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=31390 |archive-date=2 November 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

===Plastics manufacturing===
In 1950, after learning how to operate a plant, Li founded a plastic manufacturing company in Hong Kong with personal savings and funds borrowed from relatives. Li avidly read trade publications and business news before deciding to supply the world with high quality [[Artificial flower|plastic flowers]] at low prices. Li learned the technique of mixing colour with plastics that resemble real flowers. After retooling his shop and hiring the best technicians he could find, he prepared the plant for a visit from a large foreign buyer. Impressed with the quality of Li's plant, the buyer placed a large order. A few years later, Li grew to be the largest supplier of plastic flowers in Asia and made a fortune selling them.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Li-Ka-shing_SO0W.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205317/https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/10/billionaires-2009-richest-people_Li-Ka-shing_SO0W.html |date=29 July 2017 }} ''Forbes''</ref>

===Real estate===
In 1958, believing rents would continue to rise, Li decided to purchase a site and develop his own factory building. An opportunity to acquire more land arrived after the [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots|1967 riots]] when many people fled Hong Kong, and, as a result, property prices plummeted. Li believed the political crisis would be temporary and property prices would eventually rise, and bought land from the fleeing residents at low prices. In 1971, Li officially named his real estate development company [[Cheung Kong]] ({{lang|zh|長江實業}}). [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] was publicly listed in [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] in 1972. During board meetings, Li stated on a number of occasions his goal of surpassing the [[Jardine Matheson|Jardines]]-owned [[Hongkong Land]] as a leading developer.<ref>Taiwan's Business Weekly, December 2007, Issue 1047, p. 160-161</ref>

The successful bid by [[Cheung Kong]] for development sites above the Central and Admiralty MTR stations in 1977 was the key to challenging Hongkong Land as the premier property developer in Hong Kong. Despite its size, Jardines decided in the 1980s to protect itself from hostile takeover by Li or other outside investors. The company implemented a cross-shareholding structure that was designed to place control in the hands of Britain's Keswick family despite their less than 10% holdings in the group. In 1984, the company also moved its legal domicile from Hong Kong to another [[British overseas territory]] – [[Bermuda]], in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to People's Republic of China in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/business/jardine-of-hong-kong-plans-shift-to-bermuda.html |title=JARDINE OF HONG KONG PLANS SHIFT TO BERMUDA |last=Ap |date=29 March 1984 |via=NYTimes.com |access-date=10 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329063203/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/29/business/jardine-of-hong-kong-plans-shift-to-bermuda.html |archive-date=29 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In an effort to drive forward divestitures of assets in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, Li agreed to sell [[The Center]], the fifth-tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-11-02/101164723.html|title=Billionaire Pares Real Estate Holdings With Sale of Hong Kong Skyscraper|website=Caixin Global|access-date=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214070643/https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-11-02/101164723.html|archive-date=14 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> With a value of HK$40.2 billion (US$5.15 billion), the deal constitutes the biggest ever office space real estate sale in the Asia-Pacific region.<ref name=":0" /> Li sold the Century Link complex in [[Shanghai]] for US$2.95 billion, the second largest transaction for a single building, according to the [[Financial Times]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/32aead4e-bf8e-11e7-9836-b25f8adaa111|title=Li Ka-shing to sell stake in HK skyscraper for record $5.2bn|website=Financial Times|access-date=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102065327/https://www.ft.com/content/32aead4e-bf8e-11e7-9836-b25f8adaa111|archive-date=2 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Retail===
A subsidiary of CK Hutchison, the [[A.S. Watson Group]] (ASW), is a retail operator with over 15,000 stores. Its portfolio encompasses retail brands in Europe such as [[Superdrug]] (UK), Marionnaud (France), [[Kruidvat]] (Benelux countries), and in Asia including health and beauty retailer [[Watson's]] store and wine cellars et al., PARKnSHOP supermarkets (and spin-off brands), and Fortress electrical appliance stores. ASW also produces and distributes water products and beverages in the region.

===Asset trading===
[[CK Hutchison Holdings|CK Hutchison]] group has the reputation of being an astute asset trader. It builds up new businesses and sells them off when shareholder value could be created. Huge profits were obtained in the sale of its interest in [[Orange SA|Orange]] to Mannesmann Group in 1999, making a profit of $15.12&nbsp;billion. In 2006 Li sold 20% of Hutchison's ports business to Singapore rival [[PSA Corporation|PSA Corp.]], making a $3.12&nbsp;billion profit on a $4&nbsp;billion deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSHKG4565220070212|work=Reuters|author=Tony Munroe|title=Hong Kong "Superman" Li Ka-shing cashes in|date=12 February 2007|access-date=29 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615044412/http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSHKG4565220070212|archive-date=15 June 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

Group subsidiary [[Hutchison Telecommunications]] sold a controlling stake of 67% in [[Hutchison Essar]], a joint venture Mobile operator in India, to [[Vodafone]] for $11.1&nbsp;billion.

===Internet and technology===
Li has also made a foray into the technology business, where his investment and venture capital firm [[Horizons Ventures]] is specifically allocated towards backing new internet and technology startup firms, and bought a stake in [[doubleTwist]].<ref name="20090820forbes">[https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/20/spotify-li-hutchison-markets-equities-technology.html Spotify Li Hutchinson Markets Equities Technology"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729205151/https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/20/spotify-li-hutchison-markets-equities-technology.html |date=29 July 2017 }}.

==Politics==
For many years, he was considered to be a top pro-Beijing figure. However, in recent years, tensions have been growing between Li and the mainland, especially with the rise of current China's [[paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]]. During the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests]], he refused to outright condemn the protesters, instead urging for peace and calling on the authorities to respond to the protesters humanely.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hongkong-protests-tycoons/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128222138/https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hongkong-protests-tycoons/ |archive-date=28 November 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Li's business empire has presence around the world, including China. Li came under attack from Chinese state-run tabloid paper [[Global Times]] in early 2015, when his companies put out word that it was considering selling prime Shanghai and Beijing properties. It became apparent that Li aimed at re-weighting his asset portfolio to more stable and transparent markets in the West.<ref name=20150924ejinsight/> Concerted attacks ensued and went into a crescendo as China's economy slowed down dramatically in the second half of the year, and the central government sought a way to stem the capital outflows. Specific reproaches were that his asset disposals were "an act of ingratitude" and "immoral at such a sensitive juncture".<ref name=20150924ejinsight>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150924-beijing-emerges-badly-from-its-censure-of-tycoon/|title=Beijing emerges badly from its censure of tycoon|work=EJ Insight|access-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926013705/http://www.ejinsight.com/20150924-beijing-emerges-badly-from-its-censure-of-tycoon/|archive-date=26 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=nanzao>[http://www.nanzao.com/tc/business/14fca0865a4a486/nei-di-zhi-ku-pi-che-zi-shi-shou-dao-yi-chang-he-you-mai-you-mai-shi-zheng-chang-shang-ye-hang-wei "內地智庫籲“別讓李嘉誠跑了” 長和：有買有賣是正常商業行為"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930033741/http://www.nanzao.com/tc/business/14fca0865a4a486/nei-di-zhi-ku-pi-che-zi-shi-shou-dao-yi-chang-he-you-mai-you-mai-shi-zheng-chang-shang-ye-hang-wei |date=30 September 2015 }} ''South China Morning Post'' (Chinese edition)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/china-media-attacks-li-ka-shing-2015-9|title=China media attacks Li Ka-Shing – Business Insider|date=22 September 2015|work=Business Insider|access-date=3 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104092707/http://uk.businessinsider.com/china-media-attacks-li-ka-shing-2015-9|archive-date=4 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Security Times'', a ''People's Daily'' publication, estimated that Li has sold at least 73.8&nbsp;billion yuan worth of assets since 2014.<ref name=20150924ejinsight/> Li's holding companies denied divesting in China, saying that its asset disposals were being undertaken in the ordinary course of business.<ref name=nanzao/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ckh.com.hk/upload/attachments/en/pr/e_CKHH_CKPH_Media_Response_20150929.pdf|title=CKHH/CKPH Media Response|date=29 September 2015|access-date=9 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630022156/http://www.ckh.com.hk/upload/attachments/en/pr/e_CKHH_CKPH_Media_Response_20150929.pdf|archive-date=30 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The attacks stopped abruptly several weeks later, when editorials in official publications such as ''People's Daily'', ''Beijing Youth Daily'' took a neutral stance in unison.<ref name=20150924ejinsight/>
