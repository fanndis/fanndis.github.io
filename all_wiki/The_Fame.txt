'''''The Fame''''' is the debut studio album by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released on August 19, 2008, by [[Interscope Records]]. After joining [[Kon Live Distribution]] and [[Cherrytree Records]] in 2008, Gaga began working on the album with different producers, primarily [[RedOne]], [[Martin Kierszenbaum]], and [[Rob Fusari]]. Musically, ''The Fame'' is an [[electropop]], [[synth-pop]], and [[dance-pop]] album that displays influences from 1980s music. Lyrically, it visualizes Gaga's love of fame in general, while also dealing with subjects such as love, sex, money, drugs, and sexual identity. The album was primarily promoted through [[The Fame Ball Tour]] and multiple television appearances, and was reissued as a deluxe edition with ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' on November 18, 2009.

The album received generally favorable reviews from critics, who commended its lyrical content, Gaga's musicianship and vocal ability. It was a commercial success, topping the charts in several countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Poland, and Switzerland. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and also topped the [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart for 110 non-consecutive weeks. ''The Fame'' became the fifth best-selling album of 2009, and has sold over 4.9 million copies in the United States as of January 2019. Combined with ''The Fame Monster'', the album had sold over 15 million copies worldwide as of May 2019.

Gaga promoted the album with many television performances, award shows and also in her first headlining tour, [[The Fame Ball Tour]] in 2009. The first two singles "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" gained international success, topping the charts in several countries worldwide including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The subsequent singles "[[LoveGame]]" and "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" were commercial successes as well, charting within the top-ten of over ten countries worldwide. "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]" had a limited single release, while "[[Beautiful, Dirty, Rich]]" served as a [[promotional single]].

''The Fame'' has won [[List of awards and nominations received by Lady Gaga|multiple awards]] since its release. In the United States, the album was nominated for a total of five [[Grammy Award]]s at the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].

While establishing herself as an artist and working her way up through the New York [[underground music|underground]] club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, ''The Fame''.<ref name="Times Online.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5325327.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1|title=Lady Gaga: the future of pop?|date=December 14, 2008|last=Sharon|first=Kim|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=February 6, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517105424/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5325327.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1|archive-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: "''The Fame'' is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] [[popular culture|Pop culture]] is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over ''The Fame''. But, it's a sharable fame.

It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick [[hook (music)|hook]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-worships-queen-and-refuses-to-wear-pants-20090219|title=Lady Gaga Worships Queen and Refuses to Wear Pants|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=February 19, 2009|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with [[About.com]], that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, "Paparazzi" dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dancemusic.about.com/od/artistshomepages/a/LadyGagaInt_2.htm|title=Lady Gaga Interview|last=Slomowicz|first=Ron|date=June 10, 2008|publisher=[[About.com]]|access-date=April 17, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215104845/http://dancemusic.about.com/od/artistshomepages/a/LadyGagaInt_2.htm|archive-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref>

"[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" was inspired by Gaga's boyfriends who enjoyed gambling, and also dealt with her personal experience of [[bisexuality]]; her fantasies about women while having sex with men, thus representing her 'poker face'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,521190,00.html|title=Lady Gaga Opens Up About Her Preference for Boys That Look Like Girls|last=McKay|first=Hollie|date=May 22, 2009|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|access-date=April 28, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524214330/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C521190%2C00.html|archive-date=May 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/celebrity/Lady_GaGa_Entertains_Thousands_At_Palm_Springs_White_Party.html|title=Lady GaGa Entertains Thousands At Palm Springs White Party|date=April 14, 2009|access-date=April 17, 2009|publisher=[[KNTV|NBC Bay Area]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610231755/http://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/celebrity/Lady_GaGa_Entertains_Thousands_At_Palm_Springs_White_Party.html|archive-date=June 10, 2010}}</ref> "Boys Boys Boys" was inspired by the similarly titled [[Mötley Crüe]] song "[[Girls, Girls, Girls (Mötley Crüe song)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]". Gaga explained that she wanted a female version of the song that rockers would like too.<ref name="Bio" /> "[[Beautiful, Dirty, Rich]]" summed up her time of self-discovery, living in the Lower East Side and dabbling in drugs and the party scene.<ref name="Bio" /> "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]" was about breaking up with a boyfriend and finding someone new.<ref name="Bio" /> "Brown Eyes" was inspired by the British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and, according to Gaga, is the most vulnerable song on the album.<ref name="Bio" />

Gaga further clarified the ideas behind ''The Fame'', and her inspirations and visions for the album. She believed that the most important thing missing from contemporary pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the [[performance art]], which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.<ref name="mtvkids" />
<blockquote>
"I just feel like this record is really different- you[']ve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] ''The Fame'' is not about who you are—it's about how everybody wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record[,] it's a whole pop art movement[.] It's not just about one song."<ref name="mtv_uk" />

<blockquote>
"This idea of ''The Fame'' runs through and through. Basically, if you have nothing—no money, no fame—you can still feel beautiful and dirty rich. It's about making choices, and having references—things you pull from your life that you believe in. It's about self-discovery and being creative. The record is slightly focused, but it's also eclectic.[...] The music is intended to inspire people to feel a certain way about themselves, so they'll be able to encompass, in their own lives, a sense of inner fame that they can project to the world, and the carefree nature of the album is a reflection of that aura. I like to funnel interesting ideas to the rest of the world through a pop lens."<ref name="mtvkids">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589013/20080609/id_0.jhtml|title=Lady GaGa Brings Her Artistic Vision Of Pop Music To New Album – And A New Kids Song|last1=Harris|first1=Chris|first2=Kim|last2=Stolz|date=June 9, 2008|publisher=MTV News|access-date=June 9, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811132149/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589013/20080609/id_0.jhtml|archive-date=August 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The album received further promotion from her first headlining [[concert tour]], [[The Fame Ball Tour]], which started on March 12, 2009 in [[San Diego]], California. It was Gaga's first concert tour with North American shows in March, followed by dates in Oceania and a solo trek through Europe. Dates in Asia soon followed, as well as two performances at England's [[V Festival]] and two shows in North America that had been postponed from April. Gaga described the tour as a traveling museum show incorporating artist [[Andy Warhol]]'s pop-performance art concept.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604302/20090204/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Life-Changing Experience' With Fame Ball Tour|date=February 4, 2009|access-date=February 22, 2009|last=Montgomery|first=James|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207135755/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604302/20090204/lady_gaga.jhtml|archive-date=February 7, 2009}}</ref> Tickets were distributed for charity also.

The show consisted of four segments, with each segment being followed by a video interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from ''The Fame'' only.

==''The Fame Monster''==
{{Main|The Fame Monster}}
''The Fame Monster'' is a [[reissue]] of ''The Fame'', released on November 18, 2009. Initially planned solely as a part of the deluxe edition of ''The Fame'', Interscope later decided to release the eight new songs as a standalone [[extended play|EP]] in some territories. The decision was also due to Gaga believing the re-release was too expensive and that the albums were conceptually different, describing them as [[yin and yang]]. The deluxe edition of the album contains ''The Fame'' in its entirety along with ''The Fame Monster''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626134/20091112/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Is 'Honoring' Fans With Cheaper Fame Monster|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 12, 2009|publisher=MTV News|access-date=November 12, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115104953/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1626134/20091112/lady_gaga.jhtml|archive-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> The album deals with the darker side of [[celebrity|fame]], as experienced by Gaga over the course of 2008–09 while travelling around the world, and are expressed through a [[Paranoia|monster]] metaphor.
