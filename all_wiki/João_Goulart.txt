'''João Belchior Marques Goulart''' (<small>[[Gaúcho dialect|gaúcho]] </small>{{IPA-pt|ʒuˈɐ̃w bew.kiˈɔɾ ˈmarkis ɡuˈlaɾ}}, or {{IPA-pt|ˈʒwɐ̃w bewˈkjɔʁ ˈmaʁkiʒ ɡuːˈlaʁ|}} in the standard [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Fluminense]] dialect; 1 March 1918 – 6 December 1976) was a Brazilian politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of Brazil|24th]] [[president of Brazil]] until a [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|military coup d'état]] deposed him on 1 April 1964. He was considered the last [[left-wing]] president of Brazil until [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] took office in 2003.<ref>Morton, David. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-137012940/looking-lula-brazil-amazon.html "Looking at Lula: Brazil's Amazon deforestation worsens—despite a "Green" president"], ''E Magazine'', 1 September 2005.</ref>

==Name==
João Goulart was nicknamed "'''Jango'''" ({{IPA-pt|ˈʒɐ̃ɡu|}}). The [[Jânio Quadros]]–João Goulart presidential bid was thus called "Jan–Jan" ({{IPA-pt|ʒɐ̃.ʒɐ̃|}}, an amalgamation of Jânio and Jango).

His childhood nickname was "Janguinho" (little Jango), after an uncle named Jango. Years later, when he entered politics, he was supported and advised by [[Getúlio Vargas]], and his friends and colleagues started to call him Jango.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

His grandfather, Belchior Rodrigues Goulart, descended from [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese immigrants]] from the [[Azores]] who arrived in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] in the second half of the 18th century. There were at least three immigrants with the surname Govaert (latter adapted to Goulart or Gularte in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) of [[Flanders|Flemish]]-[[Azores|Azorean]] origins in the group of first Azoreans established in the state.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Early life==
Goulart was born at Yguariaçá Farm, in [[Itacurubi]], [[São Borja, Rio Grande do Sul]], on 1 March 1918. His parents were Vicentina Marques Goulart, a [[housewife]], and Vicente Rodrigues Goulart, an [[estancia|estancieiro]] (a rancher who owned large rural properties) who had been a National Guard colonel fighting on the side of Governor [[Borges de Medeiros]] during the [[Rio Grande do Sul#1923 Revolution|1923 Revolution]]. Most sources indicate that João was born in 1918, but his birth year is actually 1919; his father ordered a second [[birth certificate]] adding a year to his son's age so that he could attend the law school at the [[Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul]].<ref>{{cite book|page=185|title=Famous Assassinations in World History: An Encyclopedia [2 volumes]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4-dAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA185|via=Google Books|year=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1610692861|author=Michael Newton}}</ref>

Yguariaçá Farm was isolated and his mother had no medical care at his birth, only the assistance of her mother, Maria Thomaz Vasquez Marques. According to João's sister Yolanda, "my grandmother was the one able to revive little João who, at birth, already looked like he was dying." Like most Azorean descendants, Maria Thomaz was a devout Catholic. While trying to revive her grandson, warming him, she prayed to [[John the Baptist]], promising that if the newborn survived, he would be his namesake and would not cut his hair until the age of three, when he would march in the [[procession]] of 24 June dressed as the saint.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

João grew up as a skinny boy in Yguariaçá along with his five sisters, Eufrides, Maria, Yolanda, Cila, and Neuza. Both of his younger brothers died prematurely. Rivadávia (born 1920) died six months after birth, and Ivan (born 1925), to whom he was deeply attached, died of [[leukemia]] at 33.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

João left for the nearby town of [[Itaqui]] to study because his father Vicente wished to form a partnership with Protásio Vargas, [[Getúlio Vargas|Getúlio]]'s brother, after both [[leasing|leased]] a small refrigerator house in Itaqui from an English businessman. While Vicente ran the business for the following years, João attended the School of the [[Teresian Sisters of Mary]], along with his sisters. Although it was a [[mixed-sex education|mixed-sex school]] during the day, he could not stay overnight at the [[boarding school]] with his sisters; he had to sleep at the house of a friend of his father. It was in Itaqui that João developed a taste for both football and swimming.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Upon his return to São Borja, ending his experience as a partner in the refrigerator house, Vicente sent João to the Ginásio Santana, run by the [[Marist Brothers]] in [[Uruguaiana]]. João attended first to fourth grade in the Santana boarding school, but failed to be approved for the fifth grade in 1931. Angry with his son's poor achievements at school, Vicente sent him to attend the Colégio Anchieta in [[Porto Alegre]]. In the state capital, João lived at a [[Pension (lodging)|pension]] with friends Almir Palmeiro and Abadé dos Santos Ayub, the latter of whom was very attached to him.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Aware of João's [[association football|football]] skills at school, where he played the [[Defender (association football)|right-back position]], Almir and Abadé convinced him to try out for [[Sport Club Internacional]]. João was selected for the club's juvenile team. In 1932, he became a juvenile state champion. That same year, he finished the third grade of the ginásio (high school) at Colégio Anchieta, with an irregular academic record that would be repeated when he attended the law school at Rio Grande do Sul Federal University. João graduated from high school at Ginásio Santana after being sent back to Uruguaiana.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Political career==
Sent back to Porto Alegre after graduating from high school, Jango attended law school to satisfy his father, who desired that he earn a degree.{{Citation needed|reason=Is this opinion?|date=September 2013}} While there, Jango restored contact with his youth friends Abadé Ayub and Salvador Arísio, and made new friends and explored the state capital's nightlife. It was during that time of a [[Bohemian style|bohemian lifestyle]] that Jango acquired a [[venereal disease]],<ref>{{YouTube|ybECg69uZnI|''Jango em 3 atos'' (first part)}}. Documentary by João Vicente Goulart aired on [[TV Senado]].</ref> which paralyzed his left knee almost entirely. His family paid for expensive medical treatment, including a trip to [[São Paulo]], but he expected that he would never walk normally again.{{Citation needed|reason=Is this opinion?|date=September 2013}} Because of the paralysis of his knee, Jango graduated separately from the rest of his class in 1939. He would never fully practice law.

After graduating, Jango returned to São Borja. {{According to whom|His depression because of the leg problem was visible.|date=September 2013}} He isolated himself at Yguariaçá Farm. According to his sister Yolanda, his depression did not last long. In the early 1940s, he decided to make fun of his own walking disability in the [[Carnival]], participating in the parade of the block Comigo Ninguém Pode.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Beginning at PTB===
Jango's father died in 1943, and he inherited rural properties that made him one of the most influential ''estancieiros'' of the region. Upon the resignation of President [[Getúlio Vargas]] and his return to São Borja in October 1945, Jango was already a wealthy man. He did not need to enter politics to rise socially, but the frequent meetings with Vargas, a close friend of his father, were decisive in Jango's pursuit of a public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The first invitation Jango received to enter a political party was made by Protásio Vargas, Getúlio's brother, who was in charge of organizing the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]] (Partido Social Democrático – PSD) in São Borja. Jango declined but later accepted Getúlio's invitation to join the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro – PTB). He was the first president of the local PTB, and would later become the statewide, then national, president of the party.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1947, Getúlio convinced Jango to run for a seat in the [[state assembly]]. He was elected with 4,150 votes, becoming the fifth-most of 23 deputies. He received more votes than had his future brother-in-law [[Leonel Brizola]], another rising star of the PTB, who was married to Jango's sister Neusa until her death in 1993. Jango was not an active member of the assembly but fought for the right of the needy to buy cheaper food.{{Clarify|reason=Cheaper food, or just the ability to afford food?|date=September 2013}} He soon became a confidant and political protégé of Vargas, becoming one of the party members who most insistently urged him to launch a presidential candidacy for the [[1950 Brazilian general election|1950 elections]]. On 19 April 1949, Jango launched Getúlio's candidacy for president at a birthday party held for the former president at Granja São Vicente, which was owned by Goulart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1950, Goulart was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]. He received 39,832 votes, second-most in the PTB in Rio Grande do Sul, and took office as a deputy in February 1951. He soon became secretary of the interior and a justice in the administration of Governor Ernesto Dornelles. During his time as secretary, which lasted until 24 March 1952, Jango restructured the [[prison system]] to improve the living conditions of prisoners. He later resigned his job as secretary, at the request of Vargas, to help the president with a political deadlock at the ministry of labor, using his influence on the labor-union movement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Minister of Labor===
In 1953, after becoming aggravated with the deadlock, Vargas appointed Jango minister of labor. The Vargas administration was in a deep crisis; the workers, unsatisfied with their low wages, were promoting strikes, and the right-wing party [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]] (União Democrática Nacional – UDN) was mobilizing a [[coup d'état]] among the mass media, the [[upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and the [[Military of Brazil|military forces]]. As he took office, Jango replied to accusations from several newspapers, including [[The New York Times|the ''New York Times'']]. As minister of labor, Goulart held the first Brazilian Congress of Social Security. He signed a series of decrees favoring [[social security]], such as housing financing, regulation of loans by the Institute of Retirement and Pensions of Bank Employees (Instituto de Aposentadoria e Pensões dos Bancários – IAPB), and recognizing the employees of the Audit Committee of the Institute of Retirement and Pensions of Industry Employees (Conselho Fiscal do Instituto de Aposentadoria e Pensões dos Industriários).{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In January 1954, Jango began studies for review of the [[minimum wage]], facing two types of pressure: the mobilization of workers in larger cities to claim a readjustment of 100% that would increase the minimum wage from [[Brazilian cruzeiro|Cr$]] 1,200.00 to Cr$2,400.00, and entrepreneurs' refusal to review the policy since the [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]] administration, which allegedly contributed to the impoverishment of several segments of the Brazilian society. The business community said that it would agree to a 42% raise in the minimum wage to match the cost of living in 1951. On May Day, Vargas signed the new minimum wage into law, which was a 100% increase as demanded by the working class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Jango resigned as labor minister in February 1954, passing the job to his legal substitute{{clarify|date=April 2017}} Hugo de Faria, and resumed his term as a deputy, as a result of the strong reaction of the media and military against the new minimum wage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The political crisis of the Vargas administration deepened after one of his bodyguards was involved in an assassination attempt against UDN leader [[Carlos Lacerda]] on 5 August 1954. Vargas was put under pressure by the media, which demanded his resignation. On 24 August 1954 at 1&nbsp;a.m., Vargas called Jango to [[Catete Palace]] and handed him a document to be read only after he arrived back in Rio Grande do Sul. It was his [[suicide letter]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Vice President===
[[File:Posse de Juscelino Kubitschek como Presidente da República e de João Goulart como Vice.tif|thumb|left|Vice President Goulart (right) at the inauguration of [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] on 31 January 1956.]]
After Vargas' suicide, Jango thought about leaving politics forever. However, at the president's burial on 26 August 1954, he seemed to have given up the idea, declaring that "we, within the law and order, we'll know how to fight with patriotism and dignity, inspired by the example that you [Vargas] left us."{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In October 1954, elections were held for the [[Federal Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]], the Chamber of Deputies, state governments, and state assemblies. The second half of the year started off with uncertainties for the PTB and its allies. Emotionally and politically shaken by attacks made by Vargas' rivals, Jango departed from political activities for a few weeks. He only returned after a series of meetings with PTB leaders in Rio Grande do Sul. By the end of these meetings, it was decided that Jango would run for the Senate. However, both Jango and fellow PTB leader Ruy Ramos (two seats were being contested) were defeated. The PTB also lost the gubernatorial election in Rio Grande do Sul, although it was able to elect a large number of deputies in both the State Assembly and Chamber of Deputies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In November 1954, the PTB and PSD began to discuss an electoral coalition for the 1955 elections. [[Minas Gerais]] governor [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was PSD's choice for the Presidency. On 7 November, Kubitschek gave an interview suggesting a coalition between the two parties. His candidacy was approved by the Minas Gerais branch of the party at the end of November. After this, discussions took place regarding the selection of his vice-presidential candidate. After troubled negotiations, João Goulart, whom he had initially proposed,{{Clarify|reason=Who is "he" in this sentence?|date=September 2013}} was chosen. The PSD National Convention was held on 10 February 1955, with the confirmation of Kubitschek as the party's presidential candidate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Meanwhile, Vargas' vice president [[Café Filho]] formed a government with several UDN ministers, which impeded governance, and proved himself uncommitted with the latter President's{{Clarify|reason=Who is this referring to?|date=September 2013}} government plans. In December 1954, [[Juarez Távora]], his chief of military staff, threatened to veto Jango as a vice-presidential candidate. In April 1955, the National Directory of PSD accepted the nomination of Jango, and in the same month, the alliance was approved by the PTB National Convention. The candidacy was ready but vulnerable to new vetoes of Jango in the military and among dissident leaders of PSD.{{Clarify|reason=This needs clarification. Are both the Military and dissident leaders of PSD vetoing Jango's candidacy?|date=September 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

After the PTB National Convention, a letter from [[Brazilian Communist Party]] (Partido Comunista Brasileiro – PCB) leader [[Luiz Carlos Prestes]] to Jango was published in the press. In the letter, Prestes suggested that PTB and PCB could work together for the benefit of the Brazilian population. That was enough to intensify the actions of those plotting a coup. In addition to the smear campaign run by Carlos Lacerda in his newspaper ''Tribuna da Imprensa'' and the usual plotting inside the military, April ended with a statement by former president Dutra in ''[[O Globo]]'' opposing Jango's candidacy. From the institutional point of view, the crisis did not have major repercussions, and the PSD ratified its support for Goulart as Kubitschek's running mate at a convention in June, even with the dissent of the party in Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Pernambuco.

In 1956, Goulart was elected vice president, as the [[running mate]] of president Kubitschek. Goulart was re-elected vice president in 1960. As vice president, he also served as [[President of the Federal Senate (Brazil)|president of the Senate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www25.senado.leg.br/web/senadores/pos-1930|title=Pós-1930 - Senado Federal|website=www25.senado.leg.br}}</ref> However, the 1960 election gave the presidency to [[Jânio Quadros]], a member of a different party. At the time, Brazilians could vote for different tickets for president and vice president. Quadros resigned in 1961 because he no longer had a majority in the [[National Congress of Brazil]].

==The Goulart administration==
[[File:Kennedy and Goulart review troops 1962.jpg|thumb|250px|Goulart with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] during a visit to the United States in April 1962.]]
Goulart was out of the country on a state visit to China when Quadros resigned. Several political and military elements thought Goulart was too radical for the presidency. They objected to his left-wing tendencies, his nationalist policies, and his willingness to seek closer relations with Communist countries. These elements called for the vice presidency to be declared vacant so new elections could be held.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Congress was initially reluctant to recognize Goulart as president. He returned to Brazil a few days after Quadros' resignation, insisting he was already president. A compromise was agreed upon, thanks to [[Leonel Brizola]] and the "cadeia de legalidade" (chain of legality), and Goulart was able to take the presidency, but with his powers constrained by a [[parliamentarism|parliamentary]] system of government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A constitutional amendment was accordingly passed which transferred most of the president's powers to the newly created post of [[prime minister]]. Only after this amendment was Goulart allowed to take the oath of office as president, to serve as [[head of state]] only. Goulart nominated [[Tancredo Neves]] as prime minister.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

During this period, Goulart and his prime minister chose the three-year plan as the economic plan of his government under the advisement of [[Celso Furtado]], his minister of planning. In order to strengthen the energy sector and to foster Brazilian development, [[Eletrobrás]], Latin America's largest power utility company, was created in 1962.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

As part of the compromise that installed a parliamentary system of government in 1961, a [[1963 Brazilian constitutional referendum|plebiscite]] was set for 1963 to confirm or reverse the changes made to the constitution. The parliamentary system of government was overwhelmingly rejected in the referendum, and Goulart assumed full presidential powers.<ref>[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=br011963 Brazil, 6 January 1963: Parliamentary system] Direct Democracy {{in lang|de}}</ref>

The presidential government of Goulart initiated in 1963 was marked politically by the administration's closer ties to [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] political groups, and conflict with more conservative sectors of the society, specifically the National Democratic Union.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Goulart also led Brazil in the drive for a nuclear-free Latin America, providing the impetus for the Five Presidents' Declaration and the [[Treaty of Tlatelolco]]. Brazil's leadership on nuclear disarmament was a casualty of the military coup, and Mexico eventually stepped in to continue to drive for a nuclear-free region.<ref>Hugh B. Stinson and James D. Cochrane, "The Movement for Regional Arms Control in Latin America", ''Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs'', Vol. 13, No. 1 (1971): 1–17.</ref>
[[File:João Goulart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Goulart during a [[ticker tape parade]] in [[New York City]], 1962.]]

===Basic reforms===
Goulart's Basic Reforms plan (''Reformas de Base'') was a group of social and economic measures of nationalist character that ushered in a greater [[state intervention]] in the economy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Among the reforms were:

* Education reform to combat [[illiteracy|adult illiteracy]], with the widespread use of the pioneering teachings and method of [[Paulo Freire]]. The government also proposed to hold a university reform and prohibited the operation of private schools. Fifteen percent of Brazil's income would be directed to education.
* Tax reform to control the transfer of profits by multinational companies with headquarters abroad, instead reinvesting profits in Brazil. The [[income tax]] would be proportional to personal profit.
* Electoral reform to extend voting rights to illiterate people and low-ranking military officers.
* [[Land reform]] to expropriate and redistribute non-productive properties larger than 600 hectares to the population. At that time, the agricultural population was larger than the urban population.

==The military coup==

{{main|1964 Brazilian coup d'état}}
[[File:João Goulart e Maria Thereza Goulart no Comício da Central?.tif|thumb|Goulart and his wife [[Maria Teresa Fontela Goulart|Maria Teresa]] during the March 13, 1964 speech]]
In the early hours of 31 March 1964, General [[Olímpio Mourão Filho]], in charge of the 4th Military Region, headquartered in [[Juiz de Fora]], Minas Gerais, ordered his troops to start moving toward Rio de Janeiro to depose Goulart.<ref>[http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jgoulart/htm/biografias/Olimpio_Mourao_Filho.asp Olímpio Mourão Filho] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317124815/http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/nav_jgoulart/htm/biografias/Olimpio_Mourao_Filho.asp |date=17 March 2009 }} Fundação Getúlio Vargas: Centro de Pesquisa e Documentação de História Contemporânea do Brasil. Retrieved on 20 August 2007.</ref>

On 1 April, at 12:45&nbsp;p.m., João Goulart left Rio for the capital, [[Brasília]], in an attempt to stop the coup politically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |authorlink=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=103}}</ref> When he reached Brasília, Goulart realized that he lacked any political support. The Senate president, Auro Moura Andrade, was already calling for congressional support of the coup. Goulart stayed for a short time in Brasília, gathering his wife and two children, and flying to Porto Alegre in an [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]] [[Avro 748]] aircraft. Soon after Goulart's plane took off, Auro Moura Andrade declared the position of President of Brazil "vacant".<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |authorlink=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=111}}</ref>

In the first hours of 2 April, Auro Moura de Andrade, along with the president of the [[Supreme Federal Court]], swore in [[Pascoal Ranieri Mazzilli]], the speaker of the house, as president. This move was arguably unconstitutional at the time, as João Goulart was still in the country.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |authorlink=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=112}}</ref>

At the same time, Goulart, now in the headquarters of the 3rd Army in Porto Alegre, still loyal to him at the time, contemplated resistance and counter-moves with Leonel Brizola, who argued for armed resistance. In the morning, General Floriano Machado informed the president that troops loyal to the coup were moving from Curitiba to Porto Alegre and that he had to leave the country, otherwise risking arrest. At 11:45&nbsp;am, Goulart boarded a [[Douglas C-47]] transport for his farm bordering [[Uruguay]]. Goulart would stay on his farmland until 4 April, when he finally boarded the plane for the last time, heading for [[Montevideo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |authorlink=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=113}}</ref>

The coup installed successive right-wing hardliners as heads of state who suspended [[civil rights]] and liberties of the Brazilian people.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |authorlink=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5}}</ref> They abolished all political parties and replaced them with only two, the military government's party called the [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (Aliança Renovadora Nacional – ARENA) and the consented opposition [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro – MDB). The MDB, however, had no real power, and the military rule was marked by widespread disappearance, torture, and exile of many politicians, university students, writers, singers, painters, filmmakers, and other artists.

President João Goulart was not favorably viewed in Washington. He took an independent stance in foreign policy, resuming relations with socialist countries and opposing sanctions against Cuba; his administration passed a law limiting the amount of profits multinationals could transmit outside the country; a subsidiary of [[ITT Inc.|ITT]] was nationalized; he promoted economic and social reforms.

[[Lincoln Gordon]] served as [[United States Ambassador to Brazil|U.S. Ambassador to Brazil]] (1961–66), where he played a major role for the support of the opposition against the government of President João Goulart and during the 1964 Brazilian ''coup d'état''. On 27 March 1964, he wrote a [[top secret]] cable to the US government, urging it to support the coup of Humberto de Alencar Castello Branco with a "clandestine delivery of arms" and shipments of gas and oil, to possibly be supplemented by [[CIA]] covert operations. Gordon believed that Goulart, wanting to "seize dictatorial power," was working with the Brazilian Communist Party. Gordon wrote: "If our influence is to be brought to bear to help avert a major disaster here--which might make Brazil the China of the 1960s--this is where both I and all my senior advisors believe our support should be placed." In the years after the coup, Gordon, Gordon's staff, and the CIA repeatedly denied that they had been involved, and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] praised Gordon's service in Brazil as "a rare combination of experience and scholarship, idealism and practical judgment." In 1976, Gordon stated that the Johnson Administration "had been prepared to intervene militarily to prevent a leftist takeover of the government," but did not directly state that it had or had not intervened.

Circa 2004 many documents were declassified and placed online at the GWU National Security Archive, indicating the involvement of Johnson, McNamara, Gordon, and others. In 2005, [[Stansfield Turner]]'s book described the involvement of ITT Corporation president [[Harold Geneen]] and CIA Director John McCone. [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was uneasy about Goulart allowing "communists" to hold positions in government agencies. US President Lyndon Johnson and his Defense Secretary [[Robert S. McNamara]] were also worried.<ref name=turgwu/> Kennedy, who had made plans for the coup when his brother John was President, characterized Goulart as a "wily" politician in a White House tape.<ref name=brazilkennedy>https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/</ref>

The president of [[ITT Corporation|ITT]], Harold Geneen, was a friend of the [[Director of Central Intelligence]], John McCone. Between 1961 and 1964,<ref name=brazilkennedy /> the CIA performed [[Psychological warfare|psyops]] against Goulart, performed [[character assassination]], pumped money into opposition groups, and enlisted the help of the [[Agency for International Development]] and the [[AFL-CIO]].<ref name=turgwu>''Burn Before Reading'', Admiral Stansfield Turner, 2005, Hyperion, pg. 99.

==Life in exile==
[[File:João Goulart 1964.jpg|thumb|left|João Goulart in 1964]]
On 4 April 1964, Jango and his family landed in [[Uruguay]] seeking [[political asylum]]. After his first years in [[Montevideo]], he bought a farm on the Uruguay-Brazil border, where he devoted himself to farming cattle. In 1966 he took part in the [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Frente Ampla]] (''Broad Front'') political movement, which aimed to fully restore democratic rule in Brazil through peaceful means. The end of Frente Ampla also resulted in the end of Jango's political activity. He decided to focus on managing his farms located in Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In late 1973, Argentine president [[Juan Domingo Perón]] invited Jango to live in [[Buenos Aires]] and asked him to collaborate on a plan to expand Argentine meat exports to Europe and other markets that would not traditionally buy the Argentine commodity. However, Perón's minister of social welfare and private secretary [[José López Rega]] opposed the designation. Nevertheless, Jango decided to stay in Buenos Aires.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In March 1976 in the town of [[La Plata]], the [[Argentine Army]] dismantled a group of right-wing terrorists planning to kidnap Jango's son and demand a high ransom in cash. With his personal security compromised, the former president distanced himself from Buenos Aires. This experience led Jango to arrange new steps for his safe return to Brazil. However, this was delayed because of upcoming elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Death==
On 6 December 1976, Goulart died in his apartment La Villa, in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] municipality of [[Mercedes, Corrientes|Mercedes]], province of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], supposedly of a heart attack. Since Goulart's body was not submitted to an [[autopsy]], the cause of his death is unconfirmed. Around 30,000 people attended his funeral service, which was censored from press coverage by the military dictatorship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On 26 April 2000, the former governor of Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro, [[Leonel Brizola]], said that former presidents Goulart and Kubitschek were assassinated as part of [[Operation Condor]] and requested investigations into their deaths.<ref>[http://www1.elmostrador.cl/modulos/noticias/constructor/noticia_impresion.asp?id_noticia=3317 ''Brasil examina su pasado represivo en la Operación Cóndor''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020821/http://www1.elmostrador.cl/modulos/noticias/constructor/noticia_impresion.asp?id_noticia=3317 |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''El Mostrador'', 11 May 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2000/05/06/i-03702.htm ''Operación Cóndor: presión de Brizola sobre la Argentina''], ''El Clarín'', 6 May 2000</ref>

On 27 January 2008, the newspaper ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' printed a story with a statement from Mario Neira Barreiro, a former intelligence service member under Uruguay's dictatorship. Barreiro said that Goulart was poisoned, confirming Brizola's allegations. Barreiro also said that the order to assassinate Goulart came from [[Sérgio Paranhos Fleury]], head of the Departamento de Ordem Política e Social (Department of Political and Social Order), and the [[licence to kill (concept)|license to kill]] came from president [[Ernesto Geisel]].<ref>[http://www.cartamaior.com.br/templates/materiaMostrar.cfm?materia_id=15129 Há fortes indícios de que Jango foi assassinado com conhecimento de Geisel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702182424/http://www.cartamaior.com.br/templates/materiaMostrar.cfm?materia_id=15129 |date=2 July 2011 }}.

In March 2009, the magazine ''[[CartaCapital]]'' published previously unreleased documents of the [[National Intelligence Service of Brazil|National Intelligence Service]], created by an undercover agent who was present at Jango's properties in Uruguay. This revelation reinforces the theory that the former president was poisoned. The Goulart family has not yet identified who could be the "B Agent" that is mentioned in the documents. The agent acted as a close friend to Jango and described in detail an argument during the former president's 56th birthday party with his son stemming from a fight between two employees.<ref>NASCIMENTO, Gilberto. "[http://www.cartacapital.com.br/app/materia.jsp?a=2&a2=8&i=3605 Jango assassinado?]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}".

Later, ''CartaCapital'' published an interview with Jango's widow, [[Maria Teresa Fontela Goulart]], who revealed documents from the Uruguayan government that documented her complaints that her family was being monitored. The Uruguayan government was monitoring Jango's travel and his business and political activities. These files were from 1965, a year after the coup in Brazil, and suggest that he could have been deliberately attacked. The Movement for Justice and Human Rights and the President João Goulart Institute have requested a document in which the Uruguayan interior ministry said that "serious and responsible Brazilian sources" talked about an "alleged plot against the former Brazilian president."<ref>NASCIMENTO, Gilberto.

==Political views==

===Afro-Brazilians===
Closeness to poor people, especially poor [[Afro-Brazilians]], was a normal behavior for the young Jango. The main leader of his Carnival block ''Comigo Ninguém Pode'', [[mãe-de-santo]] Jorgina Vieira, declared in an interview with the newspaper ''Zero Hora'' that Jango was one of the only white boys of São Borja to be a member of the block. In a particular Carnival celebration in the 1940s, he broke the [[High society (group)|high society]] rules and led the block inside the aristocratic Clube Comercial, which would not allow blacks in their halls until the late 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Communism===
Like many other leftist politicians of the [[Cold War]] era, Jango was accused of being a communist at various times. As a response to Carlos Lacerda, his most frequent accuser, he cited right-wing politicians also supported by the Brazilian Communist Party whom the latter{{Clarify|reason=Does this refer to Carlos Lacerda?|date=September 2013}} would not criticize. In an interview with the newspaper ''O Jornal'', Jango declared: "regarding the communists, they have supported indistinctly candidates of several political affiliations, conservatives or populists. I do not wish to distinguish such support, but I will only allow myself this question: is perhaps Colonel Virgílio Távora a communist, just because, ostensibly, he accepts the support of communists in Ceará? How to say that the illustrious patriot of UDN Milton Campos is communist, for accepting, as he did in Minas, the same votes requested by Mr. [[Afonso Arinos]] here in Rio?"{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Tributes and amnesty==
In 1984, exactly twenty years after the coup, filmmaker [[Sílvio Tendler]] directed a documentary chronicling Jango's political career through archive footage and interviews with influential politicians. ''[[Jango (film)|Jango]]'' was viewed in theaters by over half a million people, becoming the sixth-largest grossing Brazilian documentary. It was critically acclaimed, receiving three awards at the [[Gramado Film Festival]] and one at the [[Havana Film Festival]], as well as the Silver Daisy, given by the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops (Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil).{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

There are at least ten schools throughout Brazil named after Goulart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Most are located on [[Rio Grande do Sul]], in the municipalities of [[Alvorada]], [[Ijuí]], [[Novo Hamburgo]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Viamão]], and in Jango's native [[São Borja]]. There are three schools named after Jango in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Balneário Camboriú]] and Santa Catarina, and another in [[São João de Meriti]] in Rio de Janeiro. On 6 December 2007, exactly 31 years after Goulart's death, a monument was erected in Balneário Camboriú depicting Jango sitting on a bench on the Avenida Atlântica (in front of the Atlantic Ocean) with his two children. It was designed by artist Jorge Schroder upon the request of mayor Rubens Spernau.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On 28 June 2008, the Avenida Presidente João Goulart (President João Goulart Avenue) in [[Osasco]] was inaugurated in São Paulo.<ref>[http://www.osascoagora.com.br/geral/avenida-presidente-joao-goulart-projeta-osasco-para-o-futuro/ "Avenida Presidente João Goulart projeta Osasco para o futuro"] {{in lang|pt}}, ''Osasco Agora'', 2 July 2008.</ref> The boulevard is about 760&nbsp;meters long and is the first of the city with a [[bicycle path]]. Other cities, such as [[Canoas]], [[Caxias do Sul]], [[Cuiabá]], [[Lages]], [[Pelotas]], Porto Alegre, [[Porto Velho]], [[Ribeirão Preto]], Rio de Janeiro, [[Rondonópolis]], São Borja, [[São Leopoldo]], São Paulo, and [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] already have roads honoring Jango.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On 15 November 2008, Jango and his widow Maria Teresa received political [[amnesty]] from the [[Government of Brazil|federal government]] at the 20th National Congress of Lawyers in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte]]. The former First Lady received a [[restitution]] of [[Brazilian real|R$]] 644,000 (around US$322,000) to be paid in pensions of R$5,425 (around US$2,712) per month for Jango having been restrained from practicing as a lawyer. She also received a restitution of R$100,000 (around US$50,000) for the 15&nbsp;years in which her family was forbidden to return to Brazil.<ref>Aquino, Yara.
