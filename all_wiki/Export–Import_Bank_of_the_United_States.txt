Founded in 1934, the Export–Import Bank was established by an [[executive order]] organized by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] under the name Export–Import Bank of Washington. The stated goal was "to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities between the United States and other Nations or the agencies or nationals thereof." The Bank's first transaction was a $3.8 million loan to Cuba in 1935 for the purchase of U.S. silver ingots.

The Export–Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is a government agency that provides a variety of tools intended to aid the export of American goods and services. The mission of the Bank is to create and sustain U.S. jobs by financing sales of U.S. exports to international buyers. EXIM equips U.S exporters and their customers with tools such as buyer financing, export credit insurance, and access to working capital. Second, when U.S exporters face foreign competition backed by other governments, EXIM provides buyer financing to match or counter the financing offered by almost 96 ECAs around the world. The Bank is chartered as a government corporation by the Congress of the United States; it was last chartered for a three-year term in 2012. The Charter details the Bank's authorities and limitations. Among them is the principle that EXIM does not compete with private sector lenders, but rather provides financing for transactions that would otherwise not occur because commercial lenders are either unable or unwilling to accept the political or commercial risk inherent in the deal.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Export–Import Bank Reauthorization of 2012|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ122/pdf/PLAW-112publ122.pdf|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States|title=The Charter of the Export–Import Bank of the United States|url=http://www.exim.gov/about/whoweare/charterbylaws/upload/Updated_2012_EXIM_Charter_August_2012_Final.pdf|accessdate=June 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818004815/http://www.exim.gov/about/whoweare/charterbylaws/upload/Updated_2012_EXIM_Charter_August_2012_Final.pdf|archive-date=August 18, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The EXIM's products are intended to assist export sales for any American export company regardless of size. The bank's charter provides that EXIM makes available "not less than 20%" of its lending authority to small businesses although they have often fallen short of the 20% threshold.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Assessing Reform at the Export–Import Bank|date=June 13, 2013|url=http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/113-30.pdf|accessdate=May 22, 2014|format=Congressional Hearing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States|title=Charter of the Export–Import Bank of the United States Sec.2(b)(1)(E)(v)|url=http://www.exim.gov/about/whoweare/charterbylaws/upload/Updated_2012_EXIM_Charter_August_2012_Final.pdf|accessdate=June 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818004815/http://www.exim.gov/about/whoweare/charterbylaws/upload/Updated_2012_EXIM_Charter_August_2012_Final.pdf|archive-date=August 18, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In fiscal year 2013 however, 76% of the value of loans and guarantees went to the top 10 recipients.<ref name="Mercatus EXIM Beneficiaries">{{cite web|title=The Biggest Beneficiaries of the EXIM|url=http://mercatus.org/publication/biggest-beneficiaries-ex-im-bank?429141155=|publisher=Mercatus Center|accessdate=May 22, 2013|author=Veronique De Rugy}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early history (1934–1944) ===
EXIM was organized originally as a [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] banking corporation by [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14772 Executive Order 6581] from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on February 2, 1934, under the name '''Export–Import Bank of Washington'''. The stated goal was "to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities between the United States and other Nations or the agencies or nationals thereof", with the immediate goal of making loans to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and Latin America. Roosevelt created a Second Export–Import Bank of Washington with Executive Order 6638 on March 9, 1934, with the specific goal of aiding trade with Cuba.<ref>[[s:Author:Franklin Delano Roosevelt/Executive orders]]</ref> The Bank's first transaction was a $3.8 million loan to [[Cuba]] in 1935 for the purchase of U.S. [[silver]] [[ingot]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exim.gov/news/reporter.cfm|title=A Reporter's Guide To EXIM|accessdate=November 15, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715214045/http://www.exim.gov/news/reporter.cfm|archive-date=July 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The First and Second Export–Import Banks were combined in 1936 when Congress transferred the obligations of the Second Export–Import Bank to the first.<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=William |last2=McClenahan |first2=William|title=The Market, the State, and the Export–Import Bank of the United States|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=10–40}}</ref> Congress continued the bank as a government agency, using a series of laws between 1935 and 1943 to make it subordinate to various government departments.

=== Independent agency (1945–present) ===
Congress made the bank an independent agency on July 31, 1945, with the Export–Import Bank Act of 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/archival/1341/item/457094|title=Public Law 79-173, 79th Congress, H.

== Projects assisted ==
=== Pan-American Highway ===
The [[Pan-American Highway]] runs from Alaska to Chile through 14 countries with important transportation links to nearly all of continental Latin America. The highway was constructed beginning in 1936 with the last phase complete in 1980.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Jesse |last2=Angly |first2=Edward |title=Fifty Billion Dollars: My Thirteen Years with the RFC (1932–1945|year=1951|publisher=MacMillan Company|location=New York|page=220}}</ref>

EXIM Bank credits and loans supported construction of the Pan-American Highway in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Annual Report to Congress 1941|year=1941|location=Washington, D.C}}</ref> In Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia EXIM supported construction of highway spurs connected to the Pan-American Highway.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Export–Import Bank Annual Reports to Congress, 1936–1961}}</ref> EXIM approved twenty credits to U.S. companies including Caterpillar, Koehring Co., Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing, The Galion Iron Works, and Thew Shovel to help build the highway.<ref>{{cite journal |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Export–Import Bank of the United States Annual Reports to Congress, 1936–1961}}</ref>

=== Burma Road ===
Constructed between 1937 and 1938, the 717-mile [[Burma Road]] links Lashio in present-day Myanmar (previously Burma) to Kunming in Yunnan Province, China.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Burma Road|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/85526/Burma-Road|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref> Construction of the road began in 1937 at the start of the second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). With Japan able to control port access in China and most of Southeast Asia, the Chinese built a road that would allow transportation of men and goods from a railhead at Rangoon that had access to Burma's ports. From 1939 to 1942 the Burma Road served as a lifeline for military goods and support in the fight against the Japanese in the Far East.

The $25 million credit approved by EXIM in December 1938 was crucial in ensuring that the supply route remained open by providing the transportation vehicles and support material to operate the new road and by providing China with purchasing power during WWII. An additional $20 million to the Universal Trading Corporation was approved in 1940.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States|title=First Semiannual Report to Congress for the period July–December 1945|year=1946|location=Washington, D.C|pages=48–49}}</ref> A 1939 journal article in Foreign Affairs noted that China used part of the $25 million to purchase 2,000 three-ton trucks from Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mallory|first=Walter|title=The Burma Road|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/69903/walter-h-mallory/the-burma-road|accessdate=June 10, 2013|newspaper=Foreign Affairs|date=April 1939}}</ref>

=== Post-WWII reconstruction and the Marshall Plan ===
EXIM played a critical role during the years between the end of [[Lend-Lease]] (September 1945) and the beginning of the Marshall Plan and the World Bank's first authorizations (May 1947–1948). At the end of WWII, it was recognized that the U.S. did not have a credit facility capable of handling the demand that would result from the cessation of hostilities. One of the major rationales behind the Export–Import Bank Act of 1945, the basis of EXIM's current charter document, was the necessity to dramatically increase EXIM's lending capacity to adequately respond to Europe's post-war reconstruction needs. The 1945 EXIM Annual Report predicated EXIM's role in the immediate post-WWII period: "the Export–Import Bank was to be the principal source of long-term dollar loans for an extended period of time." This assertion was based on the lack of interest by private capital in lending to foreign government buyers and delays in ratification of the Articles of Agreement for the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=First Semiannual Report to Congress for the period July–December 1945|year=1946|location=Washington, D.C |page=10}}</ref> The Export–Import Bank Act of 1945 increased lending authority from $750 million to $3.5 billion, almost a fourfold increase to help address these shortfalls.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Export–Import Bank Act of 1945, P.L. 79-173 STAT 526}}</ref>

In 1945 and 1946 credit was offered to France, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Italy, Ethiopia, Greece, Poland and Austria to purchase equipment, facilities, and services from the United States. The financing was designed to aid reconstruction of the nations and to repair their import and export capability through the purchase of new machinery, currency exchange, and improvements and repairs to infrastructure and transportation systems.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Seventh Semiannual Report to Congress for the period July–December 1948|year=1949|location=Washington, D.C|pages=32–33}}</ref>

When the [[Marshall Plan]] was initiated in 1948, EXIM concentrated its lending on non-Economic Recovery Act nations in North and South America.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Seventh Semiannual Report to Congress for the period July–December 1948|year=1949|location=Washington, D.C|page=2}}</ref>

=== First credits to post-Soviet nations ===
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the USSR was dissolved in 1991, U.S. companies were able to conduct business freely with Eastern Europe for the first time since the end of WWII. EXIM was one of the first financial institutions to provide financing for exports to the former Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the newly independent nations that emerged after 1991. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush waived the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which had officially blocked normal trade relations with communist countries since 1975. This waiver permitted all E guarantee and insurance programs to U.S. companies wanting to do business with the USSR and several former communist countries.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Press release: EximBank Offers Support for U.S. Exports to the Soviet Union|newspaper=Export–Import Bank Press Release}}<!--|accessdate=June 10, 2013--></ref>

EXIM resumed business with Czechoslovakia in March 1990. On January 25, 1991, EXIM approved the first transaction to Czechoslovakia since 1947. Financed by First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles, CA, the guarantee allowed Tonak Hat Company<ref>[http://www.tonak.cz/en/tonak/company-profile/ Tonak Hat Company]</ref> to purchase computers from a U.S. company, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] of Massachusetts. Since 1991, EXIM has supported exports to 25 of the nations that emerged after the fall of the Iron Curtain.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Export–Import Bank of the United States |title=Export–Import Bank Annual Reports, 2008–2011: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany (Unified), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan|url=http://www.exim.gov/about/library/reports/annualreports/}}</ref>

=== First credit to India ===
After a visit to India in January 2015, President Obama announced that the EXIM will finance $1 billion of exports of 'Made-in-America' products, the U.S. [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] will lend $1 billion to small- and medium-sized rural enterprises and the U.S. [[Trade and Development Agency]] will commit $2 billion for renewable energy. Obama and Modi agreed on issues that had previously stopped U.S. companies from establishing nuclear reactors in India.<ref name=reu>{{cite news|author1=Sanjeev Miglani and Roberta Rampton|title=Obama ends day of Indian pageantry with $4 billion pledge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/26/us-india-obama-idUSKBN0KX0OW20150126|accessdate=January 27, 2015|work=Reuters|date=January 26, 2015}}</ref>

== Support ==
Supporters say that the bank emphasizes trying to help small and medium size businesses expand their exporting capabilities. CEO and President of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], Jay Timmons stated: "The EXIM plays a critical role in manufacturer's ability to export to new markets and keep up with growing global competition. The Bank assists nearly 290,000 export related jobs and each year is helping more and more small and medium-sized manufacturers grow their businesses and hire new workers. More than 85% of all EXIM transactions directly benefit small business exporters—the economic engine that powers our economy and job creation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ostermayer|first=Jeff|title=Manufacturers: Export–Import Bank Supports Jobs|url=http://www.nam.org/Communications/Articles/2012/03/Manufacturers-Export-Import-Bank-Supports-Jobs.aspx|accessdate=June 13, 2013|newspaper=National Association of Manufacturers|date=March 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226223933/http://www.nam.org/Communications/Articles/2012/03/Manufacturers-Export-Import-Bank-Supports-Jobs.aspx|archive-date=February 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When Obama was campaigning for President in 2008, he stated that the Export–Import Bank had "become little more than a fund for [[corporate welfare]]."<ref name=Obama>{{cite news |last=Goldfarb |first=Zachary |date=June 26, 2014 |title=Candidate Obama, echoing tea party, called EXIM 'little more than a fund for corporate welfare' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/26/candidate-obama-echoing-tea-party-called-ex-im-bank-little-more-than-a-fund-for-corporate-welfare/ |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>  During the Bank's reauthorization struggle, May 2012, he said that the Export–Import Bank plays a very important role in reaching his goal of doubling exports over 5 years. At the reauthorization ceremony Obama stated: "We're helping thousands of businesses sell more of their products and services overseas, in the process, we're helping them create jobs here at home. And we're doing it at no extra cost to the taxpayer."

== Criticism ==
===Special interests-based criticism===
The Bank has been criticized for favoring special interests. These interests have included corporations such as [[Boeing]] or [[Enron]] as well as foreign governments and nationals, such as a 1996 $120 million low-interest loan to the [[China National Nuclear Corporation|China National Nuclear Power Corporation]] (CNNP) supporting the export of US-made technology.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-carney053102.asp|last=Carney|first=Timothy|title=Bank Scam|date=May 31, 2002|magazine=National Review|accessdate=December 19, 2007}}</ref>

More recently the bank authorized $33.6 million in loans to Abengoa, a Spanish Green energy company on which former Governor [[Bill Richardson]] is a member of the board of directors. As of May 2014, Richardson was also listed as a member of the advisory committee of the Export Import Bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/378380/ex-im-big-double-dipping-opportunity-green-energy-firms-veronique-de-rugy|title=EXIM: A Big Double-Dipping Opportunity for Green-Energy Firms|author=Veronique De Rugy|accessdate=May 22, 2014|date=May 21, 2014}}</ref>

==== Boeing ====
65% of loan guarantees over 2007 and 2008 went to companies purchasing [[Boeing]] aircraft.<ref>[http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=55965 Pew Analysis Shows More Than 60 Percent of Export–Import Bank Loan Guarantees Benefited Single Company] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505223257/http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=55965 |date=May 5, 2011 }}</ref> In 2012, the Bank's loan guarantees became even more skewed, with 82 percent of them going to Boeing customers.<ref>[http://washingtonexaminer.com/boeing-and-obama-sitting-in-a-tree-k-i-s-s-i-n-g/article/2514795#.UL42CYOx-W3 Boeing and Obama sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G]</ref>

However, EXIM supporters note that Boeing is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2009-03-25-boeing-recession_N.htm|title=Boeing says it's flying high despite recession – USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref> and must be protected in their capacity as the only remaining comprehensive U.S. commercial aircraft manufacturer. Support of Boeing is seen as particularly critical as [[Comac]], China's state-owned and heavily subsidized commercial aircraft manufacturer, aggressively seeks to leech market share from both Boeing and Airbus. Also important to note, Boeing is not the only US aircraft manufacturer previously supported by EXIM.  During the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, EXIM supported other US aviation manufacturers such as the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]], the [[Convair|Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Company (Convair)]], and the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalarchives.exim.gov/cdm/compoundobject/collection/ExImD01/id/8159/rec/35|title=1959 Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Review, 1934–1959 :: EXIM Annual Reports Collection|website=www.digitalarchives.exim.gov|access-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref> before the firms were driven out of existence by competition or acquisition.

The cost and effectiveness of the bank are controversial. While the EXIM projects will earn the U.S. government an average of $1.4 billion per year for the next 10 years, an alternative analysis from the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that the program would lose about $2 billion during the same period, partly due to discrepancies in how credit risk is accounted for. Both conservative and liberal groups have been critical of the bank, and some continue to demand its termination.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

===Budget-based criticism===
Critics also purport the existence of "unseen" costs created by the Export–Import Bank's subsidies, including artificially raising the price of new airplanes and potentially adding $2 billion to the deficit over the next decade.<ref>{{cite AV Media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4KL0WUaaRI |author=Matthew Mitchell (Mercatus Center) |title=Is the EXIM a Win-Win? |publisher=YouTube|date=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

[[Forbes]] contributor [[Doug Bandow]] wrote in 2014, "The agency piously claims not to provide subsidies since it charges fees and interest, but it exists only to offer business a better credit deal than is available in the marketplace. The Bank uses its ability to borrow at government rates to provide loans, loan guarantees, working capital guarantees, and loan insurance."<ref name="Doug Bandow">{{cite web|title=Close the Export–Import Bank: Cut Federal Liabilities, Kill Corporate Welfare, Promote Free Trade|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2014/05/05/close-the-export-import-bank-cut-federal-liabilities-kill-corporate-welfare-promote-free-trade/|work=Forbes|author=Doug Bandow|date=May 5, 2014}}</ref>

If the normal principles of economics or finance are applied, then it is seen by critics as unlikely that the bank has profited and most unlikely that it makes the annual profit that it has stated, because the bank's calculations of profit fail to make proper adjustment for risk.<ref>[[Eugene Fama|Fama, Eugene]] and MacBeth, James D.

On this basis the criticism is that "This simple approach—which is based on a method outlined in a [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] paper by Debbie Lucas of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]—suggests that the EXIM's long-term loan guarantee program actually provides guarantees at a loss for taxpayers, not a profit. Moreover, this analysis reveals that the EXIM's loan guarantees are made at sufficiently generous terms that borrowers receive subsidies of about 1% of the amount borrowed. That translates into a $200 million cost for taxpayers on the $21 billion in loans that the bank will make in 2012."<ref name="Econ 21">{{cite web|title=Critics of the Export–Import Bank Have a New Weapon at Their Disposal: Fair-Value Accounting|url=http://economics21.org/commentary/critics-export-import-bank-have-new-weapon-their-disposal-fair-value-accounting|accessdate=May 22, 2014|author=Jason Delisle|author2=Christopher Papagianis|work=e21 – Economic Policies for the 21st Century|publisher=[[The Manhattan Institute]]|date=March 29, 2012 }}</ref>

===Environment-based criticism===
In February 2009, the EXIM settled a seven-year-long legal proceeding brought by [[Friends of the Earth]], [[Greenpeace]] together with the cities of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Arcata, California|Arcata]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. The plaintiffs said that the EXIM and the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] provided financial assistance to oil and other [[fossil fuel]] projects without first evaluating the projects' [[climate change]] impacts.<ref name=Starr>Douglas Starr, [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/just-90-companies-are-blame-most-climate-change-carbon-accountant-says "The carbon accountant.

Environmental groups say that in reversing the decision the agency's Chairman, Fred Hochberg and Board of Directors "caved in" to political pressure from Wisconsin politicians.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Export–Import Bank |title=Summary of Minutes of Meeting of Board of Directors, Item #2 |date=June 24, 2011 |url=http://www.exim.gov/article.cfm/B3B56631-911C-50EC-098514F87797E0AC/ |access-date=May 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916174240/http://www.exim.gov/article.cfm/B3B56631-911C-50EC-098514F87797E0AC/ |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Export–Import Bank |title=Summary of Minutes of Meeting of Board of Directors, Item #7 |date=October 21, 2010 |url=http://www.exim.gov/article.cfm/1D82DCA5-F618-8500-B1E268D85B90C44C/ |access-date=May 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916174755/http://www.exim.gov/article.cfm/1D82DCA5-F618-8500-B1E268D85B90C44C/ |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Jess McCabe |title=U.S. EXIM Flip-Flops on Giant Indian Coal Project |work=Environmental Finance |date=July 1, 2010 |url=http://www.environmental-finance.com/news/view/1215 |access-date=May 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517165306/http://www.environmental-finance.com/news/view/1215 |archive-date=May 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Andrew Bast |title=It's Not Easy Being Green |work=Newsweek |date=July 16, 2010 |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/07/16/it-s-not-easy-being-green.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. Taxpayer-Funded Bank, Under Pressure from Obama Administration, Gives Green Light to Giant Dirty Coal Plant in India |author=Michelle Chan |work=The Huffington Post |date=July 15, 2010 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michelle-chan/us-taxpayer-funded-bank-u_b_648174.html}}</ref> In 2011, several environmental groups protested at Export–Import Bank headquarters, unsuccessfully urging Chairman Hochberg and Board of Directors to reject $805 million in financing for the 4,800 megawatt Kusile coal-fired power plant in [[South Africa]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Protestors: Why Lock the World into a Coal Powered Future |publisher=The Sierra Club |url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/compass/2011/01/protesters-why-lock-the-world-into-a-coal-powered-future.html}}</ref> which environmental groups say is the largest carbon emitting project in the agency's history, which will not alleviate poverty but will emit excessive local air pollution, which health experts say causes damage the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems and deaths resulting from heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory diseases.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-14/south-african-coal-plant-wins-u-s-backing-over-environmentalist-protests.html "South African Coal Plant Wins U.S. Backing Over Environmentalist Protests"], Bloomberg, April 14, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Your Tax Dollars at Work: A Giant Coal Plant in South Africa |work=Mother Jones |date=December 9, 2009 |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2011/12/south-africa-coal-kusile-durban-climate}}</ref><ref>[http://www.foe.org/news/archives/2011-04-us-ex-im-bank-finances-largest-carbon-emitting-proje U.S. EXIM Finances Largest Carbon Emitting Project in its History], Friends of the Earth, et al.</ref><ref>March 14, 2011, [http://pacificenvironment.org/downloads/PSR%20Pulmonary.pdf Letter to EXIM Chairman Fred Hochberg from Physicians for Social Responsibility] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025010500/http://pacificenvironment.org/downloads/PSR%20Pulmonary.pdf |date=October 25, 2014 }}</ref>

In December 2012, the [[Center for Biological Diversity]], [[Pacific Environment]], and [[Turtle Island Restoration Network]] filed a lawsuit against Chairman Hochberg and the EXIM for the agency's financing of [[Australia Pacific LNG]]'s liquid natural gas projects inside the [[Great Barrier Reef]] World Heritage Area. The lawsuit alleged that EXIM financing for the projects violates U.S. environmental and cultural heritage laws.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Lawsuit Targets $3 Billion in U.S. Funding for Fossil Fuel Project in Australia's Great Barrier Reef |publisher=[[Center for Biological Diversity]] |date=December 13, 2012 |url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2012/export-import-bank-12-13-2012.html}}</ref> Their amended lawsuit included EXIM's loan for the Australia Pacific LNG project and a $1.8 billion loan for the Queensland Curtis which together totaled $4.8 billion. In March 2016, a California federal judge ruled against the environmentalists arguing that the EXIM financing represented only 10% of the project which is backed by [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Origin Energy]] Ltd. and [[Sinopec]] and rejecting the loan would not stop the project. The environmentalists appealed the decision.<ref name="law360_AussieLNG">{{citation |url=https://www.law360.com/articles/801035/enviros-appeal-to-9th-circ-in-aussie-lng-loan-suit |work=Law360 |title=Enviros Appeal To 9th Circ.

In 2019 [[Friends of the Earth (US)]] criticized EXIM President [[Kimberly_A._Reed|Kimberly A Reed]] for supporting the liquid natural gas (LNG) industry despite the lifecycle climate impacts of the fossil fuel, citing the U.S. government’s [[Fourth National Climate Assessment]] finding that more frequent and extreme weather events are severely damaging the environment and the economy, while increasing harm to human health and loss of life. [[Friends of the Earth (US)]] also criticized EXIM for approving $5 billion in financing the Mozambique LNG project, citing the project’s damage to the surrounding ecosystem (including to endangered species), displacement of local communities, and lack of economic benefits for local people.<ref name="The Hill">{{citation |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/462823-exim-should-not-fund-detrimental-natural-gas-project-in-mozambique |title=EXIM should not fund detrimental natural gas project in Mozambique |date=September 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=$5 billion in EXIM financing for Mozambique LNG plant fuels U.S. contribution to climate emergency |publisher=[[Friends of the Earth (US)]] |date=August 22, 2019 |url=https://foe.org/news/5-billion-exim-financing-mozambique-lng-plant-fuels-u-s-contribution-climate-emergency/}}</ref>

===Criticism of green energy-based financings===
Conversely the EXIM has also faced scrutiny for pursuing [[green energy]] projects. The EXIM provided $10 million of loan guarantees in 2011 to [[Solyndra]], a company that ultimately became bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solyndra using EXIM loan guarantees system to support commercial rooftop projects|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/news/solyndra_using_ex_im_bank_loan_guarantees_system_to_support_commercial_roof|accessdate=May 22, 2014|author=Mark Osborne}}</ref> However, as any other governmental institution with lending authority, EXIM reserves a portion of fees collected in expectation that a percentage of loans will result in claims.{{cn|date=February 2020}}
