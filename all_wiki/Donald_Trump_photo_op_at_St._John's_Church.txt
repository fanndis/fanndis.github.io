=== Security perimeter ===
Following violent protests in D.C., planning began on an expansion of the White House security perimeter. According to [[United States Park Police|U.S. Park Police]] (USPP) Chief Gregory Monahan, on May 31, the Secret Service confirmed with USPP that anti-scale fencing "would be procured and potentially delivered on [June 1] for installation along H Street."<ref>{{Cite web|title=June 13 Acting Chief Gregory T.

He then ordered the perimeter expanded.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/bb5fff42f2ff7e46b8eb0e1d098d22e0 |title=DC officials push back on aggressive response to protests |first1=Michael |last1=Balsamo |first2=Matthew |last2=Barakat |date=June 2, 2020 |publisher=AP News |access-date=June 5, 2020}}</ref> A member of the [[District of Columbia National Guard|D.C.

=== Photo op preparations ===
 
According to ''The New York Times'', on the morning of June 1, Trump was advised that allowing protesters and unrest on the streets of the capital was not symbolically acceptable.<ref name="NYT Havoc" /> A team consisting of the president's daughter [[Ivanka Trump]], her husband and [[Senior Advisor to the President]] [[Jared Kushner]], [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Mark Meadows (North Carolina politician)|Mark Meadows]], and [[Counselor to the President]] [[Hope Hicks]], reportedly devised a plan for President Trump to walk to St. John's Church, though several administration officials credited President Trump himself with the idea.<ref name="NYT Havoc" />

==Aftermath and subsequent events==
===Active-duty military===

In his June 1 speech, Trump encouraged governors to use the National Guard in sufficient numbers to "dominate the streets" and promised to "deploy the military" if necessary to restore order.<ref name="cspan" />

On June 1 and 2, about 1,700 [[Active duty|active-duty]] U.S. military troops from [[Fort Bragg]], [[Fort Drum]], and [[Fort Riley]] were positioned at military installations in the [[National Capital Region|capital area]] including [[Fort Belvoir]] and [[Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall|Fort Myer]] in Virginia and [[Joint Base Andrews]] in Maryland.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Seck|first=Hope Hodge|date=2020-06-02|title=These Are the Active-Duty Units Deployed to DC Region for Protests|url=https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/06/02/these-are-active-duty-units-deployed-dc-region-protests.html |website=Military.com |language=en |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref><ref name="BloombergFederalResponse" /> No active-duty forces were deployed inside Washington, D.C.<ref name="1600 Troops">{{Cite news |author=Ryan Nobles |author2=Barbara Starr  |author3=Ryan Browne|title=1,600 active-duty troops sent to Washington area after some governors turn down request for National Guard|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/politics/national-guard-states-pentagon/index.html |date=June 3, 2020 |publisher=CNN |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref>

At a Pentagon press conference on June 3, Defense Secretary Mark Esper declared his opposition to using active-duty military to quell domestic unrest: "The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.

===Tear gas use and denial===

[[WUSA (TV)|WUSA9]] reporters on scene "witnessed canisters venting out green-colored gas" and then collected several spent canisters. According to WUSA9, the canisters "were not from a previous day", because they "were in the middle of the street undisturbed, and in one case, still slightly warm to the touch", and also because the WUSA9 journalists were the first people on the scene "immediately after" the police departed.

[[Fact-checking|Fact checkers]] from the [[Associated Press]], [[CNN]], [[FactCheck.org]], and [[Politifact]] have reported on this issue.<ref name="evidence" /> The specific compound which the Park Police denied using is [[CS gas|CS]], a traditional tear gas. "[[Tear gas]]", however, is a broad term for a group of chemicals known for being riot control agents, e.g. [[Nonivamide|PAVA]] in the pepper balls that USPP acknowledge using. The sources for this broad definition are the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC), ''[[Scientific American]]'', and the ''Handbook of Toxicology of Chemical Warfare Agents''.

=== Congressional hearings ===
Congress is investigating the tactics used in clearing of the park. The first hearing was held before the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Natural Resources Committee]] on June 30 included testimony from a protester, journalist, church leader, and a law professor.

[[Jonathan Turley]] of [[George Washington University Law School]] noted in his testimony that the Park Police had argued they were creating a perimeter to establish a new fence line on H Street but protesters were pushed back to I Street, "which is beyond the fence line".

The U.S. Park Police stated on July 7 that "the radio recorder was not working and did not record any transmissions"  during the June 1 sweep of protesters, meaning that there is no audio record of Park Police communication.

On July 9, the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] held a hearing into Department of Defense involvement in domestic law enforcement.

Speaking of his St. John's Church appearance in an interview with [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]], Trump said, "most religious leaders loved it. And why wouldn't they love it? I'm standing in front of a church that went through trauma. [...] It's only the other side that didn't like it." However, only a small minority of church leaders expressed approval while many more sharply criticized his performance.<ref name="Stableford2">{{cite news|last1=Stableford|first1=Dylan|date=June 3, 2020|title=Trump claims 'most religious leaders loved' his church photo op|work=[[Yahoo News]]|url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-religious-leaders-tear-gas-bunker-inspection-154132447.html|access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Musto|first1=Julia|date=June 3, 2020|title=Trump says he went to White House bunker for 'inspection,' hits back at criticism of church visit|url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-bunker-inspection-church-tear-gas|publisher=Fox News |access-date=June 5, 2020}}</ref> In a second Fox News interview days later, Trump said, "I think it was a beautiful picture{{nbsp}}...

On June 11, Trump continued to praise law enforcement's handling of protesters and anarchists, tweeting, "Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. 'A walk in the park', one said. The protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY easily by the Guard, D.C. Police, & S.S.

Trump said in a ''Wall Street Journal'' interview on June 18, that he could not enter because of "insurance reasons". However, Reverend [[Mariann Budde]], who was overseeing the church at the time, refuted this claim stating "there were no insurance reasons why he couldn't go in" given that the damage was isolated to the church nursery.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Daniel Dale|title=Fact check: Trump falsely claims 'insurance reasons' prevented him from entering St. John's Church|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/20/politics/fact-check-trump-st-johns-church-photo-op-insurance/index.html |publisher=CNN |access-date=2020-06-22}}</ref>

====William Barr====

A Department of Justice spokeswoman said Attorney General William Barr had been appointed by Trump to lead "efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia".<ref name="CBS June 2" />

In an interview with the Associated Press on June 5, Barr said the decision to expand the security perimeter was reached in a meeting he attended with law enforcement officials at approximately 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on June 1, and the perimeter was to have been expanded immediately after the meeting. However, because the perimeter had not been expanded when Barr arrived at Lafayette Square later that afternoon, he "was frustrated" and "worried that as the crowd grew, it was going to be harder and harder to do."

Barr later distanced himself from the controversial move, saying that earlier on Monday he had ordered the security perimeter extended, and that upon seeing protesters still there in the afternoon he urged "get it done" but did not give the "tactical command" how to do it. Video shows him conferring with officials on the ground about 24 minutes before the police launched their push.<ref name="WaPo-Zapotosky-200605">{{cite news|last=Zapotosky|first=Matt|date=June 5, 2020|title=Barr seeks to dissociate himself from move on demonstrators outside Lafayette Square|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/barr-seeks-to-dissociate-himself-from-move-on-demonstrators-outside-lafayette-park/2020/06/05/47cb96b6-a78e-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html|access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name="AP-200605">{{cite news|author=Balsamo, Michael|date=June 5, 2020|title=Barr says he didn't give tactical order to clear protesters|publisher=AP News|url=https://apnews.com/1a993a6e99b4ecd1062a7552efed2d96|access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref> Barr also said he was not "involved in giving tactical commands like that", the order to clear the protesters was given by a Park Police official whom he never spoke to, and it was already in progress when he arrived: "They had the Park Police mounted unit ready, so it was just a matter of execution. So, I didn't just say to them, 'Go.'"<ref name="WaPo-Zapotosky-200605" /><ref name="AP-200605" />

On June 7, Attorney General William Barr reacted to the incident by falsely claiming the pepper balls used by law enforcement on protesters were not chemical irritants. Pepper balls contain [[pelargonic acid vanillylamide]]; both the product's manufacturer and the Justice Department consider pepper balls a chemical irritant.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|date=June 9, 2020|title=William Barr's Four-Pinocchio claim that pepper balls are 'not chemical'|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/08/william-barrs-four-pinocchio-claim-that-pepper-balls-are-not-chemical/|access-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200609045248/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/08/william-barrs-four-pinocchio-claim-that-pepper-balls-are-not-chemical/|archive-date=June 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a Fox News interview on June 8, Barr was asked three times if he would do anything differently in retrospect. Barr replied "no". He explained that the actions were taken in response to days of violent protests, including he himself being targeted by protester-thrown projectiles such as "rocks and bottles" during his visit to the park. Barr challenged the notion that expanding the security perimeter was associated with the photo op, calling it "totally false" and a "canard".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Creitz|first=Charles|date=2020-06-08|title=Barr blasts 'canard' that Park Police cleared out protesters to let Trump visit church: 'Totally false'|url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/barr-lafayette-park-protesters-trump-church-visit |publisher=Fox News |language=en-US |access-date=2020-06-09}}</ref>

Worse, they wrote, he appeared to be using the "authority" of God "to support his own authority and to wield enhanced use of military force in a perverted attempt to restore peace to our nation".<ref name="AFP Jakarta">{{cite news |title=Trump angers American religious leaders with Bible photo op |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/03/trump-angers-american-religious-leaders-with-bible-photo-op.html |work=[[The Jakarta Post]] |agency=[[Agence France Presse]] |date=June 3, 2020 |access-date=June 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200607022252/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/03/trump-angers-american-religious-leaders-with-bible-photo-op.html |archive-date=June 7, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=New England Episcopal bishops condemn Trump's church visit |url=https://apnews.com/2ec15854f38c385552af66a204cf6e6e |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 3, 2020 |access-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>

[[Jameel Jaffer]] of the [[Knight First Amendment Institute]] said there was a strong legal case that the protester's First Amendment rights were violated.

===Media===

The ''New York Times'' editorial board called Attorney General [[William Barr]]'s decision to forcibly clear a peaceful protest in a public park and churchyard for Trump to conduct a photo-op "a brazen display of this administration's disregard for the First Amendment" that "managed to take aim at the freedom of assembly, speech and religion all at the same time".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/george-floyd-protests-first-amendment.html |title=In America, Protest Is Patriotic: The police are supposed to protect free speech, not suppress it. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> The ''Washington Post'' editorial board criticized Barr and Trump's actions as "cheap political theater" and called upon leaders in Congress and the military to dissuade Trump from deploying active-duty Army soldiers on Americans streets (as Trump indicated he might do), saying such a move would be "unacceptable" and "move America closer to anarchy".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-threats-to-deploy-troops-move-america-closer-to-anarchy/2020/06/02/88975a60-a4ee-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html |author=Editorial Board |title=Trump's threats to deploy troops move America closer to anarchy |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 2, 2020 |access-date=June 10, 2020}}</ref>
