'''Teofisto Tayko Guingona Jr.''' (born July 4, 1928) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] politician who served as the [[List of Vice Presidents of the Philippines|11th Vice President]] of the [[Philippines]] from 2001 to 2004, during the first term of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. Born in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Rizal]] (now San Juan, [[Metro Manila]]), Teofisto is a graduate of [[Ateneo de Manila University]], where he was a working student.

He was appointed as Chairman of the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]] by then newly installed President [[Corazon C. Aquino]] in 1986 until 1987, when he was elected as a senator of the Philippines under the coalition of [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|Lakas ng Bayan]], led by Aquino. While a senator, he also served as the director and chairman of the [[Mindanao Development Authority]] and the Mindanao Labor Management Advisory Council. He won in the reelections in 1992 and became [[Majority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Leader]] a year after, but his term ended prematurely when newly elected President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] appointed him as [[Executive Secretary (Philippines)|Executive Secretary]] from 1993 until 1995 and as [[Secretary of Justice (Philippines)|Justice Secretary]] from 1995 until 1998. He was re-elected to the Senate again as a [[Minority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Minority Leader]] from 1998 until 2001.

Guingona was appointed as Vice President of the Philippines and [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], after she was automatically promoted to the presidency from vice presidency after the then President [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph "Erap" Estrada]]'s ousting in [[EDSA II]], making him the only vice president who was not nationally elected to the position. When Guingona's term ended, he decided not to seek a full term election and was succeeded by [[Noli de Castro]].

== Early life and career ==
Guingona was born on July 4, 1928 in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Rizal]]. His father, [[Teofisto Guingona, Sr.]], was a former assemblyman, senator, judge and commissioner from [[Guimaras]], [[Iloilo]]. His mother, Josefa Tayko, is of [[Siaton, Negros Oriental]]. He grew up in the provinces [[Agusan (province)|Agusan]], [[Lanao (province)|Lanao]], and [[Misamis Oriental]], where he completed his [[elementary school|elementary]] schooling with honors in [[Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan|Ateneo de Cagayan]].<ref name="senate.gov.ph">[http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/former_senators/teofisto_guingona_jr.htm Senators Profile – Teofisto t. Guingona Jr.] Retrieved October 20, 2010</ref> He pursued his studies at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] as a working student, teaching history and political science while taking up courses in law and economics. He took up special studies in Public Administration, Economics, Sociology and Audit, in addition to playing a role in founding the [[Aquila Legis]] fraternity. After graduation, he went into business and became a Governor of the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]] and President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines.<ref name="senate.gov.ph"/>

== Early political career ==
Guingona was a delegate to the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|1971 Constitutional Convention]] and, when [[martial law]] was declared in 1972 by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], he resisted the abuses of the regime, serving as a human rights lawyer. He founded SANDATA and became the honorary chairman of BANDILA, two mass-based organizations dedicated to social and economic reforms. Because of his opposition to martial rule he was jailed twice, first in 1972 and then in 1978.<ref name="senate.gov.ph"/> When Marcos was ousted as a result of the [[People Power Revolution]], newly installed President [[Corazon Aquino]] appointed Guingona as Chairman of the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]] where he gained renown as a graft buster.<ref name="senate.gov.ph"/>

== Senator of the Philippines (1987–1993; 1998–2001) ==
Guingona was first elected to the Senate in 1987 under the Aquino-backed [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|Lakas ng Bayan]] coalition. He was elected as [[President pro tempore of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President pro tempore]] in 1987 and [[Majority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Leader]] in 1990. Additionally, he served as director and chairman of the [[Mindanao Development Authority]] and the Mindanao Labor Management Advisory Council.<ref name="senate.gov.ph"/>

In 1992, he ran for reelection under the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] of Speaker of the House [[Ramon Mitra Jr.]] and won, placing 14th in the Senate race. He became [[Majority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Majority Leader]] again in 1993 but his term in the Senate was cut short when President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] appointed him as [[Executive Secretary (Philippines)|Executive Secretary]] the same year. In 1998, he was elected again to the Senate under the [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas-NUCD]] and was elected as [[Minority leader of the Senate of the Philippines|Minority Leader]]. He spoke out against the anomalies in the administration of President [[Joseph Estrada]] and was among the first to call for his resignation.  On January 17, 2001, he was one of the senators who voted in favor of opening an envelope that was said to contain incriminating evidence against Estrada. The final vote was 11-10, in favor of keeping the envelope closed, which further fueled anti-Estrada sentiments that led to another [[Second EDSA Revolution|uprising]] in [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. When Estrada was ousted, Guingona emerged as the top choice for a successor to Vice President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who succeeded Estrada as president.<ref name="senate.gov.ph"/>

== Executive Secretary (1993–1995) and Secretary of Justice (1995–1998) ==

He is also the oldest person to hold the position when he was appointed at the age of 72. He also concurrently served as [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]].

He resigned as [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] on July 2, 2002. He also resigned from the [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas-NUCD]] on October 3, 2003.

== Post vice-presidency ==
After the defeat of his candidate Fernando Poe Jr., Guingona supported the administration of Arroyo again by accepting the position of Ambassador to China.  He resigned as ambassador and joined the opposition again at the height of the [[Hello Garci scandal]], a [[political scandal]] involving Arroyo's rigging of the [[2004 Philippine presidential election|2004 presidential elections]]. On November 29, 2007, Guingona participated in the [[Manila Peninsula rebellion]], a mutiny led by Senator [[Antonio Trillanes IV]] and Brigader General [[Danilo Lim]] that called for Arroyo's resignation. He was arrested afterwards but on December 13, 2007, the Makati City [[Regional Trial Court]] dismissed [[rebellion]] cases against him.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/topofthehour.aspx?StoryId=102321 AbsCbn,  Makati court junks rebellion charges vs Guingona, other civilians]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Guingona wrote his 346-page book ''Fight for the Filipino'', which contains his memoirs.
