===Coverage of Bill Clinton===
For the July 2008 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', Purdum wrote a scathing article about [[Bill Clinton]], "The Comeback Id". The article analyzed Clinton's post-presidency business dealings, behavior, and possible personal indiscretions, citing several anonymous current and former Clinton aides.<ref name="clinton200807">{{cite news | author = Purdum, Todd | title = The Comeback Id | work =Vanity Fair | date = 2008-06-01 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/07/clinton200807 | accessdate = 2008-06-06}}</ref> When asked about the article by ''[[Huffington Post]]'' writer Mayhill Fowler, Clinton said (in reference to Purdum): "He's a really dishonest reporter... and I haven't read (the article). There's just five or six blatant lies in there. But he's a real slimy guy." When Fowler reminded Clinton that Purdum is married to his former press secretary, he responded: "That's all right - he's still a scumbag." He later added, "He's just a dishonest guy - can't help it." Clinton went on to observe, "It's all politics. It's all about the bias of the media for Obama. Don't think anything about it. But I'm telling ya, all it's doing is driving her supporters further and further away - because they know exactly what it is - this has been the most rigged coverage in modern history - and the guy ought to be ashamed of himself. But he has no shame. It isn't the first dishonest piece he's written about me or her." The following day, [[Jay Carson]], a spokesman for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s presidential campaign, stated that Clinton regretted those remarks, but their factual content remained unchallenged by the Clintons.<ref name="main4148156">{{cite news | author = Associated Press | title = Bill Clinton Vs.
