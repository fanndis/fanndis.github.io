'''''Seinfeld''''' is<!-- Do not change to "was" as fiction is written in present tense and remains as "is" per Wikipedia convention. See: [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Television/Style guidelines#Lead paragraphs]]. --> an American [[sitcom]] television series created by [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. It aired on [[NBC]] from July 5, 1989, to May 14, 1998, over nine seasons and [[List of Seinfeld episodes|180 episodes]]. The show stars Seinfeld as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictionalized version of himself]] who is the main protagonist and focuses on his personal life with three of friends - [[George Costanza]] ([[Jason Alexander]]), former girlfriend [[Elaine Benes]] ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]), and neighbor across the hall [[Cosmo Kramer]] ([[Michael Richards]]). ''Seinfeld'' is set mostly in an apartment building in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]] in [[New York City]]. It has been described as "a show about nothing," often focusing on the [[slice of life|minutiae of daily life]].<ref name="bbc"/>

As a comedian rising in popularity in the late 1980s, Seinfeld was presented with an opportunity to create a show with NBC. Seinfeld asked David, a fellow comedian and friend, to help create a premise for a sitcom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=Jennifer |date=2016 |title=Seinfeldia |url=Jennifer Armstrong |location=New York, NY |publisher=Simon & Schuster |pages=7–8 |isbn=978-1-4767-5610-3 |author-link=Jennifer Armstrong}}</ref> The series was produced by West-Shapiro Productions and [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], and was distributed by [[Sony Pictures Television]]. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld with script writers who included [[Larry Charles]], [[Peter Mehlman]], [[Gregg Kavet]], [[Carol Leifer]], [[David Mandel]], [[Jeff Schaffer]], [[Steve Koren]], [[Jennifer Crittenden]], [[Tom Gammill and Max Pross|Tom Gammill]], [[Tom Gammill and Max Pross|Max Pross]], [[Dan O'Keefe (writer)|Dan O'Keefe]], [[Charlie Rubin]], [[Marjorie Gross]], [[Alec Berg]], [[Elaine Pope]], and [[Spike Feresten]]. A favorite among critics, the series led the [[Nielsen ratings]] in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC's ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'') every year from 1994 to 1998. Only two other shows have finished their runs at the top of the ratings, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Looking back at 'I Love Lucy' 64 years later|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/10-love-lucy-article-1.2397434|last=DOSTIS|first=MELANIE|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

[[File:Seinfeld actors montage.jpg|thumb|Jerry Seinfeld (upper left); Jason Alexander (upper right); Michael Richards (lower right); Julia Louis-Dreyfus (lower left)]]
* [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]] ([[Jerry Seinfeld]]) – Jerry is a "minor [[Celebrity|celeb]]" [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] who is often depicted as "[[Everyman|the voice of reason]]" amid the general insanity generated by the people in his world. The in-show character is a mild [[Mysophobia|germophobe]] and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|neat freak]], as well as an avid [[Superman]], [[New York Mets]] and [[breakfast cereal]] fan. Jerry's apartment is the center of a world visited by his eccentric friends and a focus of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=jerry&type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Jerry |publisher=Sony pictures |access-date=December 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212015442/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters |archive-date=December 12, 2007 }}</ref>
* [[Elaine Benes]]  ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) – Elaine is Jerry's ex-girlfriend and later friend. She is friendly, while also being sarcastic, selfish and unorganized. She sometimes has a tendency to be too honest with people (usually by losing her temper), which often gets her into trouble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=elaine&type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Elaine |publisher=Sony pictures |access-date=December 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217220207/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=elaine&type=char |archive-date=December 17, 2007 }}</ref> She usually gets caught up in her boyfriends' quirks, eccentric employers' unusual behaviors and idiosyncrasies, and the maladjustment of total strangers. She tends to make poor choices in men she chooses to date and is often overly reactive. First she works at Pendant Publishing with Mr. Lippman, is later hired as a personal assistant for Mr. Pitt, and later works for the J. Peterman catalog as a glorified assistant. Elaine is popularly described as an amalgamation of David's and Seinfeld's girlfriends during their early days in [[New York City|New York]] as struggling comedians.
* [[Cosmo Kramer]]  ([[Michael Richards]]) – Kramer is Jerry's [[slacker]] neighbor. His trademarks include his humorous upright [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour hairstyle]], vintage clothes, and energetic sliding bursts through Jerry's apartment door. Kramer was heavily based on a neighbor of David's during his amateur comedic years in Manhattan. At times, he appears [[Naivety|naïve]], uneducated, and impulsive, and at other times, quick-witted, helpful, and empathetic; similarly, he is exaggeratedly successful, socially, with his charisma and laid-back personality. This is seen in his success with women and employers. He has been described as a "hipster doofus." Although he never holds a steady job, he is rarely short of money and often invents wacky schemes that often work at first then eventually fail. Kramer is best friends with [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], and they work well together despite their differences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=kramer&type=char |title=Seinfeld Cast and characters – Kramer |publisher=Sony pictures |access-date=December 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217215856/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=kramer&type=char |archive-date=December 17, 2007 }}</ref>
* [[George Costanza]]  ([[Jason Alexander]]) – George is Jerry's best friend since high school. He is stingy, conniving, pedantic and jealous of others' achievements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=george&type=char |title=Seinfeld – Cast and Characters |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127162844/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/about/?sl=cast_and_characters&tab=george&type=char |archive-date=January 27, 2012 }}</ref> He is depicted as a loser who is perpetually lacking confidence about his capabilities. He rants and lies easily about his profession, relationships and almost everything else, which usually creates trouble for him later. He often uses the alias Art Vandelay when lying or concocting a cover story. Despite these shortcomings, George is very reliable to his friends and has a success in dating women and eventually secures a steady career as Assistant to the Traveling Secretary for the [[New York Yankees]].

{{Main|List of Seinfeld minor characters}}
Many characters have made multiple appearances, like Jerry's nemesis [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]] and his [[Uncle Leo]]. In addition to recurring characters, ''Seinfeld'' features numerous celebrities who appear as themselves or girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses and other acquaintances. Many actors who made guest appearances became household names later in their careers, or were already well known.

===Plotlines===
Many ''Seinfeld'' episodes are based on the writers' real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines. For example, George's storyline, "[[The Revenge (Seinfeld)|The Revenge]]", is based on Larry David's experience at ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=212 |title=Seinfacts: The Revenge |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |access-date=December 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150813/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=212 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> "[[The Contest]]" is also based on David's experiences. "[[The Smelly Car]]" storyline is based on Peter Mehlman's lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car. "[[The Strike (Seinfeld)|The Strike]]" is based on Dan O'Keefe's dad, who made up his own holiday—[[Festivus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=910 |title=The Strike |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |access-date=January 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150844/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=910 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> Other stories take a variety of turns. "[[The Chinese Restaurant]]" consists of George, Jerry and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=206 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Chinese Restaurant |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111123925/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=206 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref> "[[The Boyfriend (Seinfeld)|The Boyfriend]]", revolving around [[Keith Hernandez]], extends through 2 episodes. "[[The Betrayal (Seinfeld)|The Betrayal]]" is famous for using [[reverse chronology]], and was inspired by a similar plot device in a [[Harold Pinter]] play, [[Betrayal (play)|''Betrayal'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=908 |title=The Betrayal |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |access-date=January 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150839/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=908 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features "Notes About Nothing", "Inside Look", and "Audio Commentary". In "[[The Maestro (Seinfeld)|The Maestro]]", Kramer's lawsuit is roughly similar to the [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|McDonald's coffee case]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=703 |title=The Maestro |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |access-date=January 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150829/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=703 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> "[[The Outing (Seinfeld)|The Outing]]" is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld's sexuality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=416 |title=The Outing |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]] |access-date=January 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150823/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=416 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref>

The series was often described as "a show about nothing".<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml |title=Seinfeld |publisher=BBC |access-date=May 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427105254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seinfeld_7775675.shtml |archive-date=April 27, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/276165|title=Seinfeld: Overview|author=Erickson, Hal|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|access-date=May 17, 2007}}</ref> However, Seinfeld in 2014 stated "the pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seinfeld|first1=Jerry|title=Jerry Seinfeld here.

''Seinfeld'' broke several conventions of [[mainstream]] television. Larry David is credited with refusing to follow the predictable sitcom formula that would have a blossoming romantic relationship develop between Jerry and Elaine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hurd|first=Robert.|date=2006|title=Taking Seinfeld Seriously: Modernism in Popular Culture|journal=New Literary History|volume=37|issue=4|pages=761–776|doi=10.1353/nlh.2007.0005|s2cid=55842151|issn=1080-661X}}</ref> The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters, and eschews sentimentality.<ref name="baltimore sun">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-05-03/features/1998123008_1_seinfeld-elaine-benes-julia-louis-dreyfus|title=The world according to 'Seinfeld' No hugging, no learning.

Many episodes revolve around the characters' involvement in the lives of others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the "no hugging, no learning" rule.<ref name="baltimore sun"/> Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of [[pathos]]; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even [[The Invitations|Susan's death]] elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292901,00.html|title=Killing Time|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Nisid|last=Hajari|date=June 7, 1996|access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref>  ''Seinfeld'' does not shy away from making light of tough topics, from death to illness to handicaps.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Iannone|first=Carol|date=Spring 2018|title=Seinfeld: The Politically Incorrect Comedy: Far from being about nothing, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s was a satire of a world without rules.|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A537983199/AONE?u=aacc_ref&sid=AONE&xid=995520ed.|journal=Modern Age|pages=51|via=Academic OneFile}}</ref><ref name="politically-incorrect">{{cite web |last1=Iannone |first1=Carol |title=Seinfeld: The Politically Incorrect Comedy |url=https://isi.org/modern-age/seinfeld-the-politically-incorrect-comedy/ |website=isi.org |publisher=Modern Age |access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref>

The characters are "thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals".<ref>{{cite web|title=Postmodernism: A New Model of Reality|url=http://www.mckenziestudycenter.org/philosophy/articles/postmod.html|first=R.

One such example is the [[story arc]] where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named ''Jerry''. The [[show within a show]], ''Jerry'', was much like ''Seinfeld'' in that it was "about nothing" and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional ''Jerry'' was launched in the season four finale, but unlike ''Seinfeld'', it wasn't picked up as a series. ''Jerry'' is one of many examples of [[metafiction]] in the show.

Jerry Seinfeld is an avid [[Abbott and Costello]] fan, and has cited ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]'' as an influence on ''Seinfeld.'' "Everybody on the show knows I'm a fan. We're always joking about how we do stuff from their show. George and I will often get into a riff that has the rhythm from the old Abbott and Costello shows. And sometimes I'll hit George in the chest the way Abbott would hit Costello." The series includes numerous references to the team. George Costanza's middle name is "Louis," after Costello.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/21/arts/seinfeld-as-opening-act-for-abbott-and-costello.html|title=Seinfeld as Opening Act For Abbott and Costello|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=November 21, 1994|access-date=January 19, 2018|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> "[[The Old Man (Seinfeld)|The Old Man]]" episode features a cantankerous character named "Sid Fields" as a tribute to the landlord on the team's TV show.

In Episode 30, Kramer hears the famous Abbott and Costello line, "His father was a mudder. His mother was a mudder."

===Catchphrases===
Many terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series' run and have become part of popular culture,<ref>{{cite news|author=Caryn James|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/seinfeld/sein5-11parting.html|title=Goodbye!

The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as [[Seinlanguage]], the title of Jerry Seinfeld's best-selling book on humor.<ref name="grenz"/>

===Music===
A signature of ''Seinfeld'' is its theme music. Composed by [[Jonathan Wolff (musician)|Jonathan Wolff]], it consists of distinct solo [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bass riffs which open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by [[beatboxing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaQ7y5OeHWI|title=Entertainment Tonight – Jonathan Wolff Seinfeld music|work=YouTube}}</ref> The bass music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of [[The Seinfeld Chronicles|the pilot episode]]. The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.

In "[[The Note (Seinfeld)|The Note]]", the first episode of season three, the bumper music featured a [[Scat singing|scatting]] female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like "easy to beat". Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff's additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed, and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements.<ref>Season 3 DVD: Inside Look of 'The Note'</ref> In the commentary of "The Note", Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time.<ref>Season 3 DVD: 'The Note' commentary</ref>

In the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in "The Betrayal", part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a [[sitar]].

''Seinfeld'' stood out from family and group [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] of its time. The principal characters are not related by family or work connections but remain distinctly close friends throughout the series.

''Seinfeld'' follows its own structure: story thread is presented at the beginning of every episode, which involves the characters starting in their own situations. Rapid scene-shifts between plot lines bring the stories together. Even though it does not follow a pattern as other sitcoms, the characters' stories variously intertwine in each episode. Despite the separate plot strands, the narratives reveal the creators' "consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy" among the small cast of characters.<ref>Gantz, Katherine. ''"Not That There's Anything Wrong with That": Reading the Queer in Seinfeld''. In Calvin Thomas (Ed.). ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''. Champaign. Illinois: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-06813-0}}</ref>

The show maintains a strong sense of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]—characters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes and even entire seasons, the most memorable being [[Seinfeld (season 4)|season four]], which revolved around the [[television pilot|pilot]] pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry's girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in "[[The Stake Out (Seinfeld)|The Stake Out]]" and he ends the relationship when things do not work out in "[[The Stock Tip]]". Other examples are Kramer getting his jacket back and Elaine heading the "Peterman catalog". [[Larry David]], the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and making sure the main characters' lives remained consistent and believable. ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''—David's later comedy series—expanded on this idea by following a specific theme for all but one season in the series.

A major difference between ''Seinfeld'' and sitcoms which preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous towards the outside world and sometimes one another. A [[mantra]] of the show's producers was: "No hugging, no learning".<ref>{{cite news|title=About Seinfeld|url=http://www.tv1.com.au/Shows/Seinfeld/About/|publisher=[[TV1 (Australia)|TV1]]|access-date=January 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831074136/http://www.tv1.com.au/Shows/Seinfeld/About/|archive-date=August 31, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s TV critic [[Ken Tucker]] has described them as "a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one's fellow human beings".<ref>Tucker, Ken.

The show premiered as ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]'' on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely and the show was offered to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which declined to pick it up. [[Rick Ludwin]], head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a [[Bob Hope#Broadcasting|Bob Hope television special]], and the next 4 episodes were filmed.<ref name="Season 1 & 2 DVD review">{{cite web|last=Boudreaux |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/seinfeld1.html |title=Seinfeld: Season 1 & 2 DVD Review |publisher=tvdvdreviews.com |date=November 24, 2004 |access-date=April 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418075527/http://www.tvdvdreviews.com/seinfeld1.html |archive-date=April 18, 2008 }}</ref>{{r|littlefield20120529}} These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of ''[[Cheers]]'' on Thursdays at 9:30&nbsp;p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30&nbsp;p.m., but gave that slot to a short-lived sitcom called ''FM''. The series was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'' after the failure of short-lived 1990 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''The Marshall Chronicles''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI_qCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT21|title=Seinfeld FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Show About Nothing|first=Nicholas|last=Nigro|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|date=June 1, 2015|access-date=December 29, 2015|isbn=9781495035357}}</ref> After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered thirteen more episodes.

TV critics championed ''Seinfeld'' in its early seasons, even as it was slow to cultivate a substantial audience. For the first three seasons, Jerry's stand-up comedy act would bookend an episode, even functioning as [[cut scene]]s during the show. A few episodes set a benchmark for later seasons. "[[The Deal (Seinfeld episode)|The Deal]]" establishes Jerry and Elaine's relationship by setting rules about sleeping together and remaining friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=213 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Deal |publisher=Sonypictures.com |date=May 2, 1991 |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010172948/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=213 |archive-date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> "[[The Parking Garage (Seinfeld episode)|The Parking Garage]]" was the first episode shot with no audience for the episode and, after "[[The Chinese Restaurant (Seinfeld episode)|The Chinese Restaurant]]", with not showing Jerry's apartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=306 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Parking Garage |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116052213/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=306 |archive-date=November 16, 2011 }}</ref>  "[[The Keys (Seinfeld episode)|The Keys]]" contains a crossover to [[CBS]] show ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', marking the first such cooperation between rival networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=321 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Keys |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010172940/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=321 |archive-date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> "[[The Busboy (Seinfeld)|The Busboy]]" introduces George, Kramer and Elaine as having their own storylines for the first time.

===Seasons 4–5===
Season four marked the sitcom's entry into the [[Nielsen ratings]] Top 30, coinciding with several popular episodes, such as "[[The Bubble Boy (Seinfeld episode)|The Bubble Boy]]" in which George and the bubble boy argue over ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=407 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118152059/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=407 |archive-date=January 18, 2012 }}</ref> and "[[The Junior Mint (Seinfeld episode)|The Junior Mint]]" in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=421 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925045350/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=421 |archive-date=September 25, 2011 }}</ref> This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, ''Jerry''. Also at this time, the use of Jerry's stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of ''Seinfeld'' episodes was cut.

Much publicity followed the controversial episode, "[[The Contest (Seinfeld)|The Contest]]", an [[Emmy Award]]-winning episode written by co-creator Larry David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word "[[masturbation]]" was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=411 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173057/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=411 |archive-date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> Midway through that season, ''Seinfeld'' was moved from its original 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, following ''[[Cheers]]'' again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as [[Tim Allen|Tim Allen's]] sitcom ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' on ABC had aired at the same time and ''Improvement'' kept beating ''Seinfeld'' in the ratings. [[NBC]] moved the series after [[Ted Danson]] announced the end of ''Cheers'' and ''Seinfeld'' quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ''Cheers'' reruns that spring.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60203201.html?dids=60203201:60203201&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+4%2C+1993&author=DANIEL+CERONE&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=1&desc=%60Seinfeld%27+Is+Suddenly+Something+Sitcom+That%27s+%60About+Nothing%27+Finding+More+Fans+in+New+Time+Slot |author=Cerone, Daniel|title=Seinfeld Is Suddenly Something|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 4, 1993}}</ref> The show won an Emmy Award for ''Outstanding Comedy Series'' in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', which was only in its second season on rival network [[ABC Signature|ABC]].

''Seinfeld'' was nominated for the same award every year for its entire run but, after its win at the [[45th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1994, always lost to ''Frasier'', which went on to win a record thirty-nine Emmy Awards in its eleven-season run.

===Seasons 6–7===
In season six, [[Andy Ackerman]] replaced [[Tom Cherones]] as director of the show. The series remained well-regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as "[[The Beard]]" in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched ''[[Melrose Place]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=615 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=January 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175528/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=615 |archive-date=February 1, 2014 }}</ref> "[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]" in which Kramer's mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=610 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Switch |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031736/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=610 |archive-date=May 16, 2013 }}</ref> and "[[The Understudy (Seinfeld)|The Understudy]]" in which Elaine meets J.

This was the first season in which ''Seinfeld'' reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry's stand-up act declined with the end stand-up segment no longer appearing, as the storylines for all four characters grew denser.

In season seven, a story arc involved George getting engaged to his ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross, after the pilot ''Jerry'' proved unsuccessful. In it, George spends most of the season regretting and trying to get out of the engagement. Along with the regular half-hour episodes, two notable one-hour episodes were "[[The Cadillac (Seinfeld)|The Cadillac]]" in which George plans to date award-winning actor [[Marisa Tomei]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=714 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516034018/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=714 |archive-date=May 16, 2013 }}</ref> and "[[The Bottle Deposit]]" with Elaine and Sue Ellen participating in a bidding war to buy JFK's golf clubs in an auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=721 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=[[Sony Pictures]]|access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516031807/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=721 |archive-date=May 16, 2013 }}</ref>

===Seasons 8–9===
The show's ratings were still going strong in its final two seasons. Larry David left at the end of season seven, although he continued to voice Steinbrenner, so Seinfeld assumed David's duties as [[showrunner]], and, under the direction of a new writing staff, ''Seinfeld'' became a faster-paced show. The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor. For example, in "[[The Bizarro Jerry]]", Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famed "man hands".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=803 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Bizarro Jerry |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117185550/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=803 |archive-date=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> Some notable episodes from season eight include "[[The Little Kicks]]" showing Elaine's horrible dancing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=804 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Little Kicks |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173001/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=804 |archive-date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref> and "[[The Chicken Roaster]]" which portrays the ''[[Kenny Rogers Roasters]]'' chicken restaurant which opened during that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=808 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516045149/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=808 |archive-date=May 16, 2013 }}</ref> A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to [[Burma]] in "[[The Foundation (Seinfeld)|The Foundation]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=801 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516041857/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=801 |archive-date=May 16, 2013 }}</ref> until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in "[[The Money]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=813 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219023930/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=813 |archive-date=December 19, 2011 }}</ref> followed by [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] writing Peterman's biography in "[[The Van Buren Boys]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=814 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130032028/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=814 |archive-date=November 30, 2012 }}</ref> which leads to Kramer's parody of Kenny Kramer's Reality Tour seen in "[[The Muffin Tops]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=821 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Muffin Tops |publisher=Sonypictures.com |access-date=September 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010173006/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=821 |archive-date=October 10, 2012 }}</ref>

A major controversy caused in this final season was the accidental burning of a [[Puerto Rican flag]] by Kramer in "[[The Puerto Rican Day]]". This scene caused a furor among Puerto Ricans, and as a result, NBC showed this episode only once. Jerry Seinfeld defused the protestors by not letting this episode continue in syndication, as revealed in "Inside Look" on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=920 |title=Seinfeld – Now Playing – The Puerto Rican Day |access-date=October 25, 2008 |publisher=Sony pictures |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216150849/http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/seinfeld/episode_guide/?sl=episode&ep=920 |archive-date=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> However, the episode would be added to the syndicated rerun package several years later uncut.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2002/10/30/forbidden-seinfeld-puerto-rican-flag-burning-episode-slips-back-on-air/ |title=Forbidden 'Seinfeld'; Puerto Rican Flag Burning Episode Slips Back On Air |last=Starr |first=Michael |newspaper=New York Post |date=October 30, 2002 |access-date=April 17, 2018}}</ref>

===Series finale===
{{Main|The Finale (Seinfeld)}}
After nine years on the air, NBC and Jerry Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998. The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Carter |first1=Bill |title=Seinfeld Says It's All Over, And It's No Joke for NBC |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/us/seinfeld-says-it-s-all-over-and-it-s-no-joke-for-nbc.html |access-date=May 17, 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=December 26, 1997 |page=A1}}</ref> Jerry Seinfeld was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's first issue of 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101980112,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover: Jerry Seinfeld|date=January 12, 1998|access-date=May 17, 2007|work=Time}}</ref> The series ended with a seventy-five-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]], in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998. Before the finale, a forty-five-minute retrospective clip show, "[[The Chronicle (Seinfeld)|The Chronicle]]", was aired. The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.

It was the first episode since the finale of season seven, "[[The Invitations]]", to feature opening and closing stand-up comedy acts by Jerry Seinfeld. The finale was filmed before an audience of NBC executives and friends of the show. The press and public were shut out of the taping in order to keep its plot secret; those who attended the shoot of the final episode were required to sign written "vows of silence".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9804/08/seinfeld.email/|title=The 'Seinfeld' e-mail for April 8, 1998|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=April 8, 1998|access-date=May 17, 2007}}</ref> The secrecy only seemed to increase speculation about how the series would end. The producers of the show tweaked the media about the hype, spreading a false rumor about Newman ending up in the hospital and Jerry and Elaine sitting in a chapel, presumably to marry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b36158_clues_seinfeld_sign_off.html|title=Clues to "Seinfeld" Sign Off|author=Ryan, Joal|publisher=[[E!

However, the finale received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the show. The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating, seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its true storyline—a lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a "[[Duty to rescue|Duty to Rescue]]" law and sentenced to prison terms.

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Jerry Seinfeld's earnings from the show in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-08/news/9903090088_1_top-earning-forbes-jerry-seinfeld|title=Seinfeld's $267 Million Tops Celebrity-pay List In Forbes|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 8, 1999|access-date=September 9, 2011}}</ref> He refused NBC's offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue the show into a tenth season.

==Production==
''Seinfeld'' began as a twenty-three-minute pilot titled ''[[The Seinfeld Chronicles]]''. Created by [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Larry David]], developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one's shirt, and the effort by men to interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld's apartment.<ref name=TVGuide>Battaglio, Stephen (June 30, 2014). "'Annoying' 'Disorienting' 'Boring': On ''Seinfeld's'' 25th anniversary an exclusive look at the memo that almost killed the show". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 18–19.</ref>

The pilot was filmed at Stage 8 of [[Ren-Mar Studios|Desilu Cahuenga]] studios, the same studio in which ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' was filmed (this was seen by the crew as a good omen),<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Rob Reiner]]|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Inside Looks – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=November 23, 2004}}</ref> and was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in [[Hollywood]].<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN>{{cite video|title=Seinfeld Seasons 1 & 2: Notes about Nothing – "The Seinfeld Chronicles"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=November 23, 2004}}</ref> The pilot was first screened to a group of two dozen NBC executives in [[Burbank, California]] in early 1989. It did not yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[The Golden Girls]].'' [[Brandon Tartikoff]] was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as "Too New York, too Jewish" (a sentiment which would also lead to the Cosmo character's later surname change from the more Jewish-sounding Kessler to Kramer).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krieger|first=Rosalin|date=October 2003|title="Does he actually say the word Jewish?" – Jewish representations inSeinfeld|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=7|issue=4|pages=387–404|doi=10.1080/1479758032000165048|s2cid=144869141|issn=1479-7585}}</ref>  Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as "weak", which [[Warren Littlefield]], then second-in-command in NBC's entertainment division, called "a dagger to the heart".<ref name=TVGuide/> Comments included, "You can't get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat"; "Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character"; "Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast"; and "Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?"<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/> Seinfeld and David did not see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, "We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment."<ref name=TVGuide/>

Around the time the show's pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured [[Ann Jillian]] in her almost-similarly eponymous [[Ann Jillian (TV series)|TV series]]. After ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' tested poorly among audiences, Castle Rock then devoted their focus to Jillian's series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. ''Ann Jillian'' would last only a single season of 13 episodes and would be off the air by the end of 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/seinfeld-finale-at-20-hidden-tales-vault-a-comedians-bizarro-world-1111377 |title='Seinfeld' Finale at 20: Hidden Tales From the Vault of a Comedian's Bizarro World |last=Freeman|first=Marc |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=May 13, 2018 |website=Encyclopedia of Things |access-date=May 16, 2018 |quote=Castle Rock, which owned the series, had two pilots at NBC that year: Seinfeld and one with Ann Jillian. Whereas Seinfeld tested poorly, Ann Jillian tested through the roof and earned a 13-episode commitment. Castle Rock decided to focus on that.}}</ref>

When NBC announced its 1989–90 [prime time] schedule in May 1989, ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' was not included, but supporters of the show did not give up on it. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'',<ref name=TVGuide/> receiving a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 10.9/19.<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/> The ratings did not exhibit regional skew that Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show's supporters. Despite the poor test results, Ludwin canceled one of the [[Bob Hope]] specials budgeted for that season so that the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'', which formed the rest of [[Seinfeld (season 1)|the show's first season]] (the series was by then retitled to just ''Seinfeld'');<ref name=TVGuide/><ref>{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Mike|url=https://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723085248/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/1125seinfeld.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 23, 2012|title=Give thanks for 'The 'Seinfeld' Story'|publisher=azcentral.com|date=November 24, 2004|access-date=March 19, 2008}}</ref> a move without which ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Phil Rosenthal]] later stated there would be no ''Seinfeld''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-08-21/business/0508210218_1_warren-littlefield-rick-ludwin-head-of-nbc-entertainment |author= Rosenthal, Phil |author-link= Phil Rosenthal |date= August 21, 2005 |title= NBC executive stands apart by taking stands|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date= September 26, 2012}}</ref> Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in TV history<ref name=S1&2DVD-NAN/>), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order.<ref name=TVGuide/> The show was renamed simply ''Seinfeld'' and would not return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990; it would be another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, who was in charge of NBC's research department at the time, reminisced, "The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn't unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits."

When it was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season.<ref name="S1&2DVD-NAN" /> NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers. This gave NBC an incentive to keep broadcasting the show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060531-jerry-seinfeld-sitcom-television-nbc-kramer-comedian-stand-up-larry-david.shtml|title=Seinfeld: The Unlikeliest Success Story|publisher=American Heritage|date=May 31, 2006|access-date=March 19, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315041818/http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060531-jerry-seinfeld-sitcom-television-nbc-kramer-comedian-stand-up-larry-david.shtml|archive-date=March 15, 2008}}</ref> One DVD reviewer, Britt Gillette, wrote that "this initial episode exhibits the flashes of brilliance that made ''Seinfeld'' a cultural phenomenon."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gillette|first=Britt|url=http://www.articlecity.com/articles/music_and_movies/article_518.shtml|title=Seinfeld (Seasons 1 & 2) DVD Review|publisher=Article City|date=September 20, 2006|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref>

Other than the pilot, the series was filmed at [[CBS Studio Center]], in [[Studio City, California]]. The first three seasons were filmed on soundstage 19, and the show then moved to the larger stage 9 for the remainder of the series' production.<ref name="Studio Sets Seinfeld">{{cite web |title=Seinfeld Film Locations|url=https://sites.google.com/site/seinfeldfilmlocations/other_locations}}</ref>   Despite using numerous establishing shots taken in New York City,<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite web |title=A guide to 'Seinfeld' filming locations in New York City|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-guide-to-seinfeld-filmi_b_6834026}}</ref> all scenes of the actors walking in New York were also filmed at CBS Studio Center, on their New York Street [[backlot]].<ref name="RobOnLocation.com Youtube">{{cite web |title=New York Backlot at CBS Radford|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc3TGBoxlBc}}</ref>  Other locations on the CBS lot were also used for filming, as well as scenes filmed at [[Paramount Studios]] and [[Warner Bros.

A source of problems for the cast was the small sets, especially that of Jerry's apartment; Alexander noted "If you knew you were doing a series for nine years, you would never build that set". Adding to the issue was that the scripts contained only minimal action lines leading to the actors struggling to come up with actions to perform on the sets. Eventually they got into a routine of directing each other on how to make their movements look natural. Alexander has stated that this helped the cast build chemistry with each other.<ref name=productionweek/>

Tapings of the show would usually go long as the cast and David were perfectionists. If a joke didn't elicit the type of reaction they were hoping for they would rewrite the joke and perform it again. In at least one case, The Marine Biologist, this led to David writing an entirely new scene requiring Alexander to memorize a monologue in only a matter of minutes.<ref name=productionweek>{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye3bFno_1NU|title=Jason Alexander discusses a typical week of production on "Seinfeld" - EMMYTVLEGENDS.ORG|date=July 9, 2014 |publisher=YouTube |author=Archive of American Television}}</ref> Laugh tracks were used but only for matching shots and not for artificially adding laughter to a scene.<ref name=productionweek/>

The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=14589923#post14589923|title='Seinfeld' in HD on TBS HD!

Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame, while restoring previously cropped images on the sides, from the [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] source, to use the entire 16:9 frame.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2008/09/03/seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116201359/http://www.engadget.com/topics/hd/2008/09/03/seinfeld-goes-hd-on-tbs-hd|url-status=dead|archive-date= January 16, 2013|title=Seinfeld goes HD on TBS HD|date=September 3, 2008|publisher=AOL|access-date=October 28, 2009}}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
Elizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of ''Seinfeld'' with recourse to the [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity theory]] of humor: "The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation. For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic."<ref>{{cite journal| author = Magnotta, Elizabeth and Alexandra Strohl| title = A linguistic analysis of humor: A look at ''Seinfeld''| journal = Working Papers of the Linguistics Circle| volume = 21| issue = 1| pages = 126–135| url = http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/WPLC/article/view/5944|access-date=August 2, 2012| date = November 14, 2011}}</ref> Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on "[[The Marine Biologist]]", where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on "[[The Red Dot]]", where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine's expense by giving her a marked-down [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater.

Seinfeld has not reached the same level of popularity around the globe as it has reached in America.{{fact|date=November 2020}} In “Translating ''Seinfeld''”, Jennifer Armstrong notes that ''Seinfeld’s'' unique style of humor is apparently “too cultural and word-based to make for easy translation”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8809723/jerry-seinfeld-tv-show-international-translation|title=Translating Seinfeld|last=Armstrong|first=Jennifer|date=June 25, 2015|website=The Verge|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref>  Carol Iannone sums up the legacy of this American hit in her ''Modern Age'' article “''Seinfeld'': The Politically Incorrect Comedy" when she says, “It may be the first situation comedy truly to achieve the status of art”.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="politically-incorrect" />

Nod Miller, of the [[University of East London]], has discussed the self-referential qualities of the show:

{{quote|Seinfeld is suffused with [[postmodernism|postmodern]] themes. To begin with, the boundary between reality and fiction is frequently blurred: this is illustrated in the central device of having Jerry Seinfeld play the character Jerry Seinfeld. In the show's fourth season, several episodes revolved around the narrative of Jerry and George (whose character is co-creator Larry David's alter ego) pitching 'a show about nothing' based on the everyday life of a stand-up comedian to NBC. The reaction of the fictional NBC executives, by all accounts, mirrored the initial responses of those who eventually commissioned Seinfeld. The fourth season ends with [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|'The Pilot']], an episode focusing on the casting, taping and screening of the show-within-the-show, ''Jerry''. This episode also illustrates neatly the self-referential quality which is one of Seinfeld's hallmarks. The series finale was so replete with references to earlier shows as to render it largely incomprehensible to those not already well-versed in the personae and preoccupations of the Seinfeld universe.<ref>{{cite web| author = Miller, Nod| title = Applying Insights from Cultural Studies to Adult Education: What Seinfeld Says About the AERC| url = http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140624022756/http://www.adulterc.org/Proceedings/1999/99miller.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date = June 24, 2014| publisher = Adult Education Research Conference| access-date = August 1, 2012}}</ref>}}

==Consumer products==
A recurring feature of ''Seinfeld'' was its inclusion of specific products, especially [[candy]], as plot points. These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., [[Junior Mints]], [[Twix]], [[Chuckles]], [[Jujyfruits]], bite size [[3 Musketeers (chocolate bar)|Three Musketeers]], [[Snickers]], [[Nestlé Chunky]], [[Oh Henry!]], [[Drake's Cakes|Drake's]] Coffee Cake and [[PEZ]]), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. [[Oh Henry!]] bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., [[Chuckles]], [[Clark Bar]], [[Twinkies]]). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.

The show's creators claim that they weren't engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, quite unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. "I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie", explained ''Seinfeld'' writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in ''The Hollywood Reporter''. "At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, 'No, Junior Mints are just funnier.'"<ref>{{cite news|title=A look at some of the biggest hits in movie and TV product placement|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011140335/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000901395 |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 28, 2005|access-date=November 10, 2007|author=Staff}}</ref>

Many advertisers capitalized on the popularity of ''Seinfeld''. [[American Express]] created a [[webisode]] where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated [[Superman]] (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]], who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the [[Contraceptive sponge|Today Sponge]] created the "Spongeworthy" game, on their website, inspired by "[[The Sponge]]". An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a [[Chrysler]] commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with [[Lee Iacocca]] plays on his George's relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for [[Vodafone]] which ran in [[Australia]] where he dressed and acted exactly like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls.

In addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] brand called "Hennigan's" (a blend of "[[Hennessy]]" and "[[Brannigans]]") and a [[canned meat]] product called "Beef-a-reeno" (a parody of "[[Chef Boyardee|Beef-a-roni]]").

==After ''Seinfeld''==

===Another scene===
On the November 1, 2007, episode of ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene, after the characters leave jail. He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but didn't announce what the scene would entail, as its production isn't a certainty.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode dated 1 November 2007|series=The Daily Show|series-link=The Daily Show|network=[[Comedy Central]]|credits=Axler, Rachel; Bleyer, Kevin; Blomquist, Richard; Bodow, Steve; Carvell, Tim; Havlan, J.R.; Scott Jacobson, Scott; Javerbaum, David; Karlin, Ben; Kutner, Rob; Lieb, Josh; Means, Sam; Reich, Jason; Ross, Jason; Stewart, Jon|airdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>

In commentary from the final season [[DVD]], Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk's Cafe, with George saying "That was brutal" in reference to the foursome's stint in prison.<ref>{{cite video|title=[[Seinfeld (season 9)|Seinfeld Season 9]]: Notes about Nothing&nbsp;– "The Finale"|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|date=November 6, 2007}}</ref>

On an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' that Jerry Seinfeld hosted on October 2, 1999, a sketch was produced that showed what life was like for Jerry behind bars after being transferred to the fictional prison portrayed on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.<ref>[[Saturday Night Live season 25]]</ref> The roughly four-minute sketch shows the opening credits for the HBO series with clips of Jerry mixed in doing various activities around the prison. The sketch continues and mixes in different story lines from both ''Oz'' and ''Seinfeld'' and has Jerry interacting with various characters from the show in his typical quick-witted, sarcastic way.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99aoz.phtml | title=SNL Transcripts: Jerry Seinfeld: 10/02/99: Oz| date=October 8, 2018}}</ref>

===The ''Seinfeld'' "curse"===
<!--"SEINFELD CURSE" SECTION — PLEASE NOTE BEFORE EDITING: This section deals exclusively with "Seinfeld curse" shows, that is, shows 1] starring Jason, Michael and Julia in title roles, 2] following directly upon the end of Seinfeld, 3] and which were quickly canceled. DO ''not'' add other shows here, especially shows currently in production; add them above.-->
Louis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term ''Seinfeld curse'': the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person's ''Seinfeld'' popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the ''Seinfeld curse'' are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's ''[[Watching Ellie]]'', Jason Alexander's ''[[Bob Patterson (TV series)|Bob Patterson]]'' and ''[[Listen Up! (TV series)|Listen Up!]]'', and Michael Richards' ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]''.

This phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of [[Larry David]]'s HBO program ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', which aired in 2001. In real life, David has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a curse, saying, "It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gregbaerg.com/articles/David.html|title='Curb's' Larry David: 'Seinfeld' Curse 'Idiotic'|author=Baerg, Greg|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=March 5, 2002|access-date=May 17, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An Extremely Awkward Encounter with Larry David |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a5955/larry-david-interview-0709/ |first=Scott |last=Raab |date=September 18, 2009 |work=Esquire}}</ref>

The success of Louis-Dreyfus in the 2006–2010 [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', which included winning the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series]] in 2006, led many to believe that she had broken the curse.<ref>Susman, Gary (March 21, 2006) "[http://popwatch.ew.com/2006/03/21/old_christine_c/ Has Julia Louis Dreyfus broken the 'Seinfeld' curse?]" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' Retrieved August 29, 2008</ref> In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, "I'm not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b53166_Emmys_Clock_into_quot24quot_quotOfficequot.html |last=Hall |first=Sarah|title=Emmys Clock into "24", "Office"|publisher=[[E! News]]|date=August 27, 2006|access-date=May 17, 2007}}</ref> The show produced [[100 episodes|enough episodes]] to air in [[rerun]]s in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] for several years, something the other shows did not achieve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/cbs-cancels-shows-including-ghost-53669|title=CBS cancels seven shows, including 'Ghost,' 'Case'|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 18, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Nevertheless, the series ratings declined soon after and it was cancelled after the fifth season.  She went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President [[Selina Meyer]] in the HBO comedy series ''[[Veep (TV series)|Veep]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/julia-louis-dreyfus-wins-emmy-lead-actress-comedy-series-1202559690/|title=Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes Emmy history|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=September 18, 2016|website=Variety|access-date=September 18, 2017}}</ref>

===''Curb Your Enthusiasm''===
{{Main|Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|Seinfeld (Curb Your Enthusiasm)}}
Early in March 2009, it was announced that the ''Seinfeld'' cast would reunite for [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|season seven]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/03/05/seinfeld-cast-t/|author=Rice, Lynette|title=Exclusive: 'Seinfeld' cast to appear on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'|magazine=[[EW.com]]|date=March 5, 2009|access-date=March 5, 2009}}</ref> The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing their real life selves. The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a ''Seinfeld'' reunion show as a ploy to get his ex-wife, Cheryl, back. Along with the four main characters, some ''Seinfeld'' supporting actors like [[Wayne Knight]], [[Estelle Harris]] and [[Steve Hytner]] appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show. Though much dialogue in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the ''Seinfeld'' special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by ''Seinfeld'' regular [[Andy Ackerman]], making this the first time since ''Seinfeld'' went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.

===''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee''===
{{Main|Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee#ep22|l1=The Over-Cheer (Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee)}}
[[Jerry Seinfeld]], Jason Alexander and Wayne Knight, playing their respective ''Seinfeld'' characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] on February 2, 2014.<ref name="Superbowl">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/business/media/halftime-brings-a-much-anticipated-seinfeld-reunion.html?_r=0|title=Halftime Brings a Much-Anticipated 'Seinfeld' Reunion|date=Feb 2, 2014|access-date=Feb 2, 2014|first=Bill|last=Carter}}</ref> [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl's location being New York that year.<ref name="Superbowl" /> An uncut version appeared on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle.com]] immediately afterward, as an episode of ''[[Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee]]'' titled "The Over-Cheer".<ref name="Superbowl" />  Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld's web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, which produces the series, did not pay for it.<ref name="Superbowl" /> Seinfeld has indicated that he thinks the webisode will probably be the last cast reunion, saying, "I have a feeling you've seen the final coda on that very unique experience."<ref>{{cite web|last=Etkin|first=Jaimie|title=Jerry Seinfeld Thinks That "Seinfeld" Super Bowl Reunion Is The Last One We'll See|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jaimieetkin/jerry-seinfeld-thinks-that-seinfeld-super-bowl-reunion-is-th|work=BuzzFeed |department=Entertainment|access-date=February 18, 2014|date=February 3, 2014}}</ref> Since then, [[Michael Richards]] and [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] have also appeared in episodes.
