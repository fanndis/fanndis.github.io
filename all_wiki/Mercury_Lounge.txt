== History ==
The Mercury Lounge was founded in 1993 by Michael Swier, Michael Winsch, and Brian Swier, the three of whom went on to open a string of venues and promotions companies in New York City and Los Angeles. The Mercury Lounge is an independent indie venue to this day, and is known for launching the careers of many talented bands.

In 2016, the Mercury Lounge, the Bowery Ballroom, and its founders parted ways<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/arts/music/bowery-presents-aeg-mercury-lounge-bowery-ballroom.html|title=Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge Split From Concert Promoter Bowery Presents|last=Sisario|first=Ben|date=2017-08-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> with promotions company Bowery Presents when it was acquired by AEG.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2015/07/08/michael-swiers-musical-manifest-destiny-reaches-from-the-bowery-to-los-angeles/|title=Michael Swier’s Musical Manifest Destiny Reaches From the Bowery to Los Angeles|website=www.villagevoice.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> (The Bowery ''Presents'' was cofounded in 2004-05 by Michael Swier, John Moore, Michael Winsch, and Brian Swier in order to promote live shows in open venues.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/michael-swier-is-the-proud-new-yorker-behind-l-a-s-coolest-new-music-venue/|title=Michael Swier Is the Proud New Yorker Behind L.A.'s Coolest New Music Venue|last=Hughes|first=Hilary|date=2015-07-13|website=LA Weekly|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>

The Mercury Lounge and The Bowery Ballroom retained their independence and are no longer affiliated with the Bowery Presents and book their own shows. The two clubs have formed joint ventures with Live Nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/live-nation-forms-new-venture-with-new-yorks-bowery-ballroom-and-mercury-lounge-1202643638/|title=Live Nation Forms New Venture With New York’s Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge|last=Aswad|first=Jem|date=2017-12-18|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-york-citys-legendary-bowery-ballroom-and-mercury-lounge-join-the-pandora-ticketfly-platform-300259167.html|title=New York City's Legendary Bowery Ballroom and Mercury Lounge Join the Pandora-Ticketfly Platform|last=Ticketfly|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>

The building in which the Mercury Lounge resides has an interesting history. Located at 217 [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|East Houston Street]], the space once housed the servants to the [[Astor family|Astor]] mansion, and even connected to it via an underground labyrinth of tunnels{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}. In the early part of the 20th century, Garfein's Restaurant occupied the space, and from 1933 to 1993 the storefront housed a tombstone seller.

== Notable acts ==
In 2000, the New York City band [[The Strokes]] got their start after playing the Mercury Lounge. Ryan Gentles, the Mercury Lounge's booker, quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-strokes-mn0000568137/biography |title=The Strokes Biography  |publisher=Allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}</ref> Other acts include Radiohead, Chris Martin, Arcade Fire, Lady Gaga, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Between Giants, Interpol, Palomar, Rival Schools, Mates of State,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amny.com/things-to-do/nyc-small-music-venues-1.18351069|title=A guide to the city's small music venues|website=am New York|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref> and numerous others.
