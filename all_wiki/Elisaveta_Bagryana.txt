'''Elisaveta Bagryana''' ({{lang-bg|Елисавета Багряна}}) (16 April, 1893&nbsp;– 23 March, 1991), born '''Elisaveta Lyubomirova Belcheva''' ({{lang-bg|Елисавета Любомирова Белчева}}), was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] poet who wrote her first verses while living with her family in [[Veliko Tarnovo]] in 1907–08. She, along with [[Dora Gabe]] (1886–1983), is considered one of the "first ladies of Bulgarian women's literature". She was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] three times.<ref name= nobel></ref>

Elisaveta Lyubomirova Belcheva was born on April 16, 1893 in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria in clerk's family.<ref name="hemus" /> She finished her primary and secondary education in the capital city. She lived a year (1907-08) with her family in [[Veliko Tarnovo|the town of Tarnovo]], where she wrote her first poems.<ref name="hemus" /> Between 1910 and 1911 she taught in the village of Aftani, where she experienced rural life, after which she studied Slavic philology at [[Sofia University]]. Her first poems &mdash; ''Why'' ("Защо") and ''Night Song''  ("Вечерна песен") &mdash; were published in 1915 in the magazine ''Contemporary Thought'' (''Съвременна мисъл'').

It was after [[World War I]] ended that she truly entered into the literary world, at a time when poetry was undergoing a transformation. By 1921, she was already active in the literary life, and was collaborating on the ''Newspaper of the Woman'' ("Вестник на жената") and the magazine ''Modernity'' ("Съвременник"), among other publications.

With the arrival of her first book, ''The Eternal and the Holy'' ("Вечната и святата", 1927), she earned the confirmation of her peers. She also started writing children's stories.
Her poems are straightforward, sensitive and serious, as in ''The Well'' ("Кладенецът"), a fable-like piece relating a well she dug when a little girl to the wellspring of poetry in her soul. They often are undeniably feminine&nbsp;– as in the poem ''The Eternal'', in which the writer contemplates the body of a dead mother, or Evening Prayer&nbsp;– and spirited, as shown by the youthful, rebellious spirit in ''The Elements''.

Bagryana passed her life surrounded by words, editing a number of magazines and writing. Her works have been translated into over 30 languages. Her poems are most recently available in a book entitled ''Penelope of the 21st Century: Selected poems of Elisaveta Bagryana'', translated by Brenda Walker.

Bagryana was a friend of Pétar Russév, father of Brazilian politician [[Dilma Rousseff]], who won election as [[President of Brazil|Brazil's first female President]] on 31 October 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aba.government.bg/bg/BGpoSveta/Kariera/20050705-1.html |title=ДИЛМА РУСЕФ Е ДЯСНАТА РЪКА НА ПРЕЗИДЕНТА ИГНАСИО ЛУЛА ДА СИЛВА ("President Ignacio Lula da Silva's right hand is Dilma Rousseff") |publisher=www.aba.government.bg |language=Bulgarian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629222553/http://www.aba.government.bg/bg/BGpoSveta/Kariera/20050705-1.html |archivedate=2007-06-29 }}</ref>
