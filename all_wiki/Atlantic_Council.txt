The '''Atlantic Council''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Atlanticism|Atlanticist]] [[think tank]] in the field of [[international affairs]]. Founded in 1961, it provides a forum for international political, business, and intellectual leaders. It manages ten regional centers and functional programs related to international security and global economic prosperity. It is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It is a member of the [[Atlantic Treaty Association]].

==History==
The Atlantic Council was founded with the stated mission to encourage the continuation of [[Atlanticism|cooperation between North America and Europe]] that began after [[World War II]]. In its early years, its work consisted largely of publishing policy papers and polling Europeans and Americans about their attitudes towards transatlantic and international cooperation. In these early years its primary focus was on economic issues—mainly encouraging free trade between the two continents, and to a lesser extent to the rest of the world—but it also did some work on political and environmental issues.<ref name="Paper">{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/96-98/small.pdf|title=The Atlantic Council--The Early Years|last=Small|first=Melvin|date=1 June 1998|publisher=[[NATO]]|accessdate=15 November 2015}}</ref>

Although the Atlantic Council did publish policy papers and [[monograph]]s, [[Melvin Small]] of [[Wayne State University]] wrote that, especially in its early years, the Council's real strength lay in its connections to influential policymakers. The Council early on found a niche as "center for informal get-togethers" of leaders from both sides of the Atlantic, with members working to develop "networks of continuing communication".<ref name="Paper" />

The Atlantic Council also works outside Europe and the U.S. It was among the first organizations advocating an increased Japanese presence in the international community. Its Asian programs have expanded since 2001 as a consequence of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] leading to the opening of its South Asia Center and Program on Asia. [[Climate change]], and coordinating with India and China on these issues, were also a factor in this development.<ref name="Paper" /><ref name="transcript3">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/news/transcripts/keating-timothy-6-29-2009-transcript|title=Admiral Timothy Keating Event Transcript|date=29 June 2009|publisher=Atlantic Council|accessdate=15 November 2015}}</ref>

In February 2009, [[James L. Jones]], then-chairman of the Atlantic Council, stepped down in order to serve as President Obama's new [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and was succeeded by Senator [[Chuck Hagel]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/playbook/0209/playbook583.html|title=Politico Playbook - Exclusive: Senator Hagel succeeds Gen.

Four years later, Hagel stepped down to serve as [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of Defense]]. Gen. [[Brent Scowcroft]] served as interim chairman of the organization's Board of Directors until January 2014, when former ambassador to China and [[governor of Utah]] [[Jon Huntsman Jr.]]<ref name=Huntsman>{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Tom|title=Jon Huntsman tapped as Atlantic Council chairman|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/15/jon-huntsman-tapped-atlantic-council-chairman/|accessdate=16 January 2014|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=16 January 2014}}</ref> was appointed.

Former [[NATO]] Secretary General [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] called the Council a "pre-eminent think tank" with a "longstanding reputation",<ref name="transcript1">[http://www.acus.org/event/nato-secretary-general-rasmussen-first-major-us-speech/transcript-full Rasmussen, Anders Fogh: 9/28/2009 — Transcript] ''www.acus.org'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124232150/http://www.acus.org/event/nato-secretary-general-rasmussen-first-major-us-speech/transcript-full |website=www.acus.org |date=November 24, 2009 }}</ref> and former U.S. Senator [[Richard Lugar]] (R-IN) noted that the Council is "held in high esteem within the Atlantic community".<ref name="transcript2">[http://www.acus.org/event/senator-richard-lugar-congressional-perspective-future-nato/transcript-full Richard Lugar NATO Speech 9/28/2009 Transcript Full] ''www.acus.org'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606030204/http://www.acus.org/event/senator-richard-lugar-congressional-perspective-future-nato/transcript-full |date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref>

==Connections and funding==

The Atlantic Council has, since its inception, stated it is a [[nonpartisan]] institution, with members "from the moderate internationalist wings of both parties" in the United States.<ref name="small">{{cite web|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/10055558/the-atlantic-council-the-early-years-by-melvin-small-nato/21|title=Melvin Small, "The Atlantic Council — The Early Years," page 21 (Wayne State University: June 1, 1998)|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> Despite its connections, the Council is by charter independent of the U.S. government and NATO, a [[501(c)(3)|registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization]].<ref name="Paper" />

In September 2014, Eric Lipton reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that since 2008, the US organization had received donations from more than twenty-five foreign governments. Lipton reports that a major donor [[Bahaa Hariri]] complained to the Council about the founding head of the Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East calling the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi in Egypt a military coup. Four months later, the founding head resigned from her position.<ref name="Lipton1">{{cite news |author1=Eric Lipton |author2=Brooke Williams |author3=Nicholas Confessore  |date=6 September 2014 |title=Foreign Powers Buy Influence at Think Tanks |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/foreign-powers-buy-influence-at-think-tanks.html|newspaper=New York Times |access-date=31 January 2015 }}</ref>

It outlined common values that all western liberal democracies should adhere to, and was produced in response to a perceived movement toward more authoritarianism by western democracies; the declaration was signed by scores of former government officials and other experts.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/14/fred-kempe-how-the-us-european-alliance-can-become-even-stronger-in-an-era-of-disruption.html | title=How the US-European alliance can become even stronger in an era of disruption | last=Kempe | first=Fred | date=14 February 2019 | website=CNBC | accessdate=2 May 2019 }}</ref>

In July 2019, Russia said the activities of the Atlantic Council "pose a threat to the fundamentals of the constitutional system and the security of the Russian Federation". Russia added the Atlantic Council to its list of “undesirable” organizations, preventing it from operating within Russia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Russia declares Atlantic Council think tank an 'undesirable' organization – what exactly is it? |url=https://www.rt.com/russia/465086-atlantic-council-russia-undesirable/ |accessdate=26 July 2019 |publisher=RT |date=25 July 2019}}</ref>

In September 2020, the Council started the '''Counterterrorism Study Group''' ('''CTSG'''), a bipartisan network of former U.S. Government professionals with extensive experience in counterterrorism policymaking and operations. The CTSG is made up of those who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations on the [[National Security Council]] staff; at the departments of State, Defense, Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and the [[National Counterterrorism Center]]. The CTSG's stated purpose was to understand emerging trends and future predictions in CT and to explore creative new proposals for improving the effectiveness of current CT policies and operations.<ref name=CTSG>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/middle-east-programs/scowcroft-middle-east-security-initiative/counterterrorism-study-group/|title=Counterterrorism Study Group |website=www.atlanticcouncil.org |accessdate= 14 November 2020}}</ref> A list of the experts include [[Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley]], [[Mark E.
