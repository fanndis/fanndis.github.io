'''Jennifer Lee''' is an [[Antarctic]] researcher, best known for her work on invasion biology.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2010/01/21/antarctica-no-place-for-old-socks---or-alien-seed|title=Antarctica no place for old socks - or alien seed|website=Business Day Live|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> She is the Environment Officer in the Government of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.gs/information/personnel/|title=Personnel|website=www.gov.gs|publisher=Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Lee grew up in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], UK. She received her PhD from the Centre for Invasion Biology, [[Stellenbosch University]], South Africa.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.south-atlantic-research.org/our-people/research-fellows/68-jenniferlee|title=Dr Jennifer Lee|last=Blockley|first=David|website=www.south-atlantic-research.org|access-date=2016-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809153247/http://www.south-atlantic-research.org/our-people/research-fellows/68-jenniferlee|archive-date=2016-08-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> She then worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Invasion Biology, Stellenbosch University.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="antarctica.gov.au">{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/magazine/2011-2015/issue-21-2011/subantarctic-forum/preventing-a-marine-invasion-in-the-subantarctic|title=Preventing a marine invasion in the subantarctic|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref>

==Career and impact==
Lee is an ecologist and has focused on [[Antarctic]] and [[sub-Antarctic]] systems since 2006.<ref name=":4" /> Lee has diverse interests including invasion biology,<ref name="antarctica.gov.au"/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Preventing a marine invasion in the sub-Antarctic|journal=ECOS|language=en|volume=2011|issue=164|doi=10.1071/EC11072|year=1974|last1=Pyper|first1=Wendy}}</ref> population genetics,<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://academic.sun.ac.za/cib/news/news_cib_postdoc_scar_fellowship.htm|title=CIB DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology|website=academic.sun.ac.za|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> species distribution modelling and invertebrate physiology. Her  research on alien species in Antarctica influenced global thinking about the risks posed by the increased presence of alien vegetation due to [[Tourism in Antarctica|Antarctic tourism]] and [[Research stations in Antarctica|Antarctic research teams]].<ref name=":0" />

Lee has completed several field seasons on [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]] and three field seasons in the Antarctic; for two of these Antarctic field seasons she was the field operator, making her the first woman field operator for the [[South African National Antarctic Programme]] (SANAP). She was also the second woman Chief Scientist for land based science during a field season to Marion Island.

Lee moved to the [[Falkland Islands]] to begin work as the Environment Officer in the Government of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] in early 2012.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.gs/information/personnel/|title=Personnel {{!}} Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands|website=www.gov.gs|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> She is works on projects to eradicate non-native plants and animals (including rats and [[Reindeer in South Georgia|reindeer]])<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/10648170/Thousands-of-reindeer-culled-in-UK-territory.html|title=Thousands of reindeer culled in UK territory|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-19|date=2014-02-19|last1=Edgar|first1=James}}</ref> from South Georgia, and then monitors ecosystem recovery after removal of these pest species. She uses her research to help inform management decisions.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

==Awards and honours==
Lee was the first scientist from a South African Institute to be awarded a highly competitive [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]] (SCAR) fellowship.<ref name=":3" />
