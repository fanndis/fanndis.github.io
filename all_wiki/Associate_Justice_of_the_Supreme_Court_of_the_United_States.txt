An '''associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States''' is any member of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] other than the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice of the United States]]. The number of associate justices is eight, as set by the [[Judiciary Act of 1869]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Kermit L. |last=Hall |chapter=Judiciary Act of 1869 |title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States |editor-first=Kermit L. |editor-last=Hall |editor2-first=James W. |editor2-last=Ely |editor3-first=Joel B. |editor3-last=Grossman |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |page=548 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC&pg=PA548 }}</ref>

[[Appointments Clause|Article II, Section 2, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants [[plenary power]] to the [[President of the United States|president]] to nominate, and with the [[advice and consent]] (confirmation) of the [[United States Senate|Senate]], appoint justices to the Supreme Court. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III, Section 1]] of the Constitution effectively grants [[life tenure]] to associate justices, and all other [[United States federal judge|federal judges]], which ends only when a justice dies, retires, resigns, or is removed from office by [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]].<ref>{{cite web| last1=McMillion| first1=Barry J.| last2=Rutkus| first2=Denis Steven| date=July 6, 2018| title=Supreme Court Nominations, 1789 to 2017: Actions by the Senate, the Judiciary Committee, and the President| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33225.pdf| publisher=Congressional Research Service| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref>

Each Supreme Court justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any other justice. However, the chief justice—when in the majority—decides who writes the court's opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the chief justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The chief justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other justices do not and is paid slightly more ($270,700 per year as of 2019, as opposed to $258,900 per year for each associate justice).<ref name="salary">{{cite web| url=http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-compensation| title=Judicial Compensation| work=United States Courts| accessdate=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

Associate justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the chief justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior justice of the two. Currently, the senior associate justice is [[Clarence Thomas]]. By tradition, when the justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Supreme Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. The senior associate justice is also tasked with carrying out the chief justice's duties when he is unable to, or if that office is vacant.<ref>{{USC|28|3}}</ref> Historically, associate justices were styled "Mr. Justice" in court opinions and other writings. The title was shortened to "Justice" in 1980, a year before [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] became the first female justice.<ref name="Biskupic">{{cite book |first = Joan |last = Biskupic |title = Sandra Day O'Connor: How the First Woman on the Supreme Court Became Its Most Influential Justice |location = New York |publisher = HarperCollins |year = 2005 |page = 101 }}</ref>

== Current associate justices ==

There are currently eight associate justices on the Supreme Court, with the most recent appointment being that of [[Amy Coney Barrett]], who was sworn in on October 27, 2020, succeeding [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The justices, ordered by seniority, are:

==Retired associate justices==
An associate justice who leaves the Supreme Court after attaining the age and meeting the service requirements prescribed by federal statute ({{USCode|28|371}}) may retire rather than resign. After retirement, they keep their title, and by custom may also keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, and employ law clerks. The names of retired associate justices continue to appear alongside those of the active justices in the bound volumes of Supreme Court decisions. Federal statute ({{USCode|28|294}}) provides that retired Supreme Court justices may serve—if designated and assigned by the chief justice—on panels of the U.S. courts of appeals, or on the U.S. district courts. Retired justices are not, however, authorized to take part in the consideration or decision of any cases before the Supreme Court (unlike other retired federal judges who may be permitted to do so in their former courts); neither are they known or designated as a "senior judge". When, after his retirement, [[William O. Douglas]] attempted to take a more active role than was customary, maintaining that it was his prerogative to do so because of his senior status, he was rebuffed by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and admonished by the whole Court.<ref>{{cite book| author1-link=Bob Woodward| last1=Woodward| first1=Robert| author2-link=Scott Armstrong (journalist)| last2=Armstrong| first2=Scott|title=[[The Brethren (Woodward and Armstrong book)|The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court]]| date=1979| pages=480–488, 526| isbn=978-0-7432-7402-9| publisher=Simon & Schuster| location=New York}}</ref>

There are three living retired associate justices: [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], retired January 31, 2006; [[David Souter]], retired June 29, 2009; and [[Anthony Kennedy]], retired July 31, 2018. Souter occasionally serves on panels of the Courts of Appeals of various circuits. O'Connor did as well for several years following her retirement, but no longer does. Kennedy has not performed any judicial duties since retiring.
