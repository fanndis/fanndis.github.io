==History of use in Canada==
By the early 1700s, the maple leaf had been adopted as an emblem by the [[French Canadian]]s along the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref>[http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Nation/NatSym.html#r10 National Symbols<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Its popularity with French Canadians continued and was reinforced when, at the inaugural meeting of the [[Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste]] in 1834,<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/o3_e.cfm Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion page for Maple Leaf]</ref> the maple leaf was one of numerous emblems proposed to represent the society. Speaking in its favour, [[Jacques Viger (1787–1858)|Jacques Viger]], the first mayor of [[Montreal]], described the maple as "the king of our forest; ... the symbol of the Canadian people."

The maple leaf slowly caught on as a national symbol: in 1868, it was included in the [[coat of arms of Ontario]] and the [[coat of arms of Quebec]], and was added to the [[Canadian coat of arms]] in 1921. Historically, the golden maple leaf had represented Ontario, while the green maple leaf had represented Quebec.<ref>[http://www.onzone.ca/english/ontario/symbols/shield.asp Shield of Arms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207232357/http://www.onzone.ca/english/ontario/symbols/shield.asp |date=2009-12-07 }}</ref> In 1867, [[Alexander Muir]] composed the patriotic "[[The Maple Leaf Forever]]", which became an unofficial anthem in English-speaking Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Mike Strobel|title=Should we drop O Canada and revert to Maple Leaf Forever?|url=https://torontosun.com/2013/10/07/should-we-drop-o-canada-and-revert-to-maple-leaf-forever|accessdate=2020-10-13|website=Toronto Sun|publisher=|language=en-CA}}</ref> From 1876 until 1901, the leaf appeared on all [[Canadian coins]], and remained on the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]] after 1901.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Robert Sibley|title=A short history of the Maple Leaf flag|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/a-short-history-of-the-maple-leaf-flag|accessdate=2020-10-13|website=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=|language=en-CA}}</ref> During the [[First World War]], badges of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] were often based on a maple leaf design.<ref>{{Cite web|title=General List Cap Badge|url=https://www.warmuseum.ca/s3/supplyline/assets/teacherresources/CWM_SupplyLine_GeneralListCapBadge_EN_FINAL_20140922.pdf|accessdate=2020-10-13|publisher=War Museum}}</ref> The use of the maple leaf as a [[regimental symbol]] extended back to the 1800s, and Canadian soldiers in the [[Second Boer War]] were distinguished by a maple leaf on their sun helmets.<ref>{{Cite web|title=WarMuseum.ca - South African War - The Canadian Uniform|url=https://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/canadianuniforms_e.html|accessdate=2020-10-13|website=www.warmuseum.ca|publisher=War Museum|language=en}}</ref> In 1957 the maple leaf colour on the Canadian arms was changed from green to red<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2017-08-28|title=The history of the National Flag of Canada|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/flag-canada-history.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-13|website=aem}}</ref> - some maple leaves are commonly red even in spring as they bud & no seasonal colouring has been assigned heraldically.

The maple leaf finally became the central national symbol with the introduction of the [[Canadian flag]] (suggested by [[George Stanley|George F. G. Stanley]] and sponsored by M.P. [[John Matheson]]) in 1965, which uses a highly stylized eleven-pointed maple leaf, referring to no specific species of maple.<ref name=":0" /> Earlier official uses of a maple leaf design often used more than 30 points and a short stem. The one chosen is a generic maple leaf representing the ten species of maple tree native to Canada—at least one of these species grows natively in every province.<ref>[http://www.mapleleavesforever.com/default.asp Maple Leaves Forever<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125220137/http://www.mapleleavesforever.com/default.asp |date=2009-11-25 }}</ref> The maple leaf is currently used on the [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]], logos of various Canadian-based companies (including Canadian [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] of foreign companies and small businesses with only local operations) and the logos of Canadian sports teams.
