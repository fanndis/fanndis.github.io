'''Super Bowl LIII''' was an [[American football]] game played to determine the champion of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[2018 NFL season|2018 season]]. The [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) champion [[2018 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] defeated the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) champion [[2018 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], 13–3. The game was played on February 3, 2019, at [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. This was the first [[Super Bowl]] played at that stadium, and the third one held in Atlanta.

The Patriots' victory was their sixth, tying the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] for the [[list of Super Bowl champions|most Super Bowl championships]]. New England, after finishing the regular season with a 11–5 record, advanced to their 11th Super Bowl appearance, their fourth in five years, their ninth, and final under both the leadership of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and quarterback [[Tom Brady]]. The Rams, who finished the regular season with a 13–3 record under 33-year-old head coach [[Sean McVay]] and third-year quarterback [[Jared Goff]], advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance overall, and their first one since [[National Football League franchise moves and mergers|relocating]] back from [[St. Louis]] to [[Los Angeles]] in [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. Super Bowl LIII was a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], a 20–17 Patriots win over the Rams that gave the [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|Belichick–Brady]] tandem its first Super Bowl championship. Coincidentally, the Patriots reached that Super Bowl with an 11–5 record as well. With the Rams now playing in Los Angeles, Super Bowl LIII marked the first Super Bowl appearance of a Los Angeles-based team since the then-[[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]]' victory in [[Super Bowl XVIII]] and the Rams' first Super Bowl appearance as a [[Los Angeles]]-based team since [[Super Bowl XIV]]. This marked the 14th meeting in a major sports championship between the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]] and [[Greater Boston]] areas.

Super Bowl LIII was the lowest-scoring Super Bowl game in history, eclipsing the previous record of 14–7 held by [[Super Bowl VII]], and the lowest-scoring league championship contest since a 14–0 score was recorded during the [[1949 NFL Championship Game]]. It also marked the first Super Bowl with no touchdowns scored by either team in the first three quarters, as the Patriots and the Rams battled to a 3–3 tie as they entered the fourth quarter. New England then scored 10 unanswered points for the victory, as their lone touchdown tied them with the [[New York Jets]] in [[Super Bowl III]] for the fewest touchdowns by a winning Super Bowl team. The Rams ended up as only the second Super Bowl team to not score a touchdown, joining the [[Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VI]]. Patriots wide receiver [[Julian Edelman]], who caught 10 passes for 141 yards, was named [[Super Bowl MVP]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|title=Patriots WR Julian Edelman named Super Bowl LIII MVP|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001016167/article/patriots-wr-julian-edelman-named-super-bowl-liii-mvp|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=February 3, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

The broadcast of the game on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], along with the [[Super Bowl LIII halftime show|halftime show]] headlined by U.S. pop group [[Maroon 5]], saw the smallest Super Bowl audience in 10 years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patten|first=Dominic|title=Super Bowl Viewership Falls To Lowest Since 2008 In Historically Low Scoring Game|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/super-bowl-ratings-patriots-rams-marron-5-worlds-best-cbs-1202548893/|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 3, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

On May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host Super Bowl LIII in 2019, LIV in 2020, and LV in 2021. NFL owners voted on these cities on May 24, 2016, with the first round of voting determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, the second round deciding a different site for [[Super Bowl LIV]] and the third round deciding the site for [[Super Bowl LV]]. The four finalists for Super Bowl LIII, all in the [[Southeastern United States]], were:<ref name="CBS20150519">{{cite news|last=Wagner-McGough|first=Sean|title=Finalists for 2019, 2020 Super Bowls: Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Tampa|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25190240/finalists-for-2019-2020-super-bowls-atlanta-miami-new-orleans-tampa|publisher=CBS Sports|date=May 19, 2015|access-date=May 21, 2015}}</ref><ref name="ESPN20150519">{{cite news|last=Triplett|first=Mike|title=Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Tampa eye 2019, 2020 Super Bowls|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12916777/atlanta-miami-new-orleans-tampa-bidding-2019-2020-super-bowls|publisher=ESPN|date=May 19, 2015|access-date=May 21, 2015}}</ref>
* [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]: This would be the first Super Bowl played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium after it opened in 2017. The city had previously hosted two Super Bowls at the [[Georgia Dome]], with the last being [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in 2000.
* [[Hard Rock Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]: South Florida had previously hosted 10 Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLIV]] in 2010.

* [[Raymond James Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]: Tampa has hosted four Super Bowls, with the last being [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009.

After three votes, Atlanta was awarded Super Bowl LIII at the NFL owners' meeting on May 24, 2016. The losing candidates, except for New Orleans which removed itself from the voting for all games except Super Bowl LIII due to event conflicts in 2020 and 2021, were then pitted against [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California]] for [[Super Bowl LIV]] and [[Super Bowl LV]] hosting rights.

===Teams===
====New England Patriots====
{{main|2018 New England Patriots season}}
[[File:Julian Edelman 2014.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Julian Edelman]]]]
The Patriots finished the 2018 season with an 11–5 record to earn the #2 seed in the AFC and their 17th season with at least ten wins in their 19 years under 66-year-old head coach [[Bill Belichick]]. They went on to join the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Buffalo Bills]] as the only teams in NFL history to ever reach three consecutive Super Bowls. Though the team had only two [[Pro Bowl]] selections, they scored 436 points (fourth in the league) while giving up only 325 (seventh fewest).<ref name=PFR_NE/>

Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] earned his 14th Pro Bowl selection at age 41, finishing the season with 4,355 passing yards and 29 touchdowns, with only 11 interceptions, while also rushing for 35 yards and two more scores on the ground.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/patriots-tom-brady-ties-nfl-record-14th-pro/story?id=59898060 |title=Patriots' Tom Brady ties NFL record with 14th Pro Bowl selection |date=December 19, 2018 |publisher=ABC News |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> These totals made him just the second quarterback in NFL history to amass 70,000 career passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards. His top receiver from the previous season, [[Brandin Cooks]], was traded to the eventual Super Bowl rival Rams, but [[Julian Edelman]], who had [[2017 New England Patriots season|missed the previous season]] with an torn ACL injury, returned to catch 74 receptions for a team-leading 850 yards and six touchdowns, while also returning 20 punts for 154 yards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000924657/article/rams-acquire-brandin-cooks-in-trade-with-patriots |title=Rams acquire Brandin Cooks in trade with Patriots |publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> Other key receivers included [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]] (35 receptions for 553 yards and three touchdowns) and [[Josh Gordon]] (40 receptions for 720 yards and three touchdowns), though Gordon would end up leaving the team to focus on his mental health after 11 games when faced with a suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] added 47 receptions for 682 yards and three touchdowns. Meanwhile, the running game featured a dynamic new weapon, rookie halfback [[Sony Michel]], who lead the team with 931 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns, along with veteran [[James White (running back)|James White]] who racked up 1,176 yards from scrimmage while leading the team in receptions (87) and total touchdowns (12). On special teams, receiver [[Cordarrelle Patterson]] returned 23 kickoffs for 663 yards and a touchdown, an average of 28.8 yards per return (third in the NFL), while also catching 21 passes for 247 yards, rushing for 228 yards and scoring four touchdowns on offense.<ref name=PFR_NE/>

On defense, defensive end [[Trey Flowers]] led the team with 7.5 sacks and also forced three fumbles. Linebacker [[Kyle Van Noy]] led the team in total tackles (92), while also recording 3.5 sacks, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries. In the secondary, safety [[Duron Harmon]] lead the team in interceptions for the second year in a row with four, while Pro Bowl cornerback [[Stephon Gilmore]] intercepted two passes and forced two fumbles. Safety [[Patrick Chung]] also made an impact with 84 total tackles to go with an interception and a fumble recovery.<ref name=PFR_NE>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2018.htm|title=2018 New England Patriots Statistics & Players|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref> The Patriots secondary also featured twin brothers [[Jason McCourty]] and [[Devin McCourty]], who both had an interception each. Devin had 82 tackles, while Jason had 70.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/02/04/super-bowl-reality-mccourty-twins-even-more-special-than-dream/2765460002/ |title='Surreal' Super Bowl reality for McCourty twins even more special than childhood dream |last=Stapleton |first=Art |website=North Jersey |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref>

====Los Angeles Rams====
{{main|2018 Los Angeles Rams season}}

The Rams finished the 2018 season earning the #2 seed in the NFC, before knocking off the fourth seeded [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the divisional round and top seeded [[New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Championship to earn their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/playoffs.htm |title=2018 NFL Playoff Standings |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> The Rams went from [[2004 St. Louis Rams season|2004]] to [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]] without recording a winning record. After relocating from St. Louis back to Los Angeles and posting a dismal 4–12 season in [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]], the team's fortunes changed with the hiring of 30-year-old head coach [[Sean McVay]], the youngest head coach in NFL history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/index.htm |title=Cleveland/St. Louis/LA Rams Team Encyclopedia |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=February 7, 2019 }}</ref> Under McVay and second year quarterback [[Jared Goff]], who recovered from a lackluster winless rookie season to record a triple digit passer rating, the Rams improved to an 11–5 record in [[2017 Los Angeles Rams season|2017]]. Then in 2018, they won their first eight games and finished the year with a 13–3 record, tying the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|Saints]] for the best record in the NFC.

The Rams offense ranked second in the NFL in both points scored (527) and yards gained (6,738).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/index.htm |title=2018 NFL Standings & Team Stats |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> Goff continued to improve in his third season, setting new career highs in passing yards (4,688, fourth in the NFL), passing touchdowns (32), passer rating (101.1), rushing yards (108) and rushing touchdowns (two). His top receiver was [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]], who caught 86 passes for 1,219 yards and 6 touchdowns. [[Brandin Cooks]], an off-season pickup from the Patriots via trade, also made a big impact with 80 receptions for 1,204 yards and 5 scores. The team's #3 receiver, [[Cooper Kupp]], suffered a season ending injury after catching 40 passes for 566 yards in 8 games, forcing Goff to rely heavily on other targets like [[Gerald Everett]] (32 receptions) and [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]] (29). Pro Bowl running back [[Todd Gurley]] was the team's leading rusher with 1,251 yards (fourth in the NFL) and 17 touchdowns, while also catching 59 passes for 580 yards and five more touchdowns. His 17 rushing touchdowns led the league, while his 22 total touchdowns gave him 132 points, fifth in the NFL. Running back [[C. J. Anderson]], who made the Rams his third different team in 2018 after signing up with them in December, also was a key aspect of the running game, finishing the season with 405 yards and leading the team in rushing in both of their playoff victories. On special teams, [[JoJo Natson]] returned 26 punts for 280 yards, while kicker [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] made 87.1% of his field goals, including a franchise postseason record 57-yard kick to defeat the Saints in overtime in the NFC championship game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lyles |first=Harry |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2019/1/20/18190893/rams-saints-nfc-championship-2019 |title=Greg Zuerlein's 57-yard field goal sends the Rams to Super Bowl 53 |publisher=SBNation.com |date=January 20, 2019 |access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

The Rams defense featured Pro Bowl defensive tackle [[Aaron Donald]], who led the league in sacks with 20.5, as many sacks as the rest of the team combined. He also had 59 tackles (25 for loss), four forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. Veteran defensive lineman [[Ndamukong Suh]] was second on the team with 4.5 sacks, while also getting 59 tackles and recovering two fumbles. Pro Bowl linebacker [[Cory Littleton]] led the team in total tackles with 125, while also picking up four sacks, three interceptions and blocking two punts. The Rams also had a strong secondary, led by [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]] (119 tackles and four interceptions), [[Marcus Peters]] (three interceptions), [[Lamarcus Joyner]] (78 tackles) and [[Aqib Talib]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2018.htm|title=2018 Los Angeles Rams Statistics & Players|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=January 27, 2019}}</ref>

In the playoffs, the Patriots earned a first-round bye as the AFC's second overall seed. In the divisional round, they defeated the [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angeles Chargers]] 41–28, scoring touchdowns on five of their first six possessions. Brady passed for 343 yards and a touchdown, while running back [[Sony Michel]] rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/la-sp-chargers-patriots-20190113-story.html |title=Chargers are done early in 41–28 loss to Patriots |last=Miller |first=Jeff |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 14, 2019 |access-date=February 7, 2019}}</ref> They then defeated the [[2018 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 37–31 in the [[AFC Championship Game]], scoring the game-winning touchdown in overtime. The Patriots held a 14–0 lead at halftime, before the Chiefs rallied to take the lead 21–17 in the fourth quarter. From there, both teams took turns taking the lead, until the Chiefs forced overtime with a 39-yard field goal by [[Harrison Butker]] to tie the game 31–31. In overtime, [[Rex Burkhead]] scored a two-yard touchdown to win the game. Michel ended up rushing for a combined total of 242 yards and five touchdowns in the Patriots' two playoff games, setting an NFL record for postseason rushing touchdowns by a rookie.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goss |first=Nick |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/patriots-sony-michel-sets-nfl-rookie-record-incredible-playoff-run |title=Patriots' Sony Michel sets NFL rookie record with incredible playoff run |publisher=NBC Sports Boston |date=January 21, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref> In the AFC championship game, the Patriots defense held Chiefs receiver [[Tyreek Hill]] and tight end [[Travis Kelce]], who had both gained over 1,300 receiving yards during the season, to a combined total of just four receptions for 65 yards.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duffy |first=Kevin |url=https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/01/21/patriots-defense-erases-tyreek-hill-travis-kelce/ |title=Patriots defense erases Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce |work=Boston Herald |date=January 21, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the Rams also had a first-round bye as the NFC's second overall seed. They started off the divisional round by defeating the [[2018 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 30–22. The Rams gained 273 yards on the ground with running backs [[Todd Gurley]] and [[C. J. Anderson]] rushing for over 100 yards each.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/los-angeles-rams-defeat-dallas-cowboys-advance-with-30-22-victory-2019-01-13/ |title=Los Angeles Rams defeat Dallas Cowboys, advance with 30–22 victory |publisher=CBS News |date=January 13, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref> They then defeated the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] 26–23 in the [[NFC Championship Game]], scoring a game-winning field goal in overtime. The Saints jumped out to an early 13–0 first quarter lead, before the Rams rallied to close the lead to 13–10 at halftime. In the fourth quarter, [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] tied the game at 20–20, with just over 5 minutes remaining. The Saints moved the ball to the Rams' 13 yard line, but could not gain a first down. On third down, quarterback [[Drew Brees]] threw a pass to receiver [[Tommylee Lewis]], who was covered by [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]]. Though Robey-Coleman knocked Lewis to the ground and the pass fell incomplete, no penalty was called and the Saints' [[Wil Lutz]] kicked a 31-yard field goal to take the lead. The Rams took possession and sent the game to overtime with a 48-yard field goal by [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]]. In overtime, Brees threw an interception on their first drive and Zuerlein kicked a 57-yard field goal to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/01/20/saints-vs-rams-nfc-championship/ |title=Rams beat Saints in NFC championship, advance to Super Bowl |work=The Washington Post |date=January 20, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref>

==Game summary==
===First half===
The Patriots received first possession as [[Cordarrelle Patterson]] returned the opening kickoff 38 yards to the Patriots' 39-yard line and the team picked up 27 yards with their next five plays. But on [[Tom Brady]]'s first pass attempt of the day, [[Nickell Robey-Coleman]], who was notable for a non-pass interference call in the NFC Championship two weeks ago, deflected the ball, allowing linebacker [[Cory Littleton]] to make an interception. The turnover had no avail, and following a punt, the Patriots drove 45 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 19-yard catch by tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]]. Placekicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed a field goal attempt from 46 yards, still keeping the score at zero. The Rams were again unable to move the ball and again, the Patriots threatened to score when Brady completed a 25-yard pass to [[Julian Edelman]] at the Rams 45-yard line. But on the next play, Brady was sacked by defensive end [[John Franklin-Myers]] and fumbled the ball. Center [[David Andrews (American football)|David Andrews]] recovered the fumble, but the team was only able to get as far as the Rams' 40 before 4th down and had to punt with 18 seconds left in the first quarter.

After forcing another [[three-and-out]], the Patriots managed to drive 39 yards in seven plays, most of which came from another 25-yard completion from Brady to Edelman. Gostkowski finished the possession with a 42-yard field goal, giving the team a 3–0 lead with 10:29 left in the second quarter. After the next three drives ended in punts, the Patriots took the ball and drove 36 yards to the Rams 32-yard line. But on a 4th-and-1 conversion attempt, Brady threw an incomplete pass with 1:16 left on the clock.

The two teams went into their locker rooms with the Patriots leading, 3–0, the second lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history and the lowest since the 2–0 halftime score in [[Super Bowl IX]] after the 1974 season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/02/03/patriots-rams-super-bowl-halftime-score-second-lowest-nfl-history |title=Patriots-Rams Post Second Lowest Super Bowl Score in History at Halftime |website=Sports Illustrated }}</ref> In the entire first half, the Rams had gained just 57 yards and two first downs, both record lows for coach [[Sean McVay]]. This was also the first time that McVay's Rams had ever been shut out in a first half.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/super-bowl-liii-first-half-defense-dominates-in-a-tight-struggle-with-patriots-up-3-0-over-the-rams-1202548725/ |title=Super Bowl LIII First Half: Defense Dominates In A Tight Struggle, With Patriots Up 3–0 Over The Rams |first=Bruce |last=Haring |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 3, 2019 |access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

===Second half===
The defensive battle continued into the second half as both teams punted twice (one of them was a Super Bowl record 65-yard punt by the Rams' [[Johnny Hekker]]). With 6:33 left in the third quarter, the Rams opened their first drive of more than five plays and their first not to end in a punt, moving the ball 42 yards in 10 plays. On the third play of the drive, [[Jared Goff]] completed a 15-yard pass to [[Brandin Cooks]] and later made his first third-down conversion with an 18-yard pass to [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] on 3rd-and-6. On 3rd-and-7 from the Patriots' 26-yard line, Goff was sacked for a 9-yard loss by [[Dont'a Hightower]], but [[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] was able to pull off a 53-yard field goal, the second-longest in Super Bowl history, to tie the game at 3–3 with 2:11 left in the third quarter. It would be their only score. The Patriots took the ball back and drove to the Rams' 44-yard line, but could not go any further, and had to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter. For the first time in Super Bowl history, both teams had gone three quarters without scoring a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/f43195c9659e4d1ea718b3175cb126e2|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|title=The Latest: Patriots set Super Bowl records with 6th title|date=February 2, 2019|access-date=February 6, 2019}}</ref>

After forcing the Rams to punt, the Patriots mounted the longest drive of the game as Brady completed an 18-yard pass to Gronkowski, a 13-yard pass to Edelman, a 7-yard pass to running back [[Rex Burkhead]] and a 29-yard pass to Gronkowski, bringing them to the Rams' 2-yard line. On the next play, [[Sony Michel]] gave the Patriots the lead with a touchdown run, extending his rookie postseason rushing touchdown record to six. With the extra point by Gostkowski, the Patriots had a 10–3 lead with seven minutes left in regulation. On the first play of the Rams' next drive, Goff completed a 19-yard pass to Cooks and later converted a 3rd-and-9 with an 11-yard throw to [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]]. On the next play, his 17-yard completion to Woods moved the ball to the Patriots' 27-yard line. But with just over 4 minutes left in the game, Goff threw a pass that was intercepted by [[Stephon Gilmore]] on the 3-yard line.

The Rams needed to force a punt or turnover, but were unable to contain the Patriots on the ground. On the second play of the Patriots' possession, Michel stormed through the line for a 26-yard run. After he picked up 10 more yards with his next two carries, Burkhead's 26-yard run gave the Patriots a first down on the Rams' 33-yard line. Three plays later, Gostkowski succeeded on a 41-yard field goal, giving the Patriots a 13–3 lead with 1:12 left on the clock. Taking the ball back on their own 25, Goff completed a 10-yard pass to Woods, as well as completions to Cooks for gains of 24 and 21 yards, moving the ball to the Patriots' 30-yard line. With 8 seconds left, the Rams decided to kick a field goal, which would have been followed by an [[onside kick]] attempt, but Zuerlein missed wide left from 48 yards, and the Patriots ran out the last few seconds of the game clock.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/feb/03/super-bowl-2019-score-live-latest-new-england-patriots-los-angeles-rams-winner-tom-brady |title=Super Bowl 2019: New England Patriots beat Los Angeles Rams 13–3 – as it happened|date=February 3, 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=February 5, 2019}}</ref>
