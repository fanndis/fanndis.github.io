The '''53rd Primetime Emmy Awards''' were held on Sunday, November 4, 2001, seven weeks later than originally scheduled. The ceremony was rescheduled twice from its original date of September 16 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] because of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] that occurred five days prior to the event. It was also removed from its rescheduled date of October 7 again at the same venue as a result of the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. The event was then relocated to the smaller [[Shubert Theatre (Los Angeles)|Shubert Theater]], which had previously hosted the [[25th Primetime Emmy Awards|1973]] and [[28th Primetime Emmy Awards|1976]] ceremonies, and would be demolished in 2002. The ceremony was hosted by [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and was broadcast on [[CBS]].

[[Barbra Streisand]] sang "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]" in a surprise appearance at the close, in honor of the victims of the attacks.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2001-12-12-streisandside.htm Streisand's stage fright spiked with thought of terror], By [[Edna Gundersen]], USA TODAY, 12-12-2001</ref>

''[[Sex and the City]]'' became the first [[Pay television|premium channel show]] to win [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]; this was its only major award. The [[NBC]] [[Cult following|cult hit]] ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' accomplished a rare feat: though it only ran for one season, it was nominated in two different years for writing. The episode "[[Bowling (Malcolm in the Middle)|Bowling]]" made ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' just the second show, and first comedy, to have two different episodes win awards for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|directing]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series|writing]]. ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'' was the first show to do this in [[15th Primetime Emmy Awards|1963]] and [[17th Primetime Emmy Awards|1965]]. (Specific episodes were not nominated in the comedy categories until the late 1960s.) Meanwhile, ''[[Frasier]]'', now in its [[Frasier (season 8)|eighth season]], earned its final Outstanding Comedy Series nomination after eight consecutive nominations including five consecutive wins (seasons 1–5).

For his portrayal of [[John Cage (character)|John Cage]] in ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', [[Peter MacNicol]] won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]], the first in this category for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and the first in this category for any show outside the [[Big Three television networks]].

In the drama field, ''[[The West Wing]]'' won [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] for its second straight year and led all shows with four major awards on the night. ''[[The Sopranos]]'' led all shows with 15 major nominations and was second to ''The West Wing'' with three major wins.

[[Mike Nichols]]' win made him the ninth person to become an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]] winner.
