In British parliamentary practice, the '''Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet''' (usually known simply as the '''shadow cabinet''') consists of senior members of [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]] who scrutinise their corresponding [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] [[Minister (government)|ministers]], develop alternative policies, and hold the government to account for its actions and responses. Since May 2010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] has been Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and its leadership therefore forms the current [[shadow cabinet]].

Not all [[Official Opposition frontbench|opposition frontbench]]ers are members of the shadow cabinet, which is composed of the most senior opposition members (usually around twenty).

The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the opposition]], the opposition chief whip and opposition deputy chief whip are the only members of the Official Opposition to be paid for their opposition roles in addition to their salaries as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]].
