'''Ayrshire''' ({{lang-gd|Siorrachd Inbhir Àir}}, {{IPA-gd|ˈʃirˠəxk iɲiˈɾʲaːɾʲ|pron}}) is a [[Counties of Scotland|historic county]] and [[registration county]] in south-west [[Scotland]], located on the shores of the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Its principal towns include [[Ayr]], [[Kilmarnock]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] and it borders the counties of [[Renfrewshire]] and [[Lanarkshire]] to the north-east, [[Dumfriesshire]] to the south-east, and [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] and [[Wigtownshire]] to the south. Like many other counties of Scotland it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of [[North Ayrshire]], [[South Ayrshire]] and [[East Ayrshire]]. It has a population of approximately 366,800.

The electoral and valuation area named Ayrshire covers the three council areas of [[South Ayrshire]], [[East Ayrshire]] and [[North Ayrshire]], therefore including the [[Isle of Arran]], [[Great Cumbrae]] and [[Little Cumbrae]]. These three islands are part of the [[County of Bute]] and are sometimes included when the term ''Ayrshire'' is applied to the region. The same area is known as ''[[Ayrshire and Arran]]'' in other contexts.

==Geography==
Ayrshire is roughly crescent-shaped and is a predominantly flat county with areas of low hills; it forms part of the [[Southern Uplands]] geographic region of Scotland. The north of the county contains the main towns and bulk of the population. East of Largs can be found the Renfrewshire Heights, which continue south to the hill-country around [[Blae Loch, Beith|Blae Loch]].

Southern Ayrshire shares with the [[Galloway]] counties some rugged hill country known as the [[Galloway Hills]]. These hills lie to the west of the A713 (Ayr to [[Castle Douglas]] road) and they run south from the [[Loch Doon]] area almost to the [[Solway Firth]]. To the east of this route through the hills lie the [[Carsphairn and Scaur Hills]] which lie to the south east of [[Dalmellington]] and south of [[New Cumnock]]. Glen Afton runs deep into these hills.

Ayrshire is one of the most agriculturally fertile regions of Scotland. Potatoes are grown in fields near the coast, using seaweed-based fertiliser, and in addition the region produces pork products, other root vegetables, and cattle (see below);{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and summer berries such as strawberries are grown abundantly.

A number of small islands in the Firth of Clyde are part of Ayrshire, the chief of these being [[Horse Isle]], [[Lady Isle]] and [[Ailsa Craig]].

===Rivers===
The main rivers flowing to the Clyde coast are, from north to south, the following:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[River Garnock]]
*[[River Irvine]]
*[[River Ayr]]
*[[River Doon]]
*[[River Girvan]]
*[[River Stinchar]]

==History==
The area that today forms Ayrshire was part of the area south of the [[Antonine Wall]] which was briefly occupied by the Romans during the reign of Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] (see: [[Roman Britain#Occupation and retreat from southern Scotland]]). It was inhabited by the [[Damnonii]], who are presumed to have been [[Celtic Britons|Britons]]. Later, it formed part of the British [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] during the 11th century. In 1263, the Scots successfully drove off the [[Norway|Norwegian]] ''[[leidang]]''-army in a skirmish known as the [[Battle of Largs]].

[[File:Turnberry Castle.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of Turnberry Castle]]
A notable historic building in Ayrshire is [[Turnberry Castle]], which dates from the 13th century or earlier, and which may have been the birthplace of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]].

The historic [[shire]] or [[sheriffdom]] of Ayr was divided into three districts or ''bailieries'' which later made up the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] of Ayrshire. The three districts were:
*[[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] in the south. It was situated between the Doon and the wild district of Galloway in the adjoining Stewartries, an area that was little else than a vast tract of hills and mosses.<ref name=Douglas-2>{{cite book|last=Douglas |first=William Scott |year=1874 |title=In Ayrshire; a descriptive picture of the County of Ayr, with relative notes on interesting local subjects, chiefly derived during a recent personal tour |publisher=Kilmarnock M'Kie & Drennan |page=[https://archive.org/stream/inayrshiredespart100douguoft#page/2/mode/2up 2]}}</ref>
*[[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]] in the centre, which included the [[royal burgh]] of Ayr, occupied the central district between the [[River Irvine]] in the north, and the [[River Doon]] in the south and south-west, an area that is quite hilly inland. It was subdivided into "Kyle Stewart",<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ayrshire |volume=3 |pages=74-76}}</ref> (sometimes called "Stewart Kyle"<ref name=Douglas-2/> or "Walter's Kyle"<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=David |year=1924 |title=Early burgh organization in Scotland: as illustrated in the history of Glasgow and of some neighbouring burghs |volume=2 |publisher=Maclehose, Jackson & Co.}}</ref>) and "King's Kyle," the former embracing the country between the Irvine and the [[River Ayr]]; and the latter, the triangular portion between the Ayr and the Doon, which is honoured as the birthplace and youthful home of [[Robert Burns]].<ref name=Douglas-2/>
*[[Cunninghame]] in the north which included the royal burgh of Irvine was that part of the county which lay north of the Irvine water, and was in an area that is generally level and fertile.<ref name=Douglas-2/>

The area used to be heavily industrialised, with [[steel making]], [[coal mining]] and in Kilmarnock numerous examples of [[production-line]] manufacturing, most famously [[Johnnie Walker]] whisky. In more recent history, [[Digital Equipment]] had a large manufacturing plant near Ayr from about 1976 until the company was taken over by [[Compaq]] in 1998. Some supplier companies grew up to service this site and the more distant [[IBM]] plant at [[Greenock]] in [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]]. Scotland's aviation industry has long been based in and around [[Prestwick]] and its [[Prestwick Airport|international airport]], and although aircraft manufacture ceased at the former [[British Aerospace]] plant in 1998, a significant number of aviation companies are still based on the Prestwick site. However, unemployment in the region (excluding the more rural South Ayrshire) is above the national average.

Throughout the 17th century, huge numbers of people from Ayrshire moved to [[Ulster]], the northern [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] in [[Ireland]], as part of the [[Plantation of Ulster]], many of them with surnames such as Burns, Hamilton, Morrow, Stewart, Flanagan, Kennedy and Cunningham. Today, the [[Ulster Scots dialect]] is largely an offshoot of the version of [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] spoken in Ayrshire. The [[Ulster Scots dialect]] is still widely spoken throughout [[County Antrim]] and in parts of [[County Down]] and [[County Londonderry]], as well as still being widely spoken in West [[Tír Eoghain]] and parts of [[County Donegal]] (chiefly East Donegal and [[Inishowen]]).

==Local government==
[[File:MapOfAyrshire.png|thumb|right|250px|The administrative subdivisions covering Ayrshire. Arran is administered as part of the North Ayrshire council area, but is historically part of Buteshire.]]
{{See also|Local government of Scotland}}
The [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]] established a uniform system of [[county council]]s in Scotland and realigned the boundaries of many of Scotland's counties. Subsequently, Ayr [[county council]] was created in 1890. In 1930 the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929]] was implemented. This re-designated the [[Burghs]] into [[large burghs]] and [[small burghs]]. This new categorisation influenced the level of autonomy that the Burghs enjoyed from the county council. The act also abolished the [[parish]] as a unit of local government in Scotland. In Ayrshire in excess of 30 parishes were consolidated into ten [[List of local government areas in Scotland 1930–75|district council]]s. The District Councils were Ayr, Cumnock, Dalmellington, Girvan, Irvine, Kilbirnie, Kilmarnock, Maybole, Troon and Saltcoats.

In May 1975 the county council was abolished and its functions were transferred to [[Strathclyde Regional Council]]. The county area was divided between four new districts within the two-tier [[Strathclyde]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|region]]: [[Cumnock and Doon Valley]], [[Cunninghame]], [[Kilmarnock and Loudoun (district)|Kilmarnock and Loudoun]] and [[Kyle and Carrick]]. The Cunninghame district included the [[Isle of Arran]], [[Great Cumbrae]] and [[Little Cumbrae]], which had until then been administered as part of the [[County of Bute]].

In 1996 the two-tier system of [[regions and districts (Scotland)|regions and districts]] was abolished and Ayrshire was divided between the [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council areas]] of [[East Ayrshire]] (covering the area of the former Kilmarnock & Loudoun District and Cumnock & Doon Valley District), [[North Ayrshire]] (covering the area of the former Cunninghame District Council) and [[South Ayrshire]] (covering the area of the former Kyle and Carrick District).

== Parliamentary constituencies ==
There was an [[Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire constituency]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] from 1708 to 1801 and of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 until 1868, when the constituency was divided into [[Ayrshire North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire North]] and  [[Ayrshire South (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayrshire South]].{{fact|date=November 2019}}

During the whole of the 1708 to 1868 period, and until 1950, the [[burgh]]s of Ayr and Irvine were [[parliamentary burgh]]s, represented as components of [[Ayr Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Ayr Burghs]]. In 1832 [[Kilmarnock]] became a parliamentary burgh, to be represented as a component of [[Kilmarnock Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilmarnock Burghs]] until 1918. Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs were [[districts of burghs (UK Parliament)|districts of burghs]], and quite different in character from later Ayr and Kilmarnock constituencies.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

From 1918 to 1983 Ayrshire and [[Buteshire]] were treated as if a single area for purposes of parliamentary representation, with their combined area being divided into different constituencies at different times. Scottish local government counties were abolished in 1975, in favour of [[Regions and districts of Scotland|regions and districts]], but the next reform of constituency boundaries was not until 1983.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Constituencies covering Ayrshire may be listed by periods as below, but the story is somewhat more complicated than the lists may imply: until 1918, Ayr Burghs and Kilmarnock Burghs included burghs lying outside both Ayrshire and Buteshire; a particular constituency name may represent different boundaries in different periods; in 1974, there were boundary changes without the creation of any new constituency names.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

==Transport==
[[File:Welcome to Ayrshire (Milestone) - geograph.org.uk_-_554287.jpg|thumb|275px|Entering Ayrshire on the northbound A77]]

A number of railway lines connect the towns of northern Ayrshire to each other and also to Glasgow, as well as south to [[Stranraer]] and south-east to [[Dumfries]].

Ferries link Ayrshire to the islands of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] and [[Great Cumbrae]] in [[Buteshire]].

[[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport]], serving [[Glasgow]] and the west of Scotland more generally, is located {{convert|32|mi|km}} away from Glasgow in Ayrshire; it provides various passenger flights to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Poland.<ref>[http://www.glasgowprestwick.com/flight-and-passenger-info/flight-information/route-map.html glasgowprestwick.com - Destination Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703202711/http://www.glasgowprestwick.com/flight-and-passenger-info/flight-information/route-map.html |date=3 July 2016 }} retrieved 4 July 2016</ref> The name ''Glasgow'' was added in front of [[Prestwick]] as per American military airport naming conventions, as the airport was in the past oft-used as a stopover by US military personnel on their way to and from military bases in [[Germany]]. Moreover, it is known in [[Rock music|rock]] history as the only place in Britain visited by [[Elvis Presley]], on his way home from army service in Germany in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8547200.stm |title=Elvis anniversary: Blue suede shoes and bobby socks |publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maybole.org/news/2010/February/were_you_there.htm|title=Were you there when Elvis landed in Prestwick?|publisher=maybole.org}}</ref>
