"'''Broken-Hearted Girl'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her 2008 [[double album]] ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]''. Written by Beyoncé, [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], and production duo [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]], it was initially a [[rhythm and blues|classic rhythm and blues]] song until Babyface changed the arrangement and chords. The track appears on the ''I Am...'' disc, the songs on which give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyoncé's life stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. It is a [[tempo|midtempo]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[ballad]] accompanied by piano, [[string instrument|strings]], and [[drum machine]] beats. The lyrics describe heartache and the insecurities of love.

The song was initially announced as the sixth single from ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' in the United States and the fourth elsewhere, but was replaced with "[[Sweet Dreams (Beyoncé song)|Sweet Dreams]]". [[Columbia Records]] released "Broken-Hearted Girl" outside the US on August&nbsp;28, 2009. Critics praised Beyoncé's emotional vocals on the track but had divided opinions on the production. The single reached the top twenty on the [[Record chart|singles charts]] of Australia, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Ireland. [[Sophie Muller]] directed a monochrome [[music video]] in which Beyoncé's character reminisces about her relationship on a beach in [[Malibu, California]]. Beyoncé performed "Broken-Hearted Girl" on the [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009–10).
