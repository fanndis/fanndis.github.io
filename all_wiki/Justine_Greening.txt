While still a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], Greening had the Conservative [[September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs|whip removed on 3 September 2019]] and sat as an [[independent politician|independent MP]] after that.

Greening served in the [[Second Cameron ministry|Cameron Government]] as [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]] and [[Secretary of State for Transport]], prior to being appointed [[Secretary of State for International Development]] in September 2012.<ref name="blogs1">{{cite web| url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/09/full-cabinet-list.html| title=Full post-reshuffle list of Conservative Cabinet Ministers| publisher=[[ConservativeHome]]| accessdate=4 September 2012| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907014801/http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/09/full-cabinet-list.html| archivedate=7 September 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref> From 14 July 2016 to 8 January 2018, she served as [[Secretary of State for Education]] and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]] in the [[First May ministry|May Government]].

She contested the constituency of [[Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (UK Parliament constituency)|Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush]] in 2001; Greening finished second with a reduced share of the vote for the Conservatives.

==Parliamentary career==
Greening gained the seat of [[Putney (UK Parliament constituency)|Putney]] from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] on 5 May 2005. Greening won 15,497 votes (42.4% of the vote) giving her a majority of 1,766 (4.8%). She unseated [[Tony Colman (politician)|Tony Colman]], who had held the seat for Labour since defeating [[David Mellor]] in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]].

As the first Conservative elected on the evening of the election, her victory was the first real sign that the Conservative Party was to reduce the Labour Government's majority and begin to recover from the landslide defeats of the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] and [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] general elections. [[Michael Howard]], who had visited Putney to give a speech on his first day as Conservative Leader, returned there on the morning after the election to congratulate Putney Conservatives and give the speech in which he announced his intention to step down. Greening was the youngest female Conservative MP in the House of Commons<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/4633233.stm|title=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 October 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111180923/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/4633233.stm|archivedate=11 January 2009}}</ref> until [[Chloe Smith]] was elected to Parliament on 12 October 2009.

Greening was appointed a vice-chair (with responsibility for youth) of the Conservative Party on 15 December 2005, having earlier that year been appointed a member of the Work and Pensions Committee. In July 2007, following a shadow ministerial reshuffle, she was promoted to be a Junior Shadow Minister for The Treasury.

In January 2009, following a further shadow ministerial reshuffle, Greening was promoted to Shadow Minister for London, within the Communities and Local Government Team with responsibility for Local Government Finance. Within this brief, she focused on transport and [[community|local community benefits]].

In March 2010, she was put in charge of co-ordinating the Conservative campaign for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] in London.<ref>[http://waugh.standard.co.uk/2010/03/justine-greening-to-run-tory-ge-campaign-in-london.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315035827/http://waugh.standard.co.uk/2010/03/justine-greening-to-run-tory-ge-campaign-in-london.html|date=15 March 2010}}</ref> She held the post of [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]] from 13 May 2010 to 14 October 2011, where she helped deliver the emergency budget in 2010.  

In 2018, she established the Social Mobility Pledge upon returning to the backbenches, a new scheme aimed at broadening social mobility and opportunity in Britain. Later that year, she became the first senior Conservative to come out in favour of [[People's Vote|a new EU referendum]], arguing that Parliament was unable to make a decision on [[Brexit]] and therefore it had to be put back to the people. In October 2018, in an interview on ''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]'' she was asked if she would be interested in launching a leadership bid. Greening said: "Well, things need to change, don't they, and people need to have some hope for the future that Britain can be a country that runs differently and more fairly." Questioned again on whether she would stand for the Conservative leadership if there were a vacancy, Greening said: "I might be prepared to, but I'm more interested in the Conservative party actually showing what it can do for this country."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/29/justine-greening-hints-at-conservative-leadership-bid-theresa-may|title=Justine Greening hints at Conservative leadership bid|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=29 October 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2018}}</ref>

In early 2019, she co-founded the group [[Right to Vote]] alongside [[Dominic Grieve]] and [[Phillip Lee (politician)|Phillip Lee]] calling for a new referendum.<ref>{{cite letter |first=Phillip |last=Lee |recipient=[[Theresa May]] |subject=Letter to the Prime Minister from Dr Phillip Lee MP |date=19 March 2019 |url=https://cdn.righttovote.co.uk/assets/righttovote-PMletter19thMarch.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref> After the formation of [[The Independent Group]], Greening suggested that she could resign the Conservative whip if there was a 'no deal' Brexit. In April 2019, Greening indicated again that she would run for the Tory leadership if a 'centrist' did not run. She also unveiled possible policies such as scrapping tuition fees in favour of a graduate tax and increasing the number of Opportunity Areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijrWlcA4RHg|title=Justine Greening says May-Corbyn Brexit talks are a mess and reveals if she’ll run for PM &#124; ITV News|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>  

===Transport Secretary===
In October 2011, she was appointed [[Secretary of State for Transport]] and was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-oic-october17th.pdf |publisher=Privy Council Office |title=Orders for 17 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231324/http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-oic-october17th.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016  }}</ref>

Whilst Greening represented the London constituency of [[Putney (UK Parliament constituency)|Putney]] she had always campaigned against a third runway at [[Heathrow Airport]]. In the run up to the [[2012 British cabinet reshuffle|2012 Cabinet reshuffle]], Greening said it would be difficult to serve in a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] which was in favour of a third runway.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9502785/Heathrow-third-runway-Transport-Secretary-threatens-to-resign.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Christopher | last=Hope | title=Heathrow third runway: Transport Secretary threatens to resign | date=28 August 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015103455/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9502785/Heathrow-third-runway-Transport-Secretary-threatens-to-resign.html | archivedate=15 October 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In her role as Secretary of State for Transport, Greening oversaw the award of new rail franchises, including the award of the Intercity West Coast franchise to First Group in 2012. In October 2012, Greening announced that the government was cancelling the franchise competition for the InterCity West Coast franchise after discovering significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted, reversing the decision to award it to FirstGroup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/press-releases/dft-press-20121003a|title=Announcements – GOV.UK|website=www.dft.gov.uk}}</ref>  Subsequently, Sir Philip Rutnam, then Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, issued an apology to Greening stating the problem “clearly the responsibility of officials and not ministers".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Watt |first1=Nicholas |last2=Jowett |first2=Juliette |title=Top civil servant apologises to Justine Greening over west coast rail debacle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/11/transport-west-coast-mainline |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>  A report by the [[Transport Select Committee]] found fault with Greening and revealed that the cost to the taxpayer of the flawed franchise process was at least £40 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/9829142/Justine-Greening-to-face-criticism-over-West-Coast-Main-Line-fiasco.html|title=Justine Greening to face criticism over West Coast Main Line fiasco|first=Robert|last=Watts|date=9 January 2018|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

On 4 September 2012, she was replaced by [[Patrick McLoughlin]] at the [[Department for Transport]] and became [[Secretary of State for International Development]].<ref name="blogs1"/> The move was strongly criticised by the Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]] who believed it was linked to her opposition to a third runway at Heathrow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/04/boris-johnson-condemns-justine-greening-demotion-over-heathrow-564769/|title=Boris Johnson condemns Justine Greening 'demotion over Heathrow'|accessdate=5 October 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104181043/http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/04/boris-johnson-condemns-justine-greening-demotion-over-heathrow-564769/|archivedate=4 November 2015}}</ref> As Secretary of State for International Development, Greening became a member of the [[National Security Council (United Kingdom)|National Security Council]].

Whilst she was in the role of International Development Secretary, the UK became the first G8 country to meet the commitment to spend 0.7% of its gross national income on international development, meeting the UN official development assistance target subsequently legislating for this.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coffey |first1=Claire |last2=Haddad |first2=Lawrence |last3=Hilary |first3=John |last4=Phillips |first4=Ben |title=Justine Greening's first year: how has the development secretary fared? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/03/justine-greening-development-secretary |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Anderson |first1=Mark |title=This article is more than 5 years old UK passes bill to honour pledge of 0.7% foreign aid target |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/uk-passes-bill-law-aid-target-percentage-income |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> Greening led the UK response to international natural disasters such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-25080349/uk-at-forefront-of-typhoon-haiyan-aid-response |title=UK at 'forefront' of Typhoon Haiyan aid response|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Peacock |first1=Louisa |title=Typhoon Haiyan: "We are failing thousands of girls at risk of rape or trafficking," says Justine Greening |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10444849/Typhoon-Haiyan-relief-effort-We-are-failing-thousands-of-girls-at-risk-of-rape-or-trafficking-says-Justine-Greening.html |website=The Telegraph |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> and the Nepal earthquake in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nepal earthquake: UK aid donations reach £15m |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32508586 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Nepal earthquake: UK sends humanitarian experts |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32465105 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>

In 2014, Greening held the first-ever Girl Summit in London, which saw leaders and young people from all over the world come together to work to help combat female genital mutilation and early and forced marriage. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sanghani |first1=Radhika |title=UK's first Girl Summit aims to end FGM and forced marriage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/10976519/UK-Girl-Summit-and-David-Cameron-aim-to-end-FGM-and-forced-child-marriage.html |website=The Telegraph |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Urwin |first1=Rosamund |title=Minister for girls: Justine Greening on the fight to end FGM |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/minister-for-girls-justine-greening-on-the-fight-to-end-fgm-9620689.html |website=The Evening Standard |publisher=The Evening Standard |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>

Greening led the UK response to the Syria crisis including the UK work in Lebanon and Jordan to support local economies to provide work for refugees as well as local people. Greening pioneered the “No Lost Generation” initiative with then UNHCR boss Antonio Guterres and UNICEF to enable Syrian refugee children to still continue their education.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Elliott |first1=Larry |title=Could Justine Greening's budget help educate Syria's displaced children? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/feb/16/justine-greening-budget-educate-syria-displaced-children-lebanon |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>

Greening led the international response to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone in 2014-2015, committing a £230 million aid package including support for 700 treatment beds and funding for children orphaned by the crisis. Greening stated that children would not be “left behind once Ebola was defeated.” “Operation Gritrock” was the first-ever UK military campaign led by DFID, and was also supported by NHS personnel.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ebola outbreak: £2.5m UK grant to help children |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30505208 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |title=Greening to meet troops tackling Ebola in Sierra Leone |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2014-10-21/greening-to-meet-troops-tackling-ebola-in-sierra-leone/ |website=ITV |publisher=ITV |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>

Following an initiative by Greening, Ban Ki Moon, then UN Secretary General, announced in 2016 the creation of the UN’s first high-level panel on women’s economic empowerment.

In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|June 2017 general election]], after which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] formed a minority government, she held her Putney constituency with a reduced majority and a loss in vote share of 9.7%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000887 |title=Putney Parliamentary constituency&nbsp;– Election 2017 |publisher=BBC News website |date=9 June 2017 |accessdate=2 August 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520014600/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000887 |archivedate=20 May 2017  }}</ref> She remained Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities after the election until her resignation from government on 8 January 2018, during a [[2018 British cabinet reshuffle|cabinet reshuffle]]: it was reported that she had rejected the post of [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]], interpreted variously as the offer of a "sideways move" or a demotion.<ref name="Gdn8118">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/08/theresa-mays-reshuffle-thrown-off-course-by-defiant-ministers|title=Theresa May's reshuffle in disarray as Justine Greening quits|last=Ashtana|first=Anushka|date=8 January 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref>

Whilst Education Secretary, Greening developed targeted Opportunity Areas across England which saw targeted funding to link schools and employers in areas with weak social mobility.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coughlan |first1=Sean |title=Greening announces social mobility 'opportunity areas' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37554334 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> In December 2017, Greening launched the Department for Education’s Social Mobility Action Plan to improve social mobility through education which included four ambitions on further education, skills, early years and attainment gaps.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coughlan |first1=Sean |title=Greening wants social mobility to 'unlock talent' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42343540 |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>  Other departments in Whitehall have followed the example and have also created their own social mobility action plans.

On 3 September 2019, Greening joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/03/commons-showdown-looms-in-battle-over-no-deal-brexit-live?page=with%3Ablock-5d6ed2f58f0845a5dab7cc88|title=Boris Johnson to table motion for election after failed vote – as it happened|first1=Kate|last1=Lyons|first2=Kevin|last2=Rawlinson|first3=Andrew|last3=Sparrow|first4=Frances|last4=Perraudin|date=4 September 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion which subsequently failed.

==After Parliament==
Since leaving Parliament, Greening is a leading UK voice on social mobility and campaigns for equality of opportunity across Britain through the Social Mobility Pledge.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Lizzie |title=Why Justine Greening is targeting social mobility for the UK's youth |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/why-justine-greening-targeting-social-mobility-uks-youth-1747085 |website=Yorkshire Post |publisher=Yorkshire Post |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Gale |first1=Adam |title=Justine Greening: "The link between effort and reward has broken down" |url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/justine-greening-the-link-effort-reward-broken-down/food-for-thought/article/1660695 |website=Management Today |publisher=Management Today |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>  In 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, and ensuing United Kingdom lockdown, Greening launched the C-19 Business Pledge, galvanising the UK business response by asking them to provide extra support to their employees, customers and communities during the crisis.  Some of the UK’s biggest businesses signed onto support including [[BP]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland|RBS]], and [[Experian]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Boscia |first1=Stefan |title=Business heavyweights sign on to Covid-19 business pact |url=https://www.cityam.com/business-heavyweights-sign-on-to-covid-19-business-pact/ |website=CityAM |publisher=CityAM |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In June 2016, Greening revealed on [[Twitter]] that she was in a "happy [[same-sex relationship]]".
