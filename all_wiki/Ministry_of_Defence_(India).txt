{{Politics of India}}
The '''Ministry of Defence''' ('''MoD''') ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''Rakshā Maṃtrālaya'') is charged with coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the government relating directly to [[national security]] and the [[Indian armed forces]]. 
The [[President of India]] is the ceremonial [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces of the country. The Ministry of Defence provides policy framework and resources to the armed forces to discharge their responsibility in the context of the defence of the country. The [[Indian Armed Forces]] (including [[Indian Army]], [[Indian Air Force]], [[Indian Navy]]) and [[Indian Coast Guard]] under the Ministry of Defence are primarily responsible for ensuring the territorial integrity of [[India]].

At present, the undergoing new creation of [[Indian National Defence University|National Defence University]], for training of military officials and concerned civilian officials, will be administered and overseen by the Ministry. The Ministry organises and runs [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day celebrations]] and [[Delhi Republic Day parade|parade]] every year in January, hosting a [[Republic Day (India)#Republic Day parade chief guest|chief guest]].

==History==
===Origin===
A military department was created by the supreme government of the [[British East India Company]] at [[Kolkata]] in the year 1776.<ref name=":1" /> Its main function was to co-ordinate and record orders, relating to the army, issued by various departments of the government of the East India Company. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the Public Department and maintained a list of army personnel.<ref name=":1" />

With the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Charter Act 1833]] the Secretariat of the Government of the East India Company was reorganised into four departments, each headed by a secretary to the Government.<ref name=":1" /> The armies in the presidencies of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] and [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] functioned as the respective [[presidency armies]] until April 1895, when the presidency armies were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands: [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] (including the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|North West Frontier]]), [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] (including [[Burma]]), [[Madras Presidency|Madras]] and [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]] (including [[Sindh]], [[Quetta]] and [[Aden]]).<ref name=":1" />

The supreme authority over the Indian Army was vested in the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General-in-Council]], subject to the control of [[the Crown]], which was exercised by the [[Secretary of State for India]]. Two members in the Council were responsible for military affairs. One was the Military Member, who supervised all administrative and financial matters. The other was the commander-in-chief who was responsible for all operational matters.<ref name=":1" /> The Military Department was abolished in March 1906 and was replaced by two separate departments; the Army Department and the Military Supply Department. In April 1909 the Military Supply Department was abolished and its functions were taken over by the Army Department. The Army Department was redesignated as the Defence Department in January 1938. The Department of Defence became the Ministry of Defence under a cabinet minister in August 1947.<ref name=":1" />

===Post independences changes===
The functions of MoD which in 1947 was mainly logistic support to the armed forces, has undergone far reaching changes. In November 1962, following the 1962 war, a Department of Defence Production was set-up to deal with research, development and production of defence equipment. In November 1965, the Department of Defence Supplies was created for planning and execution of schemes for import substitution of requirements for defence purposes. These two Departments were later merged to form the Department of Defence Production and Supplies.

In 1980, the Department of Defence Research and Development was created. In January 2004, the Department of Defence Production and Supplies was renamed the Department of Defence Production. A Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister was appointed to advise on scientific aspects of military equipment and the research and design of defence forces equipment. The Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare was created in 2004.
