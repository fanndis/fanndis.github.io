[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have lived along the Mississippi River and its tributaries for thousands of years. Most were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, but some, such as the [[Mound Builders]], formed prolific agricultural and urban civilisations. The arrival of Europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers, then settlers, ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/mississippi-river-us|title=Mississippi (river US) facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Mississippi (river US)|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618035236/http://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/us-physical-geography/mississippi-river-us|archive-date=June 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The river served first as a barrier, forming borders for [[New Spain]], [[New France]], and the early United States, and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link. In the 19th century, during the height of the ideology of [[manifest destiny]], the Mississippi and several western tributaries, most notably the [[Missouri River|Missouri]], formed pathways for the western expansion of the United States.

Formed from thick layers of the river's [[silt]] deposits, the [[Mississippi embayment]] is one of the most fertile regions of the United States; [[Steamboats of the Mississippi|steamboats]] were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to ship agricultural and industrial goods. During the [[American Civil War]], the Mississippi's capture by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces marked a turning point towards victory, due to the river's strategic importance to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] war effort. Because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and [[barge]]s that replaced steamboats, the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive [[River engineering|engineering works]] such as [[levee]]s, [[Lock (water navigation)|locks]] and [[dam]]s, often built in combination. A major focus of this work has been to prevent the lower Mississippi from shifting into the channel of the [[Atchafalaya River]] and bypassing [[New Orleans]].

Since the 20th century, the Mississippi River has also experienced major pollution and environmental problems – most notably elevated nutrient and chemical levels from agricultural runoff, the primary contributor to the [[Gulf of Mexico dead zone]].

==Name and significance==
The word Mississippi itself comes from {{lang|fr|Misi zipi}}, the French rendering of the [[Anishinaabe]] ([[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] or [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]]) name for the river, {{lang|alg|Misi-ziibi}} (Great River).{{cn|date=September 2020}}

In the 18th century, the river was the primary western boundary of the young United States, and since the country's expansion westward, the Mississippi River has been widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States, and the Western United States. This is exemplified by the [[Gateway Arch]] in St. Louis and the phrase "[[Trans-Mississippi]]" as used in the name of the [[Trans-Mississippi Exposition]].

It is common to qualify a regionally superlative landmark in relation to it, such as "the [[Mount Mitchell|highest peak east of the Mississippi]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/10-tallest-mountains-east-mississippi-104158.html |access-date=March 1, 2015 |title=The 10 Tallest Mountains East of the Mississippi |author=Ethan Shaw |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309093046/http://traveltips.usatoday.com/10-tallest-mountains-east-mississippi-104158.html |archive-date=March 9, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> or "the oldest city west of the Mississippi".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newmadridmuseum.com/city_history.html |access-date=March 1, 2015 |title=New Madrid – 220+ Years Old and Counting |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102004728/http://newmadridmuseum.com/city_history.html |archive-date=November 2, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] also uses it as the dividing line for [[call sign|broadcast call-sign]]s, which begin with W to the east and K to the west, mixing together in [[media market]]s along the river.

==Divisions==
The Mississippi River can be divided into three sections: the [[Upper Mississippi]], the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the Missouri River; the Middle Mississippi, which is downriver from the Missouri to the Ohio River; and the [[Lower Mississippi]], which flows from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico.

===Upper Mississippi===
{{Main|Upper Mississippi River}}
[[File:Lake Itasca Mississippi Source.jpg|thumb|The beginning of the Mississippi River at [[Lake Itasca]] (2004)]]
[[File:Saint Anthony Falls aerial.jpg|thumb|alt=St. Anthony Falls|Former head of navigation, St. Anthony Falls]]
[[File:WyalusingStateParkWisconsinRiverIntoMississippiRiver.jpg|thumb|Confluence of the [[Wisconsin River|Wisconsin]] and Mississippi Rivers, viewed from [[Wyalusing State Park]] in Wisconsin]]

The Upper Mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the Missouri River at St. Louis, Missouri. It is divided into two sections:
# The headwaters, {{convert|493|mi|km}} from the source to [[Saint Anthony Falls]] in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]]; and
# A navigable channel, formed by a series of man-made lakes between Minneapolis and St. Louis, Missouri, some {{convert|664|mi|km}}.

The source of the Upper Mississippi branch is traditionally accepted as [[Lake Itasca]], {{convert|1475|ft|m}} above sea level in [[Itasca State Park]] in [[Clearwater County, Minnesota]]. The name ''Itasca'' was chosen to designate the "true head" of the Mississippi River as a combination of the last four letters of the Latin word for truth ({{lang|la|veritas}}) and the first two letters of the Latin word for head ({{lang|la|caput}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/waterway.cfm?PlaceNameID=1481&BookCodeID=30&County=31&SendingPage=Results.cfm |title=Minnesota Place Names: A Geographical Encyclopedia |author-link=Warren Upham |last=Upham |first=Warren |publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]] |access-date=August 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108092148/http://mnplaces.mnhs.org/upham/waterway.cfm?PlaceNameID=1481&BookCodeID=30&County=31&SendingPage=Results.cfm |archive-date=January 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the lake is in turn fed by a number of smaller streams.

From its origin at Lake Itasca to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the waterway's flow is moderated by 43 dams. Fourteen of these dams are located above Minneapolis in the [[headwater]]s region and serve multiple purposes, including power generation and recreation. The remaining 29 dams, beginning in downtown Minneapolis, all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river. Taken as a whole, these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river. Beginning just below [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], and continuing throughout the upper and lower river, the Mississippi is further controlled by thousands of [[Wing Dike]]s that moderate the river's flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks.

The [[head of navigation]] on the Mississippi is the Coon Rapids Dam in [[Coon Rapids, Minnesota]]. Before it was built in 1913, steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as [[Saint Cloud, Minnesota]], depending on river conditions.

The uppermost lock and dam on the Upper Mississippi River is the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis. Above the dam, the river's elevation is {{convert|799|ft|m}}. Below the dam, the river's elevation is {{convert|750|ft|m}}. This {{convert|49|ft|m|adj=mid}} drop is the largest of all the Mississippi River locks and dams. The origin of the dramatic drop is a waterfall preserved adjacent to the lock under an apron of concrete. [[Saint Anthony Falls]] is the only true waterfall on the entire Mississippi River. The water elevation continues to drop steeply as it passes through the gorge carved by the waterfall.

After the completion of the St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in 1963, the river's head of navigation moved upstream, to the [[Coon Rapids Dam]]. However, the Locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive [[Asian carp in North America|Asian carp]], making Minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/Home/Projects/tabid/18156/Article/571138/upper-st-anthony-falls-lock-closure.aspx |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |title=Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock Closure |year=2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610065909/http://www.mvp.usace.army.mil/Home/Projects/tabid/18156/Article/571138/upper-st-anthony-falls-lock-closure.aspx |archive-date=June 10, 2015 }}</ref>

The Upper Mississippi has a number of natural and artificial lakes, with its widest point being [[Lake Winnibigoshish]], near [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota]], over {{convert|11|mi|km}} across. [[Lake Onalaska]], created by [[Lock and Dam No. 7]], near [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], is more than {{convert|4|mi|km}} wide. [[Lake Pepin]], a natural lake formed behind the delta of the [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa River]] of Wisconsin as it enters the Upper Mississippi, is more than {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/miss/riverfacts.htm |title=Mississippi River Facts |publisher=Nps.gov |access-date=November 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106103328/http://www.nps.gov/miss/riverfacts.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the time the Upper Mississippi reaches [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], Minnesota, below Lock and Dam No. 1, it has dropped more than half its original elevation and is {{convert|687|ft|m}} above sea level. From St. Paul to St. Louis, Missouri, the river elevation falls much more slowly, and is controlled and managed as a series of pools created by 26 locks and dams.<ref>2001 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Upper Mississippi River Navigation Chart</ref>

The Upper Mississippi River is joined by the [[Minnesota River]] at [[Fort Snelling]] in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]]; the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] near [[Prescott, Wisconsin]]; the [[Cannon River (Minnesota)|Cannon River]] near [[Red Wing, Minnesota]]; the [[Zumbro River]] at [[Wabasha, Minnesota]]; the [[Black River (Wisconsin)|Black]], [[La Crosse River|La Crosse]], and [[Root River (Minnesota)|Root]] rivers in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]; the [[Wisconsin River]] at [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]]; the [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock River]] at the [[Quad Cities]]; the [[Iowa River]] near [[Wapello, Iowa]]; the [[Skunk River]] south of [[Burlington, Iowa]]; and the [[Des Moines River]] at [[Keokuk, Iowa]]. Other major tributaries of the Upper Mississippi include the [[Crow River (Minnesota)|Crow River]] in Minnesota, the [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa River]] in Wisconsin, the [[Maquoketa River]] and the [[Wapsipinicon River]] in Iowa, and the [[Illinois River]] in Illinois.

[[File:Dubois n Mississippi River P7280468 Missouri n Mississippi River.JPG|thumb|The Upper Mississippi River at its confluence with the Missouri River north of St. Louis]]

The Upper Mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many [[bar (river morphology)|bars]] and islands. From its confluence with the St. Croix River downstream to [[Dubuque, Iowa]], the river is entrenched, with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side. The height of these bluffs decreases to the south of Dubuque, though they are still significant through [[Savanna, Illinois]]. This topography contrasts strongly with the Lower Mississippi, which is a meandering river in a broad, flat area, only rarely flowing alongside a bluff (as at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]).
[[File:CairoIL from space annotated.jpg|thumb|The [[confluence]] of the Mississippi (left) and Ohio (right) rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]], Illinois, the demarcation between the Middle and the Lower Mississippi River]]

===Middle Mississippi===
The Mississippi River is known as the Middle Mississippi from the Upper Mississippi River's confluence with the [[Missouri River]] at St. Louis, Missouri, for {{convert|190|mi|km}} to its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.<ref name="Corps Middle Mississippi">{{cite book|title=Middle Mississippi River Regional Corridor: Collaborative Planning Study (July 2007 update)|year=2007|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District|location=St. Louis, MO|page=28}}</ref><ref name=MMRP>{{cite web|title=MMRP: Middle Mississippi River Partnership|url=http://www.swircd.org/mmrp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328005434/http://www.swircd.org/mmrp|archive-date=March 28, 2009|publisher=Middle Mississippi River Partnership|access-date=May 25, 2011}}</ref>

The Middle Mississippi is relatively free-flowing. From St. Louis to the Ohio River confluence, the Middle Mississippi falls {{convert|220|ft}} over {{convert|180|mi|km}} for an average rate of {{convert|1.2|ft/mi}}. At its confluence with the Ohio River, the Middle Mississippi is {{convert|315|ft}} above sea level. Apart from the Missouri and [[Meramec River|Meramec]] rivers of Missouri and the [[Kaskaskia River]] of Illinois, no major tributaries enter the Middle Mississippi River.

The Mississippi River is called the Lower Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about {{convert|1000|mi|km}}. At the confluence of the Ohio and the Middle Mississippi, the long-term mean discharge of the Ohio at Cairo, Illinois is {{convert|281500|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=off|sp=us}},<ref>Frits van der Leeden, Fred L.

In addition to the [[Ohio River]], the major tributaries of the Lower Mississippi River are the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]], flowing in at the [[White River National Wildlife Refuge]] in east central Arkansas; the [[Arkansas River]], joining the Mississippi at [[Arkansas Post National Memorial|Arkansas Post]]; the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]] in Mississippi; and the [[Yazoo River]], meeting the Mississippi at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. The widest point of the Mississippi River is in the Lower Mississippi portion where it exceeds {{convert|1|mi|km}} in width in several places.

Deliberate water diversion at the [[Old River Control Structure]] in [[Louisiana]] allows the [[Atchafalaya River]] in Louisiana to be a major [[distributary]] of the Mississippi River, with 30% of the combined flow of the Mississippi and Red Rivers flowing to the Gulf of Mexico by this route, rather than continuing down the Mississippi's current channel past [[Baton Rouge]] and [[New Orleans]] on a longer route to the Gulf.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=John|title=The Control of Nature: Atchafalaya|journal=The New Yorker|date=February 23, 1987|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987_02_23_039_TNY_CARDS_000347146|access-date=May 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513171926/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987_02_23_039_TNY_CARDS_000347146|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}  Republished in {{cite book | author=McPhee, John | title=The Control of Nature | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year=1989 | isbn=0-374-12890-1 | page = 272 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Old River Control | work=The Mighty Mississippi River | author=Angert, Joe and Isaac | url=http://users.stlcc.edu/jangert/oldriver/oldriver.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515010700/http://users.stlcc.edu/jangert/oldriver/oldriver.html |archive-date=May 15, 2009 |access-date=May 12, 2011}} Includes map and pictures.</ref><ref name="kemp">{{cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~bfleury/envirobio/enviroweb/FloodControl.htm |title=The Mississippi Levee System and the Old River Control Structure |first=Katherine |last=Kemp |date=January 6, 2000 |access-date=May 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513162258/http://www.tulane.edu/~bfleury/envirobio/enviroweb/FloodControl.htm |archive-date=May 13, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=USACE Brochure: Old River Control, Jan 2009 |url=https://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/Portals/56/docs/PAO/Brochures/OldRiverControlBrochure.pdf |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, New Orleans District |access-date=April 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516032359/https://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/Portals/56/docs/PAO/Brochures/OldRiverControlBrochure.pdf |archive-date=May 16, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] is commonly mistaken for an additional tributary, its water flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico through the Atchafalaya River.

The Mississippi River has the world's fourth-largest [[drainage basin]] ("watershed" or "catchment"). The basin covers more than {{convert|1245000|sqmi|abbr=out}}, including all or parts of 32 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The drainage basin empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], part of the Atlantic Ocean. The total catchment of the Mississippi River covers nearly 40% of the landmass of the continental United States.

In the United States, the Mississippi River drains the majority of the area between the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], except for various regions drained to [[Hudson Bay]] by the [[Red River of the North]]; to the Atlantic Ocean by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Saint Lawrence River]]; and to the Gulf of Mexico by the [[Rio Grande]], the [[Alabama River|Alabama]] and [[Tombigbee River|Tombigbee]] rivers, the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and [[Apalachicola River|Appalachicola]] rivers, and various smaller coastal waterways along the Gulf.

The Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about {{convert|100|mi|km}} downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat, but the [[United States Geological Survey]]'s number is {{convert|2320|mi|km}}. The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is typically about 90 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/miss/features/factoids/ |title=General Information about the Mississippi River |publisher=National Park Service |work=Mississippi National River and Recreation Area |year=2004 |access-date=July 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613194952/http://www.nps.gov/miss/features/factoids/ |archive-date=June 13, 2006 }}</ref>

Fresh river water flowing from the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately. The images from [[NASA]]'s [[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer|MODIS]] (to the right) show a large plume of fresh water, which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters. These images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately. Instead, it stayed intact as it flowed through the Gulf of Mexico, into the [[Straits of Florida]], and entered the [[Gulf Stream]]. The Mississippi River water rounded the tip of Florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by MODIS.

Before 1900, the Mississippi River transported an estimated {{convert|400|e6MT|e6ST|abbr=off|order=flip}} of [[sediment]] per year from the interior of the United States to coastal Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. During the last two decades, this number was only {{convert|145|e6MT|e6ST|abbr=off|order=flip}} per year. The reduction in [[sediment transport]]ed down the Mississippi River is the result of engineering modification of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers and their tributaries by dams, [[meander cutoff]]s, river-training structures, and bank revetments and soil [[erosion]] control programs in the areas drained by them.<ref name="MeadelOthers1984">Meade, R. H., and J. A. Moody, 1984, ''Causes for the decline of suspended-sediment discharge in the Mississippi River system, 1940–2007'' Hydrology Processes vol. 24, pp. 35–49.</ref>

==Course changes==
Over geologic time, the Mississippi River has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course, as well as additions, deletions, and other changes among its numerous tributaries, and the lower Mississippi River has used different pathways as its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico across the delta region.

Through a natural process known as [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]] or delta switching, the lower Mississippi River has shifted its final course to the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico every thousand years or so. This occurs because the deposits of silt and sediment begin to clog its channel, raising the river's level and causing it to eventually find a steeper, more direct route to the Gulf of Mexico. The abandoned distributaries diminish in volume and form what are known as [[bayou]]s. This process has, over the past 5,000 years, caused the coastline of south Louisiana to advance toward the Gulf from {{convert|15|to|50|mi|km}}. The currently active delta lobe is called the Birdfoot Delta, after its shape, or the [[Balize Delta]], after [[La Balize, Louisiana]], the first French settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi.

===Prehistoric courses===
The current form of the Mississippi River basin was largely shaped by the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] of the [[Last glacial period|most recent]] [[Ice Age]]. The southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day United States and Mississippi basin. When the ice sheet began to recede, hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited, creating the flat and fertile landscape of the Mississippi Valley. During the melt, giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the Mississippi watershed, creating such features as the [[Minnesota River]], [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]], and [[Milk River (Montana-Alberta)|Milk River]] valleys. When the ice sheet completely retreated, many of these "temporary" rivers found paths to [[Hudson Bay]] or the Arctic Ocean, leaving the Mississippi Basin with many features "over-sized" for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period.

Ice sheets during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]], about 300,000 to 132,000 years before present, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, Illinois, diverting it to its present channel farther to the west, the current western border of Illinois. The [[Hennepin Canal Parkway State Park|Hennepin Canal]] roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi downstream from Rock Island to [[Hennepin, Illinois]]. South of Hennepin, to [[Alton, Illinois]], the current [[Illinois River]] follows the ancient channel used by the Mississippi River before the Illinoian Stage.<ref name="McKay2007">McKay, E.D., 2007, [http://ilrdss.sws.uiuc.edu/pubs/govconf2007/session2a/DonMcKay.pdf ''Six Rivers, Five Glaciers, and an Outburst Flood: the Considerable Legacy of the Illinois River.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019161927/http://ilrdss.sws.uiuc.edu/pubs/govconf2007/session2a/DonMcKay.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }} (PDF) Proceedings of the 2007 Governor's Conference on the Management of the Illinois River System: Our continuing Commitment, 11th Biennial Conference, Oct. 2–4, 2007, 11 p.</ref><ref name="McKayOther2008">McKay, E.D., and R.C.

* c. 200 AD: [[Bayou Lafourche]] became the main course of the Mississippi.
* c. 1000 AD: The Mississippi's present course took over.
* Before c. 1400 AD: The [[Red River of the South]] flowed parallel to the lower Mississippi to the sea
* 15th century: [[Turnbull's Bend]] in the lower Mississippi extended so far west that it captured the Red River of the South. The Red River below the captured section became the [[Atchafalaya River]].
* 1831: [[Captain Henry M. Shreve]] dug a new short course for the Mississippi through the neck of Turnbull's Bend.
* 1833 to November 1873: The [[Great Raft]] (a huge [[logjam]] in the Atchafalaya River) was cleared. The Atchafalaya started to capture the Mississippi and to become its new main lower course.

===Historic course changes===
In March 1876, the Mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of [[Reverie, Tennessee]], leaving a small part of [[Tipton County, Tennessee]], attached to [[Arkansas]] and separated from the rest of [[Tennessee]] by the new river channel. Since this event was an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]], rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition, the state line still follows the old channel.<ref name="Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U.S. 158">{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/246/158/case.html |title=Arkansas v.

The town of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the Mississippi and [[Kaskaskia River|Kaskaskia (Okaw) Rivers]]. Founded as a French colonial community, it later became the capital of the Illinois Territory and was the first state capital of Illinois until 1819. Beginning in 1844, successive flooding caused the Mississippi River to slowly encroach east. A major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower {{convert|10|mile}} of the Kaskaskia River, forming a new Mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state. Later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town, including the original State House. Today, the remaining {{convert|2,300|acre}} island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of Illinois and is accessible only from the Missouri side.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knopp|first1=Lisa|title=What the River carries: Encounters with the Mississippi, Missouri, and Platte|date=2012|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, Missouri|isbn=978-0-8262-1974-9|page=74}}</ref>

===New Madrid Seismic Zone===
The [[New Madrid Seismic Zone]], along the Mississippi River near [[New Madrid, Missouri]], between Memphis and St. Louis, is related to an [[aulacogen]] (failed rift) that formed at the same time as the Gulf of Mexico. This area is still quite active seismically. [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|Four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812]], estimated at approximately 8 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]], had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area, and were felt in many other places in the Midwestern and eastern U.S. These earthquakes created [[Reelfoot Lake]] in Tennessee from the altered landscape near the river.

== Length ==
When measured from its traditional source at [[Lake Itasca]], the Mississippi has a length of {{convert|2320|mi|km}}. When measured from its longest stream source (most distant source from the sea), [[Brower's Spring]] in [[Montana]], the source of the [[Missouri River]], it has a length of {{convert|3710|mi|km}}, making it the fourth longest river in the world after the [[Nile]], [[Amazon River|Amazon]], and [[Yangtze]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKwx0VBB68IC&q=mississippi+missouri+river+3710+miles&pg=PA4|title=Settlements of the Mississippi River|first=Rob|last=Bowden|date=January 27, 2005|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|via=Google Books|access-date=January 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120015935/https://books.google.com/books?id=zKwx0VBB68IC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=mississippi+missouri+river+3710+miles&source=bl&ots=wPaH9BCeO3&sig=6L5kxtiX07EMsfp1xgSxBmeHGuw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV3dGKj7PYAhVBmeAKHbaFAbk4ChDoAQg1MAQ#v=onepage&q=mississippi+missouri+river+3710+miles&f=false|archive-date=November 20, 2018|url-status=live|isbn=9781403457196}}</ref> When measured by the largest stream source (by water volume), the [[Ohio River]], by extension the [[Allegheny river]], would be the source, and the Mississippi would begin in [[Pennsylvania]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Cultural geography==
===State boundaries===
The Mississippi River runs through or along 10 states, from [[Minnesota]] to [[Louisiana]], and is used to define portions of these states borders, with [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Mississippi]] along the east side of the river, and [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]] along its west side. Substantial parts of both Minnesota and Louisiana are on either side of the river, although the Mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states.

In all of these cases, the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2546 |title=encyclopediaofarkansas.net |publisher=encyclopediaofarkansas.net |date=April 28, 2010 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102215918/http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2546 |archive-date=November 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011110141308/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/spain/sp1795.htm Yale.edu] "''[[Pinckney's Treaty|Treaty of Friendship, Limits, and Navigation]]''", Avalon project at the [[Yale Law School]]</ref> In various areas, the river has since shifted, but the state borders have not changed, still following the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their establishment, leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel, contiguous with the adjacent state. Also, due to a meander in the river, a [[Kentucky Bend|small part of western Kentucky]] is contiguous with Tennessee, but isolated from the rest of its state.

The earliest bridge across the Mississippi River was built in 1855. It spanned the river in [[Minneapolis]] where the current [[Hennepin Avenue Bridge]] is located.<ref>{{cite book|last = Costello|first = Mary Charlotte|year = 2002|title = Climbing the Mississippi River Bridge by Bridge|volume=Volume Two: Minnesota|publisher = Adventure Publications|location = Cambridge, Minnesota|isbn = 0-9644518-2-4}}</ref> No highway or railroad tunnels cross under the Mississippi River.

The first railroad bridge across the Mississippi was built in 1856. It spanned the river between the [[Rock Island Arsenal]] in [[Illinois]] and Davenport, Iowa. Steamboat captains of the day, fearful of competition from the railroads, considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat ''Effie Afton'' rammed part of the bridge, setting it on fire. Legal proceedings ensued, with [[Abraham Lincoln]] defending the railroad. The lawsuit went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which ruled in favor of the railroad.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michael A.

A clear channel is needed for the [[barge]]s and other vessels that make the [[main stem]] Mississippi one of the great commercial [[waterway]]s of the world. The task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], which was established in 1802.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usace.army.mil/History/Documents/Brief/03-transportation/transport.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328040856/http://www.usace.army.mil/History/Documents/Brief/03-transportation/transport.html|archive-date=March 28, 2010 |title=US Army Corps of Engineers, Brief History |publisher=Usace.army.mil |access-date=November 6, 2010}}</ref> Earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags, close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and [[Shoal|sandbars]].

Steamboats entered trade in the 1820s, so the period 1830–1850 became the golden age of steamboats. As there were few roads or rails in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase, river traffic was an ideal solution. Cotton, timber and food came down the river, as did Appalachian coal. The port of New Orleans boomed as it was the trans-shipment point to deep sea ocean vessels. As a result, the image of the twin stacked, wedding cake Mississippi steamer entered into American mythology. Steamers worked the entire route from the trickles of Montana, to the Ohio River; down the Missouri and Tennessee, to the main channel of the Mississippi. Only with the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s did steamboat traffic diminish. Steamboats remained a feature until the 1920s. Most have been superseded by pusher tugs. A few survive as icons—the [[Delta Queen]] and the [[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]] for instance.

A series of 29 [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and dams on the upper Mississippi, most of which were built in the 1930s, is designed primarily to maintain a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} channel for commercial barge traffic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi River |work=USGS: Status and trends of the nation's biological resources |url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/ms137.htm |access-date=February 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927145009/http://biology.usgs.gov/s%2Bt/SNT/noframe/ms137.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2006 |url-status=dead }}

The dams make the river deeper and wider but do not stop it. No flood control is intended. During periods of high flow, the gates, some of which are submersible, are completely opened and the dams simply cease to function. Below St. Louis, the Mississippi is relatively free-flowing, although it is constrained by numerous levees and directed by numerous [[wing dam]]s.

On the lower Mississippi, from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to the mouth of the Mississippi, the navigation depth is {{convert|45|ft}}, allowing container ships and cruise ships to dock at the [[Port of New Orleans]] and bulk cargo ships shorter than {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} air draft that fit under the [[Huey P.

===19th century===
[[File:Lock and Dam 11.jpg|thumb|[[Lock and Dam No. 11]], north of Dubuque, Iowa (2007)]]
In 1829, there were surveys of the two major obstacles on the upper Mississippi, the [[Des Moines Rapids]] and the [[Rock Island Rapids]], where the river was shallow and the riverbed was rock. The Des Moines Rapids were about {{convert|11|mi|km}} long and just above the mouth of the [[Des Moines River]] at Keokuk, Iowa. The Rock Island Rapids were between [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] and [[Moline, Illinois]]. Both rapids were considered virtually impassable.

In 1848, the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] was built to connect the Mississippi River to [[Lake Michigan]] via the Illinois River near [[Peru, Illinois]]. The canal allowed shipping between these important waterways. In 1900, the canal was replaced by the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]]. The second canal, in addition to shipping, also allowed Chicago to address specific health issues ([[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and other waterborne diseases) by sending its waste down the Illinois and Mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of Lake Michigan.

The Corps of Engineers recommended the excavation of a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} channel at the Des Moines Rapids, but work did not begin until after Lieutenant [[Robert E. Lee]] endorsed the project in 1837. The Corps later also began excavating the Rock Island Rapids. By 1866, it had become evident that excavation was impractical, and it was decided to build a canal around the Des Moines Rapids. The canal opened in 1877, but the Rock Island Rapids remained an obstacle. In 1878, Congress authorized the Corps to establish a {{convert|4.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} channel to be obtained by building wing dams that direct the river to a narrow channel causing it to cut a deeper channel, by closing secondary channels and by dredging. The channel project was complete when the Moline Lock, which bypassed the Rock Island Rapids, opened in 1907.

To improve navigation between St. Paul, Minnesota, and [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], the Corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area, including [[Lake Winnibigoshish]] and [[Pokegama Dam|Lake Pokegama]]. The dams, which were built beginning in the 1880s, stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth.

</div>

===20th century===
In 1907, Congress authorized a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} channel project on the Mississippi River, which was not complete when it was abandoned in the late 1920s in favor of the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} channel project.

In 1913, construction was complete on [[Lock and Dam No. 19]] at [[Keokuk, Iowa]], the first dam below St. Anthony Falls. Built by a private power company ([[Union Electric Company]] of St. Louis) to generate electricity (originally for [[streetcars in St. Louis]]), the Keokuk dam was one of the largest [[hydro-electric]] plants in the world at the time. The dam also eliminated the Des Moines Rapids. [[Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River|Lock and Dam No. 1]] was completed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1917. [[Lock and Dam No. 2]], near [[Hastings, Minnesota]], was completed in 1930.

Before the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the Corps's primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river. It was thought that the river's [[velocity]] would scour off bottom [[sediment]]s, deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding. The 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river.

The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 authorized the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid}} channel project, which called for a navigation channel {{convert|9|ft}} feet deep and {{convert|400|ft}} wide to accommodate multiple-barge tows.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Mississippi and its Uses | work=Natural Resource Management Section, Rock Island Engineers | url=http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/mrc/mrt/Docs/Designing%20the%20Project%20Flood%20info%20paper.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005433/http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/mrc/mrt/Docs/Designing%20the%20Project%20Flood%20info%20paper.pdf | archive-date=June 4, 2011 | access-date=June 21, 2006}}

Twenty-three new locks and dams were built on the upper Mississippi in the 1930s in addition to the three already in existence.

Until the 1950s, there was no dam below Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois. [[Chain of Rocks Lock]] (Lock and Dam No. 27), which consists of a low-water dam and an {{convert|8.4|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} canal, was added in 1953, just below the confluence with the Missouri River, primarily to bypass a series of rock ledges at St. Louis. It also serves to protect the St. Louis city water intakes during times of low water.

U.S. government scientists determined in the 1950s that the Mississippi River was starting to switch to the Atchafalaya River channel because of its much steeper path to the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually the Atchafalaya River would capture the Mississippi River and become its main channel to the Gulf of Mexico, leaving New Orleans on a side channel. As a result, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] authorized a project called the [[Old River Control Structure]], which has prevented the Mississippi River from leaving its current channel that drains into the Gulf via New Orleans.<ref name="SJSU">{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/oldriver.htm|title=The Old River Control Structure on the Lower Mississippi River|publisher=sjsu.edu|access-date=June 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204205943/http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/oldriver.htm|archive-date=December 4, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Because the large scale of high-energy water flow threatened to damage the structure, an auxiliary flow control station was built adjacent to the standing control station. This $300&nbsp;million project was completed in 1986 by the Corps of Engineers. Beginning in the 1970s, the Corps applied [[hydrological transport model]]s to analyze flood flow and water quality of the Mississippi. Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois, which had structural problems, was replaced by the Mel Price Lock and Dam in 1990. The original Lock and Dam 26 was demolished.

The Corps now actively creates and maintains spillways and floodways to divert periodic water surges into backwater channels and lakes, as well as route part of the Mississippi's flow into the [[Atchafalaya Basin]] and from there to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], bypassing [[Baton Rouge]] and [[New Orleans]]. The main structures are the [[Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway]] in Missouri; the [[Old River Control Structure]] and the [[Morganza Spillway]] in Louisiana, which direct excess water down the west and east sides (respectively) of the [[Atchafalaya River]]; and the [[Bonnet Carré Spillway]], also in Louisiana, which directs floodwaters to [[Lake Pontchartrain]] (see diagram). Some experts blame [[urban sprawl]] for increases in both the risk and frequency of flooding on the Mississippi River.<ref name="The Associated Press">{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d9bb6d9bfbfe46d58305ad591c105243/st-louis-area-faces-big-cleanup-effort-after-flooding|title=Levees among possible cause of more frequent flooding|author=Jim Salter|date=January 4, 2016|access-date=January 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106064145/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d9bb6d9bfbfe46d58305ad591c105243/st-louis-area-faces-big-cleanup-effort-after-flooding|archive-date=January 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
Approximately 50,000 years ago, the [[Central United States]] was covered by an inland sea, which was drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries into the Gulf of Mexico—creating large [[floodplain]]s and extending the continent further to the south in the process. The soil in areas such as Louisiana was thereafter found to be very rich.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Nicks|editor-first=Oran W.|title=This Island Earth|publisher=[[NASA]]|year=1970|page=137}}</ref>
===Native Americans===
{{Main article|Woodland period|Hopewell tradition|Mississippian culture}}
The area of the Mississippi River basin was first [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settled]] by [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American peoples]] and is considered one of the few independent centers of [[Domestication of plants|plant domestication]] in human history.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=P.J. |last1=Richerson |first2=R. |last2=Boyd |first3=R.L. |last3=Bettinger |title=Was Agriculture Impossible During the Pleistocene but Mandatory during the Holocene?

The lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000&nbsp;BC during what is now called the [[Woodland period]], with increasing evidence of shelter construction, [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas|pottery]], [[weaving]] and other practices. 

A network of trade routes referred to as the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell interaction sphere]] was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 AD, spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. A period of more isolated communities followed, and agriculture introduced from [[Mesoamerica]] based on the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] (maize, [[beans]] and squash) gradually came to dominate. After around 800 AD there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the [[Mississippian culture]], with evidence of highly [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[complex society|complex]] [[chiefdom]]s and large [[human settlement|population centers]]. 

The most prominent of these, now called [[Cahokia]], was occupied between about 600 and 1400 AD<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208230201/http://www.sacredland.org/historical_sites_pages/miss_mounds.html |archive-date=February 8, 2005 |url=http://www.sacredland.org/historical_sites_pages/miss_mounds.html |publisher=Sacredland.org |title=Mississippian Mounds |work=Sacred Land Film Project }}</ref> and at its peak numbered between 8,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, larger than London, England of that time.

On May 8, 1541, Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto]] became the first recorded European to reach the Mississippi River, which he called ''Río del Espíritu Santo'' ("River of the Holy Spirit"), in the area of what is now Mississippi. In Spanish, the river is called ''Río Mississippi''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cec.org/naatlas/NA-Watersheds.gif|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070612063513/http://www.cec.org/naatlas/NA-Watersheds.gif|url-status=dead|title=NA-Watersheds.gif (3060x2660 pixels)|date=June 12, 2007|archive-date=June 12, 2007|website=cec.org|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

French explorers [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]] began exploring the Mississippi in the 17th century. Marquette traveled with a [[Sioux]] Indian who named it ''Ne Tongo'' ("Big river" in [[Sioux language]]) in 1673. Marquette proposed calling it the ''River of the [[Immaculate Conception]]''.

When [[Louis Jolliet]] explored the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century, natives guided him to a quicker way to return to French Canada via the Illinois River. When he found the [[Chicago Portage]], he remarked that a canal of "only half a [[League (unit)|league]]" (less than {{convert|2|mi|km|0|disp=or|sp=us}}) would join the Mississippi and the Great Lakes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1437.html |title=Jolliet and La Salle's Canal Plans |publisher=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |access-date=November 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201051932/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1437.html |archive-date=December 1, 2010  }}</ref> In 1848, the [[continental divide]] separating the waters of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley was breached by the [[Illinois and Michigan canal]] via the [[Chicago River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ilmi/ |title=Illinois & Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor |publisher=Nps.gov |date=August 24, 1984 |access-date=November 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528042135/http://www.nps.gov/ilmi/ |archive-date=May 28, 2010 }}</ref> This both accelerated the development, and forever changed the ecology of the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.

In 1682, [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] claimed the entire Mississippi River Valley for France, calling the river ''Colbert River'' after [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and the region ''[[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]]'', for [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]].

In 1718, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} upriver, New Orleans was established along the river crescent by [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], with construction patterned after the 1711 resettlement on Mobile Bay of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the capital of French Louisiana at the time.

===Colonization===
{{see also|Flood of 1851}}
[[File:A Home on the Mississippi.png|thumb|''[[A Home on the Mississippi]]'' (1871)]]
Following [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years War]] the Mississippi became the border between the British and [[Spanish Empire]]s. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] gave [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] rights to all land east of the Mississippi and Spain rights to land west of the Mississippi. Spain also ceded [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to Britain to regain [[Cuba]], which the British occupied during the war. Britain then divided the territory into [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]].

Article 8 of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] states, "The navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States". With this treaty, which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain also ceded West Florida back to Spain to regain [[the Bahamas]], which Spain had occupied during the war. Initial disputes around the ensuing claims of the U.S. and Spain were resolved when Spain was pressured into signing [[Pinckney's Treaty]] in 1795. However, in 1800, under duress from Napoleon of France, Spain ceded an undefined portion of West Florida to France in the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. The United States then secured effective control of the river when it bought the [[Louisiana Territory]] from France in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. This triggered a dispute between Spain and the U.S. on which parts of West Florida Spain had ceded to France in the first place, which would, in turn, decide which parts of West Florida the U.S. had bought from France in the Louisiana Purchase, versus which were unceded Spanish property. Following ongoing U.S. colonization creating facts on the ground, and U.S. military actions, Spain ceded both West Florida and East Florida in their entirety to the United States in the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819. 

The last serious European challenge to U.S. control of the river came at the conclusion of [[War of 1812]] when British forces mounted an attack on [[New Orleans]] – the attack [[Battle of New Orleans|was repulsed]] by an American army under the command of General [[Andrew Jackson]].

In the [[Treaty of 1818]], the U.S. and Great Britain agreed to fix the border running from the [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]] along the [[49th parallel north]]. In effect, the U.S. ceded the northwestern extremity of the Mississippi basin to the British in exchange for the southern portion of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] basin.

So many settlers traveled westward through the Mississippi river basin, as well as settled in it, that Zadok Cramer wrote a guide book called ''[[The Navigator (1801 guide book)|The Navigator]]'', detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area. It was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over a period of 25 years.

[[File:Mississippi River-sand bars.jpg|thumb|Shifting [[shoal|sand bars]] made early navigation difficult.]]

The colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|earthquakes in 1811 and 1812]], estimated at approximately 8 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]], that were centered near [[New Madrid, Missouri]].

===Steamboat era===
{{Main article|Steamboats of the Mississippi}}

Mark Twain's book, ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', covered the [[steamboat]] commerce which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer. The book was published first in serial form in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in seven parts in 1875. The full version, including a passage from the then unfinished ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' and works from other authors, was published by James R. Osgood & Company in 1885.

The first steamboat to travel the full length of the Lower Mississippi from the Ohio River to New Orleans was the ''[[New Orleans (steamboat)|New Orleans]]'' in December 1811. Its maiden voyage occurred during the series of [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|New Madrid earthquakes]] in 1811–12. The Upper Mississippi was treacherous, unpredictable and to make traveling worse, the area was not properly mapped out or surveyed. Until the 1840s only two trips a year to the Twin Cities landings were made by steamboats which suggests it was not very profitable.<ref>Roseman, Curtis C., and Elizabeth M. Roseman. Grand Excursions on the Upper Mississippi River : Places, Landscapes, And Regional Identity After 1854. Iowa City: University Of Iowa Press, 2004.</ref>

Steamboat transport remained a viable industry, both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th century. Among the several Mississippi River system steamboat companies was the noted [[Anchor Line (riverboat company)|Anchor Line]], which, from 1859 to 1898, operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between St. Louis and New Orleans.

Italian explorer Giacomo Beltrami, wrote about his journey on the ''Virginia'', which was the first steamboat to make it to Fort St. Anthony in Minnesota. He referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the Mississippi. The steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the Mississippi, as well as the nature of travel itself. The Mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourist trade.<ref>Smith, Thomas Ruys. River of Dreams : Imagining The Mississippi Before Mark Twain. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007.</ref>

===Civil War===

[[File:Mississippi River from Eunice, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|Mississippi River from [[Eunice, Arkansas]], a ghost town. Eunice was destroyed by gunboats during the Civil War.]]

Control of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the [[American Civil War]]. In 1862 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces coming down the river successfully cleared Confederate defenses at [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island Number 10]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]], while Naval forces coming upriver from the Gulf of Mexico captured [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. The remaining major Confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], and the Union's [[Vicksburg Campaign]] (December 1862 to July 1863), and the fall of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]], completed control of the lower Mississippi River. The Union victory ending the [[Siege of Vicksburg]] on July 4, 1863, was pivotal to the Union's final victory of the Civil War.

The remains of wooden-hulled water craft were exposed in an area of {{convert|4.5|acre|ha}} on the bottom of the Mississippi River at West Memphis, Arkansas. They dated to the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The State of Arkansas, the Arkansas Archeological Survey, and the Arkansas Archeological Society responded with a two-month data recovery effort. The fieldwork received national media attention as good news in the middle of a drought.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993|Great Flood of 1993]] was another significant flood, primarily affecting the Mississippi above its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois.

Two portions of the Mississippi were designated as [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997: the lower portion around Louisiana and Tennessee, and the upper portion around Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin. The Nature Conservancy's project called "America's Rivershed Initiative" announced a 'report card' assessment of the entire basin in October 2015 and gave the grade of D+. The assessment noted the aging navigation and flood control infrastructure along with multiple environmental problems.<ref>"Mississippi River Basin Receives D+ in First-Ever Report Card" (Press Release).

===Future===
Geologists believe that the lower Mississippi could take a new course to the Gulf. Either of two new routes—through the [[Atchafalaya Basin]] or through [[Lake Pontchartrain]]—might become the Mississippi's main channel if flood-control structures are overtopped or heavily damaged during a severe flood.<ref name="AmericasWetlands">{{cite web |url=http://www.americaswetlandresources.com/background_facts/detailedstory/LouisianaRiverControl.html |title=Controlling the Mighty Mississippi's path to the sea |publisher=Americaswetlandresources.com |date=January 6, 2012 |access-date=March 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310124727/http://www.americaswetlandresources.com/background_facts/detailedstory/LouisianaRiverControl.html |archive-date=March 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="DailyImpact">{{cite web|title=Mississippi Rising: Apocalypse Now?

Failure of the [[Old River Control Structure]], the [[Morganza Spillway]], or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the Mississippi through [[Louisiana]]'s [[Atchafalaya Basin]] and down the [[Atchafalaya River]] to reach the Gulf of Mexico south of [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] in southern Louisiana. This route provides a more direct path to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] than the present Mississippi River channel through [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and [[New Orleans]].<ref name="InteractiveMap"/> While the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event, such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction, maintenance, and operation of various levees, spillways, and other control structures by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

[[File:Old River Control Structure Complex.jpg|thumb|The Old River Control Structure complex. View is to the [[east-southeast]], looking downriver on the Mississippi, with the three dams across channels of the [[Atchafalaya River]] to the right of the Mississippi. [[Concordia Parish, Louisiana]] is in the foreground, on the right, and [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], is in the background, across the Mississippi on the left.]]
The Old River Control Structure, between the present Mississippi River channel and the Atchafalaya Basin, sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30% of the Mississippi's flow to the Atchafalaya River. There is a steep drop here away from the Mississippi's main channel into the Atchafalaya Basin. If this facility were to fail during a major flood, there is a strong concern the water would [[Bridge scour|scour]] and erode the river bottom enough to capture the Mississippi's main channel. The structure was nearly lost during the [[1973 Mississippi River floods|1973 flood]], but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play. In particular, the Corps of Engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity. These additional facilities give the Corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973, which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods, such as that of [[2011 Mississippi River floods|2011]].

Because the Morganza Spillway is slightly higher and well back from the river, it is normally dry on both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/article/20110512/NEWS01/105120319/Morganza-ready-flood?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Cimg%7CFRONTPAGE |title=Morganza ready for flood &#124; The Advertiser |publisher=theadvertiser.com |date=May 12, 2011 |access-date=May 16, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood, the floodwaters would have to erode to normal water levels before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} During the 2011 floods, the Corps of Engineers opened the Morganza Spillway to 1/4 of its capacity to allow {{convert|150,000|ft3/s|m3/s}} of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans.<ref name="usace-inundation">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511164822/http://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/bcarre/NO_District_Inundation_Spring_May_2011.pdf Estimated Inundation] (US Army Corps of Engineers)</ref> In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream, this diversion reduced the chances of a channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Schleifstein, The Times-Picayune |url=http://www.nola.com/weather/index.ssf/2011/05/army_corps_fears_massive_flood.html |title=Mississippi River flooding in New Orleans area could be massive if Morganza spillway stays closed |newspaper=NOLA.com |access-date=May 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514051400/http://www.nola.com/weather/index.ssf/2011/05/army_corps_fears_massive_flood.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Some geologists have noted that the possibility for course change into the Atchafalaya also exists in the area immediately north of the Old River Control Structure. Army Corps of Engineers geologist Fred Smith once stated, "The Mississippi wants to go west. 1973 was a forty-year flood. The big one lies out there somewhere—when the structures can't release all the floodwaters and the levee is going to have to give way. That is when the river's going to jump its banks and try to break through."<ref>{{cite web |last=McPhee |first=John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987_02_23_039_TNY_CARDS_000347146?currentPage=all |title=McPhee, The Control of Nature: Atchafalaya |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=February 23, 1987 |access-date=May 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514052013/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987_02_23_039_TNY_CARDS_000347146?currentPage=all |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Another possible course change for the Mississippi River is a diversion into [[Lake Pontchartrain]] near [[New Orleans]]. This route is controlled by the [[Bonnet Carré Spillway]], built to reduce flooding in New Orleans. This spillway and an imperfect natural levee about 4–6 meters (12 to 20 feet) high are all that prevents the Mississippi from taking a new, shorter course through Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnweeks.com/river_mississippi/pages/lmiss25.html |title=Bonnet Carre Spillway, Norco, LA |publisher=Johnweeks.com |date=April 10, 2008 |access-date=May 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515092839/http://www.johnweeks.com/river_mississippi/pages/lmiss25.html |archive-date=May 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Diversion of the Mississippi's main channel through Lake Pontchartrain would have consequences similar to an Atchafalaya diversion, but to a lesser extent, since the present river channel would remain in use past Baton Rouge and into the New Orleans area.

There are seven [[National Park Service]] sites along the Mississippi River. The [[Mississippi National River and Recreation Area]] is the National Park Service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the Mississippi River itself. The other six National Park Service sites along the river are (listed from north to south):
* [[Effigy Mounds National Monument]]
* [[Gateway Arch National Park]] (includes [[Gateway Arch]])
* [[Vicksburg National Military Park]]
* [[Natchez National Historical Park]]
* [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]]
* [[Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve]]

==Ecology==
[[File:Paddlefish underwater.jpeg|thumb|The [[American paddlefish]] is an ancient [[Relict (biology)|relict]] from the Mississippi]]

The Mississippi basin is home to a highly diverse aquatic [[fauna]] and has been called the "mother fauna" of North American fresh water.<ref name=Matthews1998>{{cite book | author=Matthews, W.J. | title=Patterns in Freshwater Fish Ecology | year=1998 | pages=5 and 236 | isbn=978-1-4615-4066-3 }}</ref>

===Fish===
About 375 fish species are known from the Mississippi basin, far exceeding other North Hemisphere river basin exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions,<ref name=Matthews1998/> except the [[Yangtze]].<ref>{{cite book | authors=Ye, S.; Li, Z.; Liu, J;, Zhang, T.; and Xie, S. | chapter=Distribution, Endemism and Conservation Status of Fishes in the Yangtze River Basin, China | year=2011 | pages=41–66 | title=Ecosystems Biodiversity | isbn=978-953-307-417-7 }}</ref> Within the Mississippi basin, streams that have their source in the Appalachian and [[Ozark]] highlands contain especially many species. Among the fish species in the basin are numerous [[endemic]]s, as well as [[Relict (biology)|relicts]] such as [[American paddlefish|paddlefish]], [[sturgeon]], [[gar]] and [[bowfin]].<ref name=Matthews1998/>

Because of its size and high species diversity, the Mississippi basin is often divided into subregions. The Upper Mississippi River alone is home to about 120 fish species, including [[walleye]], [[sauger]], [[large mouth bass]], [[small mouth bass]], [[white bass]], [[northern pike]], [[bluegill]], [[crappie]], [[channel catfish]], [[flathead catfish]], [[common shiner]], [[freshwater drum]] and [[shovelnose sturgeon]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fish of the Mississippi River|url=http://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Portals/48/docs/Recreation/ODM/pdf/Fish%20of%20the%20Mississippi%20River.pdf|access-date=March 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224103239/http://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Portals/48/docs/Recreation/ODM/pdf/Fish%20of%20the%20Mississippi%20River.pdf|archive-date=February 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fish Species of the Mississippi River|url=http://bestdamfishingfloat.com/fish-species-of-the-mississippi-river/|access-date=March 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012121314/http://bestdamfishingfloat.com/fish-species-of-the-mississippi-river/|archive-date=October 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Other fauna===
In addition to fish, several species of turtles (such as [[Common snapping turtle|snapping]], [[Sternotherus|musk]], [[Kinosternon|mud]], [[Graptemys|map]], [[Pseudemys|cooter]], [[Painted turtle|painted]] and [[Apalone|softshell]] turtles), [[American alligator]], aquatic amphibians (such as [[hellbender]], [[mudpuppy]], [[three-toed amphiuma]] and [[lesser siren]]),<ref>{{cite book | author1=Conant, R. | author2=J.T.

===Introduced species===
Numerous [[introduced species]] are found in the Mississippi and some of these are [[Invasive species|invasive]]. Among the introductions are fish such as [[Asian carp in North America|Asian carp]], including the [[silver carp]] that have become infamous for outcompeting native fish and their potentially dangerous [[Asian carp in North America#Jumping ability|jumping behavior]].
