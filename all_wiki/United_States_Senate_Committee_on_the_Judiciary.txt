== History ==
Established in 1816 as one of the original standing committees in the United States Senate, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary is one of the oldest and most influential committees in Congress. Its broad legislative jurisdiction has assured its primary role as a forum for the public discussion of social and constitutional issues. The committee is also responsible for oversight of key activities of the executive branch, and is responsible for the initial stages of the confirmation process of all judicial nominations for the federal judiciary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/about/history|title=History {{!}} United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|website=www.judiciary.senate.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}</ref>
