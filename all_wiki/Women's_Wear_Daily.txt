==History==
===Founding and John Fairchild===
''WWD'' was founded by Edmund Fairchild on July 13, 1910 as an outgrowth of the [[menswear]] journal ''[[Daily News Record]]''.<ref name="trager">Trager, James. ''The New York Chronology: A Compendium of Events, People, and Anecdotes from the Dutch to the Present.'' [[HarperCollins]] (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xvGhQoNT27IC&pg=PA325&sig=5LiQE4R34zIa17Y25crXLGv75Kw p325] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708230136/http://books.google.com/books?id=xvGhQoNT27IC&pg=PA325&sig=5LiQE4R34zIa17Y25crXLGv75Kw |date=2014-07-08 }}. {{ISBN|0-06-074062-0}}.</ref> The publication quickly acquired a firm standing in the New York clothing industry, due to the influence of its first advertisers. [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Rosenbaum Russell]] served as ''Women's Wear Daily'''s first [[Paris]] correspondent.<ref>''Women's Wear Daily'', August 22, 1911.</ref> Reporters for the publication were sometimes assigned to the last row of [[haute couture|couture]] shows, but the publication gained popularity by the last 1950s.<ref name="horyn"/> 

[[John Fairchild (editor)|John B. Fairchild]], who became the European bureau chief of Fairchild Publications in 1955 and the publisher of ''WWD'' in 1960, improved ''WWD''<nowiki/>'s standing by focusing on the human side of fashion.<ref name="horyn"/>  He turned his newspaper's attention to the social scene of [[fashion designer]]s and their clients, and helped manufacture a "cult of celebrity" around designers.<ref name="horyn"/>  Fairchild also played hardball to help his circulation.  After two couturiers forbade press coverage until one month after buyers had seen their clothes, Fairchild published photos and sketches anyway.<ref name="gross cite">Fairchild, John. ''The Fashionable Savages''. Doubleday (1965). (Cited in [[Michael Gross (writer)|Gross, Michael]].  [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D61330F93BA35756C0A961948260 "Women's Wear Daily and Feuds in Fashion"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. (May 8, 1987).)</ref>  He even sent reporters to fashion houses disguised as messengers, or had them observe designers' new styles from windows of buildings opposite fashion houses.<ref name="gross cite"/>  "I have learned in fashion to be a little savage," he wrote in his memoir.<ref name="gross cite"/>  John Fairchild was publisher of the magazine from 1960 to 1996.<ref name="horyn"/>

Under Fairchild, the company's feuds were also legendary.<ref name="horyn"/><ref name="rothenberg"/> When a designer's statements or work offended Fairchild, he would retaliate, sometimes banning any reference to them in his newspaper for years at a stretch.<ref name="rothenberg"/>  The newspaper famously sparred with [[Hubert de Givenchy]],<ref name="rothenberg"/><ref name="gross"/> [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]],<ref name="gross">[[Michael Gross (writer)|Gross, Michael]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D61330F93BA35756C0A961948260 "Women's Wear Daily and Feuds in Fashion"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In response, some designers forbade their representatives from speaking to WWD reporters or disinvited ''WWD'' reporters from their [[fashion show]]s.<ref name="gross"/>  In general, though, those excluded "kept their mouths shut and [took] it on the chin."<ref>Former WWD publisher James Brady. Quoted in Rothenberg, Randall. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D6143FF934A2575BC0A96E948260 "From Pauline Trigere, a Dressing Down"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. (August 17, 1988).</ref>  When designer [[Pauline Trigère]], who had been excluded from the paper for three years, took out a full-page advertisement protesting the ban in the fashion section of a 1988 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', it was believed to be the first widely distributed counterattack on Fairchild's policy.<ref name="rothenberg"/>

===1999 to 2013: Condé Nast Publications===
In 1999, Fairchild Publications was sold by the [[Walt Disney Company]] to [[Advance Publications]], the [[parent company]] of [[Condé Nast Publications]].<ref>Barringer, Felicity. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE1DB1F38F936A1575BC0A96F958260 "Fashion Magazine Industry Consolidates with a Big Deal"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. (August 25, 1999).</ref> As a result, Fairchild Publications became a unit of Condé Nast,<ref name="hoovers">[[Hoover's]] In-Depth Company Records. "Fairchild Publications, Inc." March 21, 2007.</ref> though ''WWD'' was technically operated separately from Condé Nast's consumer publications such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]''.<ref name="post">MacIntosh, Jeane.  "Will WWD Play It Straight for SI?". ''[[New York Post]]''. (Feb. 7, 2000).</ref>

In November 2010, ''WWD'' celebrated its 100th anniversary at the [[Cipriani]] in New York, with some of the fashion industry's leading experts including designers [[Alber Elbaz]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Michael Kors]].<ref>[http://www.rescu.com.au/_blog/Shopping/post/Fashion_wrap_up-_WWD_celebrate_100_years,_Kate_Moss_for_TopShop_and_more/ WWD celebrate 100 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106224931/http://www.rescu.com.au/_blog/Shopping/post/Fashion_wrap_up-_WWD_celebrate_100_years,_Kate_Moss_for_TopShop_and_more/ |date=2010-11-06 }} www.rescu.com.au</ref>
