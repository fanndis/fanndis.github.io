==Etymology and definition==
The English term and concept of ''serial killer'' are commonly attributed to former [[FBI]] [[Special agent (United States)|Special agent]] [[Robert Ressler]] who used the term ''serial homicide'' in 1974 in a lecture at [[Police Staff College, Bramshill|Police Staff Academy]] in [[Bramshill]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=29}}, {{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=5}}</ref> Author [[Ann Rule]] postulates in her book [[Kiss Me, Kill Me]] (2004), that the English-language credit for coining the term goes to [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective Pierce Brooks, who created the [[Violent Criminal Apprehension Program]] (ViCAP) system in 1985.{{sfn|Rule|2004|p=225}} There is ample evidence the term was used in Europe and the United States earlier.

The German term and concept were coined by criminologist [[Ernst Gennat]], who described [[Peter Kürten]] as a ''{{lang|de|Serienmörder}}'' ('serial-murderer') in his article "{{lang|de|Die Düsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen}}" (1930).{{sfn|Gennat|1930|pp=7, 27–32, 49–54, 79–82}} In his book, ''[[Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters]]'' (2004), criminal justice historian [[Peter Vronsky]] notes that while Ressler might have coined the English term "serial homicide" within the law in 1974, the terms ''serial murder'' and ''serial murderer'' appear in [[John Brophy (writer)|John Brophy]]'s book ''The Meaning of Murder'' (1966).<ref name="=Vronsky"/> The Washington DC newspaper ''[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]]'', in a 1967 review of the book:<ref>{{cite news |title=Review: ''The Meaning of Murder'' |work=[[The Washington Star|Evening Star]] |location=Washington DC |date=May 30, 1967 |at=p. 12, col. 4 }}</ref> {{quote|There is the mass murderer, or what he [Brophy] calls the "serial" killer, who may be actuated by greed, such as insurance, or retention or growth of power, like the [[House of Medici|Medicis]] of Renaissance Italy, or [[Henri Désiré Landru|Landru]], the "[[bluebeard]]" of the World War I period, who murdered numerous wives after taking their money.|author=|title=|source=}}

In his more recent study, Vronsky states that the term ''serial killing'' first entered into broader American popular usage when published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the spring of 1981, to describe Atlanta serial killer [[Wayne Williams]]. Subsequently, throughout the 1980s, the term was used again in the pages of ''The New York Times'', one of the major national news publication of the United States, on 233 occasions. By the end of the 1990s, the use of the term had increased to 2,514 instances in the paper.{{sfn|Vronsky|2013}}

When defining serial killers, researchers generally use "three or more murders" as the baseline,<ref name="Most common"/> considering it sufficient to provide a pattern without being overly restrictive.{{sfn|Petherick|2005|p=190}} Independent of the number of murders, they need to have been committed at different times, and are usually committed in different places.{{sfn|Flowers|2012|p=195}} The lack of a cooling-off period (a significant break between the murders) marks the difference between a [[spree killer]] and a serial killer. The category has, however, been found to be of no real value to law enforcement, because of definitional problems relating to the concept of a "cooling-off period".<ref name="fbi.gov" /> Cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent "cooling off period" or "return to normality" have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of "spree-serial killer".<ref name="=Vronsky">{{harvnb|Vronsky|2004}}</ref> 

In ''Controversial Issues in Criminology'', Fuller and Hickey write that "[t]he element of time involved between murderous acts is primary in the differentiation of serial, mass, and spree murderers", later elaborating that spree killers "will engage in the killing acts for days or weeks" while the "methods of murder and types of victims vary". [[Andrew Cunanan]] is given as an example of spree killing, while [[Charles Whitman]] is mentioned in connection with mass murder, and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] with serial killing.<ref>Fuller, John R. & Hickey, Eric W.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnxHAAAAMAAJ ''Controversial Issues in Criminology'']; Allyn and Bacon, 1999. pp. 36.</ref>

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) defines serial killing as "a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone".<ref>{{harvnb|Burkhalter Chmelir|2003|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Morton|2005|pp=4, 9}}</ref> In 2005, the FBI hosted a multi-disciplinary symposium in San Antonio, Texas, which brought together 135 experts on serial murder from a variety of fields and specialties with the goal of identifying the commonalities of knowledge regarding serial murder. The group also settled on a definition of serial murder which FBI investigators widely accept as their standard: "The unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s) in separate events".<ref name="fbi.gov" /> The definition does not consider the motivation for killing nor define a cooling-off period.

[[Liu Pengli]] of China, nephew of the [[Han dynasty|Han]] Emperor [[Emperor Jing of Han|Jing]], was made Prince of Jidong in the sixth year of the middle period of Jing's reign (144&nbsp;BC). According to the Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], he would "go out on marauding expeditions with 20 or 30 [[slave]]s or with young men who were in hiding from the law, murdering people and seizing their belongings for sheer sport". Although many of his subjects knew about these murders, it was not until the 29th year of his reign that the son of one of his victims finally sent a report to the Emperor. Eventually, it was discovered that he had murdered at least 100 people. The officials of the court requested that Liu Pengli be executed; however, the emperor could not bear to have his own nephew killed, so Liu Pengli was made a commoner and banished.{{sfn|Qian|1993|p=387}}

==Characteristics==
Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following:
*They may exhibit varying degrees of [[mental illness]] or [[psychopathy]], which may contribute to their homicidal behavior.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2005}}, {{harvnb|Skeem|Polaschek|Patrick|Lilienfeld2011|pp=95–162}}</ref>
**For example, someone who is mentally ill may have [[psychotic]] breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities.{{sfn|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=145}}
**Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking, a lack of [[remorse]] or [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[impulsivity]], the need for control, and predatory behavior.<ref name="fbi.gov">{{harvnb|Morton|2005}}</ref> Unlike people with major mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[psychopaths]] can seem normal and often quite [[Superficial charm|charming]], a state of adaptation that [[psychiatrist]] [[Hervey M.

*They were often [[child abuse|abused]]—[[Psychological abuse|emotionally]], [[physical abuse|physically]], or [[Child sexual abuse|sexually]]—by a family member.<ref name="Tick"/>
*Serial killers may be more likely to engage in [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[partialism]] or [[necrophilia]], which are [[paraphilia]]s that involve a strong tendency to experience the object of erotic interest almost as if it were a physical representation of the symbolized body. Individuals engage in paraphilias which are organized along a continuum; participating in varying levels of fantasy perhaps by focusing on body parts (partialism), symbolic objects which serve as physical extensions of the body (fetishism), or the anatomical physicality of the human body; specifically regarding its inner parts and sexual organs (one example being necrophilia).{{sfn|Silva|Leong|Ferrari|2004|p=794}}
*A disproportionate number exhibit one, two, or all three of the [[Macdonald triad]]{{dubious|date=August 2020}} of predictors of future violent behavior:
**Many are fascinated with [[Pyromania|fire setting]].<ref name="Tick"/>
**They are involved in [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] activity; especially in children who have not reached sexual maturity, this activity may take the form of [[zoosadism|torturing animals]].<ref name="Tick"/>
**More than 60 percent, or simply a large proportion, [[enuresis|wet their beds]] beyond the age of 12.<ref name="Tick"/>{{sfn|Singer|Hensley|2004|pp=48, 461–476}}
*They were frequently [[bullying|bullied]] or socially isolated as children or adolescents.<ref name="Tick"/> For example, [[Henry Lee Lucas]] was ridiculed as a child and later cited the mass rejection by his peers as a cause for his hatred of everyone. [[Kenneth Bianchi]] was teased as a child because he urinated in his pants, suffered twitching, and as a teenager was ignored by his peers.<ref name="Tick" />
*Some were involved in petty crimes, such as fraud, theft, [[vandalism]], or similar offenses.{{sfn|Mount|2007|pp=131–133}}
*Often, they have trouble staying employed and tend to work in menial jobs. The FBI, however, states, "Serial murderers often seem normal; have families and/or a steady job."<ref name="fbi.gov" /> Other sources state they often come from unstable families.<ref name="Tick"/>
*Studies have suggested that serial killers generally have an average or low-average [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], although they are often described, and perceived, as possessing IQs in the above-average range.<ref name="Tick">{{cite web|first=Shirley Lynn |last=Scott |title=What Makes Serial Killers Tick? |publisher=[[truTV]] |accessdate=January 9, 2011 |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/victims_1.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728094415/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/tick/victims_1.html |archivedate=July 28, 2010}}</ref><ref name="fbi.gov" /><ref name="The Root">Holloway, Lynette.

===Development===
Many serial killers have faced similar problems in their childhood development.<ref name="PlotnikKouyoumdjian2010">{{cite book|author1=Rod Plotnik|author2=Haig Kouyoumdjian|title=Introduction to Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2txsCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA509|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-79100-1|page=509}}</ref> Hickey's Trauma Control Model explains how early childhood trauma can set the child up for [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] in adulthood; the child's environment (either their parents or society) is the dominant factor determining whether or not the child's behavior escalates into homicidal activity.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|2000|p=107}}

Family, or lack thereof, is the most prominent part of a child's development because it is what the child can identify with on a regular basis.{{sfn|Tithecott|1997|p=38}} "The serial killer is no different from any other individual who is instigated to seek approval from parents, sexual partners, or others."{{sfn|Hale|1993|p=41}} This need for approval is what influences children to attempt to develop social relationships with their family and peers. "The quality of their attachments to parents and other members of the family is critical to how these children relate to and value other members of society."{{sfn|Hasselt|1999|p=166}}

Wilson and Seaman (1990) conducted a study on incarcerated serial killers, and what they concluded was the most influential factor that contributed to their homicidal activity.{{sfn|Wilson|Seaman|1992}} Almost all of the serial killers in the study had experienced some sort of environmental problems during their childhood, such as a broken home caused by divorce, or a lack of a parental figure to discipline the child. Nearly half of the serial killers had experienced some type of physical or sexual abuse, and more of them had experienced emotional neglect.{{sfn|Hasselt|1999|p=162}} 

When a parent has a drug or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] problem, the attention in the household is on the parents rather than the child. This neglect of the child leads to the lowering of their self-esteem and helps develop a fantasy world in which they are in control. Hickey's Trauma Control Model supports how the neglect from parents can facilitate deviant behavior, especially if the child sees substance abuse in action.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=107}} This then leads to [[disposition]] (the inability to attach), which can further lead to homicidal behavior, unless the child finds a way to develop substantial relationships and fight the label they receive. If a child receives no support from anyone, then he or she is unlikely to recover from the [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] event in a positive way. As stated by E. E. Maccoby, "the family has continued to be seen as a major—perhaps ''the'' major—arena for socialization".{{sfn|Maccoby|1992|pp=1006–17}}

There have been recent studies looking into the possibility that an abnormality with one's [[chromosome]]s could be the trigger for serial killers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201803/do-all-serial-killers-have-genetic-predisposition-kill|title=Do All Serial Killers Have a Genetic Predisposition to Kill? - Exploring a Complex Question|website=Psychology Today|author=Berit Brogaard D.M.Sci., Ph.D|year=2018}}</ref> Two serial killers, [[Bobby Joe Long]] and [[Richard Speck]], came to attention for reported chromosomal abnormalities. Long had an [[Klinefelter syndrome|extra X chromosome]].  Speck was erroneously reported to have an [[XYY syndrome|extra Y chromosome]]; in fact, his [[karyotype]] was performed twice and was normal each time.  Hellen Morrison, an American forensic psychiatrist, said in an interview that while researchers have not identified a specific causal gene, the fact that the majority of serial killers are male leads researchers to believe there is "a change associated with the male chromosome make up".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodgers|first=Abby|title=A Terrifying Glimpse into The Mind of a Serial Killer|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/12-shocking-and-twisted-facts-about-the-worlds-serial-killers-2012-6?op=1|work=Business Insider|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}</ref>

====Fantasy====
Children who do not have the [[Power (social and political)|power]] to control the mistreatment they suffer sometimes create a new reality to which they can escape. This new reality becomes their [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] that they have total control of and becomes part of their daily existence. In this fantasy world, their emotional development is guided and maintained. According to Garrison (1996), "the child becomes [[sociopathic]] because the normal development of the concepts of right and wrong and [[empathy]] towards others is retarded because the child's emotional and [[Social change|social development]] occurs within his self-centered fantasies. A person can do no wrong in his own world and the pain of others is of no consequence when the purpose of the fantasy world is to satisfy the needs of one person" (Garrison, 1996). Boundaries between fantasy and reality are lost and fantasies turn to dominance, control, sexual conquest, and violence, eventually leading to murder. Fantasy can lead to the first step in the process of a dissociative state, which, in the words of Stephen Giannangelo, "allows the serial killer to leave the stream of consciousness for what is, to him, a better place".{{sfn|Giannangelo|1996|p=33}}

[[Criminology|Criminologist]] Jose Sanchez reports, "the young criminal you see today is more detached from his victim, more ready to hurt or kill.  The lack of empathy for their victims among young criminals is just one symptom of a problem that afflicts the whole society."{{sfn|Tithecott|1997|p=38}} Lorenzo Carcaterra, author of ''Gangster'' (2001), explains how potential criminals are [[Labeling theory|labeled by society]], which can then lead to their offspring also developing in the same way through the [[cycle of violence]]. The ability for serial killers to appreciate the mental life of others is severely compromised, presumably leading to their dehumanization of others.<ref name="auto">{{harvnb|Silva|Leong|Ferrari|2004|p=790}}, {{harvnb|Tithecott|1997|page=43}}</ref>

This process may be considered an expression of the intersubjectivity associated with a cognitive deficit regarding the capability to make sharp distinctions between other people and inanimate objects. For these individuals, objects can appear to possess animistic or humanistic power while people are perceived as objects.<ref name="auto"/> Before he was executed, serial killer [[Ted Bundy]] stated media violence and pornography had stimulated and increased his need to commit homicide, although this statement was made during last-ditch efforts to appeal his death sentence.{{sfn|Hasselt|1999|p=162}} However, correlation is not causation (a disturbed physiological disposition, psychosis, lack of socialization, or aggressiveness may contribute to both fantasy creation and serial killing without fantasy creation generally contributing to serial killing for instance). There are exceptions to the typical fantasy patterns of serial killers, as in the case of [[Dennis Rader]], who was a loving family man and the leader of his church.

===Organized, disorganized, and mixed===
[[File:Ted Bundy headshot.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ted Bundy]] in custody, Florida, United States, July 1978 (State Archives of Florida)]]

The [[FBI]]'s ''[[Crime Classification Manual]]'' places serial killers into three categories: ''organized'', ''disorganized'', and ''mixed'' (i.e., offenders who exhibit organized and disorganized characteristics).{{sfn|Vronsky|2004|pp=99–100}}<ref name="PerperCina2010">{{cite book|author1=Joshua A.

Organized serial killers often plan their crimes methodically, usually abducting victims, killing them in one place and disposing of them in another. They often lure the victims with ploys appealing to their sense of sympathy. Others specifically target prostitutes, who are likely to go voluntarily with a stranger. These killers maintain a high degree of control over the [[crime scene]] and usually have a solid knowledge of [[forensic science]] that enables them to cover their tracks, such as burying the body or weighing it down and sinking it in a river. They follow their crimes in the news media carefully and often take pride in their actions as if it were all a grand project.{{sfn|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=113}}

Often, organized killers have social and other interpersonal skills sufficient to enable them to develop both personal and romantic relationships, friends and lovers and sometimes even attract and maintain a spouse and sustain a family including children. Among serial killers, those of this type are in the event of their capture most likely to be described by acquaintances as kind and unlikely to hurt anyone. [[Ted Bundy]] and [[John Wayne Gacy]] are examples of organized serial killers.{{sfn|Ressler|Schachtman|1993|p=113}} In general, the [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]]s of organized serial killers tend to be near normal range, with a mean of 94.7. Organized nonsocial offenders tend to be on the higher end of the average, with a mean IQ of 99.2.<ref name="radfordfgcudb">{{cite web|title=Serial Killer Statistics|url=http://skdb.fgcu.edu/public/Serial%20Killer%20Statistics%206SEP2014.pdf|last=Aamodt|first=Dr. Mike|authorlink=Mike Aamodt|date=|website=|publisher=[[Radford University]]/[[Florida Gulf Coast University|FGCU]] Serial Killer Database|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215045712/http://skdb.fgcu.edu/public/Serial%20Killer%20Statistics%206SEP2014.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2015|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>

Disorganized serial killers are usually far more impulsive, often committing their murders with a random weapon available at the time, and usually do not attempt to hide the body. They are likely to be unemployed, a loner, or both, with very few friends. They often turn out to have a history of mental illness, and their [[modus operandi]] (M.O.) or lack thereof is often marked by excessive violence and sometimes [[necrophilia]] or sexual violence.<ref name="Serial Killers">{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/serial-killers |title=Serial Killers |accessdate=May 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309132810/http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/serial-killers |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}</ref> Disorganized serial killers have been found to have a slightly lower mean IQ than organized serial killers, at 92.8.<ref name=radfordfgcudb/>

Kelleher and Kelleher (1998) created several categories to describe female serial killers. They used the classifications of ''[[Wiktionary:black widow|black widow]]'', ''[[Angel of Death (Criminology)|angel of death]]'', ''sexual predator'', ''revenge'', ''profit or crime'', ''team killer'', ''question of sanity'', ''unexplained'', and ''unsolved''. In using these categories, they observed that most women fell into the categories of the black widow or team killer.<ref name="Frei"/> Although motivations for female serial killers can include attention seeking, addiction, or the result of psychopathological behavioral factors,<ref name="concordia1"/> female serial killers are commonly categorized as murdering men for material gain, usually being emotionally close to their victims,<ref name="Kelleher 1998 12"/> and generally needing to have a relationship with the victim,<ref name="Frei">{{harvnb|Frei|Völlm|Graf|Dittmann|2006|pp=167–176}}</ref> hence the traditional cultural image of the "black widow". 

The methods that female serial killers use for murder are frequently covert or low-profile, such as murder by poison (the preferred choice for killing).<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|Hilton|1998|pp=495–498}}, {{harvnb|Frei|Völlm|Graf|Dittmann|2006|pp=167–176}}, {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=171}}, {{harvnb|Newton|2006}}</ref> Other methods used by female serial killers include shootings (used by 20%), suffocation (16%), stabbing (11%), and drowning (5%).<ref name="concordia1">{{cite book|url=http://www-psychology.concordia.ca/fac/Laurence/forensic/ProfileAnalysis1.ppt |title=Educated attempt to provide specific information about a certain type of suspect |publisher=Department of Psychology, Concordia University |format=PPT |year=2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081443/http://www-psychology.concordia.ca/fac/Laurence/forensic/ProfileAnalysis1.ppt |archivedate=April 26, 2012}}</ref> They commit killings in specific places, such as their home or a health-care facility, or at different locations within the same city or state.<ref>{{harvnb|Vronsky|2007|pp=1, 42–43}}, {{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=312}}</ref> A notable exception to the typical characteristics of female serial killers is [[Aileen Wuornos]],<ref>{{harvnb|Schechter|2003|p=31}}, {{harvnb|Fox|Levin|2005|p=117}}</ref> who killed outdoors instead of at home, used a gun instead of poison, and killed strangers instead of friends or family.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmid|2005|p=231}}, {{harvnb|Arrigo|Griffin|2004|pp=375–393}}</ref> One "analysis of 86 female serial killers from the United States found that the victims tended to be spouses, children or the elderly".<ref name="Frei"/> Other studies indicate that since 1975, increasingly strangers are marginally the most preferred victim of female serial killers,{{sfn|Vronsky|2007|p=41}} or that only 26% of female serial killers kill for material gain only.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=267}} Sources state that each killer will have her own proclivities, needs and triggers.<ref name="Wilson 1998 495–498">{{harvnb|Wilson|Hilton|1998|pp=495–498}}</ref><ref name="Frei"/> A review of the published literature on female serial murder stated that "sexual or [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] motives are believed to be extremely rare in female serial murderers, and psychopathic traits and histories of childhood abuse have been consistently reported in these women."<ref name="Frei"/> 

A study by Eric W. Hickey (2010) of 64 female serial killers in the United States indicated that sexual activity was one of several motives in 10% of the cases, enjoyment in 11% and control in 14% and that 51% of all U.S. female serial killers murdered at least one woman and 31% murdered at least one child.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p=265}} In other cases, women have been involved as an accomplice with a male serial killer as a part of a serial killing team.<ref name="Wilson 1998 495–498"/><ref name="Frei"/> A 2015 study published in ''The Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology'' found that the most common motive for female serial killers was for financial gain and almost 40% of them had experienced some sort of mental illness.{{sfn|Harrison|Murphy|Ho|Bowers2015|pp=383–406}}

[[Peter Vronsky]] in ''[[Female Serial Killers]]'' (2007) maintains that female serial killers today often kill for the same reason males do: as a means of expressing rage and control. He suggests that sometimes the theft of the victims' property by the female "black widow" type serial killer appears to be for material gain, but really is akin to a male serial killer's collecting of totems (souvenirs) from the victim as a way of exerting continued control over the victim and reliving it.{{sfn|Vronsky|2007}} By contrast, Hickey states that although popular perception sees "black widow" female serial killers as something of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] past, in his statistical study of female serial killer cases reported in the United States since 1826, approximately 75% occurred since 1950.<ref>[http://archive.today/794Pa Eric W. Hickey], (2010).</ref>

[[Elizabeth Báthory]] is sometimes cited as the most prolific female serial killer in all of history. Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed (Báthory Erzsébet in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], August 7, 1560 – August 21, 1614) was a countess from the renowned [[Báthory family]]. Before her husband's death, Elizabeth took great pleasure in torturing the staff, by jamming pins under the servant's fingernails or stripping servants and throwing them into the snow.{{sfn|Yardley|Wilson|2015|pp=1–26}} After her husband's death, she and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls and young women, with one witness attributing to them over 600 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80. Elizabeth herself was neither tried nor convicted. In 1610, however, she was imprisoned in the Csejte Castle, where she remained bricked in a set of rooms until her death four years later.{{sfn|Vronsky|2007|p=73}}

=== Juvenile ===
Juvenile serial killers are rare. There are three main categories that juvenile serial killers can fit into: primary, maturing, and secondary killers. There have been studies done to compare and contrast these three groups and to discover similarities and differences between them.{{sfn|Kirby|2009}} Although these types of serial killers are less common, oftentimes adult serial killers may make their debut at an early age and it can be an opportunity for researchers to study what factors brought about the behavior. Though it is rare, the youngest felon on death row is in fact, a juvenile serial killer named [[Harvey Miguel Robinson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201207/youngest-serial-killer-death-row|title=Youngest Serial Killer on Death Row|website=Psychology Today|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref>

=== Ethnicity and demographics in the United States ===
<!-- NOTE: Refrain from adding too much information about one race and/or ethnicity, as to avoid bias and WP:UNDUE WEIGHT-->

The racial demographics regarding serial killers are often subject to debate. In the United States, the majority of reported and investigated serial killers are white males, from a lower-to-middle-class background, usually in their late 20s to early 30s.<ref name="Tick"/><ref name="fbi.gov"/> However, there are African American, Asian, and [[Hispanic America|Hispanic]] (of any race) serial killers as well, and, according to the FBI, based on percentages of the U.S. population, whites are not more likely than other races to be serial killers.<ref name="fbi.gov"/> [[Offender profiling|Criminal profiler]] [[Pat Brown (criminal profiler)|Pat Brown]] says serial killers are usually reported as white because serial killers usually target victims of their own race, and argues the media typically focuses on "All-American" [[Missing white woman syndrome|white and pretty female victims]] who were the targets of white male offenders; that crimes among [[Ethnic Minorities|minority]] offenders in urban communities, where crime rates are higher, are under-investigated; and that minority serial killers likely exist at the same ratios as white serial killers for the population. She believes that the myth that serial killers are always white might have become "truth" in some research fields due to the over-reporting of white serial killers in the media.{{sfn|Brown|2008|p=12}}

According to some sources, the percentage of serial killers who are African American is estimated to be between 13% and 22%.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|author=N. R.

In a 2005 article Anthony Walsh, professor of criminal justice at Boise State University, argued a review of post-WWII serial killings in America finds that the prevalence of non-white serial killers has typically been drastically underestimated in both professional research literature and the mass media. As a paradigmatic case of this media double standard, Walsh cites news reporting on white killer [[Gary Heidnik]] and African-American killer [[Harrison Graham]]. Both men were residents of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania; both imprisoned, tortured, and killed several women; and both were arrested only months apart in 1987. "Heidnik received widespread national attention, became the subject of books and television shows, and served as a model for the fictitious Buffalo Bill in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|Silence of the Lambs]]''", writes Walsh, while "Graham received virtually no media attention outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, despite having been convicted of four more murders than Heidnik".{{sfn|Walsh|2005|pp=271–291}}

=== Outside the United States ===
There is not much research about serial homicide in non-Western countries, or outside the U.S.

===Mission-oriented===
Mission-oriented killers typically justify their acts as "ridding the world" of certain types of people perceived as undesirable, such as the [[homeless]], [[ex-cons]], homosexuals, [[Substance abuse|drug users]], prostitutes, or people of different ethnicity or religion; however, they are generally not psychotic.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|1998|p=43}} Some see themselves as attempting to change society, often to cure a societal ill.{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|2002|p=112}}

An example of a mission-oriented killer would be [[Joseph Paul Franklin]], an American [[white supremacist]] who exclusively targeted [[Jewish]], [[biracial]], and [[African-American]] individuals for the purpose of inciting a "[[race war]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox19.com/2020/02/18/worst-serial-killer-i-ever-dealt-with-confession-joseph-paul-franklin/|title='The worst serial killer I ever dealt with': The confession of Joseph Paul Franklin|first=Jason|last=Scott|website=https://www.fox19.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201809/understanding-pragmatic-mission-killers|title=Understanding Pragmatic Mission Killers|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>

===Hedonistic===
This type of serial killer seeks thrills and derives pleasure from killing, seeing people as expendable means to this goal. [[Forensic psychology|Forensic psychologists]] have identified three subtypes of the hedonistic killer: "lust", "thrill", and "comfort".{{sfn|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}

====Lust====
[[File:Paul Durousseau.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Paul Durousseau]] raped and murdered at least seven young women.]]

Sex is the primary motive of lust killers, whether or not the victims are dead, and fantasy plays a large role in their killings.<ref name="BartolBartol2008"/> Their sexual gratification depends on the amount of torture and [[mutilation]] they perform on their victims. The sexual serial murderer has a psychological need to have absolute control, dominance, and power over their victims, and the infliction of torture, pain, and ultimately death is used in an attempt to fulfill their need.{{sfn|Myers|McElroy|Burton|Recoppa|1993|pp=435–451}} They usually use weapons that require close contact with the victims, such as knives or hands. As lust killers continue with their murders, the time between killings decreases or the required level of stimulation increases, sometimes both.<ref>{{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}, {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|2001|p=163}}, {{harvnb|Dobbert|2004|pp=10–11}}</ref>

[[Kenneth Bianchi]], one of the "[[Hillside Strangler]]s", murdered women and girls of different ages, races, and appearance because his sexual urges required different types of stimulation and increasing intensity.{{sfn|Dobbert|2004|p=10-11}} [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] searched for his perfect fantasy lover—beautiful, submissive and eternal. As his desire increased, he experimented with drugs, alcohol, and exotic sex. His increasing need for stimulation was demonstrated by the dismemberment of victims, whose heads and genitals he preserved, and by his attempts to create a "living zombie" under his control (by pouring acid into a hole drilled into the victim's skull).<ref>{{harvnb|Giannangelo|2012}}, {{harvnb|Fulero|Wrightsman|2008}}, {{harvnb|Dvorchak|Holewa|1991}}</ref> 

Dahmer once said, "Lust played a big part of it. Control and lust. Once it happened the first time, it just seemed like it had control of my life from there on in. The killing was just a means to an end. That was the least satisfactory part. I didn't enjoy doing that. That's why I tried to create living zombies with acid and the drill." He further elaborated on this, also saying, "I wanted to see if it was possible to make—again, it sounds really gross—uh, zombies, people that would not have a will of their own, but would follow my instructions without resistance. So after that, I started using the drilling technique."{{sfn|MacCormick|2003|p=431}} He experimented with [[cannibalism]] to "ensure his victims would always be a part of him".{{sfn|Dobbert|2004|p=11}}

====Thrill====
{{Main|Thrill killing}}
The primary motive of a thrill killer is to induce pain or terror in their victims, which provides stimulation and excitement for the killer.<ref name="BartolBartol2008">{{cite book|author1=Curt R. Bartol|author2=Anne M. Bartol|title=Introduction to Forensic Psychology: Research and Application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=on2XfplaMTQC&pg=PA285|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5830-1|pages=285–286}}</ref> They seek the [[adrenaline]] rush provided by hunting and killing victims. Thrill killers murder only for the kill; usually, the attack is not prolonged, and there is no sexual aspect. Usually, the victims are strangers, although the killer may have followed them for a period of time. Thrill killers can abstain from killing for long periods of time and become more successful at killing as they refine their [[Modus operandi|murder methods]]. Many attempt to commit the [[perfect crime]] and believe they will not be caught.<ref>{{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}, {{harvnb|Howard|Smith|2004|p=4}}</ref>

====Comfort (profit)====

Material gain and a comfortable lifestyle are the primary motives of comfort killers.<ref name="BartolBartol2012">{{cite book|author1=Curt R. Bartol|author2=Anne M. Bartol|title=Criminal & Behavioral Profiling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYcgAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT197|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-8908-3|pages=197–199}}</ref> Usually, the victims are family members and close acquaintances.<ref name="BartolBartol2008"/> After a murder, a comfort killer will usually wait for a period of time before killing again to allow any suspicions by family or authorities to subside. They often use poison, most notably [[arsenic]], to kill their victims. Female serial killers are often comfort killers, although not all comfort killers are female.<ref>{{harvnb|Bartol|Bartol|2004|p=146}}, {{harvnb|Schlesinger|2000|p=276}}, {{harvnb|Holmes|Holmes|2000|p=41}}</ref>

===Power/control===
[[File:Illustrated Police News - Jack the Ripper 2.png|thumb| A policeman discovering the body of [[Catherine Eddowes]], one of [[Jack the Ripper]]'s victims]]
The main objective for this type of serial killer is to gain and exert [[Power (social and political)|power]] over their victim. Such killers are sometimes [[child abuse|abused as children]], leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers [[sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Egger|first=Steven A.|year=2000|title=Why Serial Murderers Kill: An Overview|journal=Contemporary Issues Companion: Serial Killers}}</ref> [[Ted Bundy]] is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.{{sfn|Peck|Dolche|2000|p=255}}

===Media influences===
Many serial killers claim that a violent culture influenced them to commit murders. During his final interview, [[Ted Bundy]] stated that [[hardcore pornography]] was responsible for his actions. Others idolise figures for their deeds or perceived [[vigilante]] justice, such as [[Peter Kürten]], who idolized [[Jack the Ripper]], or [[John Wayne Gacy]] and [[Ed Kemper]], who both idolized the actor [[John Wayne]].<ref name="Tick" />

Killers who have a strong desire for fame or to be renowned for their actions desire media attention as a way of validating and spreading their crimes; fear is also a component here, as some serial killers enjoy causing fear. An example is [[Dennis Rader]], who sought attention from the press during his murder spree.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.biography.com/people/dennis-rader-241487|title = Dennis Rader|access-date = January 1, 2016|website = Biography|publisher = A&E Television Networks}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Many movies, books, and documentaries have been created, detailing serial killers' lives and crimes. For example, the biographical films ''[[Ted Bundy (film)|Ted Bundy]]'' (2002) and ''[[Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile]] '' focuses on serial killer [[Ted Bundy]]'s personal life in college, leading up to his execution, and ''[[Dahmer (film)|Dahmer]]'' (2002) tells the story of [[Jeffrey Dahmer]].

Serial killers are also portrayed in fictional media, oftentimes as having substantial intelligence and looking for difficult targets, despite the contradiction with the psychological profile of serial killers.{{sfn|Goldberg|Crespo|2003}}

===Theories===

====Biological and sociological====
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=May 2010}}
Theories for why certain people commit serial murder have been advanced. Some theorists believe the reasons are biological, suggesting serial killers are born, not made, and that their violent behavior is a result of abnormal brain activity. Holmes and Holmes believe that "until a reliable sample can be obtained and tested, there is no scientific statement that can be made concerning the exact role of [[biology]] as a determining factor of a serial killer personality."{{sfn|Holmes|Holmes|2010|p=55-56}} 

The "Fractured Identity Syndrome" (FIS) is a merging of [[Charles Cooley]]'s "[[looking glass self]]" and [[Erving Goffman]]'s "virtual" and "actual social identity" theories. The FIS suggests a social event, or series of events, during one's childhood or adolescence results in a fracturing of the personality of the serial killer. The term "fracture" is defined as a small breakage of the personality which is often not visible to the outside world and is only felt by the killer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/bibliographies/serialkillers.htm |title=SERIAL KILLERS |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |accessdate=May 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520203225/http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/bibliographies/serialkillers.htm |archivedate=May 20, 2010 }}</ref>

"Social Process Theory" has also been suggested as an explanation for serial murder. Social process theory states that offenders may turn to crime due to peer pressure, family and friends. Criminal behavior is a process of interaction with social institutions, in which everyone has the potential for criminal behavior.{{sfn|Hickey|2010|p={{Page needed|date=February 2011}}}} A lack of family structure and identity could also be a cause leading to serial murder traits. A child used as a scapegoat will be deprived of their capacity to feel guilt. Displaced anger could result in animal torture, as identified in the [[Macdonald triad]], and a further lack of basic identity.{{sfn|Claus|Lindberg|1999|pp=427–435}}

====Military====
[[File:Charles Ng.jpg|thumb|150px|A dishonorably discharged Marine, [[Charles Ng]] participated in the kidnapping, sadistic torture, rape and murder of numerous victims]]

The "military theory" has been proposed as an explanation for why serial murderers kill, as some serial murderers have served in the military or related fields. According to Castle and Hensley, 7% of the serial killers studied had military experience.<ref>{{harvnb|Castle|Hensley|2002|pp=453–465}}, {{harvnb|DeFronzo|Prochnow|2004|pp=104–108}}</ref> This figure may be a proportional under-representation when compared to the number of military veterans in a nation's total population. For example, according to the United States census for the year 2000, military veterans comprised 12.7% of the U.S. population;<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Richardson|first1= Christy |last2= Waldrop |first2= Judith| title= Veterans: 2000 |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-22.pdf |publisher= U.S. Census Bureau |year=2003 |accessdate= July 13, 2011| page=5 }}</ref> in England, it was estimated in 2007 that military veterans comprised 9.1% of the population.{{sfn|Woodhead|Sloggett|Bray|Bradbury|2009|pp=50–54}} Though by contrast, about 2.5% of the population of Canada in 2006 consisted of military veterans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/98-187-x/4151287-eng.htm#table3 |title=Estimated population of Canada, 1605 to present|date=July 6, 2009 |publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Veteran Population and the People We Serve |url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/sub.cfm?source=department%2Freports%2Ffiveyearplan03%2Fplan03_population |year=2003 |work=Veterans Affairs Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001151839/http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/sub.cfm?source=department%2Freports%2Ffiveyearplan03%2Fplan03_population |archivedate=October 1, 2012 }}</ref>

There are two theories that can be used to study the correlation between serial killing and military training: ''Applied learning theory'' states that serial killing can be learned. The military is training for higher kill rates from servicemen while training the soldiers to be desensitized to taking a human life.{{sfn|Castle|Hensley|2002}} ''Social learning theory'' can be used when soldiers get praised and accommodated for killing. They learn or believe that they learn, that it is acceptable to kill because they were praised for it in the military. Serial killers want accreditation for the work that they have done.<ref name="Exploring">Exploring serial murder from a social learning perspective. (January 3, 2011). Retrieved from [https://web.archive.org/web/20090104221523/http://www.deviantcrimes.com/serialmurder_sociallearning.htm http://www.deviantcrimes.com/serialmurder_sociallearning.htm].</ref>

In both military and serial killing, the offender or the soldier may become desensitized to killing as well as compartmentalized; the soldiers do not see enemy personnel as "human" and neither do serial killers see their victims as humans.{{sfn|Hamamoto|2002|pp=105–120}} The theories do not imply that military institutions make a deliberate effort to produce serial killers; to the contrary, all military personnel are trained to recognize when, where, and against whom it is appropriate to use deadly force, which starts with the basic ''[[Laws of war|Law of Land Warfare]]'', taught during the [[Recruit training|initial training phase]], and may include more stringent policies for military personnel in law enforcement or security.{{sfn|Atwood|1992}} They are also taught ethics in basic training.

==Investigation==

===FBI: Issues and practices===
In 2008, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) published a handbook titled ''Serial Murder'' which was the product of a symposium held in 2005 to bring together the many issues surrounding serial murder, including its investigation.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder|title=Serial Murder|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

====Identification====
[[File:Ángel Maturino Reséndiz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ángel Maturino Reséndiz]], who was an [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive]]]]

According to the FBI, identifying one, or multiple, murders as being the work of a serial killer is the first challenge an investigation faces, especially if the victim(s) come from a marginalized or high-risk population and is normally linked through forensic or behavioral evidence (FBI 2008).<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Should the cases cross multiple jurisdictions, the law enforcement system in the United States is fragmented and thus not configured to detect multiple similar murders across a large geographic area (Egger 1998).<ref name="egger1998">{{harvnb|Egger|2002}}</ref> The FBI suggests utilizing databases and increasing interdepartmental communication. Keppel (1989)<ref name="keppel1990">{{harvnb|Keppel|2000}}</ref> suggests holding multi-jurisdictional conferences regularly to compare cases giving departments a greater chance to detect linked cases and overcome linkage blindness. 

One such collaboration, the ''Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database Project''<ref>{{cite web|title=Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database Project – Justice Studies FGCU|url=http://skdb.fgcu.edu/info.asp|last=Elink-Schuurman-Laura|first=Kristin|date=|website=|publisher=[[Florida Gulf Coast University|FGCU Department of Justice Studies]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508064156/http://skdb.fgcu.edu/info.asp|archive-date=8 May 2013|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> was proposed at the 2012 [[International Association for Identification|FDIAI]] Annual Conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdiai.org/2012%20Conference%20Daily%20Schedule.htm |title=FDIAI 52nd Annual Conference |accessdate=February 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031044256/http://fdiai.org/2012%20Conference%20Daily%20Schedule.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2012 }}</ref> Utilizing [[Radford University|Radford]]'s Serial Killer Database as a starting point, the new collaboration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Serial%20Killer%20Information%20Center/Serial%20Killer%20Statistics.pdf|title=Serial Killer Statistics|last=Aamodt|first=Dr. Mike|publisher=Radford University|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref> hosted by [[Florida Gulf Coast University|FGCU]] Justice Studies, has invited and is working in conjunction with other universities to maintain and expand the scope of the database to also include [[Spree killer|spree]] and [[mass murder]]s. Utilizing over 170 data points, multiple-murderer [[methodology]] and [[victimology]]; researchers and Law Enforcement Agencies can build [[Case study|case studies]] and statistical profiles to further research the ''Who, What, Why and How'' of these types of crimes.

====Leadership====
Leadership, or administration, should play a small or virtually non-existent role in the actual investigation past assigning knowledgeable or experienced homicide investigators to lead positions. The administration's role is not to run the investigation but to establish and reaffirm the primary goal of catching the serial killer, as well as provide support for the investigators. The FBI (2008) suggests completing Memorandums of Understanding to facilitate support and commitment of resources from different jurisdictions to an investigation.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Egger (1998) takes this one step further and suggests completing mutual aid pacts, which are written agreements to provide support to each other in a time of need, with surrounding jurisdictions. Doing this in advance would save time and resources that could be used on the investigation.<ref name="egger1998"/>

====Organization====
Organization of the structure of an investigation is key to its success, as demonstrated by the investigation of Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer. Once a serial murder case was established, a task force was created to track down and arrest the offender. Over the course of the investigation, for various reasons, the task force's organization was radically changed and reorganized multiple times – at one point including more than 50 full-time personnel, and at another, only a single investigator. Eventually, what led to the end of the investigation was a conference of 25 detectives organized to share ideas to solve the case.<ref name="guillen2007">{{harvnb|Guillen|2007}}</ref>

The FBI handbook provides a description of how a task force should be organized but offers no additional options on how to structure the investigation. While it appears advantageous to have a full-time staff assigned to a serial murder investigation, it can become prohibitively expensive. For example, the Green River Task Force cost upwards of $2&nbsp;million per year,<ref name="guillen2007"/> and as was witnessed with the Green River Killer investigation, other strategies can prevail where a task force fails.

[[File:Albert deSalvo.jpg|thumb|[[Albert De Salvo]], who claimed to be the "[[Boston Strangler]]", after being caught in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1967.]]
A common strategy, already employed by many departments for other reasons, is the conference, in which departments get together and focus on a specific set of topics.<ref name="egger1990">{{harvnb|Egger|1990}}</ref> With serial murders, the focus is typically on unsolved cases, with evidence thought to be related to the case at hand.

Similar to a conference is an information clearing-house in which a jurisdiction with a suspected serial murder case collects all of its evidence and actively seeks data which may be related from other jurisdictions.<ref name="egger1990"/> By collecting all of the related information into one place, they provide a central point in which it can be organized and easily accessed by other jurisdictions working toward the goal of arresting an offender and ending the murders.

Already mentioned was the task force,<ref name="egger1990"/> FBI 2008,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Keppel 1989<ref name="keppel1990"/> which provides for a flexible, organized, framework for jurisdictions depending on the needs of the investigation. Unfortunately due to the need to commit resources (manpower, money, equipment, etc.) for long periods of time it can be an unsustainable option.

In the case of the investigation of Aileen Wournos, the Marion County Sheriff coordinated multiple agencies without any written or formal agreement.<ref name="egger1998"/> While not a specific strategy for a serial murder investigation, this is certainly a best practice in so far as the agencies were able to work easily together toward a common goal.

Finally, once a serial murder investigation has been identified, the use of an FBI Rapid Response Team can assist both experienced and inexperienced jurisdictions in setting up a task force. This is completed by organizing and delegating jobs, by compiling and analyzing clues, and by establishing communication between the parties involved.<ref name="egger1998"/>

====Resource augmentation====
During the course of a serial murder investigation, it may become necessary to call in additional resources; the FBI defines this as Resource Augmentation. Within the structure of a task force, the addition of a resource should be thought of as either long term or short term. If the task force's framework is expanded to include the new resource, then it should be permanent and not removed. For short term needs, such as setting up roadblocks or canvassing a neighborhood, additional resources should be called in on a short-term basis. The decision of whether resources are needed short or long term should be left to the lead investigator and facilitated by the administration (FBI 2008).<ref name="autogenerated1"/> 

The confusion and counter productiveness created by changing the structure of a task force mid investigation is illustrated by the way the Green River Task Force's staffing and structure was changed multiple times throughout the investigation. This made an already complicated situation more difficult, resulting in the delay or loss of information, which allowed Ridgeway to continue killing (Guillen 2007).<ref name="guillen2007"/> The FBI model does not take into account that permanently expanding a task force, or investigative structure, may not be possible due to cost or personnel availability. Egger (1998) offers several alternative strategies including; using investigative consultants, or experienced staff to augment an investigative team. Not all departments have investigators experienced in serial murder and by temporarily bringing in consultants, they can educate a department to a level of competence then step out. This would reduce the initially established framework of the investigation team and save the department the cost of retaining the consultants until the conclusion of the investigation.<ref name="egger1998"/>

====Communication====
The FBI handbook (2008)<ref name="autogenerated1"/> and Keppel (1989)<ref name="keppel1990"/> both stress communication as paramount. The difference is that the FBI handbook (2008)<ref name="autogenerated1"/> concentrates primarily on communication within a task force while Keppel (1989)<ref name="keppel1990"/> makes getting information out to and allowing information to be passed back from patrol officers a priority. The FBI handbook (2008)<ref name="autogenerated1"/> suggests having daily e-mail or in-person briefings for all staff involved in the investigation and providing periodic summary briefings to patrol officer and managers. Looking back on a majority of serial murderer arrests, most are exercised by patrol officers in the course of their everyday duties and unrelated to the ongoing serial murder investigation (Egger 1998,<ref name="egger1998"/> Keppel 1989).<ref name="keppel1990"/> 

Keppel (1989)<ref name="keppel1990"/> provides examples of Larry Eyler, who was arrested during a traffic stop for a parking violation, and Ted Bundy, who was arrested during a traffic stop for operating a stolen vehicle. In each case, it was uniformed officers, not directly involved in the investigation, who knew what to look for and took the direct action that stopped the killer. By providing up to date (as opposed to periodic) briefings and information to officers on the street the chances of catching a serial killer, or finding solid leads, are increased.

====Data management====
A serial murder investigation generates staggering amounts of data, all of which needs to be reviewed and analyzed. A standardized method of documenting and distributing information must be established and investigators must be allowed time to complete reports while investigating leads and at the end of a shift (FBI 2008).<ref name="autogenerated1"/> When the mechanism for data management is insufficient, leads are not only lost or buried but the investigation can be hindered and new information can become difficult to obtain or become corrupted.<ref name="guillen2007"/>

During the Green River Killer investigation, reporters would often find and interview possible victims or witnesses ahead of investigators. The understaffed investigation was unable to keep up the information flow, which prevented them from promptly responding to leads. To make matters worse, investigators believed that the journalists, untrained in interviewing victims or witnesses of crimes, would corrupt the information and result in unreliable leads (Guillen 2007).<ref name="guillen2007"/>

==Memorabilia==
Notorious and infamous serial killers number in the hundreds and a subculture revolves around their legacies. That subculture includes the collection, sale, and display of serial killer memorabilia, dubbed "[[murderabilia]]" by one of the best-known opponents of collectors of serial killer remnants, Andrew Kahan. He is the director of the Mayor's Crime Victims Office in Houston and is backed by the families of murder victims and "[[Son of Sam law]]s" existing in some states that prevent murderers from profiting from the publicity generated by their crimes.<ref name="Ramsland">{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/s_k_culture/1.html |title=Serial Killer Culture |last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |author2=Karen Pepper |publisher=Tru.tv Crime Library |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106080546/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/s_k_culture/1.html |archivedate=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>

Such memorabilia includes the paintings, writings, and poems of these killers.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91786&page=1 |title=Serial Killer Action Figures For Sale|last=Robinson|first=Bryan|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=April 1, 2010|date=January 7, 2006}}</ref> Recently, marketing has capitalized even more upon interest in serial killers with the rise of various merchandise such as [[trading card]]s, [[action figure]]s, and books such as ''The Serial Killer Files: The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World's Most Terrifying Murderers'' by [[Harold Schechter]], and ''The A-Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' by Schecter and David Everitt. Some serial killers attain celebrity status in the way they acquire fans and may have previous personal possessions auctioned off on websites like [[eBay]]. A few examples of this are [[Ed Gein]]'s 150-pound stolen gravestone and [[Bobby Joe Long]]'s sunglasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/s_k_culture/6.html |title=Serial Killer Culture |last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |author2=Karen Pepper |publisher=Tru.tv Crime Library |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601230659/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/s_k_culture/6.html |archivedate=June 1, 2009 }}</ref>
