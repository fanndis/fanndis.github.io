A '''jet trainer''' is a [[jet aircraft]] for use as a [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]], whether for basic or advanced [[flight training]]. Jet trainers are either custom designs or modifications of existing aircraft. With the introduction of military jet-powered aircraft towards the end of the World War II it became a requirement to train pilots in the handling of such aircraft.

==History==

The first generation of trainers in the 1940s were modified from existing designs like the Gloster Meteor and [[Lockheed T-33]] but with these were followed by custom training aircraft like the [[Aero L-29 Delfín]] and the [[BAC Jet Provost]].

As training developed different air forces used jet trainers for different phases of training. Although most air forces continued to use piston or later turboprop aircraft for basic training, a number of jet trainers like the [[Cessna T-37 Tweet]] appeared for the early stages of pilot training. Pilots who were picked to fly fighter or strike aircraft then went on to fly more advanced training aircraft like the [[Hawker Siddeley Gnat]].

As the early jet-trainers became obsolete then further generations have appeared, the British using the single-engine [[BAE Systems Hawk]] while the French ordered the [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet]]. In the Warsaw Pact the [[Aero L-39 Albatros]] became the standard jet trainer.

As the jet trainer developed it was also used for weapon training, which led to some trainers being modified as light strike aircraft; for example, the [[Cessna T-37 Tweet]] was developed into the [[Cessna A-37 Dragonfly]].
