==Early political career==
{{BLP sources|date=August 2011|section}}

Barroso's political activity began in his late teens, during the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime in Portugal, before the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974. In his university days, he was one of the leaders of the underground [[Maoism|Maoist]] MRPP (Re-Organized Movement of the Proletariat Party, later [[Portuguese Workers' Communist Party]] (PCTP/MRPP), Communist Party of the Portuguese Workers/Revolutionary Movement of the Portuguese Proletariat).<ref>{{cite news |title=Barroso’s role in the proletarian struggle |url=https://www.ft.com/content/43fc0028-3821-3e58-806f-9287842524f8 |work=Financial Times |date=9 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=José Manuel Barroso bullies the Irish |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3558827/Jose-Manuel-Barroso-bullies-the-Irish.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 May 2008}}</ref> In an interview with the newspaper ''[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]]'', he said that he had joined MRPP to fight the only other student body movement, also underground, which was controlled by the [[Portuguese Communist Party]]. Despite this justification, there is a very famous political 1976 interview recorded by the Portuguese state-run television channel, [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]], in which Barroso, as a politically minded student during the post-Carnation Revolution turmoil known as [[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso|PREC]], criticises the bourgeois [[education system]] which "throws students against workers and workers against students."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAHv3UnXvmM&feature=fvw|title=Barroso as a young, passionate Maoist student leader in 1976|last=Euractiv|date=20 January 2009|via=YouTube}}</ref> In December 1980, Barroso joined the right-of-centre PPD (Democratic Popular Party, later PPD/PSD-[[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]]), where he remains to the present day.

In 1985, under the PSD government of [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|113th]] [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], Barroso was named Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs. In 1987 he became a member of the same government as he was elevated to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (answering to the Minister of Foreign Affairs), a post he was to hold for the next five years. In this capacity, he was the driving force behind the [[Bicesse Accords]] of 1990, which led to a temporary armistice in the [[Angolan Civil War]] between the ruling [[MPLA]] and the opposition [[UNITA]]. He also supported independence for [[East Timor]], a former Portuguese colony, then a province of [[Indonesia]] by force. In 1992, Barroso was promoted to the post of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and served in this capacity until the defeat of the PSD in the 1995 general election.

==Prime Minister of Portugal==
While in opposition, Barroso was elected to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] in 1995 as a representative for [[Lisbon]]. There, he became chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1999 he was elected president of his political party, PSD, succeeding [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]] (a professor of law), and thus became Leader of the Opposition. [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|Parliamentary elections]] in 2002 gave the PSD enough seats to form a coalition government with the right-wing Portuguese [[People's Party (Portugal)|People's Party]], and Barroso subsequently became Prime Minister of Portugal on 6 April 2002.

As Prime Minister, facing a growing budget deficit, he made a number of difficult decisions and adopted strict reforms. He vowed to reduce public expenditure, which made him unpopular among leftists and public servants.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. His purpose was to lower the public budget deficit to a 3% target (according to the demands of EU rules), and official data during the 2002–2004 period stated that the target was being attained.

[[File:Bush, Barroso, Blair, Aznar at Azores.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Barroso Azores (far left) in March 2003]]
In March 2003, Barroso hosted U.S President [[George W. Bush]], British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and Spanish Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]] in the Portuguese island of Terceira, in the [[Azores]]. The four leaders finalised the controversial US-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Under Barroso's leadership, Portugal became part of the "[[coalition of the willing]]" for the invasion and [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]], sending non-combat troops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Conservative lawyer an ex-Maoist communist |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/conservative-lawyer-an-ex-maoist-communist-1.1147035 |work=The Irish Times |date=30 June 2004}}</ref> On 30 January 2003, Barroso signed ''[[The letter of the eight]]'' supporting [[Preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|US. policy on Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Full text of letter written by eight European leaders |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/full-text-of-letter-written-by-eight-european-leaders-1.459198 |work=The Irish Times |date=30 January 2003}}</ref>
 
Barroso did not finish his term as he had been nominated as [[President of the European Commission]] on 5 July 2004. Barroso arranged with Portuguese President [[Jorge Sampaio]] to nominate [[Pedro Santana Lopes]] as a substitute Prime Minister of Portugal. Santana Lopes led the PSD/PP coalition for a few months until early 2005, when new elections were called. When the Portuguese Socialist Party won the elections it produced an estimation that by the end of the year the budget deficit would reach 6.1%,<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3208.htm#econ Portugal: ECONOMY] Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, U.S. Department of State</ref> which it used to criticise Barroso's and Santana Lopes's economic policies.

==President of the European Commission==

[[File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Schuman - Berlaymont - 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels.]]

In 2004, the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] and now the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] included a provision that the choice of President must take into account the result of [[Elections in the European Union|Parliamentary elections]] and the candidate supported by the victorious [[Europarty]] in particular. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right [[European People's Party]] (EPP), who won the elections, pressured for a candidate from its own ranks. In the end, José Manuel Barroso, the EPP candidate, was chosen by the [[European Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing a New EU Commission President|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=16 June 2004|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1237192,00.html|accessdate=27 August 2007}}</ref>

On the same basis, the EPP again endorsed Barroso for a second term during the 2009 European election campaign and, after the EPP again won the elections, was able to secure his nomination by the [[European Council]] on 17 June 2009. On 3 September 2009, Barroso unveiled his manifesto for his second term.<ref name="José Manuel Barroso unveils manifesto for second term">{{cite news|author=Ian Traynor in Brussels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/03/jose-manuel-barroso-europe-vote|title=José Manuel Barroso unveils manifesto for second term|date=3 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2009|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref> On 16 September 2009, Barroso was re-elected by the European Parliament for another five years.<ref name="José Manuel Barroso wins second term as European Commission President">{{cite news|author=David Charter in Strasbourg|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6837597.ece|title=José Manuel Barroso wins second term as European Commission President|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2009|work=The Times |location=UK }}</ref><ref name="PN MEPs welcome election of José Manuel Barroso">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=94191|title=PN MEPs welcome election of José Manuel Barroso|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2009|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214014645/http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=94191|archivedate=14 December 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epp.eu/newsdetail.php?newsID=541&hoofdmenuID=4&submenuID=49 "EPP delighted with re-election of Barroso"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} European People's Party, 16 September 2009; accessed 29 November 2009</ref> Since he completed his second term he became only the second Commission president to serve two terms, after [[Jacques Delors]].

During his first presidency, the following important issues were on the Commission's agenda:
* [[Turkey]] applying for EU membership
* The reform of the institutions ([[Treaty of Lisbon]])
* The [[Bolkestein directive]], aimed at creating a single market for services within the EU
* [[Lisbon Strategy]]
* [[Galileo positioning system]]
* [[Doha Development Agenda]] negotiations
* [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]]
* An EU climate change package

One of his first tasks since being re-elected was a visit to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to persuade Irish citizens to approve the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in the country's [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|second referendum]] due to be held the following month.<ref name="No vote will affect confidence - Barroso"/> Barroso was greeted by Irish Minister for Defence [[Willie O'Dea]] and [[Peter Power (politician)|Peter Power]], the [[Minister of State for Overseas Development (Ireland)|Minister of State for Overseas Development]], as he got off his plane at [[Shannon Airport]] on the morning of 19 September 2009 before briefly meeting with the joint committee of the [[Oireachtas]] and meeting and greeting people at functions in [[Limerick]]'s City Hall, [[University of Limerick]] (UL) and the [[Savoy Hotel]].<ref name="No vote will affect confidence - Barroso">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0919/eulisbon.html|title=No vote will affect confidence – Barroso|date=19 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}</ref> He told ''[[The Irish Times]]'' in an interview referenced internationally by [[Reuters]] that he had been asked if Ireland would split from the European Union.<ref name="EU's Barroso warns Ireland on commissioner right">{{cite news|author=Carmel Crimmins|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE58I0KE20090919|title=EU's Barroso warns Ireland on commissioner right|date=19 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2009|agency=Reuters }}</ref> He also launched a €14.8&nbsp;million grant for former workers at [[Dell]]'s Limerick plant, described as "conveniently opportune" by former Member of the European Parliament and anti-Lisbonite [[Patricia McKenna]].<ref name="European grant for former Dell workers">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0919/dell.html|title=European grant for former Dell workers|date=19 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2009|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}</ref>

On 12 September 2012 Barroso has called for the EU to evolve into a "federation of nation-states". Addressing the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Barroso said such a move was necessary to combat the continent's economic crisis. He said he believed Greece would be able to stay in the eurozone if it stood by its commitments. Mr Barroso also set out plans for a single supervisory mechanism for all banks in the eurozone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19568781|title=EU Commission chief Barroso calls for 'federation'|date=12 September 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

He was once appointed [[List of European Commission portfolios#Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration|Acting Commissioner for Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration]] in [[Maroš Šefčovič]]'s stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the [[2014 European Parliament election|2014 elections]] to the [[European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/news/123733|title=Six commissioners head for EU election campaign trail}}</ref> He ultimately decided to not take up his seat.

===Controversies===
In 2005, ''[[Die Welt]]'' reported that Barroso had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire [[Spiro Latsis]]. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred only a month before the Commission approved 10&nbsp;million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company – though the state aid decision had been taken by the previous European Commission before Barroso took up his post.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article223215.ece |title=Barroso survives confidence debate over free holiday with Greek tycoon |work=The Independent |location=London |date=26 May 2005 |accessdate=8 June 2009 |first=Stephen |last=Castle |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091311/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article223215.ece |archivedate= 1 October 2007 }}</ref> In response to this revelation, [[Nigel Farage]] MEP of the [[UK Independence Party]] persuaded around 75 MEPs from across the political spectrum to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, so as to compel him to appear before the [[European Parliament]] to be questioned on the matter.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&sid=aFq2hOeCcYZc&refer=europe |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg |date=25 May 2005 |accessdate=8 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&sid=aFq2hOeCcYZc&refer=europe |archivedate=16 November 2006}}</ref> The motion was tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament as required at a debate on 26 May 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4578261.stm |title=Europe &#124; Barroso rebuffs yacht questions |publisher=BBC News |date=25 May 2005 |accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref> The motion itself was heavily defeated.

In response to criticism for his choice of a less fuel efficient [[Volkswagen Touareg]], amid EU legislation of targets drastically to reduce car {{co2}} emissions, Barroso dismissed this as "overzealous moralism".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6432995.stm |work=BBC News | title=Barroso bashed over gas guzzler | date=9 March 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>

In April 2008, amid sharp food price rises and mounting [[food vs fuel]] concerns, Barroso insisted that [[biofuel]] use was "not significant" in pushing up [[food prices]].<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/25957 Biofuels 'aggravating' food prices says Brown] EUobserver, 10 April 2008</ref> The following month, he announced a study that would look into the issue.<ref>[http://www.transportenvironment.org/News/2008/5/Barroso-orders-study-on-biofuelsfood-link/ Barroso orders study on biofuels/food link] Transport & Environment, 14 May 2008</ref> The backdoor approval of the GE potato, by President Barroso, has met a wave of strong opposition from EU member-states. The governments of Greece, Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Hungary and France have all publicly announced that they will not allow the GE potato to be grown in their countries.

Barroso has expressed criticism of national governments arguing "Decisions taken by the most democratic institutions in the world are very often wrong."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100056661/the-eu-is-an-antidote-to-democratic-governments-argues-president-barroso/ |work=Telegraph | title=The EU is an antidote to democratic governments, argues President Barroso | date=1 October 2010 | accessdate=15 August 2012 | location=London}}</ref>

In December 2013 Barroso said that Europe was not the cause of the problems for Ireland; Ireland caused a problem for Europe. Following the bailout exit, in December 2013, the Irish government's bid to get backdated funding for the banking sector was rejected as the head of the European Commission blamed the Irish banks, regulators and government for the difficulties in the country. Barroso said the problems in the Irish banks caused a "major destabilisation" in the euro, rather than structural problems with the currency itself, "I am saying this because it would be wrong to give the impression that Europe has created a problem for Ireland and now Europe has to help Ireland. In fact, it was the banking sector in Ireland—it was one of the biggest problems in the world in terms of banking stability what happened in Ireland."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/eu-chief-barroso-no-backdated-bank-debt-deal-for-ireland-29854504.html | work=Irish Independent | title=EU chief Barroso: No backdated bank debt deal for Ireland}}</ref>

Barroso was heavily criticised for taking a position as a chairman and senior adviser to the international arm of Goldman Sachs. He did so two months after the 18-month "cooling-off" period for EU officials after they leave their posts. Barroso's move was especially sensitive because Goldman Sachs is an American institution that played a questionable role in the financial crisis that nearly broke the euro. Furthermore, Barroso announced his move to the London-based subsidiary of Goldman Sachs shortly after the Brexit referendum. The European Commission agreed to an unprecedented ethics inquiry into the move. The independent panel concluded there were "not sufficient grounds to establish a violation of the duty of integrity and discretion" and accepted Barroso's assurances that he would not be lobbying on behalf of the bank's clients.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/jose-manuel-barroso-cleared-ethics-breach-goldman-sachs-job-european-commission | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101123948/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/jose-manuel-barroso-cleared-ethics-breach-goldman-sachs-job-european-commission | url-status=dead | archive-date=2016-11-01 | work=The Guardian | title=José Manuel Barroso cleared of ethics breach over Goldman Sachs job}} </ref>
