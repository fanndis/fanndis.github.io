==History==
Nordea is the result of the successive mergers and acquisitions of the [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Finland|Finnish]], [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[bank]]s of Nordbanken, Merita Bank, Unibank and [[Christiania Bank|Kreditkassen]] (Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse) that took place between 1997 and 2000.

PK-banken was formed in 1974 by a merger between Postbanken (formed 1884) and Sveriges Kreditbank (formed 1923), both state-owned.

The private Nordbanken was formed in 1986 by a merger of two smaller private local banks, Uplandsbanken and Sundsvallsbanken. The [[Swedish banking rescue|Swedish banking crisis]] of 1991, resulting from deregulated markets and a housing price bubble, forced the government to nationalise Nordbanken for 64 billion kronor. Bad debts were transferred to the asset-management companies Securum and Retriva, which sold off the assets.

The name Nordea comes from the Swedish bank Nordbanken; this developed from PK-banken (Post och Kreditbanken) which in 1990 purchased the smaller private bank Nordbanken, and picked up that name. The name is also a contraction of the words '''Nor'''dic and i'''dea'''s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nordea.com/da/om-nordea/hvem-vi-er/vores-historie/ |title=Vores historie |website=www.nordea.com |language=da |access-date=2018-03-25}}</ref>

Merita Bank was a 1995 merger of the former main rivals in Finland, the originally [[Svecoman]] Union Bank of Finland (Föreningsbanken i Finland) founded in 1862 and the [[Fennoman]] [[Kansallis-Osake-Pankki|National Share Bank (Kansallis-Osake-Pankki)]] founded in 1889.

Nordea was the subject of an online phishing scam in 2007. The company estimated 8 million [[Swedish krona|kr]] ($1.1 million) was stolen.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Swedish-bank-hit-by-biggest-ever-online-heist/2100-7349_3-6151546.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629075315/http://news.cnet.com/Swedish-bank-hit-by-biggest-ever-online-heist/2100-7349_3-6151546.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-29|title=Swedish bank hit by 'biggest ever' online heist - CNET News|date=2012-06-29|website=archive.is|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> Customers were targeted over a period of 15 months with [[phishing]] emails containing a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6279561.stm|title=Bank loses $1.1m to online fraud|date=2007-01-19|access-date=2019-09-19|language=en-GB}}</ref> Nordea refunded affected customers.<ref name=":0" />

== Panama document leak ==
The largest [[Financial institution|financial group]] in the Nordic region, Nordea has, despite warnings from the [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden)|Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority]] (FI) been active in using offshore companies in tax havens according to the Panama papers.<ref name="mordea">{{cite web |url=http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2016/04/03/nordea-grundade-hundratals-skatteparadisbolag-kunder |title=Nordea grundade hundratals skatteparadisbolag åt kunder |publisher=Svenska Yle |access-date=4 April 2016}}</ref>

The Nordea section in Luxembourg, between the years 2004 and 2014, founded nearly 400 [[offshore companies]] in [[Panama]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] for its customers.<ref name="mordea"/>

The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) has pointed out that there are "serious deficiencies" in how Nordea monitors [[money laundering]], and has given the bank two warnings. In 2015, Nordea had to pay the largest possible fine - over 5&nbsp;million [[Euro|EUR]].<ref name="mordea"/>

In 2012, Nordea asked [[Mossack Fonseca]] to change documents retroactively so that three Danish customers power of attorney documents had been in force since 2010.<ref name="mordea"/>

The director for Nordea Private banking Thorben Sanders admits that before 2009 they did not screen for customers that tried to evade tax. "At the end of 2009 we decided that our bank should not be a means of tax evasion" says Thorben Sanders.<!--”I slutet av 2009 beslöt vi att vår bank inte längre ska kunna användas för att kringgå skatt”--><ref name="mordea"/>

As a consequence of the leaked documents, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) stated on 4 April 2016 that it had started an investigation into the conduct of Nordea, the largest financial group in the Nordic region. The Swedish minister of Finance [[Magdalena Andersson (Social Democrat)|Magdalena Andersson]] characterized the conduct of Nordea as "a crime" and "totally unacceptable".<ref name=local-nordea>{{cite web |title=Nordea bank investigated over tax haven scandal |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20160404/swedens-nordea-bank-in-global-tax-tangle |publisher=The Local (Sweden) |accessdate=4 April 2016 |quote=Reacting to Nordea's role in the scandal, Sweden's Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told Swedish reporters: "It is a crime — tax evasion — it is totally unacceptable".
