'''Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] ({{lang|ru|link=no|Оле́г Анто́нович Гордие́вский}}; born 10 October 1938) is a former colonel of the [[KGB]] and KGB [[Resident spy|resident-designate]] (''rezident'') and bureau chief in London, who was a secret agent of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] from 1974 to 1985.<ref>Ben Macintyre, (2018)</ref>

==Early career==
The son of an [[NKVD]] officer, he was born in 1938.<ref name="Rodney Carlisle2015">{{cite book |last=Carlisle |first=Rodney |date=26 March 2015 |title=Encyclopedia of Intelligence and Counterintelligence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oXysBwAAQBAJ&q=Oleg+Gordievsky+1938&pg=PA273 |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages=273–274 |isbn=978-1-317-47177-6 |author-link= }}</ref> He proved an excellent student at school, where he learned to speak German. He studied at a [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations|premium Moscow University]] ([[MGIMO]]), and later undertook NKVD training, where in addition to espionage skills, he mastered his expertise in German, and he also learned to speak Danish, Swedish and Norwegian. On completion of his studies, he joined the foreign service where he was posted to [[East Berlin]] in August 1961, just prior to completion of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name="Rodney Carlisle2015" /> The building of the wall appalled him, and he became disillusioned with the Soviet system.<ref>"The Spy and the Traitor" - 2018 - Ben MacIntyre</ref> After spending a year in Berlin, he returned to Moscow.<ref name="Rodney Carlisle2015" /> He joined the [[KGB]] in 1963 and was posted to the Soviet embassy in [[Copenhagen]].

==British secret agent==
During his Danish posting, Gordievsky became disenchanted with his work in the KGB, particularly after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.<ref name="Rodney Carlisle2015" /> That had been noticed by the [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste|Danish Security Intelligence Service]], which resulted in extensive efforts to see if Gordievsky could be recruited. Convinced an approach could be made, the DSIS contacted MI6. Because of their relatively small size, the DSIS felt that they needed a partner among the big intelligence agencies to make the operation successful.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historien om Politiets Efterretningstjeneste (2:3)|language=Danish|publisher=DR TV|url=https://www.dr.dk/tv/se/historien-om-politiets-efterretningstjeneste-series/-/historien-om-politiets-efterretningstjeneste-2-3}}</ref> MI6, via DSIS, subsequently made contact with Gordievsky.

The value of MI6's recruitment of such a highly placed and valuable intelligence asset increased dramatically when, in 1982, Gordievsky was assigned to the Soviet embassy in London as the KGB [[resident spy|resident-designate]] ("''rezident''"), responsible for Soviet intelligence gathering and espionage in the UK.

Two of Gordievsky's most important contributions were averting a potential nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union, when NATO exercise [[Able Archer 83]] was misinterpreted by the Soviets as a potential [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]],<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ablearcher/|title = The Able Archer 83 Sourcebook|date = |accessdate = |website = The National Security Archive|publisher = |last = Jones|first = Nate}}</ref> and identifying [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as the Soviet heir-apparent long before he came to prominence. Indeed, the information passed by Gordievsky became the first proof of how worried the Soviet leadership had become about the possibility of a NATO nuclear first strike.<ref>Gordon Corera.

===Escape (exfiltration) from the USSR===
Although MI6 passed on information provided by Gordievsky to the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the British would not reveal their source, so the CIA conducted a covert operation to discover who the source was, and after about a year, they realised that it must be Gordievsky. However, a high-ranking American CIA officer, [[Aldrich Ames]], who had been selling secrets to the KGB, passed Gordievsky's name to Soviet counterintelligence. Gordievsky was suddenly ordered back to Moscow. Although Gordievsky was advised to defect and stay in London, on 22 May 1985 he left for Moscow. On arrival, he was taken to a KGB safe house outside Moscow, drugged, and interrogated.<ref name="smithsonianmag.com">David Wise. [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/still-unexplained-cold-war-fbi-cia-180956969/?no-ist "Thirty years later, we still don't know who betrayed these Cold War spies"] Smithsonian Magazine, November 2015. (Retrieved 23 October 2015)</ref>

Gordievsky was questioned for about five hours. After that, he was released and told that he would never work abroad again. He was suspected of espionage for a foreign power, but for some reason, his superiors decided to stall. In June 1985, he was joined by his wife and two children in Moscow.<ref name="smithsonianmag.com"/>

Although he almost certainly remained under KGB surveillance, Gordievsky managed to send a covert signal to MI6, which activated an elaborate escape plan that had been in place for many years for just such an emergency.<ref name="smithsonianmag.com"/> Gordievsky waited on a particular street corner, on a particular weekday at 7.30 pm, carrying a [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] bag as a signal. An MI6 agent walked past carrying a [[Harrods]] bag, eating a [[Mars (chocolate bar)|Mars bar]], and the two made eye contact. That indicated that the escape plan was in place.

On 19 July 1985, Gordievsky went for his usual jog, but he instead managed to evade his KGB tails and boarded a train to [[Vyborg]], near the [[Finland|Finnish]] border, where he was met by British embassy cars, after they managed to lose the three KGB surveillance cars. Lying down in the boot of a Ford Sierra [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]], he was smuggled across the border into Finland, and then flown to the UK via Norway.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Soviet authorities subsequently sentenced Gordievsky to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for [[treason]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/news/newsarchive2005/gordievsky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925060429/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/news/newsarchive2005/gordievsky.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> a sentence never rescinded by post-Soviet Russian authorities, but which cannot be legally carried out because of Russian membership in the [[Council of Europe]]. His wife, Leila (an [[Azerbaijanis|Azeri]]) was a KGB officer who was loyal to Moscow and who was unaware of her husband's defection.  She and their children were on holiday in [[Azerbaijan SSR|Azerbaijan]] at the time of his escape. She was interrogated and detained for some 6 years, the Soviets presuming (wrongly) that she had been complicit in Gordievsky's activities. However, the marriage was effectively dead by then and eventually it foundered completely. It was reported in 2013 that, since a date in the 1990s, Gordievsky had had a long-term relationship with a British woman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/11/russian-spies-britain-oleg-gordievsky|title=Gordievsky: Russia has as many spies in Britain now as the USSR ever did|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2013-03-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref>

Gordievsky's exfiltration greatly embarassed both the KGB and the Soviet Union and resulted in disruptions by Viktor Babunov, the KGB's chief of counterintelligence, within the KGB including [[Sergei Ivanov]]'s career with the KGB, who was KGB [[Resident spy|resident]] in Finland, as well as numerous members of the Leningrad KGB, which was responsible for surveillance of British subjects, and numerous persons close to [[Vladimir Putin]], who was a member of the Leningrad KGB.{{sfn|MacIntyre|2018|p=103, 213, 317, 329}}

==Life in the UK==
[[File:Reagan and Gordievsky.jpg|thumb|left|Gordievsky (right) with U.S. President Ronald Reagan in 1987]]
Gordievsky has written a number of books on the subject of the KGB and is a frequently quoted media pundit on the subject.

Gordievsky noted that the KGB were puzzled by and denied the claim that [[Director General of MI5]] [[Roger Hollis]] was a Soviet agent. In the 2009 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme ''Inside MI5: The Real Spooks'', Gordievsky recounted how he saw the head of the British section of the [[KGB]] express surprise at the allegations that he read in a British newspaper about [[Roger Hollis]] being a [[KGB]] agent: "Why is it they are speaking about Roger Hollis, such nonsense, can't understand it, it must be some special British trick directed against us". The allegiance of Hollis remains a debated historical issue; the MI5 official website has cited Gordievsky's revelation as a vindication of Hollis. <ref>{{cite web|title=Inside MI5: The Real Spooks (ITV 2009) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UClrXrb6Xy4}}</ref>

In 1990, he was consultant editor of the journal ''Intelligence and National Security'', and he worked on television in the UK in the 1990s, including the game show ''[[Wanted (game show)|Wanted]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Urban, Mark | title=UK Eyes Alpha: The Inside Story of British Intelligence | publisher=Faber and Faber | year=1996 | isbn=0-571-19068-5}}</ref> In 1995, the former [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] leader [[Michael Foot]] received an out of court settlement (said to be "substantial") from ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' after the newspaper alleged, in articles derived from claims in the original manuscript of Gordievsky's book ''Next Stop Execution'' (1995), that Foot was a KGB "agent of influence" with the codename 'Boot'.<ref>Rhys Williams [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sunday-times-pays-foot-damages-over-kgb-claim-1590325.html "'Sunday Times' pays Foot damages over KGB claim"], ''The Independent'', 8 July 1995</ref>

In the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2010, [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] gave a "full account", which he claimed had been provided to him by Gordievsky shortly after Foot's death, of the extent of Foot's alleged KGB involvement. Moore also wrote that, although the claims are difficult to corroborate without MI6 and KGB files, Gordievsky's past record in revealing KGB contacts in Britain had been shown to be reliable.<ref>Charles Moore: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/7377111/Was-Foot-a-national-treasure-or-the-KGBs-useful-idiot.html "Was Foot a national treasure or the KGB’s useful idiot?"] ''The Daily Telegraph'', 5 March 2010</ref>

On 26 February 2005, he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters by the [[University of Buckingham]] in recognition of his outstanding service to the security and the safety of the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/news/newsarchive2005/gordievsky.html Buckingham Honours Oleg Gordievsky] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925060429/http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/news/newsarchive2005/gordievsky.html |date=25 September 2006 }}, University of Buckingham, 28 February 2005</ref>

Gordievsky was featured in the PBS documentary ''[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy]]''.

Gordievsky was appointed Companion of the Most Distinguished [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) for "services to the security of the United Kingdom" in the 2007 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] (in the Diplomatic List).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=58358 |supp=y|page=3|date=16 June 2007}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper noted that it was "the same [[Medal|gong]] given his fictional [[cold war]] colleague [[James Bond]]."<ref>{{cite news|title=Literary world applauds Rushdie knighthood|author=Esther Addley|date=16 June 2007|newspaper=The Guardian|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2104513,00.html|location=London}}</ref>

Gordievsky lives in a "safe house" in London, and security has been tightened since the [[Salisbury poisonings]]. [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] is said to especially dislike Gordievsky because Putin was at the time part of the KGB group that failed to foil Gordievsky's escape to Finland; but [[Ben Macintyre]] considers that Putin is unlikely to authorise any assassination attempt on Gordievsky. <ref> {{cite book | author = Ben Macintyre | date = 2018| title = The Spy and the Traitor; The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War}}</ref>

===Suspected poisoning===
In April 2008, the media reported that on 2 November 2007, Gordievsky had been taken by ambulance from his home in [[Surrey]] to a local hospital, where he spent 34 hours unconscious.<ref name="IndepDouble">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/double-agent-gordievsky-claims-he-was-poisoned-by-the-kremlin-805308.html |work=[[The Independent]]|date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010 |title=Double agent Gordievsky claims he was poisoned by the Kremlin |location=London |first=Sadie |last=Gray}}</ref> Gordievsky claimed that he was poisoned with [[thallium]] by "rogue elements in Moscow".<ref name="IndepDouble"/> He accused MI6 of forcing [[Special Branch]] to drop its early investigations into his allegations;<ref name="IndepDouble"/> according to him, the investigation was only reopened thanks to the intervention of former MI5 Director General [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/39Russian-spy-poisoned-me39-says.3953035.jp |title='Russian spy poisoned me' says former double agent Gordievsky |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date=6 April 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

In Gordievsky's opinion, the culprit was a UK-based Russian business associate who had supplied him with pills, which he said were the sedative [[Alprazolam|Xanax]], purportedly for [[insomnia]]; he refused to identify the associate, saying British authorities had advised against it.<ref>Lawless, Jill.
