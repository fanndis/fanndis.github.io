The '''Amazon rainforest''',{{efn|{{lang-pt|Floresta amazônica}} or ''{{lang|pt|Amazônia}}''; {{lang-es|Selva amazónica}}, ''{{lang|es|Amazonía}}'' or usually ''{{lang|es|Amazonia}}''; {{lang-fr|Forêt amazonienne}}; {{lang-nl|Amazoneregenwoud}}}} alternatively, the '''Amazon Jungle''', also known in English as '''Amazonia''', is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|moist broadleaf]] [[tropics|tropical]] [[rainforest]] in the [[Amazon biome]] that covers most of the [[Amazon basin]] of South America. This basin encompasses {{convert|7,000,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|5,500,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations.

The majority of the forest is contained [[Amazônia Legal|within Brazil]], with 60% of the rainforest, followed by [[Peruvian Amazonia|Peru]] with 13%, [[Amazon natural region|Colombia]] with 10%, and with minor amounts in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Venezuela]]. Four [[nations]] have "[[Amazonas (disambiguation)|Amazonas]]"<!--intentional link to DAB page--> as the name of one of their first-level administrative [[regions]] and [[France]] uses the name "[[Guiana Amazonian Park]]" for its [[rainforest]] protected area.

==History==
{{see also|History of South America#Amazon|Amazon River#History}}
Tribal societies are well capable of escalation to all-out wars between tribes. Thus, in the Amazonas, there was perpetual animosity between the neighboring tribes of the [[Jivaroan peoples|Jivaro]]. Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], practised [[headhunting]] for trophies and [[Shrunken head|headshrinking]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Amazon's head hunters and body shrinkers |url=https://theweek.com/articles/478804/amazons-head-hunters-body-shrinkers |work=The Week |date=20 January 2012}}</ref> The accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the [[Yanomami]] tribes. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare.<ref>Chagnon, Napoleon A. (1992). ''Yanomamo''. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston.</ref>

During the [[Amazon rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as [[typhus]] and [[malaria]], killed 40,000 native Amazonians.<ref>La Republica Oligarchic. Editorial Lexus 2000 p. 925.</ref>

===Location===
Nine countries share the Amazon basin—most of the rainforest, 58.4%, is contained within the borders of Brazil. The other eight countries include Peru with 12.8%, Bolivia with 7.7%, Colombia with 7.1%, Venezuela with 6.1%, Guyana with 3.1%, Suriname with 2.5%, French Guyana with 1.4%, and Ecuador with 1%.<ref name="Segamazonia_Coca-Castro_201301">{{citation|title=Land use Status and Trends in Amazonia|publisher=Amazonia Security Agenda Project|date=January 2013|last1=Coca-Castro|last2=Reymondin|last3=Bellfield|last4=Hyman|first1=Alejandro|first2=Louis|first3=Helen|first4=Glenn|url=http://segamazonia.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/land_use_status_and_trends_in_amazonia.pdf |access-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319140931/http://segamazonia.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/land_use_status_and_trends_in_amazonia.pdf|archive-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Amazon CIAT (2).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest, near [[Manaus]]]]
The rainforest likely formed during the [[Eocene]] era<!-- , following the evolutionary appearance of [[angiosperm]] plants [nonsense - they evolved during the Cretaceous!] --> (from 56 million years to 33.9 million years ago). It appeared following a global reduction of tropical temperatures when the [[Atlantic Ocean]] had widened sufficiently to provide a warm, moist climate to the Amazon basin. The rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years, and most of the region remained free of [[savanna]]-type [[biome]]s at least until the [[current ice age]] when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread.<ref name=morley>{{cite book

Following the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66 to 34 [[mya (unit)|Mya]], the rainforest extended as far south as [[45th parallel south|45°]]. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the [[Oligocene]], for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the [[Middle Miocene]], then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the [[Last glacial period|last glacial maximum]].<ref>{{cite journal

During the [[mid-Eocene]], it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the [[Purus Arch]]. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the [[Amazonas Basin]]. As the [[Andes]] Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the [[Solimões Basin]]. Within the last 5–10 million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic.<ref>{{cite journal

There is evidence that there have been significant changes in the Amazon rainforest [[vegetation]] over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.<ref name="Colinvaux1">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/1099-1417(200005)15:4<347::AID-JQS537>3.0.CO;2-A| title=Palaeoecology and climate of the Amazon basin during the last glacial cycle| journal=Journal of Quaternary Science| volume=15| issue=4| pages=347–356| year=2000| last1=Colinvaux| first1=Paul A.| last2=Oliveira| first2=Paulo E.

====Sahara Desert dust windblown to the Amazon====
More than 56% of the dust fertilizing the Amazon rainforest comes from the [[Bodélé depression]] in Northern Chad in the [[Sahara]] desert. The dust contains [[phosphorus]], important for plant growth. The yearly Sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed away yearly in Amazon soil from rains and floods.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/2015GL063040 | volume=42 | issue=6 | title=The fertilizing role of African dust in the Amazon rainforest: A first multiyear assessment based on data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations | year=2015 | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | pages=1984–1991 | last1 = Yu | first1 = Hongbin| bibcode=2015GeoRL..42.1984Y | doi-access=free }}</ref>

NASA's [[CALIPSO]] satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon: an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year, at 15 degrees west longitude, across {{convert|1,600|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} over the Atlantic Ocean (some dust falls into the Atlantic), then at 35 degrees West longitude at the eastern coast of South America, 27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the Amazon basin (22 million tons of it consisting of phosphorus), 132 million tons of dust remain in the air, 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea, past 75 degrees west longitude.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-satellite-reveals-how-much-saharan-dust-feeds-amazon-s-plants |title=Saharan Dust Feeds Amazon's Plants|first=Rob|last=Garner|date=24 February 2015|website=NASA}}</ref>

CALIPSO uses a laser range finder to scan the Earth's atmosphere for the vertical distribution of dust and other aerosols. CALIPSO regularly tracks the Sahara-Amazon dust plume. CALIPSO has measured variations in the dust amounts transported – an 86 percent drop between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011.

A possibility causing the variation is the [[Sahel]], a strip of semi-arid land on the southern border of the Sahara. When rain amounts in the Sahel are higher, the volume of dust is lower. The higher rainfall could make more vegetation grow in the Sahel, leaving less sand exposed to winds to blow away.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/29apr_amazondust/ |title=Desert Dust Feeds Amazon Forests – NASA Science|work=nasa.gov}}</ref>

For a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was never more than sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through [[agriculture]] given the poor soil. Archeologist [[Betty Meggers]] was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book ''Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise''. She claimed that a population density of {{convert|0.2|PD/km2}} is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population.<ref>{{cite journal

The green leaf area of plants and trees in the rainforest varies by about 25% as a result of seasonal changes. Leaves expand during the dry season when sunlight is at a maximum, then undergo abscission in the cloudy wet season. These changes provide a balance of carbon between photosynthesis and respiration.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mynenia, Ranga B. | title=Large seasonal swings in leaf area of Amazon rainforests | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=13 March 2007 | volume=104 | pmid=17360360 | issue=12 | pages=4820–4823 | pmc=1820882 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0611338104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.4820M |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

===Remote sensing===
[[File:Afternoon Clouds over the Amazon Rainforest.jpg|thumb|This image reveals how the forest and the [[atmosphere]] interact to create a uniform layer of "popcorn-shaped" [[Cumulus humilis cloud|cumulus clouds]].]]

The use of [[Remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data is dramatically improving conservationists' knowledge of the Amazon basin. Given the objectivity and lowered costs of satellite-based land cover analysis, it appears likely that remote sensing technology will be an integral part of assessing the extent and damage of deforestation in the basin.<ref>{{cite journal

The use of remote sensing for the conservation of the Amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests. Using handheld [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] devices and programs like [[Google Earth]], members of the Trio Tribe, who live in the rainforests of southern Suriname, map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims.<ref>Isaacson, Andy. 2007. With the Help of GPS, Amazonian Tribes Reclaim the Rain Forest. Wired 15.11: https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/15-11/ps_amazon</ref> Currently, most tribes in the Amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries, making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories.

To accurately map the Amazon's biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions, the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial. In 2006, Tatiana Kuplich organized the trees of the Amazon into four categories: mature forest, regenerating forest [less than three years], regenerating forest [between three and five years of regrowth], and regenerating forest [eleven to eighteen years of continued development].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kuplich |first=Tatiana M. |title=Classifying regenerating forest stages in Amazônia using remotely sensed images and a neural network |journal=Forest Ecology and Management |date=October 2006 |volume=234 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2006.05.066}}</ref> The researcher used a combination of [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) and [[Thematic Mapper]] (TM) to accurately place the different portions of the Amazon into one of the four classifications.

In 2010, the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought. The affected region was approximately {{convert|1160000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of rainforest, compared with {{convert|734000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in 2005. The 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off, whereas in 2005, the drought was focused on the southwestern part. The findings were published in the journal ''Science''. In a typical year, the Amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide; during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released.<ref>[http://www.bitsofscience.org/2010-amazon-drought-record-866/ 2010 Amazon drought record: 8 Gt extra CO2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327191653/http://www.bitsofscience.org/2010-amazon-drought-record-866/ |date=March 27, 2019 }}, Rolf Schuttenhelm, ''Bits Of Science'', 4 February 2011.
