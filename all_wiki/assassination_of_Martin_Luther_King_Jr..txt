[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], an American [[clergyman]] and civil rights leader, was fatally shot at the [[National Civil Rights Museum|Lorraine Motel]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on April 4, 1968, at 6:01&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]]. He was rushed to [[St. Joseph's Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee)|St. Joseph's Hospital]], where he died at 7:05&nbsp;p.m. He was a prominent [[Leadership|leader]] of the [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights movement]] and a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate who was known for his use of [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]].

[[James Earl Ray]], a fugitive from the [[Missouri State Penitentiary]], was arrested on June 8, 1968, at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]], extradited to the United States, and charged with the crime. On March 10, 1969, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in the [[Tennessee State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Pepper|2003|page=8}} He later made many attempts to withdraw his guilty plea and to be tried by a jury, but was unsuccessful. Ray died in prison in 1998.{{sfn|Pepper|2003|page=97}}

The King family and others believe that the assassination was the result of a [[Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy]] involving the U.S. government, the [[mafia]] and [[Memphis Police Department|Memphis police]], as alleged by [[Loyd Jowers]] in 1993. They believe that Ray was a scapegoat. In 1999, the family filed a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful-death]] lawsuit against Jowers for the sum of $10 million. During closing arguments, their attorney asked the jury to award damages of $100, to make the point that "it was not about the money." During the trial, both sides presented evidence alleging a government conspiracy. The accused government agencies could not defend themselves or respond because they were not named as defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury concluded that Jowers and others were "part of a conspiracy to kill King" and awarded the family $100.<ref name=Douglass2000/><ref name="Emily">{{cite news|last=Yellin|first=Emily|title=Memphis Jury Sees Conspiracy in Martin Luther King's Killing|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 9, 1999|access-date=June 8, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/us/memphis-jury-sees-conspiracy-in-martin-luther-king-s-killing.html}}</ref> The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later rejected by the [[United States Department of Justice]] in 2000 because of the lack of evidence.<ref name="usdoj2">{{cite book| title=United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr|chapter=Overview|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Justice]]|date=June 2000|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part1.php |url-status=live |chapter-url= http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part2.php#over|access-date=July 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113154920/http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part2.php |archive-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref>

==Background==

===King on death===
As early as the mid-1950s, King had received death threats because of his prominence in the civil rights movement. He had confronted the risk of death, including a [[Izola Curry#Assassination attempt on Martin Luther King Jr.|nearly fatal stabbing]] in 1958, and made its recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. After the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President Kennedy]] in 1963, King told his wife, [[Coretta Scott King]], "This is what is going to happen to me also. I keep telling you, this is a sick society."<ref name=MED08>{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=Michael Eric|title=April 4, 1968: Martin Luther King Jr.'s death and how it changed America|year=2008|publisher=[[Haymarket Books#Imprints|Basic Civitas Books]]|edition=1st|location=New York City|isbn=978-0465002122|chapter=Fighting Death|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/april41968martin00dyso|url=https://archive.org/details/april41968martin00dyso}}</ref><ref name=WAA69>(via Google News) {{cite news|title=King had predicted he too would be killed |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZrYlAAAAIBAJ&pg=3439%2C4781621|access-date=July 20, 2012|work=[[The Washington Afro American]]|publisher=[[Baltimore Afro-American]]|location=Washington, D.C. |date=September 9, 1969}}</ref>

===Memphis===
{{Main|Memphis sanitation strike}}
King traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in support of striking African American city sanitation workers. The [[Memphis sanitation strike|workers had staged]] a walkout on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions imposed by mayor [[Henry Loeb]]. At the time, Memphis paid black workers significantly lower wages than it did white workers. There were no city-issued uniforms, no restrooms, no recognized union, and no grievance procedure for the numerous occasions on which they were underpaid. During Loeb's tenure as mayor, conditions did not significantly improve, and the gruesome February 1968 deaths of two workers in a garbage-compacting truck turned mounting tensions into a strike.<ref name="Southern Hollows podcast">{{cite web|title=The Accident on a Garbage Truck That Led to the Death of Martin Luther King, Jr.|publisher=Southern Hollows podcast |url=http://www.southernhollows.com/episodes/memphissanitationstrike|access-date=25 June 2018}}</ref>

King participated in a massive march in Memphis on March 28, 1968, which ended in violence.<ref name="Southern Hollows podcast"/> On April 3, King returned to Memphis to attempt a successful new march later that week. His airline flight to Memphis was delayed by a bomb threat, but he arrived in time to make a planned speech to a gathering at the [[Mason Temple]] (world headquarters of the [[Church of God in Christ]]).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/04/time-looks-back-martin-luther-kings-assassination/|title=TIME Looks Back: The Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|author=Time Magazine Staff|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=April 4, 2013|access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/04/04/The-last-sermon-Memphis-April-3-1968/stories/200804040201|title=The last sermon, Memphis, April 3, 1968|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=Pittsburgh|date=April 4, 2008|first=Tony|last=Norman |access-date=October 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="About.com">{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Jennifer |title=Martin Luther King Jr. Assassinated |url=http://history1900s.about.com/cs/martinlutherking/a/mlkassass.htm |work=20th Century History |publisher=About.com|access-date=July 20, 2012}}</ref>

At the Mason Temple, King delivered his famous "[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]" speech. In it, he recalled his 1958 attempted assassination, noting that the doctor who treated him had said that because the knife used to stab him was so close to his aorta, any sudden movement, even a sneeze, might have killed him.<ref name=nyt>Alexandra S. Levine, "New York Today: If Martin Luther King Had Sneezed", ''New York Times'', January 12, 2017. Accessed August 11, 2018.</ref> He referred to a letter written by a young girl who told him that she was happy that he had not sneezed. He used that reference to say:

{{quote|I, too, am happy that I didn't sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1961, when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in interstate travel.<ref name="nyt"/>}}

King repeated the phrase "If I had sneezed" several more times, recalling numerous other events and acts of civil disobedience from the previous several years: the [[Albany Movement]] (1962), the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963, and the [[Selma to Montgomery March]] (1965).<ref>The King Encyclopedia, "[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/ive-been-mountaintop I've Been to the Mountaintop]", The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford). Accessed August 11, 2018.</ref>

As he neared the close, he prophetically referred to the bomb threat:

{{quote|And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats... or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've ''seen'' the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! And so I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/speeches/I've_been_to_the_mountaintop.pdf "I've Been to the Mountaintop"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216012709/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/speeches/I%27ve_been_to_the_mountaintop.pdf |date=February 16, 2008 }}</ref>}}

==Assassination==
On Thursday, April 4, 1968, King was staying in room 306 at the [[National Civil Rights Museum|Lorraine Motel]] in Memphis. The motel was owned by businessman Walter Bailey and was named after his wife. Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]], a colleague and friend, later told the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] that he and King had stayed in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel so often that it was known as the "Kingâ€“Abernathy Suite".<ref name="usdoj">{{cite web |title=United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr - VII.

According to biographer [[Taylor Branch]], King's last words were to musician [[Ben Branch]], who was scheduled to perform that night at a planned event. King said, "Ben, make sure you play '[[Take My Hand, Precious Lord]]' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty."{{sfn|Branch|2007|page=766}}

According to Rev. Samuel Kyles, who was standing several feet away, King was leaning over the balcony railing in front of Room 306 and was speaking with [[Jesse Jackson|Rev.

The force of the shot ripped King's necktie off. King fell backward onto the balcony, unconscious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6InSAAAAMAAJ&q=Investigation+of+the+Assassination+of+Martin+Luther+King,+Jr.++Appendix+to+Hearings+before+the+Select+Committee+on+Assassinations+of+the+U.S.+House+of+Representatives.++Volume+XIII+(Scientific+Reports+and+Supplementary+Staff+Reports).++March+1979.|title=Investigation of the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Appendix to Hearings before the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives.

</ref> According to Branch, King's autopsy revealed that his heart was in the condition of a 60-year-old man rather than that of a 39-year-old such as King, which Branch attributed to the stress of King's 13 years in the civil rights movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Citizen King'|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/mlk/#transcript|access-date=June 4, 2020|work=[[American Experience]]|publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>

Shortly after the shot was fired, witnesses saw a man, later believed to be [[James Earl Ray]], fleeing from a rooming house across the street from the Lorraine Motel.

King's widow Coretta had difficulty informing her children that their father was dead. She received a large number of telegrams, including one from [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s mother that she regarded as the one that had touched her the most.{{sfn|Clarke|2007|page=124}}

===Robert F. Kennedy speech===
{{Main|Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.}}

During the day of the assassination while on the campaign trail for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nomination in [[Indiana]], Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] learned of the shooting before boarding a plane to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]].{{sfn|Klein|2006|page=2}} Kennedy was scheduled to make a speech there in a predominantly black neighborhood. Kennedy did not learn that King had died until he landed in Indianapolis.

Kennedy's press secretary, [[Frank Mankiewicz]], suggested that he ask the audience to pray for the King family and to follow King's practice of nonviolence.{{sfn|Klein|2006|page=3}} Mankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted notes for Kennedy's use, but he refused them, using some that he had likely written during the ride to the site of the speech.{{sfn|Klein|2006|pp=3â€“4}} The Indianapolis chief of police advised Kennedy that he could not provide him protection and was worried that he would be at risk when talking about King's death before the predominantly black crowd.<ref name="Scarborough">[http://www.joescarborough.com/view.asp?ID=31 Scarborough Country] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025062559/http://www.joescarborough.com/view.asp?ID=31 |date=October 25, 2007 }}</ref> However, Kennedy decided to proceed. Standing on a flatbed truck, he spoke for four minutes and 57 seconds.{{sfn|Klein|2006|pages=1, 4}}

Kennedy was the first to tell the audience that King had died. Some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot.<ref name="Klein">{{cite magazine|last=Klein|first=Joe|title=Pssst!

He said: "For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by [[Lee Harvey Oswald|a white man]]." These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death.{{sfn|Klein|2006|page=6}} Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to "go beyond these rather difficult times" and quoted a poem by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwright [[Aeschylus]]: "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." In conclusion, he said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, again quoting the Greeks.

Kennedy's speech was credited with assisting in the prevention of post-assassination rioting in Indianapolis on a night when such events broke out in major cities across the country.<ref>[http://www.indygov.org/eGov/Mayor/PR/2006/4/20060404b.htm Statement of Mayor Bart Peterson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114222940/http://www.indygov.org/eGov/Mayor/PR/2006/4/20060404b.htm |date=November 14, 2007 }} April 4, 2006, press release</ref> It is widely considered one of the greatest speeches in American history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 American Speeches of the 20th Century |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/007256296x/77464/top100_only.html|access-date=August 30, 2009}}</ref>

Kennedy canceled all of his scheduled campaign appearances and withdrew to his hotel room. Several phone conversations with black community leaders convinced him to speak out against the [[King assassination riots|violent backlash]] beginning to emerge across the country.{{sfn|Newfield|1988|page=248}} The next day, Kennedy gave a prepared response, "[[On the Mindless Menace of Violence]]", in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Although still considered significant, it is given much less historical attention than is the Indianapolis speech.{{sfn|Duffy|Leeman|2005|page=245}}

===President Lyndon B. Johnson===
President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was in the [[Oval Office]] that evening, planning a meeting in [[Hawaii]] with [[Vietnam War]] military commanders. After press secretary [[George Christian (journalist)|George Christian]] informed him at 8:20&nbsp;p.m. of the assassination, he canceled the trip to focus on the nation. He assigned Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]] to investigate the assassination in Memphis. He made a personal call to King's wife, [[Coretta Scott King]], and declared April 7 a [[national day of mourning]] on which the U.S. flag would be flown at [[Half-mast|half-staff]].{{sfn|Kotz|2006|page=415}}

Colleagues of King in the civil rights movement called for a nonviolent response to the assassination to honor his most deeply held beliefs. [[James Farmer Jr.]] said:

{{quote|Dr. King would be greatly distressed to find that his blood had triggered off bloodshed and disorder. I think instead the nation should be quiet; black and white, and we should be in a prayerful mood, which would be in keeping with his life.

However, the more militant [[Stokely Carmichael]] called for forceful action, saying:

{{quote|White America killed Dr. King last night. She made it a whole lot easier for a whole lot of black people today.

On April 8, King's widow [[Coretta Scott King]] and her four young children led a crowd estimated at 40,000 in a silent march through the streets of Memphis to honor Dr. King and support the cause of the city's black sanitation workers.<ref name="digital"/>

The next day, funeral rites were held in King's hometown of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The service at [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]] was nationally televised, as were other events. A funeral procession transported King's body for {{convert|3+1/2|mi}} through the streets of Atlanta, followed by more than 100,000 mourners, from the church to his ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Morehouse College]]. A second service was held there before the burial.<ref name="digital">[http://crdl.usg.edu/events/mlk_assassination/?Welcome "Dr. King's Assassination: Background"], Civil Rights Digital Library, Digital Library of Georgia, 2013</ref>

In the wake of King's assassination, journalists reported some callous or hostile reactions from parts of white America, particularly in the [[American South|South]]. [[David Halberstam]], who reported on King's funeral, recounted a comment heard at an affluent white dinner party:

{{quote|One of the wivesâ€”station wagon, three children, forty-five-thousand-dollar houseâ€”leaned over and said, "I wish you had spit in his face for me." It was a stunning moment; I wondered for a long time afterwards what King could possibly have done to her, in what conceivable way he could have threatened her, why this passionate hate.<ref name=MED08/>}}

Reporters recounted that many whites were also grief-stricken at the leader's death. In some cases, the shock of events altered opinions. A survey later sent to a group of college trustees revealed that their opinions of King had risen after his assassination.<ref name=MED08 /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised King in an editorial, calling his murder a "national disaster" and his cause "just."<ref name=NYTneed>{{cite news|title=The Need of All Humanity |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 5, 1968}}</ref><ref name=SD>{{cite web|last=Catalyst|title=White America's reaction to the shooting of MLK?|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showpost.php?s=83c87316412df8355c276ee759f16c59&p=6774594&postcount=16|publisher=Straight Dope|access-date=July 20, 2012|date=November 8, 2005}}</ref>

Public figures generally praised King in the days following his death. Others expressed political ideology. [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]] of Alabama, known as a segregationist, described the assassination as a "senseless, regrettable act."<ref name=NYTnonviolence /> But [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor]] [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia called King "an enemy of our country" and threatened to "personally raise" the state capitol flag back from half-staff. California [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] described the assassination as "a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break." [[South Carolina]] senator [[Strom Thurmond]] wrote to his constituents: "We are now witnessing the whirlwind sowed years ago when some preachers and teachers began telling people that each man could be his own judge in his own case."{{sfn|Perlstein|2009|page=257}}

==FBI investigation==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was assigned the lead to investigate King's death. [[J. Edgar Hoover]], who had previously made efforts to undermine King's reputation, told President Johnson that his agency would attempt to find the culprit(s).{{sfn|Kotz|2006|page=415}} Many documents related to the investigation remain classified and are slated to remain secret until 2027.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.truman.edu/microforms/martin_luther_king.asp|title=FBI File on Martin Luther King|website=library.truman.edu|access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/nine-historical-archives-that-will-spill-new-secrets-966931/|title=Eight Historical Archives That Will Spill New Secrets|last=Strauss|first=Mark|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref> In 2010, as in earlier years, some argued for passage of a proposed [[Martin Luther King Jr. Records Collection Act|Records Collection Act]], similar to a [[President John F.

==Funeral==
{{main|Funeral of Martin Luther King Jr.}}
A crowd of 300,000 attended King's funeral on April 9.{{sfn|Kotz|2006|page=415}} Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] attended on behalf of Johnson, who was at a meeting on the Vietnam War at [[Camp David]]; there were fears that Johnson might be hit with protests and abuse over the war if he attended the funeral. At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church was played at the funeral; it was a recording of his "Drum Major" sermon given on February 4, 1968. In that sermon, he asked that, at his funeral, no mention of his awards and honors be made, but that it be said he tried to "feed the hungry", "clothe the naked", "be right on the [Vietnam] war question", and "love and serve humanity."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/drum-major-instinct| title=Drum Major Instinct (1968) | encyclopedia=Martin Luther King Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle | publisher=[[Stanford University]] | access-date=December 3, 2019 }}</ref>

===Capture and guilty plea===
The FBI investigation found fingerprints on various objects left in the bathroom from which the gunfire had come. Evidence included a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] [[Gamemaster (disambiguation)|Gamemaster]] rifle from which at least one shot had been fired. The fingerprints were traced to an escaped convict named [[James Earl Ray]].<ref name=mlkassassin>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/28/mlk.ray.case/index.html |title=The case against James Earl Ray|first=James|last=Polk|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]([[Time Warner]])|location=Atlanta|date=December 29, 2008|access-date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> Two months after assassinating King, Ray was captured at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] while he was trying to depart the [[United Kingdom]] for [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Rhodesia]], or [[Apartheid|apartheid South Africa]]{{sfn|Clarke|2007|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb2AwFMso9UC&pg=PA296 296]}} on a false [[Canadian passport]] in the name of Ramon George Sneyd.{{sfn|Borrell|1968|page=2}} Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder.

Ray confessed to the assassination on March 10, 1969. On the advice of his [[Lawyer|attorney]] [[Percy Foreman]], Ray took a guilty plea to avoid a conviction and potential [[death penalty]]. Ray was sentenced to a 99-year prison term, but he recanted his confession three days later.<ref name=recant>{{cite news|last=Jerome|first=Richard|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125261,00.html|title=Dead Silence|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=May 11, 1998|access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

Ray fired Foreman and claimed that a man whom he had met in [[Montreal]] by the alias of "Raoul" was involved, as was Ray's brother Johnny, but that Ray himself was not. He said through his new attorney [[Jack Kershaw]] that, although he did not "personally shoot King", he may have been "partially responsible without knowing it", hinting at a conspiracy. In May 1977, Kershaw presented evidence to the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] that he believed exonerated his client, but tests did not prove conclusive. Kershaw also claimed that Ray was somewhere else when the shots were fired, but he could not find a witness to corroborate the claim.<ref name=Kershaw>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/us/24kershaw.html|title=Jack Kershaw Is Dead at 96; Challenged Conviction in King's Death|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 24, 2010|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref><!-- Cites paragraph. -->

===Escape===
Ray and seven other convicts escaped from [[Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary]] in [[Petros, Tennessee]] on June 10, 1977.

Ray worked for the remainder of his life unsuccessfully attempting to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a full trial. In 1997, King's son [[Dexter King|Dexter]] met with Ray; he publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a [[retrial]].<ref name="CNN2">{{cite news|title=James Earl Ray, convicted King assassin, dies|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]([[Time Warner]])|location=Atlanta|date=April 23, 1998 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9804/23/ray.obit/#2|access-date=September 17, 2006|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061029154237/http://edition.cnn.com/US/9804/23/ray.obit/|archive-date=October 29, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Death===
Ray died in prison on April 23, 1998, at the age of 70 from kidney and liver failure caused by [[hepatitis C]] (probably contracted as a result of a [[blood transfusion]] given after a [[stabbing]] while at Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary).

==Conspiracy theories==
{{main|Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories}}

===Loyd Jowers===
{{anchor|Loyd Jowers and conspiracy}}
In December 1993, [[Loyd Jowers]], a white man from Memphis with business interests in the vicinity of the assassination site, appeared on ABC's ''[[Prime Time Live]].'' He had gained attention by claiming that he had conspired with the [[mafia]] and the federal government to kill King. According to Jowers, Ray was a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and was not directly involved in the shooting. Jowers claimed that he had hired someone to kill King as a favor for a friend in the mafia, Frank Liberto, a produce merchant who died before 1993.

According to the Department of Justice, Jowers had inconsistently identified different people as King's assassin since 1993. He had alternatively claimed the shooter was: (1) an African American man who was on South Main Street on the night of the assassination (the "Man on South Main Street"); (2) "Raoul"; (3) a white "Lieutenant" with the Memphis Police Department; and (4) a person whom he did not recognize. The Department of Justice does not consider Jowers' accusations credible and refers to two of the accused individuals by pseudonym.<ref group=note>Because [The Department of Justice] does not credit Jowers' inconsistent allegations, we refer to the two assassins he has named as the "Man on South Main Street" and the "Lieutenant", respectively.</ref> It has stated that the evidence allegedly supporting the existence of "Raoul" is dubious.<ref name=DOJMLK>[https://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part1.php#toc "United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr"].

In 1997, King's son [[Dexter King|Dexter]] met with Ray and asked him, "I just want to ask you, for the record, um, did you kill my father?"
