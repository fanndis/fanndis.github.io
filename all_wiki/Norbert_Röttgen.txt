===Federal Minister for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2009–2011===
Following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]], Röttgen was part of the CDU/CSU team in the negotiations with the FDP on a coalition agreement; he joined the working group on economic affairs and energy policy, led by [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] (CSU) and [[Rainer Brüderle]] (FDP).

From 28 October 2009, Röttgen was the [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] in the [[Second Merkel cabinet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article106325174/Kanzlerin-Merkel-feuert-Umweltminister-Roettgen.html|title=Nach NRW-Schlappe: Kanzlerin Merkel feuert Umweltminister Röttgen – DIE WELT|date=16 May 2012|work=DIE WELT}}</ref> He also served as a member of the Board of Supervisory Directors at [[KfW]] from 28 October 2009 to 22 May 2012. From November 2010, he was one of the four deputy chairs of the CDU in Germany, as well as the chair of the CDU in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].<ref name=bio/> At the time, he was often mentioned as a potential successor to Merkel as chancellor.<ref>Aaron Wiener (13 May 2012), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/05/angela-merkel-takes-a-loss-in-key-german-election.html Merkel's party suffers loss in key German state, early results show] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

Röttgen, in his capacity as environment minister, led the German delegations to the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancún]] and the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Durban]], respectively.

In May 2011, Röttgen announced his government's plans to shut all of the nation's [[nuclear power plant]]s by 2022. The decision was based on recommendations of an expert commission appointed after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].<ref>Judy Dempsey and Jack Ewing (30 May 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/world/europe/31germany.html Germany, in Reversal, Will Close Nuclear Plants by 2022] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Later that year, he teamed up with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) in launching the [[Bonn Challenge]], calling for 150 million hectares of forest – an area four times larger than Germany – to be reforested by 2020; the Bonn Challenge was later endorsed at the 2014 UN Climate Summit and supplemented by the New York Declaration on Forests, which calls for an end to deforestation by 2030.

Following the dissolution of the state's [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|Landtag]] on 14 March 2012, Röttgen confirmed his intention to run in the [[2012 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|subsequent election]] as the CDU's candidate for the office of [[List of Ministers-President of North Rhine-Westphalia|Minister-President]] against the incumbent, [[Hannelore Kraft]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].<ref name="kandidieren">{{Cite news | title = Neuwahlen in NRW: Röttgen gegen Kraft | work = dradio.de | date = 14 March 2012 | url = http://www.dradio.de/aktuell/1702938/ | accessdate = 15 March 2012 | language = German}}</ref> Röttgen ran against the debt-financed spending supported by Kraft, and even described the vote as a referendum on Merkel's Europe policies.<ref>Nicholas Kulish (13 May 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/world/europe/in-rebuke-to-merkel-social-democrats-win-german-vote.html In Rebuke to Merkel’s Party, Social Democrats Win German Vote] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> However, he was widely seen as having failed to commit himself whole-heartedly to state politics, refusing to promise that if he lost the election he would nonetheless lead the opposition in North Rhine-Westphalia;<ref>Quentin Peel (26 September 2012), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/22c96060-00ce-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html  ‘Red-green’ victory makes waves in Berlin] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> 59 percent of respondents to an FG Wahlen poll said his refusal to commit to the state "damaged the CDU."<ref>Brian Parkin (14 May 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-13/merkel-s-cdu-defeated-in-biggest-german-state-exit-polls-show.html Merkel Defeated in Worst Postwar Result in Biggest State] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref>

===Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs===
Since 2014, Röttgen has been the chairman of the Bundestag's Committee on Foreign Affairs. In addition to his committee assignments, he is a member of the German-Swiss Parliamentary Friendship Group.<ref>[https://www.parlament.ch/de/organe/delegationen/delegationen-fuer-beziehungen-mit-parlamenten-anderer-staaten/deutscher-bundestag/deutsch-schweizerische-parlamentariergruppe-des-bundestags German-Swiss Parliamentary Friendship Group] [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal Assembly]].</ref>

In February 2014, Röttgen accompanied German President [[Joachim Gauck]] on a state visit to [[India]] – where they met with Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] and [[Sonia Gandhi]], among others – and [[Myanmar]].<ref>Anne Merholz (5 February 2014), [http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/gauck-joachim/so-exotisch-ist-die-indienreise-des-bundespraesidenten-34554728.bild.html Großes Staatsbankett für Gauck] "[[Bild]]".</ref> Shortly after the [[2014 Crimean status referendum|referendum]] on the status of [[Crimea]] held on 16 March 2014, he and his counterparts of the [[Weimar Triangle]] parliaments – [[Elisabeth Guigou]] of France and [[Grzegorz Schetyna]] of [[Poland]] – visited Kyiv to express their countries’ firm support of the territorial integrity and the [[European integration]] of [[Ukraine]].<ref>[http://mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/news/21506-krajini-vejmarsykogo-trikutnika-pidtrimujuty-teritorialynu-cilisnisty-ta-jevrointegracijnij-postup-ukrajini Weimar Triangle countries support the territorial integrity and European integration of Ukraine] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine]], press release of 11 April 2014.</ref> This was the first time that parliamentarians of the Weimar Triangle had ever made a joint trip to a third country.<ref>[https://www.bundestag.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/pm_1404081/263198 Parlamentarier des Weimarer Dreiecks: Röttgen, Guigou und Schetyna in Kiew] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817013043/https://www.bundestag.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/pm_1404081/263198 |date=17 August 2016 }} [[Bundestag]], press release of 8 April 2014.</ref>

In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] under the leadership of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] following the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal elections]], Röttgen was part of the working group on foreign policy, led by [[Ursula von der Leyen]], [[Gerd Müller (politician)|Gerd Müller]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]].

In 2020, following the resignation of CDU chairwoman [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]], Röttgen announced his candidacy for the party leadership; this made him the first official contender in the election.<ref>Philip Oltermann (18 January 2020), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/germany-senior-cdu-figure-announces-surprise-leadership-candidacy Germany: senior CDU figure announces surprise leadership candidacy] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref><ref>Andreas Rinke and Madeline Chambers (18 February 2020), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/wild-card-roettgen-enters-race-to-take-over-merkels-party-idUSKBN20C0U5 Wild card Roettgen enters race to take over Merkel's party] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

==Political views==

===European integration===
In 2011, Röttgen called for the direct elections of the [[President of the European Commission]], a bicameral political system for the EU, and simultaneous parliamentary elections across the EU.<ref>[http://www.politico.eu/article/the-yes-no-and-maybe-team/ The ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and ‘Maybe’ team] ''[[European Voice]]'', 23 May 2012.</ref>

Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum on European Union membership]] in the United Kingdom, Röttgen co-authored a paper with [[Jean Pisani-Ferry]], [[André Sapir]], [[Paul Tucker (banker)|Paul Tucker]] and [[Guntram Wolff]] which lays out a proposal of a "continental partnership" between the EU and the UK.<ref>[https://www.hertie-school.org/fileadmin/images/Research_Expertise/EU-UK_20160829.pdf Europe after Brexit: A proposal for a continental partnership] [[Hertie School of Governance]], released on 25 August 2016.</ref> According to the paper, such a partnership would grant Britain some control over labor mobility while preserving free movement of capital, goods and services.<ref>Patrick Donahue, Caroline Hyde and Arne Delfs (8 September 2016), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-08/merkel-lawmaker-sees-flexibility-on-migration-in-brexit-bargain Merkel Lawmaker Sees Leeway on Migration in Brexit Bargain] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

===Relations with Russia===
Röttgen is considered as an advocate of a more assertive [[Foreign relations of Germany|German foreign policy]]. In an editorial for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in March 2014, he argued that the only people who seemed not to realize that Germany was at the center of the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]] were "the Germans themselves."<ref>Alison Smale (18 April 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/world/europe/twin-shocks-shake-roots-of-german-power.html Twin Shocks Shake Foundation of German Power] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> When Russian state-run energy group [[Gazprom]] conducted an asset swap with its long-term German partner [[BASF]], under which it increased its stake in [[Wingas]], Röttgen raised concerns about the deal.<ref name="ft.com">Stefan Wagstyl (26 March 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/488fa430-b437-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html Gazprom deal in Germany raises alarm] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> In his opinion, expanding Gazprom activities in Germany are "deepening our dependence on Russia."<ref name="ft.com"/> In late 2015, Röttgen called for a review of the [[Nord Stream]] 2 natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], saying it was a "highly-political subject which carried the risk of splitting Europe" and may "contradict the aims of the agreed [[Energy policy of the European Union|European energy policy]]."<ref>Christian Oliver and Stefan Wagstyl (18 December 2015), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4dc4f66c-a5a3-11e5-97e1-a754d5d9538c.html#axzz3umwPzglA Tusk joins Italian premier in attacking Berlin over gas pipeline] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

Röttgen supported the European Union leaders' decision to impose sanctions on 21 individuals after the [[2014 Crimean status referendum|referendum in Crimea]] that paved the way for Putin to annex the region from Ukraine.<ref>Brian Parkin and Arne Delfs (7 April 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-06/merkel-pushes-u-s-trade-deal-saying-europe-ready-to-shun-putin.html Merkel Backs U.S. Trade Deal Saying EU Ready to Shun Putin] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref> By August 2014, he demanded that Europe respond to the escalation of violence in Ukraine by agreeing to further sanctions against Russia, saying that "[a]ny hesitation would be seen by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin as European weakness that would encourage him to keep going."<ref>Andreas Rinke (28 August 2014), [https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFB4N0PR01U20140828 German lawmaker says EU must impose new sanctions on Russia] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> However, he ruled out a U.S. proposal to arm Ukraine against Russia, calling it a "grave mistake" which "not only would [give] Putin a pretext to expand the war beyond eastern Ukraine, it would also serve his other goal to divide the West wherever he can."<ref>Sabine Muscat (11 February 2015), [https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/11/fps-situation-report-fighting-continues-in-ukraine-ahead-of-peace-talks-the-islamic-states-last-known-american-hostage-is-dead-u-s-rethinks-withdrawal-plans-in-afghanistan-and-much-more-from/ ONLY IT SITREP: Berlin Clings to Hope for Ukraine Deal] ''[[Foreign Policy]]''.</ref>

===Relations with the Middle East===
Amid the debate on sending military assistance to the Iraqi government following a dramatic push by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] militants through northern Iraq in mid-2014, Röttgen told newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' that delivering weapons would violate the government's arms export guidelines.

In 2016, Röttgen was quoted by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' as saying that Germany might end its unconditional support for Israel due to increasing frustration with Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s policies. "Israel's current policies are not contributing to the country remaining Jewish and democratic," Röttgen was quoted as saying. "We must express this concern more clearly to Israel."<ref>Christian Oliver and Stefan Wagstyl (18 December 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-israel-germany-idUSKCN0XS1FY German official denies report on foreign policy shift on Israel] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2019, Röttgen warned that Germany would alienate its European partners if it continued to insist on maintaining a temporary moratorium on arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia.<ref>Andrea Shalal (25 February 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-saudi-defence/germanys-spd-wants-to-extend-saudi-arms-export-halt-despite-uk-french-pressure-idUSKCN1QE1K1 Germany's SPD wants to extend Saudi arms export halt despite UK-French pressure] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Relations with Iran===
In March 2014, Röttgen was part of a delegation of the [[European Council of Foreign Relations]] to Tehran, Iran. In an open letter published in prominent newspapers across Europe – including ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', ''[[Tagesspiegel]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]'' – on 5 November 2014, he joined [[Javier Solana]], [[Ana Palacio]], [[Carl Bildt]], [[Emma Bonino]], [[Jean-Marie Guéhenno]] and [[Robert Cooper (strategist)|Robert Cooper]] in urging the [[P5+1|EU3+3]] countries (the UK, Germany and France and the US, China and Russia) and Iran to reach agreement on a comprehensive nuclear deal, arguing "that there may never again be an opportunity as good as this one to seal a final nuclear deal."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/05/time-for-nuclear-deal-with-iran-now The time for a nuclear deal with Iran is now] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 November 2014.</ref>

===Relations with Turkey===
In a speech to parliament in April 2015, Röttgen urged his fellow parliamentarians to call [[Armenian Genocide|the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians under Turkish rule in 1915]] [[Genocide|genocidal]] and to acknowledge that German actions at the time were partly to blame, adding that this recognition was overdue.<ref>Brian Parkin (23 April 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-23/germany-recognizes-armenian-killings-in-1915-as-genocide Germany Recognizes Armenian Killings in 1915 as Genocide] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> After the [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017 constitutional referendum]] that handed new powers to Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], Herrmann demanded that [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|EU accession talks for Turkey]] should be ended, not paused.<ref>Andrea Shalal (22 April 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-germany-idUSKBN17O0ON German conservatives urge end to EU-Turkey talks after pro-Erdogan vote] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Climate change and the environment===
Following the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], Röttgen sharply criticized both U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and China's leadership when he said: “China doesn’t want to lead, and the U.S. cannot lead.”<ref>Steven Hill (13 January 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/opinion/14iht-edhill.html Europe's Post-Copenhagen View of Obama] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> Writing in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in 2010, he joined British Energy Minister [[Chris Huhne]] and French Ecology Minister [[Jean-Louis Borloo]] in urging the [[European Union]] to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from the originally established 20 percent target by 2020.<ref>Karolina Tagaris (14 July 2010), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/14/us-europe-emissions-idUSTRE66D55R20100714 Ministers urge EU to toughen emissions targets] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Both [[Angela Merkel]] and Röttgen, the chief architects of the government's [[energy transition]] plan, are thought to have pushed for a rapid nuclear phase-out with a view to raising the prospects for a possible future national coalition with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]].<ref>Gerrit Wiesmann (30 June 2011), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/104eb058-a327-11e0-a9a4-00144feabdc0.html Germans vote to scrap nuclear power] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref><ref>Gerrit Wiesmann and Quentin Peel (23 May 2011), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/210b29dc-855c-11e0-ae32-00144feabdc0.html Röttgen sees rewards in non-nuclear policy] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> In 2012, Roettgen's plan to cut subsidies for solar power drew fire from opposition parties and the photovoltaic industry, which said the move threatened thousands of jobs in what was then the world's biggest solar market by installed capacity.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/>

===Relations with the African continent===
Röttgen has in the past voted in favor of German participation in [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions as well as in United Nations-mandated European Union peacekeeping missions on the African continent, such as in [[Somalia]] – both [[Operation Atalanta]] and [[European Union Training Mission Somalia|EUTM Somalia]] – (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), [[African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur|Darfur/Sudan]] (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014), [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan|South Sudan]] (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014), [[EUTM Mali|Mali]] (2013 and 2014), the [[EUFOR RCA|Central African Republic]] (2014) and [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|Liberia]] (2015). He abstained from the votes on extending the mandates for Operation Atalanta in 2009 and 2010 as well as on EUTM Somalia in 2016.

===Relations with China===
After European ambassadors wrote an open letter, praising 45 years of Sino-European relations, they found that ''[[China Daily]]'', which is a state-controlled media outlet, refused to publish unless it was significantly changed. In particular, that references to the origins of [[Coronavirus disease 2019]] coming from China be removed. The Europeans quickly accommodated this request. As the head of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, Röttgen criticised the European back-pedalling:<blockquote>I am shocked not once but twice: First the EU ambassadors generously adopt Chinese narratives and then on top of that the EU representation accepts Chinese censorship of the joint op-ed. Speaking with one voice is important, but it has to reflect our shared European values and interests.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Beijing|first=Bruno Waterfield, Brussels {{!}} Didi Tang|title=EU bows to Beijing censorship over source of coronavirus outbreak|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eu-accepts-chinese-censorship-of-joint-public-letter-89wlj9r83|access-date=2020-05-08|issn=0140-0460}}</ref></blockquote>
