The film includes more than 60 songs from famous artists and also has an original song by [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Ariana Grande]] called "[[Faith (Stevie Wonder song)|Faith]]," which was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Amidi|first=Amid|title=A Complete List of Every Song in Illumination’s ‘Sing’ |url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/complete-list-every-song-illuminations-sing-147042.html|accessdate=December 28, 2016|work=Cartoon Brew|date=September 9, 2016}}</ref> It screened on the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2016, premiered at [[Microsoft Theater]] on December 3, 2016 and was released in the United States on December 21, 2016, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed $634 million worldwide.

A sequel, titled ''[[Sing 2]]'', is scheduled to be released on December 22, 2021.

==Plot==
In a city of [[anthropomorphic]] animals called Calatonia, [[koala]] theater owner Buster Moon hosts a singing competition to promote his struggling theater, following financial problems brought up by [[llama]] bank representative Judith. A mishap involving the [[Ocular prosthesis|glass eye]] of Buster's assistant, elderly [[iguana]] Miss Crawly, applies two extra zeroes to the prize money, and the misprinted flyers are blown out the window into the street.

Animals from across the city gather for auditions. Those selected include: housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; punk-rock porcupine Ash; gorilla Johnny, son of mobster Big Daddy; [[street musician]] mouse Mike; singing and dancing frog trio Ricki, Howie, and Kai; and opera singer camel Pete. Teenage elephant Meena fails her audition from [[stage fright]], while Ash's ill-tempered boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest. Rosita is paired with an exuberant pig named Gunter for a dance routine. Buster discovers the flyers advertise a prize of $100,000 – money he does not have – but remains optimistic. He arranges a visit with his friend Eddie's grandmother, former opera singer and stage actress Nana Noodleman, who is hesitant to sponsor the prize money but agrees to attend a private preview of the show.

Pressured by her grandfather, Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance to perform, but becomes his [[stage hand]] instead. When the frog trio breaks up and quits and Pete is injured, Meena is added as an act (despite the fact that Buster hasn't heard her sing). Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray. After discovering Lance broke up with her for a new girlfriend, telling her that she was never around anymore, and evicting them from her apartment, Ash breaks down while singing her assigned song, [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s "[[Call Me Maybe]]." Johnny is torn between rehearsals and having to help his father as the driver of a [[getaway car]] in a heist. Trying to do both, he fails to pick up the robbers in time due to a traffic jam, and his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright, and Mike, certain the prize money is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse and swindles a group of Russian bears in a card game.

The day of the preview, the Russian bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who points to Buster. The bears open the prize chest, but it is nowhere near $100,000. The glass tank of [[Bioluminescence|luminescent]] squids lighting the stage breaks and floods the theater, which comes crashing down. Judith repossesses the lot and Buster, who had been living in his desk at the theater, takes up residence with Eddie at his parents' pool house. The contestants try to cheer him up, but Buster is too despondent to listen. He tries to start over by opening a [[car wash]].

When Meena goes to the rubble of the theater and sings [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]", Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money, performing on a makeshift stage on the lot for Rosita and Meena's families. Rosita and Gunter perform [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[Shake It Off]]", which finally prompts Rosita's husband, Norman, to pay attention to her singing talent. More animals are drawn to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news. Johnny's rendition of [[Elton John]]'s "[[I'm Still Standing]]" impresses his father, who escapes from prison to reconcile with him and apologize. Despite an interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song "Set It All Free," which her ex-boyfriend watches on TV and finally acknowledges Ash's talent. Mike returns to the show and sings [[Frank Sinatra]]'s "[[My Way]],” and Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "[[Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing]]", which literally brings down the house.

The show is a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. She buys the lot and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.

Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote, "In a year full of talking-animal hits, ''Sing'' isn't quite as strong a number. It's a tale that might not be particularly thought-provoking but sure is toe-tapping."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/12/20/review-sing-movie-matthew-mcconaughey-reese-witherspoon/95642796/|title=Review: Animated 'Sing' is a poppy treat (and Matthew McConaughey sings!)|author=Brian Truitt|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> In her review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Katie Walsh called ''Sing'', "a cute movie with genuinely funny moments (keep an eye out for the koala car wash), and some great tunes to boot."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-sing-review-20161216-story.html|title=Packed with pop tunes, 'Sing' discovers the simple fun in putting on a show|author=Katie Walsh|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''{{'}}s Bill Goodykoontz was rather mixed about the movie in his review and overall said, "Sing is like an album with a good song here and there, but too much filler and not enough hits."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/billgoodykoontz/2016/12/20/sing-movie-review-matthew-mcconaughey/95625778/|title='Sing' has too much filler, not enough hits|author=Bill Goodykoontz|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=December 21, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> Reviewing the version of the film screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], Stefan Pape of the British website ''HeyUGuys'' gave the film a mixed review of 2/5, stating that "Garth Jennings's ''Sing'' effectively acknowledges early on that it's following a completely unoriginal formula, and yet carries on regardless."<ref>{{cite news|title=TIFF 2016: Sing Review - HeyUGuys |url=http://www.heyuguys.com/sing-review/ |accessdate=September 21, 2016}}</ref> While Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', who also saw the film during the same festival, did not find the subplots to have any "profound life lessons," he overall praised Jennings' direction, the cast's voice performances and the film's silliness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/sing-review-illumination-entertainment-1201857701/|title=Film Review: ‘Sing’|author=Peter Debruge|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 11, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref>
