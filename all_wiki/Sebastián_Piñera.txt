== Education ==
Piñera's family moved to Belgium one year after his birth and later to New York City, where his father was the Chilean ambassador to the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Piñera returned to Chile in 1955 and enrolled in the [[Colegio del Verbo Divino]] ("Divine Word College"), from which he graduated in 1967.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Universia [http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=120078 Sebastián Piñera Perfil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207211052/http://www.universia.cl/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=120078 |date=7 February 2015}}</ref>

Piñera continued on to [[Harvard University]] on a partial [[Fulbright Program]] for [[postgraduate studies]] in economics.

== Teaching career ==
Piñera was an economics lecturer from 1971 until 1988 at the [[University of Chile]], the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], and [[Adolfo Ibáñez University]]. In 1971, he was in charge of Economic Political Theory in the School of Economics at the University of Chile and in 1972, at the Valparaiso Business School.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://biografias.bcn.cl/pags/biografias/detalle_par.php?id=226 |title=Sebastián Piñera Echeñique&nbsp;— Senador |work=Reseñas parlamentarias&nbsp;— Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |language=es}}</ref>

== Foundations ==
In 1989, with Cecilia Morel, Danica Radic, and Paula Délano, Piñera created the Enterprising Women Foundation (''Fundación Mujer Emprende''), originally called The House of Youth (''La Casa de la Juventud''). The foundation aims to assist in the development of young women of lower income.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Fundacion Mujer Emprende [http://www.mujeremprende.cl/me_qs.php Quienes Somos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115140830/http://www.mujeremprende.cl/me_qs.php |date=15 January 2010}}</ref>

In 1973, Piñera created the foundation ''Fundación Futuro'', of which he is president and whose directors are Cristián Boza D., María Teresa Chadwick P., Hugo Montes B., Cecilia Morel M., Renato Poblete S.J., and Fabio Valdés C.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The head director of the foundation is Magdalena Piñera.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.estrellaarica.cl/prontus4_nots/site/artic/20100423/pags/20100423170525.html|title=Magdalena Piñera, directora de la Fundación Futuro lanzó "Ojo con el Ejército de Chile" (Video)|website=www.estrellaarica.cl|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref> The foundation's mission is to help in Chile's development of justice, freedom and democracy.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Fundanción Futuro [http://www.fundacionfuturo.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=43&Itemid=20 Quienes Somos]</ref> The foundation was renamed ''Fundación Cultura y Sociedad'' after Piñera was elected president.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Terra [http://economia.terra.cl/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=201002091001_INV_78739381 Semana clave para fundación a la que Piñera traspasará propiedad de Chilevisión]</ref>

Under the ''Fundación Cultura y Sociedad'' (formerly ''Fundación Futuro''), the ''Grupo Tantauco'' has the mission of environmentalism, and is administered by Juan Carlos Urquidi.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} It was created to support the proposals Piñera plans to institute during his presidency.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Piñera2010 [http://pinera2010.cl/2009/09/22/conoce-las-propuestas-medioambientales-del-grupo-tantauco/ Conoce las propuestas medioambientales del Grupo Tantauco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207222157/http://pinera2010.cl/2009/09/22/conoce-las-propuestas-medioambientales-del-grupo-tantauco/ |date=7 December 2009 }}</ref> In 2005, Piñera created [[Tantauco Park]] (Spanish: ''Parque Tantauco''), a 1,180 km2 (456 sq mi) private natural reserve he bought and owns on the south end of Chiloé Island, in order to protect 118,000 hectares of the region's unique ecosystem. His foundation runs the park, which is open to the public and is an [[ecotourist]] location.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In fact, Piñera bought the 118,000 hectares in Chiloé through an [[offshore company]] in Panama. He has faced pressure to cede eight hectares to 16 indigenous families whose presence pre-dates Piñera's purchase and who have spent years negotiating to obtain title to their familial lands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-landrights-island-idUSKCN1GD5JE|title=Mystical islanders divided over Chile's giant bridge project|date=1 March 2018|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2017/06/09/familias-que-viven-en-tantauco-presionan-a-pinera-para-que-entregue-hectareas-antes-de-las-primarias/|title=Familias que viven en Tantauco presionan a Piñera para que entregue hectáreas antes de las primarias|first=El|last=Mostrador|date=9 June 2017|website=El Mostrador}}</ref>

An additional project, ''Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos'', was proposed in hopes of beginning a reconciliation between the Chilean people who suffered human rights violations during [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s dictatorship.<ref>{{in lang|es}} Piñera2010 [http://www.pinera2010.cl/2008/12/05/este-miercoles-se-lanza-nuevo-grupo-tantauco-derechos-humanos/ Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116222334/http://pinera2010.cl/2008/12/05/este-miercoles-se-lanza-nuevo-grupo-tantauco-derechos-humanos/ |date=16 November 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:Sebastián Piñera asume como Presidente de Chile y da inicio su segundo mandato 5.jpg|thumb|President Sebastian Piñera receives presidential sash and the O'Higgins Pioche for the second time, 11 March 2018]]

On 17 December, Piñera won the second round of the [[2017 Chilean general election|Chilean General election]], defeating the left wing candidate [[Alejandro Guillier]] to become President-Elect. Piñera took office for a second time on 11 March 2018, succeeding the outgoing [[Michelle Bachelet]].

Environmental NGOs accuse the government of yielding to pressure from the mining lobby in an attempt to thwart any draft legislation. In 2018, Sebastián Piñera buried an initiative to ban industrial activities near glaciers. In 2019, a draft law from the ranks of the opposition caused tensions. It is supposed to convert glaciers and their surrounding environment "into protected areas, prohibiting any intervention except scientific and that can benefit sustainable tourism". At least 44 mining projects are likely to be completed between 2019 and 2028.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reporterre.net/L-industrie-miniere-ou-les-glaciers-le-Chili-va-devoir-choisir|title=L’industrie minière ou les glaciers, le Chili va devoir choisir|website=Reporterre, le quotidien de l'écologie}}</ref>

===Cabinet===

In January 2018, Piñera unveiled his cabinet to harsh criticism: his interior minister, [[Andrés Chadwick]], was a vocal supporter of Pinochet dictatorship, which had previously appointed him president of the Catholic University Students Federation.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/chile-president-elect-sebastian-pinera-andres-chadwick|title=Chile president-elect reveals hardline cabinet with ties to Pinochet|first=Piotr|last=Kozak|date=23 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> In 2012 Chadwick expressed "deep repentance" for this support after discovering "over the years" serious human rights violations committed by the dictatorship, while defending the regime on other grounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/augusto-pinochet/chadwick-por-su-rol-en-dictadura-me-arrepiento-de-no-haber-hecho-algo-mas/2012-06-11/130659.html|title=Chadwick por su rol en dictadura: Me arrepiento de no haber hecho algo más|website=Cooperativa.cl}}</ref>

Chadwick and justice minister [[Hernán Larraín]] were also "supporters and defenders of the secretive German enclave [[Colonia Dignidad]], which was established by the fugitive [[Nazi]] officer and [[paedophile]] [[Paul Schäfer]] in the early 60s".<ref name="theguardian.com"/> Colonia Dignidad was used by Pinochet security officials to [[torture]] and murder opponents of the regime.<ref name="theguardian.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeracorrespondent/2013/10/tales-torture-2013103081121394171.html|title=Tales of torture|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>

Other appointees with ties to the Pinochet includes mining minister [[Baldo Prokurica]], a governor in the Pinochet government.

===Response to 2019–2020 Chilean protests===
{{Main|2019–2020 Chilean protests}}
Following widespread protests that broke out across Chile in October 2019, due to a poor economy, Piñera declared a [[state of emergency]] on 18 October, authorizing the deployment of the [[Chilean Army]] across the main regions to enforce order and prevent the destruction of public property, and invoked before the courts the ''Ley de Seguridad del Estado'' ("State Security Law") against dozens of detainees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/es/20191020-chile-movilizaciones-disturbios-toque-queda|title=Chile vivió segundo día en toque de queda tras nueva jornada de protestas|date=20 October 2019|website=France 24|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref> As a result, Piñera has been heavily criticized, decreasing his approval ratio down to 9% by 24 October, according to a poll by Active Research.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2019/10/24/por-los-suelos-encuesta-activa-reaserch-revela-pesima-valoracion-del-gabinete-de-pinera-en-manejo-de-la-crisis/|title=Por los suelos: Encuesta Activa Research revela demoledora evaluación del gabinete de Piñera en el manejo de la crisis|last=Mostrador|first=El|date=24 October 2019|website=El Mostrador|language=es|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref> although it slowly recovered back up to 13% by 1 June 2020,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Investigación de mercado y Opinión Pública|url=https://www.cnnchile.com/pais/pulso-ciudadano-aprobacion-pinera-127-mayo_20200601/|access-date=12 June 2020|website=CNN|language=es-CL}}</ref> against 73% disapproval.

===Use of bellicose rhetoric ===
During the [[2019–20 Chilean protests]] Piñera made himself known for the use of a bellicose language.<ref name=Espinoza2020>{{Cite news|title="Enemigo poderoso e implacable que no respeta a nada ni a nadie": Qué hay detrás del discurso que repite Piñera|url=https://www.theclinic.cl/2020/04/15/enemigo-poderoso-e-implacable-que-no-respeta-a-nada-ni-a-nadie-que-hay-detras-del-discurso-que-repite-pinera/|last=Espinoza|first=Camilo|date=15 April 2020|access-date=19 April 2020|work=[[The Clinic (newspaper)|The Clinic]]|language=es}}</ref> When Piñera addressed the nation on the evening of 20 October during the height of the unrest he remarked that the country was "at war with a powerful and relentless enemy" and announced that the [[state of emergency]] would be extended across much of the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://prensa.presidencia.cl/comunicado.aspx?id=103689 |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024144328/https://prensa.presidencia.cl/comunicado.aspx?id=103689 |archive-date=24 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some opposition politicians described his rhetoric as "irresponsible", while a Latin America editor for BBC News Online expressed concern about the impact his words would have on the protesters and on the chances for meaningful dialogue.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50119649 |title=Cost of living protests in Chile take deadly toll |access-date=21 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021185043/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50119649 |archive-date=21 October 2019 |url-status=live |work=BBC News |date=21 October 2019 }}</ref> Hours shortly after the President's speech, chief of national defense Javier Iturriaga del Campo spoke against this declaration, asserting that he was "content" and "not at war with anyone".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latercera.com/nacional/noticia/la-verdad-no-estoy-guerra-nadie-general-iturriaga-se-desmarca-dichos-del-presidente-pinera/870824/|title="La verdad es que no estoy en guerra con nadie": General Iturriaga se desmarca de dichos del Presidente Piñera|date=2 October 2019|website=La Tercera|language=es-CL|access-date=21 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021220644/https://www.latercera.com/nacional/noticia/la-verdad-no-estoy-guerra-nadie-general-iturriaga-se-desmarca-dichos-del-presidente-pinera/870824/|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

However the use of bellicose rhetoric can be traced back to at least 2018 when Piñera began his second government.<ref name=Espinoza2020/> He has referred to a variety of subjects like drug trafficking, terrorism and organised crime as a "powerful and relentless enemies".<ref name=Espinoza2020/> Besides this Piñera has made frequent use of words like "battle", "conquest", "defeat" and "combat" in his verbal communication.<ref name=Espinoza2020/> The use of such language is not unique to Piñera but has also been heard from European [[right-wing populism|right-wing populists]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=Espinoza2020/> According to economist Carlos Tromben who studied the political discourse of Piñera, the aim of this rhetoric is to rally the nation behind what is perceived as a common interest, but the success of this has been variable.<ref name=Espinoza2020/> Tromben also views the bellicose rhetoric as a defensive communicational strategy aimed to gain time for a "counterattack".<ref name=Espinoza2020/>
