'''Kharkiv''' ({{lang-uk|Ха́рків|Chárkiv}}, {{IPA-uk|ˈxɑrkiu̯|pron}}), also known as '''Kharkov''' ({{lang-ru|Ха́рьков}} {{IPA-ru|ˈxarʲkəf|}})<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/place/Kharkiv-Ukraine |title= Kharkiv on Encyclopædia Britannica - current edition |publisher= Britannica.com |accessdate= 20 April 2012}}</ref> is the second largest city in [[Ukraine]].<ref name="Kharkiv: #2 + situation October 2014">[http://www.euronews.com/2014/10/23/kharkiv-never-had-eastern-western-conflicts/ Kharkiv "never had eastern-western conflicts"], ''[[Euronews]]'' (23 October 2014)</ref> In the northeast of the country, it is the largest city of the [[Sloboda Ukraine|Slobozhanshchyna]] historical region. Kharkiv is the [[administrative centre]] of [[Kharkiv Oblast]] and of the surrounding [[Kharkiv Raion]], though administratively it is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the raion. The latest population estimate is {{Ua-pop-est2020|1,443,207|.}}.

The city was founded in 1654 and after a humble beginning as a small fortress grew to be a major centre of Ukrainian industry, trade and culture in the [[Russian Empire]]. Kharkiv was the first capital of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], from December 1919 to January 1934, after which the capital relocated to [[Kyiv]].<ref name="George O. Liber 1992">{{cite book|first=George|last=Liber|title=Soviet Nationality Policy, Urban Growth, and Identity Change in the Ukrainian SSR, 1923-1934|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oqThmrFCfwC&pg=PA160|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521522434}}</ref>

Presently, Kharkiv is a major cultural, scientific, educational, transport and industrial centre of Ukraine, with numerous museums, theatres and libraries, including the [[Annunciation Cathedral, Kharkiv|Annunciation]] and [[Dormition Cathedral, Kharkiv|Dormition Cathedrals]], the [[Derzhprom]] building in [[Freedom Square (Kharkiv)|Freedom Square]], and the [[National University of Kharkiv]]. Kharkiv was a host city for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

Industry plays a large role in Kharkiv's economy. Kharkiv's industry specializes primarily in [[machinery]] and in [[electronics]]. There are hundreds of industrial companies in the city, including the [[Morozov Design Bureau]] and the [[Malyshev Tank Factory]] (leaders in world [[tank]] production from the 1930s to the 1980s); [[Khartron]] ([[aerospace]] and [[nuclear power plant]]s automation [[electronics]]); the [[Turboatom]] ([[turbine]]s for hydro-, thermal- and nuclear-power plants), and [[Antonov]] (the multipurpose aircraft manufacturing plant).

Cultural artifacts date back to the [[Bronze Age]], as well as those of later [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] settlers. There is also evidence that the [[Chernyakhov culture]] flourished in the area from the second to the sixth centuries. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Establishment===
The city was founded by re-settlers who were running away from the war that engulfed [[Right-bank Ukraine]] in 1654 (see [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]]).<ref name=KUW231114/> The years before the region was a sparsely populated part of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]].<ref name="Solchanyk2001">{{cite book|author=Roman Solchanyk|title=Ukraine and Russia: The Post-Soviet Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNvTSDQXFXgC&pg=PA6|accessdate=31 March 2015|date=January 2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1018-0|page=6}}</ref> The group of people came onto the banks of [[Lopan River|Lopan]] and [[Kharkiv River|Kharkiv]] rivers where an abandoned settlement stood.<ref name="living_kharkiv">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2012/06/9/88316/ Живий Харків. Нічна екскурсія містом-господарем (Living Kharkiv. Nightly excursion through the host-city)] [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. June 9, 2012</ref> According to archive documents, the leader of the re-settlers was [[otaman]] Ivan Kryvoshlyk.<ref name=KUW231114/>

At first the settlement was self-governed under the jurisdiction of a [[voivode]] from [[Chuhuiv]] that is {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the east.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> The first appointed voivode from [[Moscow]] was Voyin Selifontov in 1656 who started to build a local [[Ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] (fort).<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> At that time the population of Kharkiv was just over 1000, half of whom were local cossacks, while Selifontov brought along a Moscow garrison of another 70 servicemen.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> The first Kharkiv voivode was replaced in two years after constantly complaining that locals refused to cooperate in building the fort.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> Kharkiv also became the centre of the local Sloboda cossack regiment as the area surrounding the [[Belgorod]] fortress was being heavily militarized. With the resettlement of the area by Ukrainians it came to be known as [[Sloboda Ukraine]], most of which was included under the jurisdiction of the Razryad [[Prikaz]] (Military Appointment) headed by a [[okolnichy|district official]] from [[Belgorod]]. By 1657 the Kharkiv settlement had a fortress<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> with underground passageways.

In 1658 Ivan Ofrosimov was appointed as the new voivode, who worked on forcing locals to kiss the cross to show loyalty to Russian tsar.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> The locals led by their [[otaman]] Ivan Kryvoshlyk refused.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> However, with the election of the new otaman Tymish Lavrynov the community (hromada) sent a request to the tsar to establish a local Assumption market, signed by [[Dean (Christianity)|deans]] of Kharkiv churches (the [[Assumption Cathedral, Kharkiv|Assumption Cathedral]] and parish churches of Annunciation and Trinity).<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> Relationships with the neighboring [[Chuhuiv]] sometimes were non-friendly and often their arguments were pacified by force.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> With the appointment of the third voivode Vasiliy Sukhotin was completely finished the construction of the city fort.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/>

Meanwhile, Kharkiv had become the centre of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].<ref name=KvUah5e/>

The Kharkiv Fortress was erected around the [[Assumption Cathedral, Kharkiv|Assumption Cathedral]] and its castle was at [[University Hill, Kharkiv|University Hill]].<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> It was between today's streets: vulytsia Kvitky-Osnovianenko, Constitution Square, Rose Luxemburg Square, Proletarian Square, and Cathedral Descent.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> The fortress had 10 towers: Chuhuivska Tower, Moskovska Tower, Vestovska Tower, Tainytska Tower, Lopanska Corner Tower, Kharkivska Corner Tower and others.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> The tallest was Vestovska, some {{convert|16|m|ft}} tall,<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> while the shortest one was Tainytska which had a secret well {{convert|35|m|ft}} deep.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> The fortress had the Lopanski Gates.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/>

In 1689 the fortress was expanded and included the Saint-Pokrov Cathedral and Monastery which was baptized<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> and became the center of local eparchy. Coincidentally in the same year in the vicinity of Kharkiv in [[Kolomak]], [[Ivan Mazepa]] was announced the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]].<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> Next to the Saint-Pokrov Cathedral was located the Kharkiv Collegiate that was transferred from [[Belgorod]] to Kharkiv in 1726.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/>

===In the Russian Empire===
In the course of the [[administrative divisions of Russia in 1708–1710|administrative reform]] carried out in 1708 by [[Peter the Great]], the area was included into [[Kiev Governorate]]. Kharkiv is specifically mentioned as one of the towns making a part of the governorate.<ref name="1708List">{{cite web|url=http://constitution.garant.ru/history/act1600-1918/2005/|script-title=ru:Указ об учреждении губерний и о росписании к ним городов, 1708 г., декабря 18 |trans-title=Decree on the establishment of Provinces and cities assigned to them, December 18, 1708|language=ru|website=constitution.garant.ru|accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref> In 1727, [[Belgorod Governorate]] was split off, and Kharkiv moved to Belgorod Governorate. It was the center of a separate administrative unit, [[Kharkiv Regiment|Kharkiv Sloboda Cossack regiment]]. The regiment at some point was detached from Belgorod Governorate, then attached to it again, until in 1765, [[Sloboda Ukraine Governorate]] was established with the seat in Kharkiv.<ref name="voronezh">{{cite web|url=http://arsvo.ru/arkhivnaya-sluzhba/istoriya-administrativno-territorialnogo-deleniya-voronezhskogo-kraya-2-voronezhs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525173851/http://arsvo.ru/arkhivnaya-sluzhba/istoriya-administrativno-territorialnogo-deleniya-voronezhskogo-kraya-2-voronezhs|archive-date=25 May 2013|script-title=ru:История административно-территориального деления воронежского края. 2.

Kharkiv became a major industrial centre and with it a centre of Ukrainian culture. In 1812, the first Ukrainian newspaper was published there. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} One of the first [[Prosvita]]s in Eastern Ukraine was also established in Kharkiv. A powerful nationally aware political movement was also established there and the concept of an Independent Ukraine was first declared there by the lawyer [[Mykola Mikhnovsky]] in 1900.

Soon after the [[Crimean War]], in 1860–61 number of [[hromada (secret society)|hromada]] societies sprung up across the Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv.<ref name=hromada>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CH%5CR%5CHromadas.htm|title=Hromadas|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> Among the most prominent hromada members in Kharkiv was [[Alexander Potebnja|Oleksandr Potebnia]], a native of [[Sloboda Ukraine]].<ref name=hromada/> Beside the old hromada, in Kharkiv also existed several student hromadas members of which were future political leaders of Ukraine such as [[Borys Martos]], [[Dmytro Antonovych]] and many others.<ref name=hromada/> One of the [[University of Kharkiv]] graduates [[Oleksandr Kovalenko (soldier)|Oleksandr Kovalenko]] was one of initiators of the mutiny on [[Russian battleship Potemkin]] being the only officer who supported the in-rank sailors.

Since April 1780 it was an [[administrative centre]] of [[Kharkov uyezd]].

Bolshevik Baltin in the "Chronicle of the Revolution" ({{lang-ru|Летопись Революции}}) noted that during the [[World War I]] in December 1914 Kharkiv experienced the most eerie Russian chauvinism (see, [[Great Russian chauvinism]]) which knew no limits when Russian ultra-nationalist [[Black Hundreds]] were assisted by a local police.<ref name=baltin>Балтин, А. "Харьковская организация Р. С.-Д. Р. П. большевиков во время войны." // Летопись Революции. - 1923. No.5.

Baltin also pointed that national oppression during the war had increased and from it suffered especially Ukrainians.<ref name=baltin/> With declaration of the war, there were closed all Ukrainian language newspapers and other periodicals.<ref name=baltin/> During the "Great Retreat", the local pro-Ukrainian socialist-democrats managed to receive permission on publication of Ukrainophone newspaper "Slovo".<ref name=baltin/> It was the first newspaper in Ukrainian language after a year of hiatus.<ref name=baltin/> But soon the city administration fined the publisher of the newspaper, after which no other publisher wanted to print the newspaper.<ref name=baltin/>

In 1928, the SVU ([[Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process|Union for the Freedom of Ukraine]]) process was initiated and court sessions were staged in the Kharkiv Opera (now the Philharmonia) building. Hundreds of Ukrainian intellectuals were arrested and deported. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the early 1930s, the [[Holodomor]] famine drove many people off the land into the cities, and to Kharkiv in particular, in search of food. Many people died and were secretly buried in mass graves in the cemeteries surrounding the city. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Kharkiv, the third largest city in the Soviet Union, was the most populous city in the Soviet Union captured by the Germans, since in the years preceding World War II, [[Kyiv]] was by population the smaller of the two.

The significant Jewish population of Kharkiv (Kharkiv's Jewish community prided itself with the second largest synagogue in Europe) suffered greatly during the war. Between December 1941 and January 1942, an estimated 15,000 Jews were killed and buried in a mass grave by the Germans in a ravine outside of town named [[Drobytsky Yar]].<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.dt.ua/3000/3150/55411/ |work=Дзеркало Тижня |issue= No. 49 (628) |title=Трагедія, про яку дехто не дуже хотів знати |trans-title=A tragedy that not everyone wanted to know about |first1=Gennady |last1=Karpyuk |date=23–29 December 2006 | access-date=16 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209085420/http://www.dt.ua/3000/3150/55411/ |archive-date=9 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], four battles took place for control of the city:
* [[First Battle of Kharkov]]
* [[Second Battle of Kharkov]]
* [[Third Battle of Kharkov]]
* [[Fourth Battle of Kharkov]] (''see also'' [[Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev]])

Before the occupation, Kharkiv's [[Malyshev Factory|tank industries]] were evacuated to the [[Urals]] with all their equipment, and became the heart of [[Red Army]]'s tank programs (particularly, producing the [[T-34]] tank earlier designed in Kharkiv). These enterprises returned to Kharkiv after the war, and continue to produce tanks.

Of the population of 700,000 that Kharkiv had before the start of World War II, 120,000 became [[Ost-Arbeiter]] ([[slave]] worker) in Germany, 30,000 were executed and 80,000 starved to death during the war.<ref name=KvUah5e/>

===Post-World War II===
In the post-World War II period, many of the destroyed homes and factories were rebuilt. The city was planned to be rebuilt in the style of [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Classicism]].<ref name="living_kharkiv"/>

An airport was built in 1954. Following the war, Kharkiv was the third largest scientific and industrial centre in the former USSR (after Moscow and [[Leningrad]]).

In 1975 Kharkiv subway was opened.

By its territorial expansion on September 6, 2012 the city increased its area from about {{convert|310|to|350|km2|abbr=out}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/T125215.html |title=Про зміну і встановлення меж міста Харків, Дергачівського і Харківського районів Харківської області |publisher=Search.ligazakon.ua |date=2012-09-18 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

A well-known landmark of Kharkiv is the [[Freedom Square, Kharkiv|Freedom Square]] (''Ploshcha Svobody'' formerly known as ''Dzerzhinsky Square''), which is the ninth largest city square in Europe, and the [[List of city squares by size|28th largest square in the world]].

There is an underground [[Kharkiv Metro|rapid-transit system]] (metro) with about {{convert|38.7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of track and 30&nbsp;stations. The newest underground station, [[Peremoha (Kharkiv Metro)|Peremoha]], was opened on 19 August 2016. All the underground stations have very distinctive architecture.

Kharkiv was a host city for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], and hosted three group soccer matches at the reconstructed [[Metalist Stadium]].

A large number of Orthodox cathedrals were built in Kharkiv in the 1990s and 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} For example, the Myrrh Bringing Wives Orthodox cathedral, the St. Vladimir Orthodox cathedral, St. Tamara Orthodox cathedral, etc.

In 2007, the city's Vietnamese minority built the largest Buddhist temple in Europe on a 1 hectare plot with a monument to [[Ho Chi Minh]].<ref>In↑  «Сегодня»,21 December 2007.</ref>

Gorky Park was fully renovated in the 2000s, having a big number of modern attractions, a lake with lilies and sport facilities to play tennis, football, beach volleyball, and basketball.

Feldman Park was created in recent years, containing a big collection of animals, horses, etc.

During the [[Euromaidan]] events, pro-Russian activists raised the Russian flag above the regional administration building and declared the Kharkov People's Republic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The uprising was quelled in less than two days due to rapid reaction of the Ukrainian security forces under then Ukrainian Interior Minister [[Arsen Avakov]] and [[Stepan Poltorak]] the then acting commander of the [[Internal Troops of Ukraine|Ukrainian Internal Forces]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} In addition, a special forces unit from [[Vinnytsia]] was sent to the city to crush the separatists. The mayor of the city, [[Hennadiy Kernes]], who supported the [[Orange Revolution]] but later joined the [[Party of Regions]], decided to side with the Ukrainian government. 2014 to 2016 saw a series of terror attacks.

==Geography==
[[File:Kharkiv, Ukraine, city and vicinities, LandSat-5 satellite image, near natural colors, 2011-06-18.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Kharkiv and vicinities, LandSat-5 satellite image, near natural colors, 2011-06-18]]
[[File:LopanStrelkaKharkov.jpg|thumb|right|Lopan-Kharkiv river spur]]
Kharkiv is located at the banks of the [[Kharkiv River|Kharkiv]], [[Lopan River|Lopan]], and [[Udy River|Udy]] rivers, where they flow into the [[Seversky Donets]] watershed in the north-eastern region of Ukraine.
[[File:Altana - Kharkiv Gorky Park.jpg|thumb|[[Park of Maxim Gorky|Gorky park]] is one of the main family attraction in Kharkiv]]
Historically, Kharkiv lies in the [[Sloboda Ukraine]] region (''Slobozhanshchyna'' also known as ''Slobidshchyna'') in Ukraine, in which it is considered to be the main city.

The approximate dimensions of city of Kharkiv are: from the North to the South — 24.3&nbsp;km; from the West to the East — 25.2&nbsp;km.

Based on Kharkiv's topography, the city can be conditionally divided into four lower districts and four higher districts.

The highest point above sea level in Pyatikhatky in Kharkiv is 202m, the lowest point above sea level in Novoselivka in Kharkiv is 94m.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Kharkiv lies in the large valley of rivers of [[Kharkiv River|Kharkiv]], [[Lopan River|Lopan']], [[Udy River|Udy]], and Nemyshlya. This valley lies from the North West to the South East between the Mid Russian highland and [[Donetsk]] lowland. All the rivers interconnect in Kharkiv and flow into the river of [[Seversky Donets|Northern Donets]]. A special system of concrete and metal dams was designed and built by engineers to regulate the water level in the rivers in Kharkiv.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Kharkiv has a large number of green city parks with a long history of more than 100 years with very old oak trees and many flowers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} [[Park of Maxim Gorky|Gorky park]], or Maxim Gorky Central Park for Culture and Recreation, is Kharkiv's largest public garden. The park has nine areas: children, extreme sports, family entertainment, a medieval area, entertainment center, French park, cable car, sports grounds, retro park.

===Climate===
Kharkiv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold, snowy winters and dry and hot summers.

The city has rather sunny, warm summers which, however, are relatively mild compared to temperatures in South European regions, due to the region's lower elevation, proximity to the Black Sea, and the city's [[latitude]].

Kharkiv has relatively long and cold winters.

The average rainfall totals {{convert|513|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, with the most in June and July.

In the early 2000s, the industry started to recover and adapt to market economy needs. Now there are more than 380&nbsp;industrial enterprises concentrated in the city, which have a total number of 150,000 employees. {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The enterprises form machine-building, electro-technology, instrument-making, and energy conglomerates.
