[[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) candidate [[Tsai Ing-wen]] with her independent running mate [[Chen Chien-jen]] won over [[Eric Chu]] of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and [[James Soong]] of the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP).

A second time presidential candidate, Tsai secured the DPP's nomination uncontested as early as February 2015, while KMT candidate [[Hung Hsiu-chu]] who won the party's nomination in July 2015, was trailing behind Tsai by double digits.<ref name="Tiezzi"/> Alarmed by Hung's perceived pro-Beijing stance, the KMT held a special party congress to nullify Hung's candidacy in a controversial move, and replaced her with the party chairman Eric Chu, less than a hundred days before the general election.<ref name="kick"/> However, Chu did not fare much better than Hung in the polls, and it was almost certain that Tsai was going to win weeks before the election. Veteran politician James Soong also announced his presidential campaign for the fourth time, making the election a three-way contest.

Some 12 million voters, 66% of the total registered voters, cast their votes; this was the lowest turnout since the office was first directly elected in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tai|first1=Ya-chen|last2=Chen|first2=Chun-hua|last3=Huang|first3=Frances|title=Turnout in presidential race lowest in history|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201601170015.aspx|accessdate=17 January 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=17 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119154047/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201601170015.aspx|archivedate=19 January 2016}} [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/01/18/2003637469 Alt URL]</ref> Tsai won 6.89 million votes, leading Chu, who received 3.81 million votes, by 3.08 million votes.

It was the second time the DPP won the presidency since [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s victory in [[2000 Taiwanese presidential election|2000]].

==Background==
{{see also|President of the Republic of China|Vice President of the Republic of China}}
[[File:中華民國第12、13任總統馬英九先生官方肖像照.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ma Ying-jeou]], the incumbent President of the Republic of China was ineligible to seek re-election after serving two consecutive terms.]]
Presidential candidates and vice-presidential [[running mate]]s are elected on the same ticket, using [[first-past-the-post]]. Due to [[Constitution of the Republic of China|constitutional]] two-term limits, incumbent president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] of [[Kuomintang]] was ineligible to seek re-election. It was the 14th election of the [[President of the Republic of China]] since the 1947 Constitution and the sixth [[direct election]] by the [[Taiwanese people|citizens of Taiwan]], which was previously [[indirectly elected]] by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] prior to 1996.

Ma Ying-jeou of Kuomintang was elected to a second term after defeating [[Tsai Ing-wen]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in the [[2012 Taiwanese presidential election|2012 presidential election]] with nearly six million votes. However, the Ma presidency was overshadowed by the historic [[Sunflower Movement]] student protest in 2014 against the [[Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]] (CSSTA) in which 500,000 protesters were mobilized and the [[Legislative Yuan]] was occupied by the protesters for the first time in history.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lin|first1=Adela|last2=Culpan|first2=Tim|title=Taiwan Students Occupy Legislature Over China Pact|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-19/taiwan-students-occupy-legislature-over-china-trade-pact-vote.html|work=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg L.

The ruling Kuomintang suffered a historic defeat in the following [[2014 Taiwanese local elections|municipal elections]] in November 2014, in which the Kuomintang lost nine of the 15 mayorships it previously held. Other anti-government movements such as the White Shirt Army, a mass protest following the [[Death of Hung Chung-chiu|death of army conscript Hung Chung-chiu]], and also the High School Edition protest, also hammered the credibility of the Ma government.<ref name="Carnegie">{{cite web|title=Taiwan’s 2016 Presidential Election|url=https://carnegieendowment.org/2015/09/09/taiwan-s-2016-presidential-election-pub-61189|date=9 September 2015|work=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Taiwan’s Changing Political Landscape: The KMT’s Landslide Defeat in the Nine-in-One Elections|first=Min-Hua|last=Huang|date=8 December 2014|work=Brookings|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/taiwans-changing-political-landscape-the-kmts-landslide-defeat-in-the-nine-in-one-elections/}}</ref>

==Nominations==

===Democratic Progressive Party===
According to internal party protocols, presidential primaries are conducted via nationwide opinion polling.<ref name="dppA">[http://www.dpp.org.tw/news_content.php?sn=4796 第13任總統提名選舉公告] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721193842/http://www.dpp.org.tw/news_content.php?sn=4796 |date=21 July 2015 }}，民主進步黨，2011年3月17日</ref> Registration for the primary was held between 2 and 16 February 2015.

Tsai became the only candidate who registered in February 2015, and thus nationwide opinion polling that was planned to be conducted between 16 and 18 March was suspended. Tsai was duly nominated by the DPP on 15 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/04/16/2003616029|title=DPP nominates Tsai as 2016 candidate|work=Taipei Times}}</ref> On 16 November 2015, Tsai Ing-wen announced former [[Ministry of Health and Welfare (Taiwan)|Minister of Health]] [[Chen Chien-jen]] as her running mate, who consequently resigned from his post as deputy director of [[Academia Sinica]].

Nationwide opinion polling were conducted from 12 to 13 June 2015; with equal weighting between approval rating and general election polling. Hung garnered an average of 46.20% in the nationwide polling, crossing the eligibility threshold of 30%, and was nominated unopposedly by the party congress on 19 July 2015.<ref>[http://www.cdnews.com.tw/cdnews_site/docDetail.jsp?coluid=141&docid=103258597 選戰/洪秀柱跨過防磚門檻　將獲國民黨提名] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221720/http://www.cdnews.com.tw/cdnews_site/docDetail.jsp?coluid=141&docid=103258597 |date=23 September 2015 }}，中央日報</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201507190005.aspx|title=Hung Hsiu-chu officially nominated as KMT's presidential candidate|work=focustaiwan.tw}}</ref>

However Hung's remarks on the Cross-Strait policy sparked fears over her perceived pro-unification stance which alienated some in her own party, taking a more moderate line, as she had advocated unification with the mainland but was recently stopped by senior party members, as most on the island prefer the status quo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan's ruling party endorses conservative pro-China candidate Hung Hsiu-chu for presidential run|date=19 July 2015|work=ABC News|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-19/taiwan-ruling-party-endorses-pro-china-hung-hsiu-chu/6632092}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan's KMT picks 'one-China' Hung Hsiu-chu for 2016 presidential run|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1841353/taiwans-kmt-picks-one-china-hung-hsiu-chu-2016|date=19 July 2005|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> In addition, Hung was still trailing Democratic Progressive Party candidate Tsai Ing-wen in the polls by double digits. Tsai is consistently showing 40–50 percent support in the polls, while Hung's numbers are closer to those of third party candidates [[James Soong]]. One poll had Tsai at 45 percent support and Hung at only 12 percent. The poor showing in the polls alarmed the senior party members.<ref name="Tiezzi">{{cite news|title=Taiwan’s KMT Moves to Replace Its Presidential Candidate|first=Shannon|last=Tiezzi|date=8 October 2015|work=The Diplomat}}</ref>

According to the reports from [[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|CNA]], Eric Chu, the incumbent KMT chairman and [[Mayor of New Taipei]], had privately urged Hung to step aside and allow another candidate to run, most likely Chu himself.<ref name="Tiezzi"/> In October 2015, Hung cited that Republic of China Constitution calls for "ultimate unification with China," although she added "be it in 50 years or 100 years." Eric Chu publicly responded by saying Hung's policy deviated from the mainstream and that the party has decided to call an extempore congress to consider a new candidate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hung hits back at Chu on China|date=9 October 2015|newspaper=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/10/09/2003629634}}</ref>

On 17 October, an extraordinary KMT party congress was called. The delegates voted overwhelmingly to nullify Hung Hsiu-chu's nomination.

After the controversial move of the KMT replacing [[Hung Hsiu-chu]] with [[Eric Chu]] as the presidential candidate less than 100 days before the 16 January general election, the poll still showed Chu trailing behind DPP candidate [[Tsai Ing-wen]] and was predicted to certainly lose. Critics said Chu over-thought his strategy and threw his hat in the ring when it was too late and being too close to the unpopular incumbent President [[Ma Ying-jeou]].<ref>{{cite news|title=
Eric Chu on a Mission Impossible|url=https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=137|date=15 January 2016|work=CommonWealth Magazine}}</ref><ref name="APF"/> Furthermore, Chu's running mate, Vice Presidential candidate [[Wang Ju-hsuan]] was mired in series of scandals, such as proposing unpaid leave, suing laid-off workers, and the "22K policy" which was blamed for decreasing young people's wages during her tenure as Minister of the Council of Labor Affairs, in addition to the ethical debate over her purchase of military housing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwanese presidential election: Can KMT’s Eric Chu debate his way to more votes?|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/taiwan-presidential-election-while-heading-left-on-economy-can-eric-chu-debate-his-way-to-more-votes/|date=5 January 2016|work=Asia Times}}</ref>

Like Ma, Chu put economic growth at the top of his agenda. Chu advocated for building stronger economic ties with China, seeing that as crucial to lifting Taiwan's economy out of isolation.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|title=Who are Taiwan's presidential election candidates?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35192143|publisher=BBC|date=1 January 2016}}</ref> He also said he would work to further Taiwan's objective of participating in regional integration initiatives such as the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) and [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]].<ref name="jantoday">{{cite news|title=2016 Presidential Election|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31&post=8033|work=Taiwan Today|date=1 January 2016}}</ref> Chu also proposed a "three strategy plan," a highlight of which is to dramatically raise basic wages from $20,008 new Taiwan dollars (NT) to NT $30,000 over four years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Analysis: Tsai, Chu gains limited in first round of Taiwan presidential debates|date=31 December 2015|work=Asia Times|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/taiwan-presidential-election-while-heading-left-on-economy-can-eric-chu-debate-his-way-to-more-votes/}}</ref>

With regard to relations with mainland China, Chu said he would be in line with his party's policy to continue to promote the development of cross-strait ties on the basis of the "[[1992 Consensus]]," in which both sides insist there is "one China" but agree to disagree on what this means. He attacked Tsai for her "vague policies", especially her approach to cross-strait relations as Tsai refused to accept Beijing's precondition that she first accept that Taiwan is a part of "one China". However, Tsai had moderated her party's pro-independence stance and promised to maintain peaceful and stable relations and expressed her openness to dialogues with the Beijing government.<ref name="jantoday"/><ref name="bbc"/> She stressed the importance of maintaining the status quo "in accordance with the will of the Taiwanese people and the existing ROC constitutional order." On the other hand, Tsai pledged to promote greater spending on indigenous defense programs, including research and development, in order to meet the nation's long-term defense needs.<ref name="jantoday"/>

On the domestic issues, Tsai called for comprehensive reform in areas such as bureaucratic efficiency, the education system, fiscal policy and regional development. She said that, above all, the country must establish a government that "puts the people first" and the "fruits of economic success should be shared fairly among all citizens."<ref name="jantoday"/> She pledged to solve the problem of unemployment rate, weak economic growth, an unequal distribution of wealth and impeding upward mobility.<ref name="jantoday"/>

Capitalizing on the unpopularity of the KMT's Chu-Wang ticket, [[James Soong]], the third party candidate of the PFP stressed that he would seek a cross-party cooperation on sharing power if elected and sought a middle path that would bridge the blue-green divide. According to the most recent surveys, is polling at about 14%, or just five percentage point behind the KMT.<ref name="APF">{{cite web|title=Taiwan Elections 2016: Certain Outcome, Uncertain Implications|date=8 January 2016|url=https://www.asiapacific.ca/canada-asia-agenda/taiwan-elections-2016-certain-outcome-uncertain-implications|work=Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada}}</ref>

The [[Ma–Xi meeting]] in November 2015 between Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou and Chinese [[paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]] in Singapore provided little political benefit to the KMT, affirming how most Taiwanese do not view closer relations with China to be beneficial to Taiwan.<ref name="APF"/>

==Chou Tzu-yu flag incident==
On 15 January 2016, one day before the election, [[Chou Tzu-yu]], a 16-year-old Taiwanese singer and a member of the [[South Korea]]n [[K-pop]] girl group [[Twice (band)|Twice]], attracted attention with her appearance in a South Korean variety show called ''[[My Little Television]]'', in which she introduced herself and waved the [[flag of the Republic of China]] alongside that of [[Flag of South Korea|South Korea]]. [[Flag of Japan|Japan]]'s flag was also shown as the other members of the group represented their nationality throughout the show. However, soon after the episode was broadcast it sparked controversy in China when Taiwanese-born China-based singer [[Huang An (singer)|Huang An]] accused Chou of being a "pro-Taiwanese independence activist".<ref>{{Cite web|title = 16-year-old K-pop singer waves Taiwan flag, forced to cancel China activities|url = http://shanghaiist.com/2016/01/16/16-year-old_k-pop_singer_tzuyu.php|website = Shanghaiist|access-date = 22 January 2016}}</ref> After the uproar over the issue, the group's record label, [[JYP Entertainment]] cancelled all activities of the group in China and released a video where Chou is shown reading an apology, all this the day before the election.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/01/16/pop_star_may_have_helped_pro_independence_party_win_taiwan_presidency.html | title = Did a 16-Year-Old Pop Star Help Pro-Independence Party Win Taiwan’s Election? | first=Daniel|last=Politi | work = Slate | accessdate = 21 January 2016}}</ref> She mentioned in part: {{Quote|text = "There is only one China. The two sides of the [Taiwan] Strait are one entity. I feel proud being a Chinese. I, as a Chinese, have hurt the company and netizens' feelings due to my words and actions during overseas promotions.

Nevertheless, many Taiwanese saw her apology as "humiliating and a sign of Taiwan's predicament that Chou had to apologize for expressing her Taiwanese identity and for showing her nation's flag." Tsai in her victory speech also mentioned how it had "angered many Taiwanese people, regardless of their political affiliation." And although it was believed by many that this incident affected the election, contributing to one or two percentage points of Tsai's winning margin,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Taiwan election: How a penitent pop star may have helped Tsai win – BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35340530|website = BBC News|access-date = 21 January 2016|language = en-GB}}</ref> it was thought that the issue probably had a very minor impact on the final outcome since most believed that people would have voted for Tsai anyway. However it is believed that the incident might potentially contribute to Taiwan's desire to become an independent state.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|title = Twenty-Somethings in Taiwan and the Country’s First Female President|url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/twenty-somethings-in-taiwan-and-the-countrys-first-female-president|newspaper = The New Yorker|date = 20 January 2016|access-date = 22 January 2016|issn = 0028-792X|first = Hua|last = Hsu}}</ref>
