'''Abuse of power''' or '''abuse of authority''', in the form of "[[malfeasance in office]]" or "official misconduct", is the commission of an [[Crime|unlawful]] act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties. Malfeasance in office is often a [[just cause]] for removal of an elected official by [[statute]] or [[recall election]]. Officials who utilize abuse of power are often those who exploit the ability to use [[corruption]] in their advantage.<ref name="corruption abuse of power">{{cite web|url=https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/research-and-learning/key-areas-work/corruption-and-abuse-power|title=Corruption and abuse of power|publisher= www.policeconduct.gov.uk/|accessdate=2020-01-18}}</ref><ref name="vanuatu-corruptionabuseofpower">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/382741/vanuatu-officials-accused-of-abuse-of-power-amid-corruption-claims |title=Vanuatu officials accused of abuse of power amid corruption claims |date=2019-02-19 |website=rnz.co.nz |access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref><ref name="trumpcorruptabuseofpower">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/opposing-trumps-corrupt-abuse-of-power-is-todays-form-of-patriotism/2019/09/23/72a0f95a-de3d-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html |title=Opposing Trump's corrupt abuse of power is today's form of patriotism |last=Gerson  |first=Michael |date=2019-09-24 |website=washingtonpost.com |access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>

In the United States, abuse of power has been cited in the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] of at least five federal officials.  Two of these (Judge [[George W. English|George English]] and President [[Richard Nixon]]) resigned before their trial in the Senate could take place, and two others were acquitted by the Senate.  The trial of President [[Donald Trump]] concluded with the president being found not guilty.  At the state level, Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] of Illinois was impeached and unanimously removed from office by the Illinois Senate in 2009 for offenses including abuse of power.

[[Institutional abuse]] is the maltreatment of someone (often children or older adults) by a system of power.<ref name=Powers>{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L.|author2=A. Mooney & M.

===Charles Swayne===
Federal Judge [[Charles Swayne]] was [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1904. He was accused of filing false travel vouchers, improper use of private railroad cars, unlawfully imprisoning two attorneys for contempt, and living outside of his district. He was acquitted by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1905.  There was little doubt that Swayne was guilty of some of the offenses charged against him. Indeed, his counsel admitted as much, though calling the lapses "inadvertent." The Senate, however, refused to convict Swayne because its members did not believe his actions amounted to "high crimes and misdemeanors".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm#3|title=U.S. Senate: Impeachment|website=senate.gov}}</ref>

President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|voted to approve articles of impeachment]], but before the full House had a chance to vote on impeachment.

===Lois Lerner/IRS===
Lois Lerner used her position as head of the Exempt Organizations Unit of the IRS to deny mainly conservative groups exempt status.

In October 2017, the Trump Administration agreed to settle a lawsuit filed on behalf of more than four hundred conservative nonprofit groups who claimed that they had been discriminated against by the Internal Revenue Service for an undisclosed amount described by plaintiffs' counsel as "very substantial." The Trump Administration also agreed to settle a second lawsuit brought by forty-one conservative organizations with an apology and an admission that subjecting them to "heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays" was wrongful.

===Fa Zheng===
{{Main|Fa Zheng}}
Fa Zheng, a Chinese man, was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shu [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (蜀郡) and "General Who Spreads Martial Might" (揚武將軍) by [[Liu Bei]]. He oversaw administrative affairs in the vicinity of Yi Province's capital [[Chengdu]] and served as Liu Bei's chief adviser.<ref>(以正為蜀郡太守、揚武將軍，外統都畿，內為謀主。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.</ref>

During this period of time, he abused his power by taking personal revenge against those who offended him before and killing them without reason. Some officials approached [[Zhuge Liang]], another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, "When our lord was in Gong'an (公安), he was wary of [[Cao Cao]]'s influence in the north and fearful of [[Sun Quan]]'s presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that [[Lady Sun]] might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?" Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.<ref>(一飡之德，睚眦之怨，無不報復，擅殺毀傷己者數人。或謂諸葛亮曰：「法正於蜀郡太縱橫，將軍宜啟主公，抑其威福。」亮荅曰：「主公之在公安也，北畏曹公之彊，東憚孫權之逼，近則懼孫夫人生變於肘腋之下；當斯之時，進退狼跋，法孝直為之輔翼，令翻然翱翔，不可復制，如何禁止法正使不得行其意邪！」初，孫權以妹妻先主，妹才捷剛猛，有諸兄之風，侍婢百餘人，皆親執刀侍立，先主每入，衷心常凜凜；亮又知先主雅愛信正，故言如此。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.</ref>

===Police officers===
{{further|Legal abuse#Law enforcement abuse|Abuse#Police abuse|Police brutality}}
In dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity.

Individual officers, or sometimes whole units, can be [[Police corruption|corrupt]] or carry out various forms of [[police misconduct]]; this occasionally happens in many forces, but can be more common where police pay is very low unless supplemented by [[bribe]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |title=IPS: DRUGS-MEXICO: Police Caught Between Low Wages, Threats and Bribes |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2010-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620183631/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |archive-date=2010-06-20 }}</ref> Police officers sometimes act with unwarranted [[Police brutality|brutality]] when they overreact to confrontational situations,<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5172206/Ian-Tomlinson-G20-protests-death-police-office-faces-manslaughter-charge.html |title=Ian Tomlinson G20 protests death: police office faces manslaughter charge |work=The Telegraph |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> to extract a confession from a person they may or may not genuinely suspect of being guilty,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517014.100-you-did-it-didnt-you-the-police-often-argue-that-thetough-interviewing-of-suspects-is-the-best-way-to-extract-the-truth-butsuch-strategies-are-exactly-the-sort-to-provoke-false-confessions-.html |title=The police often argue that the tough 'interviewing' of suspects is the best way to extract the truth.
