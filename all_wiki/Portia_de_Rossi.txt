The actress was to star as a "brilliant and successful woman who begrudgingly goes to work for her less-brainy but more popular sister – a former beauty queen, weather girl and now big-city Mayor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spoilerville.unrealitytv.com/abc-to-air-ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossis-the-smart-one|title=ABC to air Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi's "The Smart One"|publisher=Unreality TV|date=6 February 2012|accessdate=6 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206163932/http://spoilerville.unrealitytv.com/abc-to-air-ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossis-the-smart-one/|archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref> But ''The Smart One'' was not picked up for the 2012–2013 season.<ref name="imdb"/>
