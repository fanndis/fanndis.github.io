==Former TV3 news shows==

===''3 News''===
{{External media|video1=[https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/3-news-first-episode-1989 3 National News - First Bulletin, 27 November 1989]<br />via [[NZ on Screen]]}}The TV3 6pm news bulletin was known as ''3 News'' or ''3 News at 6pm'' up until 31 January 2016. 3 News was originally known as ''3 National News'' and first went on air on Monday 27 November 1989 when [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] began broadcasting. For the first year of broadcast, ''3 National News'' was a thirty-minute bulletin screening at 6:30 pm, which the same time slot as [[Paul Holmes (broadcaster)|Holmes]] on [[TV1 (New Zealand)|TV1]]. The original bulletin was presented by former [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation|BCNZ]] and [[TVNZ]] anchor [[Philip Sherry]], joined by sportscaster Greg Clark and weathercaster [[Belinda Todd]].

Among the reports in the first day's bulletin were:

* Marty McNamara reported on a man (Charles Coulam) appearing in court charged with murdering Monica Cantwell.
* [[Mark Jennings (New Zealand)|Mark Jennings]] reported on an alleged stabbing of a motorcyclist in [[Timaru]] 
* [[Stephen Christensen]] reported on a lack of funding for education and interviewed Education Minister [[Phil Goff]] 
* [[Ian Wishart (journalist)|Ian Wishart]] reported on law changes allowing traffic officers to enter private property and challenged drivers who were trying to evade traffic officers
* Max Hayton reported on the [[1989 Indian general election|1989 Indian Election]]
* Steve Barnes reported on political changes in Communist [[Czechoslovakia]]
* Greg Clark reported on the victory of New Zealand horse [[Horlicks (horse)|Horlicks]] in the 1989 [[Japan Cup]]
* [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] runner [[Peter O'Donoghue (athlete)|Peter O'Donoghue]] was interviewed by Stephen Stuart
* [[Clint Brown]] previewed upcoming summer tennis
* The final report, by [[Janet McIntyre]], described TV3's launch party and the network's first day of operation.

In 1991 TV3 extended ''3 National News'' to a 1-hour bulletin starting at 6pm, this occurred during the [[Gulf War]] but TV3 continued to screen a 1-hour bulletin following the war. TV3 used their 1-hour news bulletin of 3 National News as a selling point over [[One News (New Zealand)|One Network News]] which was still a 30-minute bulletin followed by the Holmes show, One Network News did not become a 1-hour bulletin until 1995. During the nine years that the bulletin was known as ''3 National News'' it had three different hosts. Original anchor [[Philip Sherry]] was replaced by [[Joanna Paul]] in mid-1990; Paul had previously been the anchor of the launch news update and weekend bulletins. When Paul opted not to renew her contract with the network, [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] hired former TVNZ newsreader and [[It's in the Bag (game show)|It's in the Bag]] game show host, [[John Hawkesby]].

In 1998, [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] revamped its presentation, shortening the show's name to ''3 News'' and adding another presenter. They initially planned for Hawkesby and ex-TVNZ journalist [[Carol Hirschfeld]] to co-host. The planned Hawkesby-Hirschfeld team never eventuated, with [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] taking the male anchor role when Hawkesby walked out of [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] to host [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]. [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] later sued TVNZ for "interfering with the relationship" between Hawkesby and [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]. The two parties settled out of court at the end of 2000 for an undisclosed amount.<ref>{{cite news |title=TVNZ pays TV3 over Hawkesby |publisher=The Press |date=11 November 2000 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-17504038.html |accessdate=6 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 2005, Hirschfeld and Campbell left their anchor positions to collaborate on current affairs show [[Campbell Live]]. They were replaced by [[Hilary Barry]] and [[Mike McRoberts]]. The same year, 3 News won the Best News Award at the [[Qantas Television Awards]]. In 2005, TV3's parent company [[Mediaworks New Zealand]] launched [[Radio Live]].

A new ''3 News'' studio set began use on 15 September 2008, this coincided with an updated graphics package using the 2005 – 2008 graphics as its base. On 4 July 2011, 3 News revamped its presentation package starting with the early morning show of the time ''Firstline'', to have the "floating tiles" look, which was in use up till the launch of Newshub on 1 February 2016.

In November 2012, 3 News won the Best News award at the 2012 New Zealand Television Awards.

On 27 January 2014, 3 News refreshed its split screen graphic, finance graphics and full frame graphics. At the same time, 3 News also updated their printed fake newsroom backdrop which they used while they temporarily broadcast from a green/blue screen set.

In early April 2015, it was announced that 3 News' Sunday bulletin would be reduced to half an hour and would be followed by a shortened version of the network's midweek current affairs programme 3rd Degree, which was later renamed "3D".<ref>{{cite news |title=TV3 to reduce Sunday 6pm news bulletin to 30 minutes |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=12 April 2015 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/67699811/TV3-to-reduce-Sunday-6pm-news-bulletin-to-30-minutes |accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> The first of these shortened Sunday bulletins was broadcast on 24 May 2015.

On 19 December 2015, Studio 1 was decommissioned temporarily to prepare the studio for the launch of Newshub. During the refit of Studio 1, they broadcast from a green screen studio placed in the Paul Henry show set during the summer off-air time.
