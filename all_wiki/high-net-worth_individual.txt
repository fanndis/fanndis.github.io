'''High-net-worth individual''' ('''HNWI''') is a term used by some segments of the [[financial services]] industry to designate persons whose investible [[wealth]] ([[asset]]s such as [[stocks]] and [[bond (finance)|bonds]]) exceed a given amount. Typically, these individuals are defined as holding financial assets (excluding their [[primary residence]]) with a value greater than US$1 million.<ref name="investopedia.com">{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=19 April 2020|title=High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI)|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hnwi.asp|access-date=2020-11-10|website=Investopedia}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

As of June 2020, there were estimated to be just over 13 million HNWIs in the world. The United States had the highest number of HNWIs (4,700,000) of any country, while [[New York City]] had the most HNWIs (348,000) among cities.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020|title=Global Wealth Migration Review 2020|url=https://e.issuu.com/embed.html?u=newworldwealth&d=gwmr_2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/afrasia-global-wealth-migration-review-2020|archive-date=2020-11-10|access-date=October 2, 2020|website=AfrAsia Bank|publisher=AfrAsia Bank Limited}}</ref>

== United States: SEC regulations ==
{{See also|Accredited investor}}

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] requires all SEC-registered investment advisers to periodically file a report known as Form ADV.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/formadv.htm|title=SEC.gov - Form ADV|website=www.sec.gov}}</ref> Form ADV requires each investment adviser to state how many of their clients are "high-net-worth individuals", among other details; its Glossary of Terms explains that a "high-net-worth individual" is a person with at least $1,000,000 managed by the reporting investment adviser, or whose net worth the investment adviser reasonably believes exceeds $2,000,000 (or who is a "qualified purchaser" as defined in section 2(a)(51)(A) of the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]]). The net worth of an individual for SEC purposes may include assets held jointly with his or her spouse. Unlike the definitions used in the financial and banking trade; the SEC's definition of HNWI would include the value of a person's verifiable non-financial assets, such as a primary residence or art collection.<ref>{{Cite web|title=17 CFR ยง 230.501 - Definitions and terms used in Regulation D.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.501|access-date=2020-11-10|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en}}</ref>

== Annual World Wealth Report ==

The World Wealth Report was co-published by [[Merrill Lynch]] and [[Capgemini]], previously known as Cap Gemini Ernst & Young who worked together since c. 1993, investigating the "needs of high-net-worth individuals" in order to "successfully serve this market segment". Their first annual World Wealth Report was published in 1996.<ref name="Capgemini2003">{{cite report|url=http://ml.com/media/14076.pdf |year=2003 |publisher=Capgemini |title=2003 World Wealth Report |access-date=10 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102085510/http://ml.com/media/14076.pdf |archive-date=January 2, 2010 }}</ref>  The World Wealth Report defines HNWIs as those who hold at least US$1 million in assets excluding primary residence and ultra-HNWIs as those who hold at least US$30 million in assets excluding primary residence.<ref name="Capgemini2009-1">{{cite report|url=http://www.capgemini.com/resources/thought_leadership/2009_world_wealth_report|title=2009 World Wealth Report|publisher=Capgemini|year=2009|series=Thought Leadership}}</ref> The report states that in 2008 there were 8.6 million HNWIs worldwide, a decline of 14.9% from 2007.  The total HNWI [[wealth]] worldwide totaled US$32.8 trillion, a 19.5% decrease from 2007.  The ultra-HNWIs experienced the greater loss, losing 24.6% in population size and 23.9% in accumulated wealth. The report revised its 2007 projections that HNWI financial wealth would reach US$59.1 trillion by 2012 and revised this downward to a 2013 HNWI wealth valued at $48.5 trillion advancing at an annual rate of 8.1%.<ref name="Capgemini2009">{{cite report|url=http://www.capgemini.com/sites/default/files/resource/pdf/World_Wealth_Report_2009.pdf|title=2009 World Wealth Report|publisher=Capgemini|access-date=11 September 2013|year=2009}}</ref>

The 2018 World Wealth Report <ref name="worldwealthreport.com">https://worldwealthreport.com/</ref> was jointly produced by Capgemini and [[RBC Wealth Management]] and included, for the first time, the Global HNW Insights Survey produced in collaboration with Scorpio Partnership.<ref>http://www.scorpiopartnership.com</ref> The inaugural survey represented one of the largest and most in-depth surveys of high-net-worth individuals ever conducted, surveying more than 4,400 HNWIs across 21 major wealth markets in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.

== Markets ==
Certain products cater to the wealthy, whose [[conspicuous consumption]] of [[luxury goods]] and services includes, for example: [[mansion]]s, [[yacht]]s, first-class airline tickets and [[Business jet|private jets]], and personal [[umbrella insurance]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/ideas/conspicuous-consumption-is-over-its-all-about-intangibles-now|title=Conspicuous consumption is over.

=== Banking and finance ===
{{Main|Private banking|Wealth management}}
Most global banks, such as [[Banco Santander|Santander]], [[Barclays]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Citibank]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[HSBC]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], and [[UBS]], have a separate business unit with designated teams consisting of client advisors and product specialists exclusively for UHNWI. These clients are often considered to have characteristics similar to [[institutional investors]] because the vast majority of their net worth and current income is derived from [[Passive income|passive sources]], rather than [[Job|labor]].

By 2006, asset managers working for HNW individuals invested more than ยฃ300 billion on behalf of their clients. These wealth managers are bankers who in 2006, earned multimillion-pound salaries and owned their own companies and equity funds.<ref name="RivkinTimes2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article1724680.ece|date=12 December 2006|title=How I make the rich richer|first=Annabel|last=Rivkin|work=The Times|access-date=10 September 2013 | location=London}}</ref> In 2006, a list of the 50 top investment bankers was published by the [[Spear's Wealth Management Survey]].

== Academic studies of asset management trends ==
The [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] Global Family Alliance (WGFA) whitepaper was released in 2008 to study the investment strategies of single family offices in the United States and in Europe.<ref>Wharton Global Family Alliance. [http://wgfa.wharton.upenn.edu/ "Benchmarking the Single Family Office: Identifying the Performance Drivers"].</ref> The research was segregated into sub-groups representing those with less than $1 billion in assets and those with assets above $1 billion. The study found that U.S. families reported a more aggressive attitude toward investment objectives than their counterparts in Europe.  One recommendation of the WGFA study advised the advisors and family offices serving this niche to avoid complexity in the structure of portfolios.

The authors cite that the more complex the portfolio and number of holdings, the more difficult the job of performing adequate governance, reporting, and education. The [[Institute for Private Investors]], a peer networking organization for wealthy families and their advisors, suggested a similar theme to its membership in 2008 with a conference themed, "The Return to Simplicity".<ref>Institute for Private Investors. [http://memberlink.net].</ref> Kotak Wealth Management<ref>http://wealthmanagement.kotak.com</ref> and [[CRISIL]] Research, published a report on the Ultra High Net Worth Individuals in India titled "Top of the Pyramid Report".<ref name="Indian Express 2011">{{cite web | title=Ultra HNI segment set to treble: Report | website=Indian Express | date=2011-06-07 | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ultra-hni-segment-set-to-treble-report/800562/ | access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>

Niall J Gannon and Michael Blum published a [[whitepaper]] in [[The Journal of Wealth Management]]<ref>https://jwm.pm-research.com/content/9/2/35.full</ref> in 2006 titled The After-Tax Return of Stocks Versus Bonds for the High Tax Bracket Investor.  The paper found that the return of indexed stock portfolios fell from 10.62% for non-taxable portfolios to 6.72% for a portfolio that paid the highest federal income and capital gains tax rate. The paper observed rolling 20 year periods from 1961โ2006. The study was updated by Gannon and Scott Seibert, CFA in ''Tailored Wealth Management: Exploring the Cause and Effect of Financial Success''.<ref name=twm>{{cite book | title=Tailored Wealth Management - Exploring the Cause and Effect of Financial Success - Niall J.
