He left the programme to become a political candidate.

==Political career==
===Career in national politics===
Cox stood as a [[Fianna Fáil]] candidate at the [[1979 Irish local elections|1979 local elections]].<ref name=IT_07062011>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0607/breaking46.html |title=Pat Cox applies to join Fine Gael |work=The Irish Times |date=7 June 2011 |first=Paul |last=Cullen}}</ref>

===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–2004===
Cox was elected an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[1989 European Parliament election in Ireland|in 1989]] for the constituency of [[Munster (European Parliament constituency)|Munster]], representing the [[Progressive Democrats]] (PDs).<ref name=elecs_irl>{{ElectionsIreland|name=Pat Cox|id=3924|access-date=7 June 2011}}</ref> During his first term, he served on the [[Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs|Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy]].

At the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] Cox was also elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] as a [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) for [[Cork South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Cork South-Central]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Pat-Cox.D.1992-12-14/|title=Pat Cox|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=20 July 2013}}</ref> Following [[Desmond O'Malley]]'s retirement from the party leadership in 1993, Cox stood for election to the post but was beaten by [[Mary Harney]]. He became deputy leader.

Cox left the PDs in 1994 in a dispute over his seat as an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. It was expected that Cox would not contest his seat in the [[1994 European Parliament election in Ireland|1994 European elections]], with O'Malley, who had a large Munster base in [[Limerick]] city and [[County Limerick]], becoming the party candidate. However Cox then decided to contest the seat as an independent, beating O'Malley, the PD candidate. On being elected, he resigned his Dáil seat and a [[1994 Cork South-Central by-election|by-election]] was held on 10 November 1994, which was won by [[Fine Gael]]. He subsequently served on the [[Committee on Constitutional Affairs|Committee on Institutional Affairs]] from 1994 until 1997 and on the [[Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs|Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy]] from 1997 until 1999. In addition to his committee assignments, he was a member of the Parliament's delegation for relations with [[South Africa]].

Cox was unanimously re-elected Group President in June 1999 following his re-election as an MEP at the [[1999 European Parliament election in Ireland|1999 European Parliament election]]. He resigned this post when he became [[President of the European Parliament]] on 15 January 2002 in accordance with an agreement between the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the ELDR groups at the start of the term (in the customary two-way split of the five-year Presidency of the European Parliament).
