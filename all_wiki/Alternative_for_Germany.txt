Founded in April 2013, the AfD narrowly missed the 5% electoral threshold to sit in the [[Bundestag]] during the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]]. In 2014, the party won seven seats in the [[2014 European Parliament election in Germany|European election]] as a member of the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]]. After securing representation in 14 of the 16 [[States of Germany|German state]] parliaments by October 2017, in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]] the AfD became the third-largest party in Germany after winning 94 seats in the [[Bundestag]]. It was the first time they had been represented there. The party is chaired by [[Jörg Meuthen]] and [[Tino Chrupalla]]; its lead candidates in the 2017 elections were AfD Co-Vice Chairman [[Alexander Gauland]] and [[Alice Weidel]], who now serves as the party group leader in the Bundestag. In 2017 the AfD also became the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.

Their [[manifesto]] was endorsed by several economists, journalists, and business leaders, and stated that the [[eurozone]] had proven to be "[[Optimum currency area|unsuitable]]" as a currency area and that southern European states were "sinking into poverty under the competitive pressure of the euro".<ref name=Welt0303>{{cite news| title = Anti-Euro-Partei geißelt die Politik der Kanzlerin|trans-title=Anti-euro party lashes out at politics of Chancellor Merkel| language = German | first = Günther | last = Lachmann| url = https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article114091447/Anti-Euro-Partei-geisselt-die-Politik-der-Kanzlerin.html| newspaper = [[Die Welt]]| date = 3 March 2013| accessdate =2 May 2013|quote="Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ist in der schwersten Krise ihrer Geschichte.

With the [[European migrant crisis|migrant debate]] remaining the dominant national issue, on 13 March 2016 elections held in the three states of [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]] saw the AfD receiving double-digit percentages of the vote in all three states.<ref>{{cite news |author=Philip Oltermann |title=Anti-refugee AfD party makes big gains in German state elections |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/13/anti-refugee-party-makes-big-gains-in-german-state-elections |date=13 March 2016 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/landtagswahlen-2016-die-sechs-datenanalysen-zur-wahl-a-1082240.html|title=Landtagswahlen 2016: Die sechs Datenanalysen zur Wahl|date=14 March 2016|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref> In the [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election]], the AfD reached second place in the Landtag, receiving 24.2% of the vote.

In the [[2016 Rhineland-Palatinate state election]], the AfD again reached third place, with 12.6% of the vote. In [[Angela Merkel]]'s home state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], her CDU was beaten into third place following a strong showing of the AfD, who contested at state level for the first time, to claim the second-highest polling with 20.8% of the vote in the [[2016 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/09/04/nationalists-overtake-merkels-party-in-german-state-vote.html | title=Nationalists overtake Merkel's party in German state vote &#124; Fox News | agency=Associated Press | date=4 September 2016 | publisher=Fox News Channel | access-date=5 September 2016 | quote=The three-year-old Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 21 to 22 percent of votes in the election for the state legislature in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, according to projections for ARD and ZDF television based on exit polls and partial counting.

Rising support for the AfD meant that The Greens and the NDP failed to reach the 5% threshold to qualify for seats in the [[Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], and consequently lost their seats. In the [[2016 Berlin state election]], which the AfD also contested for the first time,{{cn|date=November 2020}} they achieved a vote of 14.2%, making them the fifth largest party represented in the state assembly.

At the party congress held on 30 April to 1 May 2016, the AfD adopted a policy platform based upon opposition to Islam, calling for the ban of Islamic symbols including [[Burqa|burkhas]], [[minaret]]s and the [[Adhan|call to prayer]], using the slogan "Islam is not a part of Germany".<ref name="MM1">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/germanys-afd-adopts-anti-islam-stance-at-party-conference-1462120609|title=Germany's AfD Adopts Anti-Islam Stance at Party Conference|author=Ruth Bender|date=1 May 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref name="MM2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae9e9a92-0f9d-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html|title=Germany's AfD party adopts anti-Islamic manifesto|work=Financial Times}}</ref><ref name="MM3">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/alternative-for-germany-anti-immigrant-afd-says-muslims-are-not-welcome-in-germany-a7009531.html|title=Anti-immigrant AfD says Muslims are not welcome in Germany|author=Tina Bellon|date=1 May 2016|work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38661621|title=German fury at AfD Hoecke's Holocaust memorial remark|date=18 January 2017|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

At the party conference in April 2017, Frauke Petry announced that she would not run as the party's main candidate for the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]]. This announcement grew out of internal power struggle as the party's support had fallen in polls from 15% in the summer of 2016 to 7% just before the conference. Björn Höcke from the far-right wing of the party and Petry were attempting to push each other out of the party. Petry's decision was partly seen as a step to avoid a vote at the conference on the issue of her standing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Huggler|first1=Justin|title=German far-right leader stuns party by quitting chancellor race|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/21/german-far-right-leader-stunsparty-quitting-chancellor-race/|website=The Telegraph}}</ref> The party chose Alexander Gauland, a stark conservative who worked as an editor and was a former member of the CDU,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wehner|first1=Markus|title=AfD-Vizechef im Porträt - Die drei Leben des Alexander Gauland |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/portraets-personalien/afd-vizechef-die-drei-leben-des-alexander-gauland-13442469.html|website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|language=german}}</ref> to lead the party in the elections.

In the 2017 German federal elections, the AfD won 12.6% of the vote and received 94 seats; this was the first time it had won seats in the [[Bundestag]].<ref name=GB2017results/><ref name=Wahlrecht2017/> It won three constituency seats, which would have been enough to qualify for proportionally-elected seats in any event. Under a long-standing law intended to benefit regional parties, any party that wins at least three constituency seats qualifies for its share of proportionally-elected seats, regardless of vote share.

===Split-off parties===
At a press conference held by AfD the day after the election, Petry said that she would participate in the Bundestag as an independent; she said she did this because extremist statements by some members made it impossible for AfD to function as a constructive opposition, and to make clear to voters that there is internal dissent in the AfD. She also said that she would be leaving the party at some future date.<ref name=DW2017-09>{{cite news|title=Frauke Petry, co-chair of the far-right AfD, to quit the party {{!}} Germany|url=http://www.dw.com/en/frauke-petry-co-chair-of-the-far-right-afd-to-quit-the-party/a-40686693|work=Deutsche Welle|ref=26 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Elwazer|first1=Schams|last2=Clarke|first2=Hilary|title=German far-right party AfD in disarray|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/europe/german-election-result-afd-walkout/index.html|work=CNN}}</ref> Petry formed the [[Blue Party (Germany)|Blue Party]] in September 2017.

In 2018, [[André Poggenburg]], the AfD's regional leader of the eastern [[Saxony-Anhalt]] state, resigned his post after making racist remarks concerning Turks and immigrants with dual citizenship. Poggenburg gave as reasons for his resignation a shift to the left in the AfD when it jettisoned from extremists in order to appear more moderate to voters. In 2019, Poggenburg started a new far-right party, ''[[Aufbruch deutscher Patrioten – Mitteldeutschland]]'' ("Dawn of German Patriots", AdP), which planned to field candidates in state elections in [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Brandenburg]] in Fall 2019. In August 2019, party founder Poggenburg left the AdP because his internal call to support the AfD in the upcoming state elections of fall 2019 was denied.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.compact-online.de/sensation-poggenburg-verlaesst-seine-eigene-partei-und-ruft-zur-wahl-der-afd-auf/ |title=Sensation: Poggenburg verlässt seine eigene Partei und ruft zur Wahl der AfD auf |trans-title=Sensation: Poggenburg leaves his own party and calls for the election of the AfD |work=Compact |language=de}}</ref>

In March 2020, the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] ({{lang-de|Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz}}) classified the far-right nationalistic faction known as ''[[Der Flügel]]'' as "a right-wing extremist endeavor against the free democratic basic order" and as "not compatible with the Basic Law" and therefore placed it under intelligence surveillance.<ref>https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/presse/pm-20200312-bfv-stuft-afd-teilorganisation-der-fluegel-als-gesichert-rechtsextremistische-bestrebung-ein</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Verfassungsschutz stuft "Flügel" als rechtsextrem ein - DER SPIEGEL - Politik|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/afd-verfassungsschutz-stuft-fluegel-als-beobachtungsfall-ein-a-1436d2da-ded7-4c62-9209-3ab648d104cf|url-status=|format=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=DER SPIEGEL|date=|year=|language=de|pages=|quote=}}</ref>

=== German nationalism ===
Over time, a focus on [[German nationalism]], on reclaiming Germany's sovereignty and national pride, especially in repudiation of Germany's culture of shame with regard to its [[Nazism|Nazi]] past, became more central in AfD's ideology and a central plank in its populist appeals.<ref name=NYT2017-01/><ref name=Duke/><ref name=Spiegel2016-03/>

For example: Petry, who led the moderate wing of the party, said that Germany should reclaim the German word "[[völkisch]]" from its Nazi connotations,<ref>{{cite news|title='Nazi word' revived by German AfD chief|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37337927|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2016}}</ref> while Björn Höcke, who is an example of the more right-wing or [[National conservatism|national conservative]] ideology, regularly speaks of the ''"Vaterland"'' ("father land") and ''"Volk"'' ('nation', 'people', but with a strong ethnic/racial connotation).<ref name=NYT2017-01/>

In January 2017, Höcke in a speech stated, in reference to the [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe|Berlin Holocaust Memorial]]: "Germans are the only people in the world who plant a monument of shame in the heart of the capital" and criticized this "laughable policy of coming to terms with the past".<ref>{{cite news | title=German AfD rightist triggers fury with Holocaust memorial comments | first=Madeline | last=Chambers | newspaper=Reuters | date=18 January 2017 | accessdate=7 March 2018 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-afd/german-afd-rightist-triggers-fury-with-holocaust-memorial-comments-idUSKBN1521H3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=German AfD politician 'attacks Holocaust memorial' and says Germans should be more positive about Nazi past | first=Lizzie | last=Dearden | newspaper=Independent | date=19 January 2017 | accessdate=7 March 2018 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-afd-bjoern-hoecke-berlin-holocaust-memorial-shame-history-positive-nazi-180-turnaround-a7535306.html}}</ref> Höcke continued that Germany should make a "180 degree" turn with regard to its sense of national pride.<ref name=NYT2017-01/>

=== Immigration ===

Former leader Petry said in March 2016: "I'm not against immigration, but (...) the economic and social consequences of migration on both home and host countries are equally momentous (...)

Because the 2013 federal election was the first attempt to join by the party, the AfD had not received any federal funds in the run-up to it,<ref name="Winand">{{cite news|last=Petterdorff-Campen|first=Winand von|title="Alternative für Deutschland" Haste mal 'ne Mark?|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/alternative-fuer-deutschland-haste-mal-ne-mark-12156430.html|accessdate=21 September 2013|date=21 April 2013|language=German}}</ref> but after receiving 2 million votes it crossed the threshold for party funding and was expected to receive an estimated 1.3 to 1.5 million Euros per year of state subsidies.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article120476123/Verzaehlt-Nachschlag-fuer-die-AfD-in-Frankfurt.html Verzählt – Nachschlag für die AfD in Frankfurt (in German, Subsidies for AfD).] Die Welt. 28 September 2013</ref> After joining the parliament after the election of 2017 with more than 90 representatives, the party received more than 70 million Euros per year. This will probably rise to more than 100 million Euros per year from 2019 onward.

In 2018 the [[Alternative for Germany donation scandal]] became public, the federal and European politicians Alice Weidel, Jörg Meuthen, Marcus Pretzell and Guido Reil had profited from illegal and unnamed donations from non-EU-countries. The acceptance of donations from non-EU countries is prohibited for German parties and politicians.

In August 2013, critics from far-left anti-fascist anarchists to the mainstream [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Green Party]] accused AfD of peddling in xenophobic and nationalistic sentiments.<ref name="Heine">{{cite news|last=Heine|first=Friederike|title=Hard Knocks for Anti-Euro Party|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/anti-euro-party-alternative-for-germany-faces-violent-threats-from-left-wing-activists-a-916531.html|accessdate=15 August 2013|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=14 August 2013}}</ref> This ultimately led to the AfD complaining over incidents of verbal abuse and violence to its campaigners in Berlin, [[Lübeck]], [[Nuremberg]] and the university city of [[Göttingen]].<ref name="Heine" /> Incidents in Göttingen flared after a party conference on 1 August, with police intervening later in the month in an attempted garage arson attack (in which there was said to be a car filled with AfD campaign literature) and to break up a dispute between the AfD and members of the [[Green Youth (Germany)|Green Youth]].<ref name="Heine" /> Party leader Bernd Lucke described the events as a "slap in the face for every person who supports democracy" with the party in Lower Saxony left questioning whether to abandon their campaign in the state as local pub and restaurant owners denied the party access to their venues fearing for their businesses.<ref name="Heine" />

On 24 August 2013, Lucke and 16 other party members were reported to have been attacked in [[Bremen]] by opponents who used pepper spray and pushed Lucke from the stage. Initial reports by party officials and the police suggested that they were left-wing extremists, and that about eight out of 20–25 attackers had succeeded in getting onto the stage. It was reported that a campaign worker had been cut with a knife. Later the police indicated that the number of people was probably around 10, of whom only two were known to have gained access to the stage, that only one of the opponents was known to be a left wing activist, and that the minor cut sustained by a campaign worker was probably not caused by a knife and was incurred later when attempting to apprehend a fleeing attacker.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nwzonline.de/bremen/angriff-auf-afd-chef-uebertrieben-dargestellt_a_8,3,1571418366.html|title= Angriff auf AfD-Chef übertrieben dargestellt}}</ref>

Referring to an initiative for an [[LGBT]] specific sex education in elementary school, Petry had asked on her social media presence if [[homophobia]] was such a common prejudice among third and fourth grade children, that it would be necessary to confront them with it.

They charged that the images' use violated their human dignity protected under the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/schaubuehne-berlin-fear-siegt-ueber-die-angst-von-afd-und-pegida/12727778.html|title=Fear siegt ueber die Angst von AfD und Pegida|work= Tagespiele}}</ref> On 15 December 2015, the court ruled against the complainants in favour of the theatre's freedom of expression and lifted the injunctions against using the images.

''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' reports that among 396 AfD candidates for the 2017 Bundestag, 47 candidates have not distanced themselves from right-wing extremism. Although a large proportion of the candidates are not openly racist, some relativize Germany's role in World War II or call for the recognition of a "Cult of Guilt". 30 candidates tolerate right-wing friends in their profile or are themselves members of groups associated with such people. Others mourn the [[German Reich]] or use their symbols.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stern|title=SPD fällt in Umfrage auf 20 Prozent |url= http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/wahl-2017--spd-faellt-in-umfrage-auf-20-prozent-7428928.html |accessdate=15 September 2017|agency= Stern|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

=== Pegida ===
In response to the [[Pegida]] movement and demonstrations, members of AfD have expressed different opinions of it, with Lucke describing the movement as "a sign that these people do not feel their concerns are understood by politicians".<ref name="Huggler14">{{cite news|last1= Huggler|first1= Justin|title= German Eurosceptics embrace anti-Islam protests|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11285422/German-Eurosceptics-embrace-anti-Islam-protests.html|accessdate= 16 December 2014|work= The Daily Telegraph|date= 10 December 2014}}</ref> In response to the CDU Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]] alleging an "overlap" between Pegida rallies and the AfD, Alexander Gauland stated that the AfD are "natural allies of this movement".<ref>{{cite news|last1= Withnall|first1= Adam|title= Germany sees 'visible rise' in support for far-right extremism in response to perceived 'Islamisation' of the West|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-sees-visible-rise-in-support-for-farright-extremism-in-response-to-perceived-islamisation-of-the-west-9926264.html|accessdate= 17 December 2014|work= The Independent|date= 15 December 2014}}</ref> However, Hans-Olaf Henkel asked members of the party not to join the demonstrations, telling ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'' that he believed it could not be ruled out that they had "xenophobic or even racist connotations".<ref name="Huggler14" /> A straw poll by ''[[The Economist]]'' found that nine out of ten Pegida protesters would back the AfD.<ref>{{cite news

=== Anti-communism ===
In May 2018, the statue of the founding father of communism [[Karl Marx]], donated by the [[Government of China|Chinese government]], was unveiled in Karl Marx's hometown of [[Trier, Germany]].

As a result of his speech, the leaders of the AfD have asked in February 2017 that Björn Höcke be expelled from the party.
