'''AllMusic''' (previously known as '''All Music Guide''' and '''AMG''') is an American [[online database|online music database]]. It catalogs more than 3 million [[album]] entries and 30 million tracks, as well as information on [[Musical artist|musicians]] and [[Musical ensemble|bands]]. Initiated in 1991, the database was first made available on the Internet in 1994.<ref name="Wired" /><ref name="Metro" /> AllMusic is owned by [[RhythmOne]].

==History==
AllMusic was launched as ''All Music Guide'' by [[Michael Erlewine]], a "compulsive archivist, noted astrologer,  Buddhist scholar and musician".  He  became interested in using computers for his astrological work in the mid-1970s and founded a software company, Matrix, in 1977. In the early 1990s, as CDs replaced vinyl as the dominant format for recorded music, Erlewine purchased what he thought was a CD of early recordings by [[Little Richard]]. After buying it he discovered it was a "flaccid latter-day rehash".<ref name="Metro" /> Frustrated with the labeling, he researched using [[metadata]] to create a music guide.<ref name="Videoland book">{{cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=Daniel|title=Videoland: Movie Culture at the American Video Store|date=January 24, 2014|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0520279636|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV98AgAAQBAJ&q=All+Music+Guide+Michael+Erlewine+founded+astrologer&pg=PA209|accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref> In 1990, in [[Big Rapids, Michigan]], he founded All Music Guide with a goal to create an open access database that included every recording "since [[Enrico Caruso]] gave the industry its first big boost".<ref name="Wired" />

The first ''All Music Guide'', published in 1992, was a 1,200-page reference book, packaged with a CD-ROM,  titled ''All Music Guide: The Best CDs, Albums & Tapes: The Expert's Guide to the Best Releases from Thousands of Artists in All Types of Music''.<ref name="world cat first ed">{{cite book|title=Formats and Editions of All Music Gude|publisher=World Cat|oclc=31186749}}</ref> Its first online version, in 1994, was a text-based [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] site.<ref name="Wired" /><ref name="Vice history">{{cite news|last1=Nosowitz|first1=Dan|title=The Story of AllMusic, Which Predates the World Wide Web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-internets-most-complete-guide-to-music|accessdate=June 22, 2017|work=Vice|date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> It moved to the [[World Wide Web]] as [[Web browser|web browsers]] became more user-friendly.<ref name="Metro" />

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:All Music Homepage circa 1999.jpg|thumb|left|Allmusic.com homepage as it appeared in 1999]]  -->Erlewine hired a database engineer, Vladimir Bogdanov, to design the All Music Guide framework, and recruited his nephew, writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], to develop editorial content. In 1993, Chris  Woodstra joined the staff as an engineer.  A "record geek" who had written for alternative weeklies and fanzines, his main qualification was an "encyclopedic knowledge of music".<ref name="Metro" /> 1,400 subgenres of music were created, a feature which became central to the site's utility.  In a 2016 article in ''Tedium'', Ernie Smith wrote: "AllMusic may have been one of most ambitious sites of the early-internet era—and it’s one that is fundamental to our understanding of pop culture. Because, the thing is, it doesn’t just track reviews or albums. It tracks styles, genres, and subgenres, along with the tone of the music and the platforms on which the music is sold. It then connects that data together, in a way that can intelligently tell you about an entire type of music, whether a massive genre like classical, or a tiny one like sadcore."<ref name="big data smith">{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Ernie|title=The Big Data Jukebox|url=http://tedium.co/2016/09/20/allmusic-database-historic-importance/|website=tedium.com|publisher=Tedium|accessdate=July 26, 2017|date=September 20, 2016}}</ref>

In 1996, seeking to further develop its web-based businesses, Alliance Entertainment Corp. bought All Music from Erlewine for a reported $3.5 million. He left the company after its sale.<ref name="Metro" /> Alliance filed for bankruptcy in 1999, and its assets were acquired by [[Ron Burkle]]'s Yucaipa Equity Fund.<ref name="Videoland book" />

In 1999, All Music relocated from Big Rapids to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], where the staff expanded from 12 to 100 people.<ref name="Metro" />
By February of that year, 350,000 albums and 2 million tracks had been cataloged. All Music had published biographies of 30,000 artists, 120,000 record reviews and 300 essays written by "a hybrid of historians, critics and passionate collectors".<ref name="Weisbard Voice">{{cite news|last1=Weisbard|first1=Eric|title=Conjunction Junction|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/1999/02/23/conjunction-junction/|accessdate=July 22, 2017|work=Village Voice|date=February 23, 1999}}</ref><ref name="NPR">{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Ann|title=Digital Underground Who Will Make Sure The Internet's Vast Musical Archive Doesn't Disappear?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/03/411666224/digital-underground|accessdate=July 20, 2017|work=NPR|date=June 3, 2015}}</ref>

In late 2007, AllMusic was purchased for $72 million by [[TiVo Corporation]] (known as Macrovision at the time of the sale, and as Rovi from 2009 until 2016).<ref>{{cite web|title=Focus Article: Rovi Corporation|url=http://www.insidearbitrage.com/2012/10/weekly-focus-article-rovi-corporation-rovi/|website=insidearbitrage.com|publisher=Inside Arbitrage|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, AllMusic was purchased by BlinkX (later known as [[RhythmOne]]).<ref>{{cite news | title = Blinkx Acquires Website Owner All Media Network For Undisclosed Amount | publisher =London South East| date = April 16, 2015 | url = http://www.lse.co.uk/AllNews.asp?code=64stlp40&headline=Blinkx_Acquires_Website_Owner_All_Media_Network_For_Undisclosed_Amount}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://investor.rhythmone.com/newsroom/2015/04/16/blinkx-acquires-all-media-network-llc|title=BLINKX ACQUIRES ALL MEDIA NETWORK, LLC - Newsroom - RhythmOne|website=investor.rhythmone.com|access-date=January 15, 2019}}</ref>
