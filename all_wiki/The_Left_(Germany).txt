Since 2012, The Left's co-[[chairperson]]s have been [[Katja Kipping]] and [[Bernd Riexinger]]. The party currently holds 69 seats out of 709 in the [[Bundestag]], the federal legislature of Germany, having won 9.2% of votes cast in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]]. Its parliamentary group is the fifth largest of six in the Bundestag, and is headed by parliamentary co-leaders [[Amira Mohamed Ali]] and [[Dietmar Bartsch]].

The party is represented in ten of Germany's sixteen state legislatures, including all five of the [[New states of Germany|eastern states]]. The party currently participates in governments in the states of both [[Berlin]] and [[Bremen]], where it is a junior partner in a three-party coalition with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]], as well as in [[Thuringia]], where it leads a coalition with the SPD and Greens, headed by Minister-President [[Bodo Ramelow]].

The Left is a founding member of the [[Party of the European Left]], and is the third largest party in the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) group in the [[European Parliament]]. In September 2019, The Left had 61,055 registered members, making it the sixth largest party in Germany by membership.<ref name="membership"/>

The party is the most [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] party of the six represented in the [[Bundestag]].

==History==
===Background===
{{mainarticle|Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)}}
The main predecessor of The Left was the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which emerged from the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) of East Germany. In October 1989, facing increasing unpopularity, the SED replaced long-time leader [[Erich Honecker]] with [[Egon Krenz]], who began a program of limited reforms, including the legalisation of opposition groups. He also loosened restrictions on travel between East and West Berlin, which inadvertently led to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and his resignation. He was succeeded by [[Gregor Gysi]], part of a group of reformers who supported the [[Peaceful Revolution]]. His ally [[Hans Modrow]], the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, became the ''de facto'' national leader. Seeking to change its image, the party expelled most of its former leadership, including Honecker and Krenz; the new government negotiated with opposition groups and arranged free elections. The SED adopted the name Party of Democratic Socialism and oriented itself as pro-democratic, socialist, and supportive of East German sovereignty. The party chose Modrow as its lead candidate for the [[1990 East German general election|March 1990 election]]. They were decisively defeated, finishing in third place with 16.4% of votes cast. The PDS was excluded from further political developments due to the aversion of the opposition, now in power, who considered them essentially tied to the dictatorship.<ref>Mary Elise Sarotte, ''1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe'' (Second Edition) Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014</ref>

After debuting with a meagre 2.4% nationwide in the [[1990 German federal election|1990 federal election]] post-reunification, the PDS gained popularity throughout the 1990s as a protest party in the eastern states. By the 2000s, it was the second largest party in every eastern state legislature except Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]], it won 5.1% of votes, enough to win seats outright without relying on direct constituencies as it had in 1994. Despite electoral successes, the PDS faced internal strife due to ideological disputes, a chronic decline in membership, and a near-complete lack of support in the western states (home to 85% of Germany's population).

===PDS–WASG alliance===
[[File:Oskar Lafontaine and Gregor Gysi election poster.jpg|thumb|A poster for The Left.PDS featuring [[Gregor Gysi]] and [[Oskar Lafontaine]], posted in [[Berlin]] during the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]].]]
In January 2005, a group of disaffected [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and trade unionists founded [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative]] (WASG), a left-wing party opposed to federal Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s ''[[Agenda 2010]]'' labour and welfare reforms. The party made a modest showing of 2.2% in the [[2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia state election]] in May, but failed to win seats. The election saw the incumbent SPD government defeated in a landslide, which was widely interpreted as a sign of the federal SPD's unpopularity. Chancellor Schröder subsequently called an early federal election to be held September.

WASG continued to gain members, prompting the PDS leadership to propose an alliance between the two parties. With the established eastern base of the PDS and WASG's potential for growth in the west, the parties hoped to enter the Bundestag together. They agreed to form an electoral pact, in which they would not run against one another in direct constituencies and would create joint [[electoral list]]s featuring candidates from both parties. They also agreed to unify into a single party in 2007. To symbolise the new relationship, the PDS renamed itself the Left Party.PDS ({{lang-de|Linkspartei.PDS}}). The joint list ran under the name The Left.PDS ({{lang-de|Die Linke.PDS}}), though in the western states, where the PDS was shunned for its association with the GDR, "PDS" was optional. The alliance's profile was greatly boosted when former federal Minister of Finance [[Oskar Lafontaine]], who had left the SPD after the North Rhine-Westphalia election, joined WASG in June. He was chosen as the party's lead candidate for the federal election and shared the spotlight with Gregor Gysi of the PDS.

Polls early in the summer showed the unified Left list winning as much as 12 percent of the vote, and for a time it seemed possible the party would surge past the Greens and FDP and become the third-largest party in the Bundestag. During the campaign, the party was subject to frequent criticism. At one event, Oskar Lafontaine described ''fremdarbeiter'' ("foreign workers", a term associated with the Nazi regime) as a threat to German labour. He claimed to have misspoken, but in an article published in ''[[Die Welt]]'', a group of prominent German writers accused him of deliberately appealing to [[xenophobic]] and [[far-right]] voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/241.html|title=Writers warn about Linkspartei|publisher=signandsight |date=1 July 2005 |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>

In the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], the Left.PDS easily passed the electoral threshold, winning 8.7% of the vote and 53 seats. It became the fourth largest party in the Bundestag. The result of the election was inconclusive; between the SPD, Greens, and Left.PDS, left-wing parties held a majority, but the SPD was unwilling to cooperate with the Left.PDS. The result was a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] of the CDU and SPD.

===Foundation of The Left===
Negotiations for a formal merger of the PDS and WASG continued through the next year until a final agreement was reached on 27 March 2007. The new party, called The Left (''Die Linke''), held its founding congress in Berlin on 16 June 2007. [[Lothar Bisky]] and Oskar Lafontaine were elected as co-leaders, while Gregor Gysi became leader of the party's Bundestag group.

The unified party quickly became a serious force in western Germany for the first time. It comfortably surpassed the electoral threshold in [[2007 Bremen state election|Bremen in 2007]], and throughout 2008 won seats in [[2008 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxony]], [[2008 Hessian state election|Hesse]] and [[2008 Hamburg state election|Hamburg]]. The "five-party system" in Germany was now a reality in the west as well as the east.

A string of electoral successes followed during the "super election year" of 2009. The Left achieved 7.5% in the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|European elections]], confirming their enduring nationwide popularity. Six state elections were held throughout the year, and in each of them the party either surged ahead or consolidated earlier gains. They saw an upswing in [[2009 Thuringia state election|Thuringia]] and [[2009 Hessian state election|Hesse]] and won seats for the first time in [[2009 Schleswig-Holstein state election|Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[2009 Saarland state election|Saarland]]. Oskar Lafontaine ran as the party's lead candidate in Saarland, leading the party to a massive success with 21.3% of the vote. In [[2009 Saxony state election|Saxony]] and [[2009 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]], The Left's vote declined slightly, but it remained the second largest party in both states.

===2009 federal election===
[[File:Bundestag 2009 Linke.svg|thumb|Results for the second votes by constituency in the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]].]]
The electoral collapse of the Social Democratic Party in the [[2009 German federal election|federal election]] on 27 September 2009 saw The Left's vote surge to 11.9%, increasing its representation in the Bundestag from 54 to 76 seats, just under half as large as the SPD's parliamentary group. It became the second most popular party in the eastern states with 28.5%, while experiencing a breakthrough in the west with 8.3%. It was the most popular party in Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, and won sixteen direct constituencies, the largest tally by a minor party in history. The Left nonetheless remained in opposition.

The Left won seats in the parliament of Germany's most populous state, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], in the [[2010 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|May 2010 election]]. They now held seats in thirteen of Germany's sixteen states, only absent from three states in the traditionally conservative south.

In January 2010, Oskar Lafontaine announced that, due to his ongoing cancer treatment, he would not seek re-election to the party leadership at the upcoming party congress. At the congress in May, Lothar Bisky also chose not to nominate for re-election; [[Klaus Ernst]] and [[Gesine Lötzsch]] were elected as the party's new leaders.

Just a few weeks later, the SPD and Greens invited the Left to support their candidate for the [[2010 German presidential election|2010 presidential election]], former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] [[Joachim Gauck]]. They suggested that this was an opportunity for the Left to leave their communist past behind them and show unconditional support for democracy.<ref>{{cite web|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-06/gauck-linkspartei|title=Präsidentenwahl: Linke, wählt Gauck!|publisher=Zeit.de |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> However, the party refused to support him, highlighting his support of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and his attacks on their party.<ref>[http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Linke-ist-gegen-Gauck-article942387.html "Nicht wählbar": Linke ist gegen Gauck], n-tv, 28 June 2010</ref> They also rejected the conservative [[Christian Wulff]], favourite of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]],<ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,703784,00.html Linke verhindert Gauck, Wulff wird Präsident], Manager Magazin</ref> instead putting forward their own nominee, television journalist [[Luc Jochimsen]].<ref>{{cite web|author=von Markus Ehrenberg|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/medien/tagesschau-luc-jochimsen-oder-doch-lukrezia/1854908.html |title=Tagesschau: Luc Jochimsen?

The party was isolated ahead of the [[2012 German presidential election|March 2012 presidential election]]. The federal CDU/CSU–FDP government invited the SPD and Greens to agree on an all-party consensus candidate; The Left was excluded. Those invited eventually agreed to support Joachim Gauck. The Left again refused to support him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/gauck-als-wulff-nachfolger-linke-schimpft-ueber-kandidat-der-kalten-herzen/6232216.html |title=Bundesversammlung: Gauck soll am 18.

She received 10.2% of the delegate votes. Gauck was elected in the first round with 80.4% of votes.

The Left's fortunes began to turn in 2011, and they suffered a string of setbacks and defeats through 2013, particularly in the western states. They failed to win seats in [[2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election|Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[2011 Baden-Württemberg state election|Baden-Württemberg]], and suffered losses in [[2011 Bremen state election|Bremen]], [[2011 Berlin state election|Berlin]], and [[2012 Saarland state election|Saarland]]. Crucially, the party lost its seats in the Landtags of [[2012 Schleswig-Holstein state election|Schleswig-Holstein]], [[2012 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North-Rhine Westphalia]], and [[2013 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxony]].

On 11 April 2012, Gesine Lötzsch resigned as party co-leader, citing medical conditions her husband was suffering. Klaus Ernst subsequently announced he would not seek re-election as leader at the party congress in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/loetzsch158.html|title=Linkspartei diskutiert über Lötzsch-Nachfolge |publisher=tagesschau.de |date=13 January 2012|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> [[Katja Kipping]], who had served as deputy leader since 2007, was elected as co-leader with 67.1% of votes.

===2013 federal election===
[[File:Btw13 linke zweit endgueltig.svg|thumb|Results for the second votes by constituency in the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]].]]
In the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal election]], The Left received 8.6% of the national vote and won 64 seats, a decline from 2009. However, due to the collapse of the FDP, they moved into third place. After the formation of a second grand coalition between the CDU and SPD, The Left became the leading party of the opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_13/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html|title=Final result of the Election to the German Bundestag 2013|work=The [[Federal Returning Officer]]|accessdate=23 September 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925024908/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_13/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html|archive-date=25 September 2013}}</ref>

The party narrowly retained its seats in the [[2013 Hessian state election|Hessian state election]] held on the same day as the federal election. The Left suffered a major loss in [[2014 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]] in 2014, losing a third of its voteshare and falling to third place. Nonetheless, it continued as a junior partner under the SPD.

The [[2014 Thuringian state election]] was the party's biggest success to date, achieving not only its best state election result (28.2%) but also forming the first coalition with one of its own members at the head. The party was able to negotiate a [[Red–green alliance#Red–red–green coalition|red-red-green coalition]] with the SPD and Greens, and [[Bodo Ramelow]] was elected [[List of Ministers-President of Thuringia|Minister-President]] by the [[Landtag of Thuringia]], becoming the first member of the party to serve as head of government of any German state.

The Left achieved modest gains in the city-states of [[2015 Hamburg state election|Hamburg]] and [[2015 Bremen state election|Bremen]] in 2015. They suffered a loss in [[2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election|Saxony-Anhalt]] reminiscent of that in Brandenburg 18 months earlier earlier, falling to third place and losing a third of their voteshare. In September, the Left joined government in [[Berlin]] after the [[2016 Berlin state election|2016 state election]] as the second-largest member of a coalition with the SPD and Greens.

===2017 federal election===
[[File:Karte btw linke17z endg.svg|thumb|Results for the second votes by constituency in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].]]
In the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]], The Left made small gains, but nonetheless fell to fifth place due to the re-entry of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] in fourth place and the ascension of [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] to third place.

Throughout 2017, they failed to make a comeback to the Landtags of [[2017 Schleswig-Holstein state election|Schleswig-Holstein]], [[2017 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia]], and [[2017 Lower Saxony state election|Lower Saxony]], despite making gains in all three states. The party's slow decline in [[2017 Saarland state election|Saarland]] continued, winning 12.8% in March. In 2018, they defended their seats in [[2018 Hessian state election|Hesse]]. Kipping and Riexinger were re-elected for a third time at the party congress in 2018, winning 64.5% and 73.8% respectively.<ref name="Parteitag2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article177265132/Parteitag-in-Leipzig-Kipping-und-Riexinger-als-Linken-Vorsitzende-wiedergewaehlt.html|title=Kipping und Riexinger als Linken-Vorsitzende wiedergewählt|date=9 June 2018}}</ref>

The Left had mixed results in 2019. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|European election]], they declined to 5.5%, the worst result in a national election since the party's formation. In the [[2019 Bremen state election|Bremen state election]] held on the same day, the party made small gains, and joined a western state government for the first time in a coalition under the SPD and Greens. The Left suffered major losses in the [[2019 Brandenburg state election|Brandenburg]] and [[2019 Saxony state election|Saxony]] state elections held on 1 September, losing almost half its voteshare in each. As a result, The Left left the Brandenburg government, in which they had participated since 2009.

In October however, Bodo Ramelow led the party to its best ever result in the [[2019 Thuringian state election|Thuringian state election]], winning 31.0% and becoming the largest party in a state legislature for the first time, though his red-red-green government lost its majority. In February 2020, the FDP's [[Thomas Kemmerich]] was elected Minister-President with the support of [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], but immediately resigned due to widespread outrage. After a protracted [[2019 Thuringian state election#Government formation|government crisis]], Ramelow was re-elected for a second term to lead a minority government.

In August 2020, Kipping and Riesinger announced they would not run for re-election as party co-chairs. As they were first elected in 2012, this announcement was in line with party regulations stating that no position should be held by the same person for more than eight years. Speculated potential successors include Thuringia branch leader [[Susanne Hennig-Wellsow]] and Hessian parliamentary leader [[Janine Wissler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germany-both-leaders-of-socialist-left-party-to-quit/a-54752073|title=Germany: Both leaders of socialist Left Party to quit|date=29 August 2020|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref> A party congress was scheduled on 30 October to 1 November 2020, but was cancelled on 27 October due to the worsening of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.die-linke.de/partei/parteistruktur/parteitag/erfurter-parteitag-2020|title=Erfurt Party Congress 2020|publisher=The Left}}</ref> The party will instead hold a "decentralised" party congress in February 2021, in which a series of small conventions will submit delegates to take part in a digital conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.die-linke.de/start/presse/detail/linke-beschliesst-dezentralen-bundesparteitag/|title=LINKE decides on a decentralized federal party conference|date=7 November 2020|publisher=The Left}}</ref>

==Ideology==
The Left aims for [[democratic socialism]] in order to overcome [[capitalism]]. As a platform for left politics in the wake of [[globalization]], The Left includes many different factions, ranging from [[communism|communists]] to [[social democracy|social democrats]]. In March 2007, during the joint party convention of Left Party and WASG, a document outlining political principles was agreed on. The official program of the party was decided upon by an overwhelming majority at the party conference in October 2011 in Erfurt, Thuringia.

The party's fiscal policies are based on [[Keynesian economics]], originating from the 1930s when governments responded to the [[Great Depression]]. The central bank and government should collaborate with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in order to ameliorate [[business cycle]]s, to support economic growth, and to reduce unemployment. Wage rises in the private sector should be determined through the productivity growth, the target inflation rate of the [[European Central Bank]], and [[Master contract (labor)|master contract]]s.

The party aims at increasing [[government spending]] in the areas of public investments, education, research and development, culture, and infrastructure, as well as increasing taxes for large [[corporations]]. It calls for increases in [[inheritance tax]] rates and the reinstatement of the individual "net worth" tax. The Left aims at a linear [[income tax]] progression, which would reduce the tax burden for lower incomes, while raising the middle- and top-income tax rates. The combating of tax loopholes is a perennial issue, as The Left believes that they primarily benefit people with high incomes.

The financial markets should be subject to heavier government regulation, with the goal, among others, to reduce the speculation of bonds and derivatives. The party wants to strengthen [[Competition law|anti-trust laws]] and empower [[cooperatives]] to decentralise the economy. Further economic reforms shall include solidarity and more self-determination for workers, a ban on [[hydraulic fracturing|gas and oil fracking]], the rejection of privatization and the introduction of a federal [[minimum wage]],<ref name=BBCLeft>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8272658.stm|title=German hard left set to gain ground |author=Steve Rosenberg  |publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> and more generally the overthrow of property and power structures in which, citing [[Karl Marx]]'s aphorism, "man is a debased, enslaved, abandoned, despicable essence".<ref>"''Our alternative: Social, democratic and peacemaking reforms to overcome capitalism''" [http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/international/programmatic_points.pdf Programmatic Points, part III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210617/http://die-linke.de/fileadmin/download/international/programmatic_points.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Concerning foreign policy, The Left calls for international [[disarmament]], while ruling out any form of involvement of the [[Bundeswehr]] outside of Germany. The party calls for a replacement of [[NATO]] with a collective security system including [[Russia]] as a member country. They believe that German foreign policy should be strictly confined to the goals of civil diplomacy and cooperation, instead of confrontation.

The Left supports further debt cancellations for developing countries and increases in development aid, in collaboration with the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[World Bank]], and diverse bilateral treaties among countries. The party supports [[reform of the United Nations]] as long as it is aimed at a fair balance between developed and developing countries. The Left would have all American military bases within Germany, and if possible in the [[European Union]], enacted within a binding treaty, dissolved. The Left welcomes the European process of integration, while opposing what it believes to be [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies in the European Union. The party strives for the democratisation of the EU institutions and a stronger role of the United Nations in international politics. The Left opposed both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and in [[Iraq War|Iraq]],<ref name=BBCLeft/> as well as the [[Lisbon Treaty]].<ref name="euractiv lisbon treaty">{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/bundestag-paves-way-lisbon-treaty-ratification/article-185252?Ref=RSS|title=Bundestag paves way for Lisbon Treaty ratification|publisher=EurActive.com|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609230050/http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/bundestag-paves-way-lisbon-treaty-ratification/article-185252?Ref=RSS|archive-date=9 June 2011}}</ref>

The party has a mixed stance towards the [[Ukrainian crisis]]. [[Gregor Gysi]] has described Russia as "state capitalist", and the party has called the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] and [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine]] "illegal". However, Gysi has noted that "older" elements of the party have a strong penchant for Russia and the Soviet Union.<ref name="test">[http://www.israelcfr.com/documents/gregor-gysi.pdf Gregor Gysi.

[[File:Katja Kipping und Bernd Riexinger. Leipzig 2018 (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|[[Katja Kipping]] (left) and [[Bernd Riexinger]] (right) at the 2018 federal party conference.]]
The party is organised into branches in each of the 16 [[States of Germany|states]]. The party has smaller branches on a local level, for which the corresponding state branches are responsible. These branches usually organise across a [[Districts of Germany|district]], larger city, or (in [[Berlin]]), [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|borough]]. The lowest unit of the party is the grassroots organization, which, depending on the density of membership, can include a residential area, a city or an entire district. In addition to these regional associations, there are [[working groups]], interest groups and commissions working at the federal level, and partly at the state and district levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.die-linke.de/partei/parteistruktur/kommissionen/|title=Kommissionen|publisher=The Left}}</ref>

The highest organ of The Left is the Party Congress. It discusses and determines the party platform, and rules on basic political and organisational matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.die-linke.de/party/party-congress/|title=Party Congress|publisher=The Left}}</ref> The most recent Party Congress was held on 22 to 24 February 2019. It elects the party executive, the 44-member Party Executive Committee (PEC), of which ten are members of the party's leadership, the Executive Board. Since June 2018, the PEC's composition has been as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.die-linke.de/party/executive-committee/2018-2020/members/|title=Members|publisher=The Left}}</ref>

The Council of Elders (''Ältestenrat'') is an advisory body formed in December 2007. Lothar Bisky stated the Council will "focus on the development of the party, allied and international issues, the history of the left and possible consequences for the socialist program."

==Internal caucuses==
The Left Party has a number of internal [[caucus]]es, most often referred to as [[platform (European politics)|platforms]] or forums.
*The '''Anti-capitalist Left''' (''Antikapitalistische Linke, AKL'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antikapitalistische-linke.de/ |title=Willkommen (Netzwerk Antikapitalistische Linke) |publisher=Antikapitalistische-linke.de |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> is a broad group seeking to strengthen the party's anti-capitalist profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antikapitalistische-linke.de/|title=akl Anti-capitalist left|access-date=31 March 2020|publisher=Anti-Capitalist Left}}</ref> They seek cooperation with extra-parliamentary leftist movements, and believe that The Left should only participate in [[coalition government]]s if a set of minimum criteria are met, including no [[privatization]], no involvement in war, and no cuts to social welfare spending. The ''Verfassungsschutz'' classifies the AKL as an "openly extremist" association. As of 2018, the AKL has 1,011 members.<ref name="BfV2018"/> Prominent representatives of this group are [[Tobias Pflüger]], Cornelia Hirsch, and [[Ulla Jelpke]].
*The '''[[Communist Platform (Germany)|Communist Platform]]''' (''Kommunistische Plattform, KPF'') was originally formed as a tendency of the PDS. It is less critical of German Democratic Republic than other groupings, and upholds orthodox Marxist positions. A "strategic goal" of the KPF is "building a new socialist society, using the positive experiences of [[real socialism]] and to learn from mistakes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dielinke-brandenburg.de/fileadmin/Arbeitsgemeinschaften/Beschluss_der_Landeskonferenz_der_KPF.rtf|title=Beschluss der Landeskonferenz der Kommunistischen Plattform der Partei DIE LINKE des Landes Brandenburg vom 29.9.2007}}</ref> Its primary leader is [[Sahra Wagenknecht]], former co-leader of the party's Bundestag faction. In 2018, the group had around 1,200 members,<ref name="BfV2018"/> around 2% of the party's national membership.
*The '''Democratic Socialist Forum''' (''Forum demokratischer Sozialismus, fds'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forum-ds.de/ |title=Wir stehen für emanzipatorische, radikalreformerische Politik sowie den demokratischen Sozialismus |publisher=Forum-ds.de |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] group, considered part of the reformist wing of the party. Originally founded in 2002 as the ''Forum Second Renewal'', it was reformed in 2007 to promote the positions of PDS within the new Left party. It places emphasis on [[civil rights]] and social progressivism, and supports cooperation with the SPD and Greens. The spokesperson for the group is Luise Neuhaus-Wartenberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum-ds.de/?page_id=349|title=Federal Executive Board Democratic Socialism Forum|publisher=Forum Demokatischer Sozialismus}}</ref>
*The '''Ecological Platform''' (''Ökologische Plattform, ÖPF'') is a current which promotes [[green politics]] and [[eco-socialism]]. Founded in 1994 within PDS, it is critical of capitalism and supports [[degrowth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oekologische-plattform.de/uber-uns-seite/|title=About us|publisher=Ecological Platform}}</ref> The group describes itself as "a forum for all left-wing ecologists", and is expressly open to non-Left party members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oekologische-plattform.de/mitgliedschaft/|title=Membership|publisher=Ecological Platform}}</ref>
*The '''Emancipatory Left''' (''Emanzipatorische Linke, Ema.Li'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emanzipatorische-linke.de/ |title=Emanzipatorische Linke |publisher=Emanzipatorische-linke.de |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> is a [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] current co-founded in May 2009 by [[Katja Kipping]], [[Caren Lay]], and [[Julia Bonk]]. It advocates for a decentralized society and is supportive of [[social movement]]s. Besides its co-founders, prominent members of the current include Christoph Spehr and [[Anne Helm (voice actress)|Anne Helm]].
*The '''Gera Dialogue/Socialist Dialogue''' (''Geraer Dialog/Sozialistischer Dialog, GD/SD''), was formed in February 2003 as a reaction to the increasing influence of reform-oriented groups such as the Reform Left Network. They opposed a shift away from Marxism and what they feared as a move toward a [[social market economy]] model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiv2007.sozialisten.de/politik/publikationen/kpf-mitteilungen/view_html/n0/pp1/bs1/zid6450|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064108/http://archiv2007.sozialisten.de/politik/publikationen/kpf-mitteilungen/view_html/n0/pp1/bs1/zid6450|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 March 2016|title=Die Linkspartei - Gera als Weltanschauung|date=4 March 2016}}</ref> The ''Verfassungsschutz'' classifies GD/SD as "openly extremist", and states that the number of members of the group is not known.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/embed/vsbericht-2017.pdf|title=Report 2017|publisher=[[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]}}</ref>
*The '''Marxist Forum''' (''Marxistisches Forum, MF'') was founded in 1995 within PDS, promoting classical [[Marxism]]. It is critical of the reform-oriented wings and positions of the party and is often sympathetic to the GDR. The ''Verfassungsschutz'' classifies the group as "orthodox communist" and [[Far-left politics|left-extremist]]. In 2018, the group had 400 members.<ref name="BfV2018"/> [[Kurt Pätzold]] was a member of the Marxist Forum.
*The '''Reform Left Network''' (''Netzwerk Reformlinke'')<ref name="reformlinke">{{cite web|url=http://archiv2007.sozialisten.de/partei/strukturen/agigs/netzwerk_reformlinke/index.htm|title=Netzwerk Reformlinke|publisher=sozialisten.de|accessdate=25 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226152006/http://archiv2007.sozialisten.de/partei/strukturen/agigs/netzwerk_reformlinke/index.htm|archive-date=26 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> was originally formed in 2003 as a tendency within PDS promoting [[social democracy]]. It is closely associated with the Democratic Socialist Forum, which was formed around the same time. The Reform Left Network strongly supports involvement in coalition governments with the SPD and Greens. It includes a number of prominent Left politicians, including former PDS chairperson and current Bundestag Vice-President [[Petra Pau]], and The Left's Saxony-Anhalt leader Wulf Gallert. Other members include [[Jan Korte (politician)|Jan Korte]], [[Stefan Liebich]], and Halina Wawzyniak.
*The '''[[Socialist Left (Germany)|Socialist Left]]''' (''Sozialistische Linke, SL'') includes [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] leftists and [[Eurocommunism|reform communists]], and seeks to orient the party toward the [[Trade unions in Germany|labour movement]]. The revolutionary socialist current [[Linksruck|Marx21]] organises within SL, as it does not meet the requirements to become its own caucus. Many leaders of the Socialist Left were formerly members of WASG, and the group models itself on the Dutch [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] and the Italian [[Communist Refoundation Party]]. As of 2018, the group has 836 members.<ref name="BfV2018"/> Due to its association with Marx21, SL is monitored by the ''Verfassungsschutz''.<ref name="BfW2018">{{citation|publisher=[[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community]]|title=Verfassungsschutzbericht 2018|url=https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/embed/vsbericht-2018.pdf}}</ref> Leading members include [[Janine Wissler]], [[Thomas Händel]], [[Jürgen Klute]], and [[Christine Buchholz]].
*'''Marx21''' ''(M21)'' promotes [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] and revolutionary positions and rejects working within a government. M21 itself is not recognized as an official caucus by the party leadership, but is organized within the party and especially the Socialist Left.

In addition to the recognised platforms, a number of smaller groups have aligned with The Left and its predecessors, such as the Trotskyist [[Socialist Alternative (Germany)|Socialist Alternative]] (SAV), though the membership applications of some of its leaders, including [[Lucy Redler]], were initially rejected. ''Der Funke'', supporters of the [[International Marxist Tendency]] (IMT) in Germany, pursue [[Entryism|entryist]] strategies in the party, while the [[Fourth International (post-reunification)|Fourth International]]-affiliated [[International Socialist Organisation (Germany)|International Socialist Organisation]] (ISO) also works inside The Left. Other left-wing groups, such as the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP), have formed local alliances with the party, but have not joined. The [[Association for Solidarity Perspectives]] (VsP) also supports the party.

The party has a youth wing ([[Left Youth Solid]]) and a student wing known as The Left.SDS. The party is also affiliated with a number of left-wing [[think tank]]s, education, and policy groups, most prominently the [[Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]].

The PDS inherited 170,000 members from the SED in 1990, but suffered constant decline from that point until the merger with WASG. Upon its formation, The Left had 71,000 members, of which 11,500 had been WASG members. Over the next two years the party grew, reaching a peak of 78,000 in 2009, after which point numbers began to decline. In 2016, the party had 59,000 members. However, the trend reversed in 2017, and the party gained several thousand new members for a total of 62,300.<ref name="BPBorganisation">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/die-linke/42135/organisation|title=Die Organisation der LINKEN|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung}}</ref>

A large part of The Left's base and membership reside in the [[New states of Germany|new states]] (the former GDR). The voting base of the PDS was limited almost entirely to the east; upon its formation, the vast majority of The Left's western membership came from WASG. However, this has been changing in recent years: while in [[2005 German federal election|2005]], the Left.PDS list won just 45.5% of its votes in the western states, this grew to 57.7% in [[2009 German federal election|2009]], and 65.4% in [[2017 German federal election|2017]]. Despite this, on the state level, the party has been marginalised in the west since making several breakthroughs in 2007–2010. Since 2010, it has lost representation in the Landtags of [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Generally growing popularity in the west has also been offset by major losses in most of its eastern heartland since 2014.<ref name="BPBelectorate">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/themen/FB25SL,0,DIE_LINKE_%96_W%E4hlerschaft_und_Mitglieder.html|title=Wahlergebnisse und Wählerschaft der LINKEN|date=16 July 2018|publisher=Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung}}</ref>

Prior to the merger, the voting base of PDS was an approximate cross-section of the population, favoured somewhat by more educated voters. Since the merger, The Left has become more favoured among working-class and poorer voters, which made up the core of WASG's support.<ref name="BPBelectorate"/> According to regular studies by the [[Free University of Berlin]], in 2017 The Left's membership compromised around 19% blue-collar workers, 32% white-collar workers, 34% civil servants, and 16% self-employed. 46% of party members held an academic degree, and 68% were not organized in unions.<ref name="BPBsurvey">{{cite web|url=https://www.bpb.de/politik/grundfragen/parteien-in-deutschland/zahlen-und-fakten/140358/soziale-zusammensetzung|title=Die soziale Zusammensetzung der Parteimitgliederschaften|date=7 October 2017|publisher=Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung}}</ref>

The Left's voter demographics are skewed strongly by region. In the east, Left voters and members trend much older: in 2018, 44% of the party's members in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] were 76 years or older.<ref name="ND2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/1090472.mitgliederentwicklung-der-linkspartei-die-linke-wird-juenger-und-westdeutscher.html|title=Die LINKE wird jünger und westdeutscher|date=7 June 2018|publisher=Neues Deutschland}}</ref> Meanwhile, in the west, the party membership is male-dominated, with almost three-quarters of western members being men.<ref name="BPBelectorate"/> In recent years, the party has gained significant popularity among youth. Prior to the merger, PDS had by far the highest proportion of members over 60 years of any party, at 68%, and the lowest proportion of members under 30, at just 4%. By 2016, these numbers had fallen and risen, respectively, to 47% and 14%. The Left now has the highest proportion of members under 30 of any party;<ref name="BPBsurvey"/> the average age of the party's members fell from 60 years in 2014 to 56 years in 2017.<ref name="BPBorganisation"/> Between 2016 and 2018, two-thirds of the party's new members were under 35 years of age; 72% of them were from the western states, 15% from the east, and 13% from Berlin. During this period, the party's membership total in the west exceeded that of the east for the first time.<ref name="ND2018"/>

Women have been well-represented amongst elected representatives from The Left. The party's [[Women in government#Quotas|gender quota]] requires that at least half of the party's ruling bodies and representatives should be female. Amongst the party membership however, the proportion of women has decreased in recent years since the large majority of WASG members were male.<ref name="BPBorganisation"/> The proportion of female members fell from 44% in the PDS in 2006 to 39% post-merger in 2007; nonetheless, the party had the highest representation of women in its membership until it was overtaken by the Greens in 2012.<ref name="BPBsurvey"/> After the 2009 election, the party's Bundestag group was 52.6% female, second only to the Greens (57.4%). In 2013, this increased slightly to 54.7%, which was the highest of any group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete18/mdb_zahlen/frauen_maenner/260128|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415191337/https://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete18/mdb_zahlen/frauen_maenner/260128|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 April 2016|title=German Bundestag - women and men|date=September 2015|publisher=German Bundestag}}</ref> Since 2017, The Left's group has been 54% female, again second to the Greens (58%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/abgeordnete/biografien/mdb_zahlen_19/frauen_maenner-529508|title=German Bundestag - women and men|date=July 2019|publisher=German Bundestag}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Observation by Verfassungsschutz===
The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] (''Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz'', abbreviated as '''BfV''' or ''Verfassungsschutz'') is the German federal domestic [[security agency]], tasked with [[intelligence-gathering]] on threats concerning the democratic order, the existence and security of the federation or one of its states. This includes monitoring and reporting on suspected [[extremist]] groups and political parties. Members of The Left and groups within the party have been periodically monitored, sometimes leading to controversy. The ''Verfassungsschutz'' does not consider the party in its entirety extremist, but monitors several of its internal factions and groupings. According to the 2018 report, these are the [[Communist Platform (Germany)|Communist Platform]], [[Socialist Left (Germany)|Socialist Left]], [[working group]] ''AG Cuba Sí'', the Anti-capitalist Left, Marxist Forum, and Gera Dialogue/Socalist Dialogue. The ''Verfassungsschutz'' also monitors [[Socialist Alternative (Germany)|Socialist Alternative]] and Marx21, which have links with the Anti-capitalist Left and Socialist Left, respectively.<ref name="BfV2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/publikationen/themen/sicherheit/vsb-2018-gesamt.html|title=Verfassungsschutzbericht 2018|date=26 June 2019|publisher=[[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]]}}</ref>

As evidence of extremism in The Left, the 2007 ''Verfassungsschutz'' report cites a June 2007 statement by [[Lothar Bisky]] stating that democratic socialism remains the party's goal: "We also still discuss the change of property and power relations [...]. We question the system." However, the report notes that in practice the parliamentary party appears as to act as a "reform-oriented" left force.<ref>''[http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2007.pdf Verfassungsschutzbericht 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920151144/http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2007.pdf |date=20 September 2008 }}'', Federal Ministry of the Interior.</ref>

In the past, The Left was under observation by all western German states; in January 2008, Saarland became the first to cease observation.<ref name="welt.de"/> As of 2008, the authorities of Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, and Lower Saxony considered The Left in its entirety to be extremist.<ref>[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/linkeverfassungsschutz2.html Die Linke – keine Gefährdung für die Verfassung], tagesschau.de, 16. January 2008, accessed 16 March 2008</ref> In the five eastern states however, The Left is not under surveillance, as state constitutional authorities see no indication of anti-constitutional tendencies in the bulk of the party. However, Communist Platform is under observation in three eastern states.<ref name="Netzeitung-Juni">[http://www.netzeitung.de/deutschland/675695.html Neue Linke verunsichert Verfassungsschützer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122182355/http://www.netzeitung.de/deutschland/675695.html |date=22 January 2009 }}, netzeitung.de, 18 June 2007, accessed 16 March 2008</ref>

Surveillance of party members has been a point of controversy. [[Bodo Ramelow]], a prominent Left politician in Thuringia, was under surveillance until a court ruling in January 2008 that this was illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/ovgs/vg_koeln/j2007/20_K_3077_06urteil20071213.html |title=Aktenzeichen: 20 K 3077/06, 20 K 6242/03 |publisher=Justiz.nrw.de |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="welt.de">[https://www.welt.de/politik/article1562539/Beobachtung_von_Ramelow_ist_verboten.html Beobachtung von Linkspartei-Politiker verboten], Welt Online, 17 January 2008, accessed 16 March 2008</ref> In January 2012, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that 27 of the party's 76 Bundestag members were under surveillance, as well as 11 of the party's members of various state parliaments. This included nearly the entirety of the party's Bundestag leadership, party co-leader [[Gesine Lötzsch]] and deputy leader Halina Wawzyniak, and [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Vice President of the Bundestag]] [[Petra Pau]]. Many of those under surveillance were not associated with acknowledged extremist factions of the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/alexander-dobrindt-csu-generalsekretaer-bringt-verbot-der-linken-ins-spiel/6126392.html |title=Alexander Dobrindt: CSU-Generalsekretär bringt Verbot der Linken ins Spiel |language=de |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://de.euronews.com/agenturmeldungen/1341447-verfassungsschutz-beobachtet-umfangreich-die-linke/]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> This surveillance was criticised by the SPD, Greens, and FDP; federal Justice Minister [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]] described it as "intolerable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/geheimdienst-verfassungsschutz-beobachtet-27-linken-abgeordnete-a-810651.html|title=Verfassungsschutz beobachtet 27 Linken-Abgeordnete|date=22 January 2012|publisher=Der Spiegel}}</ref> In October 2013, the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] deemed the surveillance of Bundestag members unconstitutional,<ref name="tagesspiegel">{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/innenministerium-prueft-konsequenzen-ueberwachung-von-ramelow-verfassungswidrig/8906370.html|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht verbietet Überwachung von Bodo Ramelow|publisher=tagesspiegel.de|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> and Federal Minister of the Interior [[Thomas de Maizière]] subsequently declared that none of the party's Bundestag members would be placed under surveillance, even those affiliated with the factions considered extremist by the ''Verfassungsschutz''.<ref name="tagesschau">{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/linkspartei-verfassungsschutz100.html|title=Verfassungsschutz reagiert auf Urteil: Linken-Abgeordnete ohne Beobachtung - tagesschau.de|publisher=tagesschau.de|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>

===Extremism and populism===
Both media and political scientists have discussed whether The Left should be considered extremist in nature.<ref name="Eckhard Jesse: Die Linke,">See, for example, Frank Decker, [[Viola Neu: ''Handbuch der deutschen Parteien,'' VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2007, p. 323 ff.; Eckhard Jesse, Jürgen P. Lang: ''Die Linke – der smarte Extremismus einer deutschen Partei.'' Olzog Verlag, Munich 2008; for the past history of PDS: Steffen Kailitz: ''Politischer Extremismus in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', Wiesbaden 2004, p. 82 ff. and for suspicion of extremism in the party as a whole: [http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/linksextremismus/158721/die-linke-meinungsbeitrag-von-eckhard-jesse Eckhard Jesse: ''Die Linke''], and a rebuke: [http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/linksextremismus/156715/die-linke-meinungsbeitrag-von-richard-stoess Richard Stöss: ''Die Linke. Zur Beobachtung der Partei durch den Verfassungsschutz.'']</ref> Outlets including the [[BBC]]<ref name="BBC-5-11-14"/>, [[The Guardian]]<ref name="Guardian-18-09-09"/>, [[Euronews]]<ref name="Euronews-20-11-14"/> and [[Der Spiegel]]<ref name="Spiegel-19-09-13"/> have described the party as "[[far-left]]". Among academics, there is a general consensus that at least some sections of the party are extremist. However, [[political scientist]] [[Richard Stöss]] states that they make up less than ten percent of the party membership, and compete for resources among themselves. As such, there is little risk of these groups becoming dominant and exerting major influence over the party's leadership and platform.<ref>Richard Stöss: [http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/linksextremismus/156715/die-linke-meinungsbeitrag-von-richard-stoess ''Die Linke. Zur Beobachtung der Partei durch den Verfassungsschutz.'']</ref> [[Eckhard Jesse]] states that, while The Left is far more accepting of the Basic Law than parties like the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]], the presence of its extremist factions means the party overall represents a "soft left-wing extremism".<ref>Eckhard Jesse: [http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/linksextremismus/158721/die-linke-meinungsbeitrag-von-eckhard-jesse ''Die Linke'']</ref>

The Left has also been characterised as [[Left-wing populism|left-wing populist]]<ref name="keating" /> by researchers such as [[Cas Mudde]]<ref>[[Cas Mudde]]: [http://www.bpb.de/apuz/30843/radikale-parteien-in-europa?p=all ''Radical Parties in Europe'']. In: ''From Politics and Contemporary History'' 45 (2008) 47, p. 12–18.</ref> and Tilman Mayer.<ref>[[Tilman Mayer]]: ''Left-wing populism as a challenge. For the demagogical siphoning of resentments''. In: ''The Political Opinion'', Nr. 465, August 2008, pp. 15–18, here: p. 15, 17 ([http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_14310-544-1-30.pdf PDF]).</ref> Florian Hartleb states that the party is "social-populist".<ref>Florian Hartleb: ''Populism – a central characteristic of party politics in turbulent times?''. In: Friso Wielanga, Florian Hartleb (ed.): ''Populism in modern democracy. The Netherlands and Germany in comparison''. Waxmann, Münster u. a. 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-8309-2444-9}}, pp. 105–127, here: p. 117.</ref> According to Frank Decker, the party during the leadership of Oskar Lafontaine could be described as left-wing populist.<ref>Frank Decker: ''From a protest phenomenon to a permanent political phenomenon: right-wing and left-wing populism in Western Europe''. In: Uwe Backes, Alexander Gallus, Eckhard Jesse (ed.): ''[[Jahrbuch Extremismus & Demokratie]]'', 27th year (2015), Nomos, Baden-Baden 2015, {{ISBN|978-3-8487-2522-9}}, pp. 57–72, here: p. 59.</ref>

In 2011, Bundestag deputy and later party co-leader Katja Kipping stated that she believed The Left needed "a double strategy [of] social-ecological restructuring plus left-wing populism" to become attractive to voters. She elaborated: "Left-wing populism means targeting those who are marginalized in our society in a targeted and pointed manner."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/linken-vize-katja-kipping-im-interview-wir-muessen-uns-der-gruenen-herausforderung-stellen/4070954.html|title=We have to face the green challenge|date=18 April 2011|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]}}</ref>

===Association with the SED===
The Left's position as the successor of the PDS and SED has made it subject to significant controversy and criticism, as well as claims that the party is sympathetic to the former GDR.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,650626,00.html Verdrängte Parteigeschichte: Plädoyer für eine Entzauberung der Linkspartei], spiegel.de, 25 September 2009, accessed 25 September 2009</ref> On 3 October 2007, The Left's parliamentary faction walked out of the [[Landtag of Saxony]] during a [[German Unity Day]] ceremony<ref>{{cite web|author=Sächsischer Landtag |url=http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/de/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/1378_3646.aspx |title=Sächsischer Landtag feiert Tag der Deutschen Einheit – Festredner Joachim Gauck: "Freiheit wagen – Verantwortung leben" |publisher=Landtag.sachsen.de |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=3 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303151803/http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/de/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/1378_3646.aspx |archive-date=3 March 2012 }}</ref> in protest of the presence of [[Joachim Gauck]], former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]], who was the keynote speaker at the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2010/06/05/wulff-und-gauck-im-interview/kandidat-joachim-gauck/linke/warum-die-linke-gauck-nicht-waehlt.html |title=Kandidaten für das Amt des Bundespräsidenten: Warum "Die Linke" Joachim Gauck nicht wählt |language=de |publisher=Bild.de |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> The Left's state leader André Hahn claimed that Gauck did not deliver an "appropriate or balanced speech", arguing he had "an absolutely one-sided view of the GDR." He also criticised the lack of cross-factional agreement in the selection of the speaker. The party's actions were widely condemned, with Saxon CDU parliamentary leader Fritz Hehle calling their absence "embarrassing and insulting" and regional Greens leader Antje Hermenau stating "[The Left is] still not ready to perceive the GDR as the dictatorship that it was."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/sachsen-linke-boykottiert-einheitsfeier-wegen-gauck-rede/1054930.html|title=Left boycotts unity celebration over Gauck speech|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>
