Mukherjee got his break in politics in 1969 when the then [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] helped him get elected to the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of [[Parliament of India]], on a Congress [[Ticket (election)|ticket]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pranab Mukherjee passes away: A glimpse into Congress stalwart's life - Early Life|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pranab-mukherjee-passes-away-a-glimpse-into-congress-stalwarts-life/early-life/slideshow/77866966.cms|access-date=2020-12-04|website=The Economic Times}}</ref> Following a meteoric rise, he became one of Gandhi's most trusted lieutenants and a minister in her cabinet in 1973. Mukherjee's service in a number of ministerial capacities culminated in his first stint as [[Finance Minister of India]] in 1982–84.

Mukherjee was sidelined from Congress during the premiership of [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Mukherjee had viewed himself and not the inexperienced Rajiv, as the rightful successor to Indira following [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|her assassination]] in 1984. Mukherjee lost out in the ensuing power struggle. He formed his own party, the [[Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress]], which merged with Congress in 1989 after reaching a consensus with [[Rajiv Gandhi]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gujral|first=Inder Kumar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6pABAAAQBAJ|title=Matters of Discretion: An Autobiography|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin Books Publication]]|year=2011|isbn=978-93-8048-080-0|location=|pages=56-63|author-link=Inder Kumar Gujral|archive-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Matters_of_Discretion.html?id=C_ePpwAACAAJ|archive-date=2017-10-19}}</ref> After Rajiv Gandhi's [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassination in 1991]], Mukherjee's political career was revived when Prime Minister [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] appointed him [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] head in 1991 and [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|foreign minister]] in 1995. Following this, as elder statesman of Congress, Mukherjee was the principal architect of [[Sonia Gandhi]]'s ascent to the [[President of the Indian National Congress|party's presidency]] in 1998.<ref name="europe.eu2" />

When the Congress-led [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA) came to power in 2004, Mukherjee won a [[Lok Sabha]] (the popularly elected lower house of Parliament) seat for the first time. From then until his resignation in 2012, he held a number of key cabinet portfolios in Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]]'s government{{snd}}[[Minister of Defence (India)|Defence]] (2004–06), [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|External Affairs]] (2006–09), and [[Finance minister of india|Finance]] (2009–12){{snd}}apart from heading several Groups of Ministers (GoMs) and being [[Leader of the House (Lok Sabha)|Leader of the House]] in the [[Lok Sabha]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Pranab Mukherjee|url=https://indianexpress.com/about/pranab-mukherjee/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200901000000/https://indianexpress.com/about/pranab-mukherjee/|archive-date=2020-06-10|access-date=2020-12-04|website=The Indian Express|language=en}}</ref> After securing the UPA's nomination for the country's presidency in July 2012, Mukherjee comfortably defeated [[P.

In 1979, Mukherjee became Deputy Leader of the INC in the Rajya Sabha, and in 1980, he was appointed Leader of the House.<ref name="GOVT"/> He was considered the top-ranking Indian cabinet minister and he presided over cabinet meetings in the absence of the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pranabmukherjee.nic.in/profile.html|title=Pranab Mukherjee|website=pranabmukherjee|access-date=10 October 2019|archive-date=31 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200831133202/http://pranabmukherjee.nic.in/profile.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Mukherjee was sidelined from the INC following [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|the assassination of Indira Gandhi]]. Although he was much more experienced in politics than Indira's son, Rajiv Gandhi, it was Rajiv who gained control. Mukherjee lost his position in the cabinet and was sent to manage the regional [[West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee]].

In 1986, Mukherjee founded another party, the [[Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress]] (RSC), in West Bengal. The RSC and INC merged three years later after a compromise was reached with Rajiv Gandhi. The RSC had fared terribly in the 1987 Assembly polls in West Bengal. Many analysts, over the years, have attributed the muting of Mukherjee's political aspirations as the supreme leader to his inability to emerge as a magnetic mass leader.<ref name="Pranab Mukherjee's USP for President: sheer experience"/> On later being asked whether he ever desired to become Prime Minister, Mukherjee replied, "[[7 Race Course Road|7 RCR]] was never my destination."<ref name="zee news2">{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/zee-exclusive/i-won-t-be-a-unique-president-pranab-mukherjee_788923.html|title=I won't be a unique President: Pranab Mukherjee|publisher=Zee News|date=24 July 2012|access-date=9 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523125957/http://zeenews.india.com/news/zee-exclusive/i-won-t-be-a-unique-president-pranab-mukherjee_788923.html|archive-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> [[Zee News]] noted: "The statement assumes heft in the light of the longstanding speculation that Mukherjee, as one of the doyens of Congress, always nursed an ambition to occupy the top executive post".<ref name="zee news2"/>

Mukherjee's political career revived following the [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi]] in 1991, when [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] chose to appoint him as deputy chairman of the Indian Planning Commission and subsequently as a union cabinet minister. He served as External Affairs Minister for the first time from 1995 to 1996 in Rao's cabinet.<ref name="GOVT"/>

Mukherjee was considered to be a Gandhi family loyalist and the principal architect of Sonia Gandhi's entry into politics, a mentoring responsibility he was believed to have continued shouldering.<ref name="Pranab Mukherjee's USP for President: sheer experience"/> He was made General Secretary of the AICC in 1998–99 after Sonia Gandhi became Congress President. Mukherjee was made President of the West Bengal Congress in 2000 and held the position until his resignation in 2010. He had earlier held the position in 1985.<ref name="PMI"/>

Mukherjee became Leader of the House in the [[Lok Sabha]] in 2004.<ref name="GOVT"/> He contested and won a Lok Sabha seat from [[Jangipur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Jangipur]] in West Bengal, which he would later retain in 2009. It was speculated in 2004 that Mukherjee would be made Prime Minister of India after Sonia Gandhi declined to become Prime Minister; however, Manmohan Singh was chosen instead.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theprint.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-man-who-knew-too-much-but-was-a-rahul-dravid-like-wall-for-congress/486181/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-date=1 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200901040908/https://theprint.in/politics/pranab-mukherjee-man-who-knew-too-much-but-was-a-rahul-dravid-like-wall-for-congress/486181/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mukherjee was briefly considered for the post of the largely ceremonial Indian presidency in 2007, but his name was subsequently dropped after his contribution in the Union Cabinet was considered practically indispensable.<ref name="zee news"/>

He held many important posts in the Manmohan Singh government: He had the distinction of being the minister for various high-profile ministries, including Defence, Finance, and External Affairs. Apart from being Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha and Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee President,<ref name="GOVT"/> he also headed the [[Congress Parliamentary Party]] and the Congress Legislative Party, which consist of all the Congress MP's and MLA's in the country.

Mukherjee ended his affiliation with the Indian National Congress and retired from active political life following his election as president in 2012.

When asked what legacy he wanted to leave behind as Foreign Minister of India, Mukherjee replied, "As the [man] who prepared Indian diplomacy to address the challenges of a more globalised, interdependent and uncertain world".<ref name="IT"/>

===Minister of Commerce and Industry===
Mukherjee thrice served as Commerce Minister of India. His first stints were in the Indira Gandhi government from 1980 to 1982 and again in 1984.<ref name="GOVT"/> His third stint in the 1990s saw him contribute significantly to the negotiations which led to the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref name="IE2"/>

Mukherjee's first stint as the Finance Minister of India was during the [[Indira Gandhi]] government in 1982. He presented his first annual budget in 1982–83. His first term was noted for the work he did to improve the finances of the government and for successfully returning the last instalment of India's first 
[[IMF]] loan.<ref name="auto"/> Mukherjee signed the letter appointing Manmohan Singh as the Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]] in 1982.<ref name="Footsteps of Pranab"/> He was accused of patronage practices in the [[Dhirubhai Ambani|Ambani]]–[[Nusli Wadia|Wadia]] industrial feuds.<ref name="Aggarwal 1990">{{Cite book|last=Aggarwal|first=S.

Mukherjee was credited with being an early reformer of the Indian economy. ''India Today'' wrote: "Operation Forward, which [Mukherjee] and then Industries Minister Charanjit Chanana launched in the early 1980s, started the liberalisation process that flowered under Rao and Manmohan Singh".<ref name="IT"/> A Left-wing magazine once commented that "socialism did not grow out of the pipe Mukherjee smoked".<ref name="IT"/>

Mukherjee was removed from his position as Finance Minister by Rajiv Gandhi in 1984. Gandhi had wished to bring in his own team of staff to govern India.<ref name="TET"/> Mukherjee was replaced even though he was rated as the best Finance Minister in the World that year according to a survey by Euromoney magazine.<ref name="auto"/>

He presented the annual budgets in [[2009 Union budget of India|2009]], [[2010 Union budget of India|2010]], and [[2011 Union budget of India|2011]]. The 2010–11 budget included the country's first explicit target to cut public debt as a proportion of the [[GDP]] and Mukherjee targeted a budget deficit reduction of 4.1% of the GDP in the fiscal year 2012–13, from 6.5% in 2008–09.<ref name=TB/>

Mukherjee expanded funding for several social sector schemes including the [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]]. He also supported budget increases for improving [[literacy in India|literacy]] and health care. He expanded infrastructure programmes such as the [[National Highway Development Programme]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=More Funds for Infrastructure Development, Farmers|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/more-funds-for-infrastructure-development-farmers/662289|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200901040912/https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/more-funds-for-infrastructure-development-farmers/662289|archive-date=1 September 2020|access-date=1 September 2020|website=Outlook India}}</ref> Electricity coverage was also expanded during his tenure. Mukherjee also reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of fiscal prudence as some economists expressed concern about the rising fiscal deficits during his tenure, the highest since 1991.

In 2010, he was awarded "Finance Minister of the Year for Asia" by ''Emerging Markets'', the daily newspaper of record for the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). Mukherjee was praised for "the confidence [he] has inspired in key stakeholders, by virtue of his fuel price reforms, fiscal transparency and inclusive growth strategies".<ref name="Asia Award Finance"/> ''[[The Banker]]'' also recognised him as "Finance Minister of the Year."<ref name="TB"/>

Mukherjee's final years at the finance ministry were not considered a success. The [[NDTV]], upon his resignation in June 2012, wrote: "There [had] been a clamour from many quarters for a change in the Finance Ministry, with Mr Mukherjee having faced flak for several decisions where politics seemed to overwhelm economic imperatives".<ref name="NDTV2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/pranab-mukherjee-resigns-as-finance-minister-pm-to-take-additional-charge-say-sources-236331|title=Pranab Mukherjee resigns as Finance Minister; PM to take additional charge, say sources|publisher=NDTV|date=26 June 2012|access-date=13 July 2012|archive-date=29 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629053603/http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/pranab-mukherjee-resigns-as-finance-minister-pm-to-take-additional-charge-say-sources-236331|url-status=live}}</ref>
