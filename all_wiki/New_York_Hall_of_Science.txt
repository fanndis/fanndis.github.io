The '''New York Hall of Science''', also known as '''NYSCI''', is a [[science museum]] located in [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]], in the section of the park that is in [[Corona, Queens|Corona]]. It occupies one of the few remaining structures from the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], and is New York City's only hands-on [[science]] and [[technology]] center. The more than 400 hands-on exhibits focus on [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]].

{{Flushing Meadows-Corona Park map|float=left||highlight=8}}

===Founding and deterioration===
The museum was established in 1964 as part of the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]] in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park,<ref name="scilif"/><ref name="remi">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/09/22/archives/hopeful-future-museum-but-citys-hall-of-science-still-retains-aura.html|title=Hopeful Future Museum; But City's Hall of Science Still Retains Aura Reminiscent of the World's Fair|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=September 22, 1966|author=Walter Sullivan|work=The New York Times}}</ref> and at the time was one of only a few [[science museum]]s in existence.<ref name="window"/> Unlike many other institutions, which were closed immediately or soon after the Fair,<ref name="wpf">{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-589789.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517132936/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-589789.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 17, 2011|title=The Future was Then; NYC Dusts Off Relics of Its Word's Fairs|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=June 13, 1999|author=Jon Marcus|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> the Hall remained open after the fair, and served as a resource for students.<ref name="stude">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/11/11/archives/students-bone-up-in-museum-at-old-fair-site.html|title=Students Bone Up in Museum at Old Fair Site|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=November 11, 1968|work=New York Times}}</ref> Its exhibits at the time were somewhat limited but included plans for the world's first [[atomarium]] open to the public.<ref name="atom">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/07/archives/first-atomarium-planned-here-a-hot-reactor-open-to-public.html|title=First Atomarium Planned Here: A Hot Reactor Open to Public|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=January 7, 1969|author=[[Sandra Blakeslee]]|work=New York Times}}</ref>

The Hall remained open for 15 years, but in 1979 it was closed for major renovations, not to reopen until 1983 at the earliest. By May 1982, according to a ''New York Daily News'' article at the time, the condition of the museum had deteriorated to such a state that "paint peels from the Saturn V and Apollo hulls, and graffiti adorn the walls around the space park; chipped cement and scattered stones fill the moat beneath the hall". At the time, even though renovations were completed in 1983, city funding for the museum was severed because only $40,000 out of $8 million of promised funding had been raised.<ref name="the-physicist">[http://nysci.org/the-physicist-who-saved-the-hall-of-science/ NYSCI | The Physicist Who Saved the Hall of Science<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1984, New York City hired [[physicist]] [[Alan J.

At the time of its re-opening, the museum was unique in that it also provided a training program for science majors who could then go on to study under a tuition waiver program at nearby [[Queens College]]<ref name="cultcom">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DC143CF935A15753C1A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=Culture Commissioner Looks Back in Humor at a Bumpy First Year|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=October 26, 1988|author=[[William H.

The museum's role in the life of city school children continued, and in 1991 it announced plans for a ten-year, $80 million renovation and expansion to be able to meet the needs of a growing visitorship.<ref name="scilif">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D8103CF933A05753C1A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Science Centers Help Bring Schoolwork to Life|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=October 30, 1991|author=Michel Marriott|work=New York Times}}</ref> Further expansion, which included a new entrance rotunda, driveway, cafe, gift shop and theater, as well as a {{convert|30,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} science playground, began in 1996<ref name="window"/> and reflected the need for constant updates in science museums to keep their displays up to date and relevant.

In 2005, the Hall was among 406 [[New York City]] arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which had been made possible through a donation by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].<ref name="citg">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|title=City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=July 6, 2005|author=Sam Roberts|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="carn">{{cite web|url=http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html |title=Carnegie Corporation of New York Announces Twenty Million Dollars in New York City Grants |accessdate=March 12, 2008 |publisher=Carnegie Corporation of New York |date=July 5, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310235744/http://carnegie.org/sub/news/anon2005.html |archivedate=March 10, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> The Hall has  continued to receive funding from a number of sources essential to its operation and expansion.<ref name="pigb">{{cite web|url=http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080403/NATION/53069335/0/FRONTPAGE|title='Pig Book' Tallies $17.2 Billion in Pork|accessdate=April 6, 2008|date=April 3, 2008|author=S.A.
