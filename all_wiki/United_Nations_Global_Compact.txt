The '''United Nations Global Compact''' is a non-binding [[United Nations]] [[pact]] to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and [[corporate social responsibility|socially responsible]] policies, and to report on their implementation. The UN Global Compact is a principle-based framework for businesses, stating ten principles in the areas of [[human rights]], [[Labor relations|labor]], the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[Political corruption|anti-corruption]]. Under the Global Compact, companies are brought together with UN agencies, labor groups and civil society. Cities can join the Global Compact through the Cities Programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesprogramme.org/ |title=Front Page &#124; |publisher=Citiesprogramme.org |date=2019-10-10 |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>

The UN Global Compact is the world's largest [[corporate sustainability]] ({{aka}} corporate social responsibility) initiative  with 13000 corporate participants and other stakeholders over 170 countries<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/publications/UN_Global_Compact_Guide_to_Corporate_Sustainability.pdf |title=Guide to sustainability |publisher=unglobalcompact.org |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> with two objectives: "Mainstream the ten principles in business activities around the world" and "Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals, such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/AboutTheGC/index.html|title=About the UN Global Compact - UN Global Compact}}</ref> Moving forward, the UN Global Compact and its signatories are deeply invested and enthusiastic about supporting work towards the SDGs.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/1521-12-08-2014|title = Major Companies to Help Set the Stage for Ambitious Climate Agreement in 2015}}</ref>

The UN Global Compact was announced by then UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] in an address to the [[World Economic Forum]] on 31 January 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/1999/19990201.sgsm6881.html|title=SECRETARY-GENERAL PROPOSES GLOBAL COMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS, LABOUR, ENVIRONMENT, IN ADDRESS TO WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN DAVOS - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases}}</ref> and was officially launched at [[UN Headquarters]] in New York City on 26 July 2000. The '''Global Compact Office''' works on the basis of a mandate set out by the UN General Assembly as an organization that "promotes responsible business practices and UN values among the global business community and the UN System."<ref>A/RES/68/234</ref> The UN Global Compact is a founding member of the United Nations [[Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative|Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative]] along with the [[Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)]], the [[United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative|United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI)]], and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)]].

==The Ten Principles==
The UN Global Compact was initially launched with nine Principles.<!-- name them --> On 24 June 2004, during the first Global Compact Leaders Summit, Kofi Annan announced the addition of the tenth principle against [[Political corruption|corruption]] in accordance with the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption|United Nations Convention Against Corruption]] adopted in 2003.

{{Cquote|''Human Rights''
*1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and
*2 Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

''Labour''
*3 Businesses should uphold the [[freedom of association]] and the effective recognition of the right to [[collective bargaining]];
*4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;
*5 The effective abolition of child labour; and
*6 The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

''Environment''
*7 Businesses should support a [[Precautionary principle|precautionary approach]] to environmental challenges;
*8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and
*9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.

''Anti-Corruption''
*10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.}}

==Facilitation==
The UN Global Compact is not a regulatory instrument, but rather a forum for discussion and a network for communication including governments, companies and labour organisations, whose actions it seeks to influence, and civil society organisations, representing its stakeholders. The UN Global Compact says that once companies declared their support for the principles "This does not mean that the Global Compact recognizes or certifies that these companies have fulfilled the Compact’s principles."  Instead, as mentioned in a 2015 interview with Executive Director, Lise Kingo, "we are the guide dogs, not the watchdogs", with the organization seeking to prioritize providing resources and support instead of attempting to enforce discipline.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dumalaon|first1=Janelle|title=Global Compact: a guide dog, not a watchdog|url=http://dw.com/p/1GnoP|access-date=2016-01-26|agency=dw.com|date=2015-10-14}}</ref>

The UN Global Compact's goals are intentionally flexible and vague, but it distinguishes the following channels through which it provides facilitation and encourages dialogue: policy dialogues, learning, local networks and projects.<ref>Hoessle, Ulrike:The Contribution of the UN Global Compact towards the Compliance of International Regimes: A Comparative Study of Businesses from the United States, [[Mozambique]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and Germany.

Recent studies indicate that businesses are more open than ever to private sector interventions, such as carbon pricing and other mechanics to help curb climate effects within the scope of business solutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/un-global-compact-partner-zone/2015/nov/30/un-climate-change-cop21-paris-investment-business|title = Study shows UN climate change agreement needed to unlock funds for solutions to global warming}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/3551|title=The UN Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study Special Edition: A Call to Climate Action - UN Global Compact}}</ref> The Global Compact also will periodically create resources and guides that business and non profit organizations may use in their efforts to support the Compact's overall mission. One such example is the [http://sdgcompass.org/ SDG Compass], developed in collaboration with the [[Global Reporting Initiative|Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)]] and [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBSCD), which is a collection of resources (analysis of the goals, indicators for businesses, tools for stakeholders) that companies can utilize in finding out their role in helping to achieve the SDGs.

==History==
The first Global Compact Leaders Summit, chaired by the then Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], was held in UN Headquarters in New York on 24 June 2004,  to bring "intensified international focus and increased momentum" to the UN Global Compact. The second Global Compact Leaders Summit, chaired by Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], was held on 5–6 July 2007 at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. It adopted the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070715005808/http://www.unglobalcompact.org/NewsAndEvents/news_archives/2007_07_06c.html Geneva Declaration] on corporate responsibility. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Global Compact's launch, the Global Compact Leaders Summit 2010 took place on 24–25 June 2010 in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/NewsAndEvents/2010_Leaders_Summit/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326083121/http://www.unglobalcompact.org/newsandevents/2010_Leaders_Summit/index.html |archive-date=March 26, 2012 }}</ref> On the occasion, the  Blueprint for Corporate Sustainability Leadership <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_events/8.1/Blueprint.pdf |title=News events |publisher=unglobalcompact.org |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> identifying leadership criteria linked to implementation of the ten principles, efforts to support development objectives, and engagement in the Global Compact was released.

==UN Global Compact – Cities Programme==

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|thumb|Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011)]]
In  2001, the City of [[Melbourne]] proposed that cities as well as corporations should be allowed to join the UN Global Compact, arguing that this would provide a clear statement of a city's commitment to positive change, as well as motivating participation in international dialogue. The proposal was accepted, and the UN Global Compact - Cities Programme was launched in 2002. It was formed as an urban-focused component of the Global Compact with its International Secretariat initially located in [[Melbourne]], Australia. The aim of the programme is to improve urban life in cities throughout the world.

Melbourne became the first city to engage the Global Compact in June 2001.

In April 2003, under the directorship of David Teller, a framework called the Melbourne Model was developed that went beyond the Ten Principles. It begins by drawing the resources of government, business and civil society into a cross-sector partnership in order to develop a practical project that addresses a seemingly intractable urban issue. In 2007, the then Director, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] (2007–2014) and his colleagues Dr. Andy Scerri and Dr. Liam Magee, took this methodology further by integrating the partnership model with a four-domain sustainability framework called '[[Circles of Sustainability]]'.<ref>Paul James and Andy Scerri, ‘Auditing Cities through Circles of Sustainability’, Mark Amen, Noah J. Toly, Patricia L. Carney and Klaus Segbers, eds, Cities and Global Governance, Ashgate, Farnham, 2011, pp. 111–36; Andy Scerri and Paul James, ‘Communities of Citizens and "Indicators" of Sustainability’, Community Development Journal, vol. 45, no. 2, 2010, pp. 219–36; Andy Scerri and Paul James, ‘Accounting for Sustainability: Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Research in Developing ‘Indicators’ of Sustainability’, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, vol. 13, no. 1, 2010, pp. 41–53.</ref>

In 2007, the  Secretariat moved from the [[Committee For Melbourne]] to the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], itself affiliated with [[UN-HABITAT]]. There, projects associated with city-based responses to global [[climate change]] and [[globalization]] became increasingly important. The Melbourne Model was further elaborated, with a sustainability indicators program developed as a way of assessing and monitoring progress.<ref>Paul James and Andy Scerri, ''Accounting for Sustainability: Briefing Paper No. 1'', available at http://www.citiesprogramme.org/</ref> In 2012, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] method was elaborated to guide a city or urban region through a rigorous assessment process. As one of the outcomes it provides a figurative image of the overall sustainability of that city to illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.

In 2015, RMIT Professor Ralph Horne became the third director of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme and in February 2016 an Urban Thinkers Campus was organised at RMIT Melbourne in collaboration with World Vision International as part of the buildup to UN Habitat III. The theme of the Urban Thinkers Campus was Ethical Cities: Locking in Liveability. This was followed by the organisation of an Urban Innovation Forum on Ethical Cities in July 2016 in Barcelona, Spain as a collaboration between the UN Global Compact - Cities Programme, RMIT Europe and UN-Habitat.

{{as of|August 2020}} there are 120 participants in the City Network, 85 of them in Latin America and the Caribbean. Milwaukee and San Francisco are the only U.S. member cities.<ref>UN Global Compact, Cities Programme, [https://citiesprogramme.org/participate/our-city-network/ Our City Network], accessed 17 August 2020</ref>

==Local networks==
Local networks of the Global Compact advance the initiative and its ten principles at a country level. Currently there are approximately 85 Local Networks in total. These networks help companies and non profit organizations understand what responsible business means within diverse national, cultural, and linguistic contexts. Additionally, there are related programs for particular topics of interest, such as the Business for Peace initiative, that bring awareness to businesses and other organizations about instability and conflict, such that organizations can help to address these concerns from their own perspective and with the assistance of their local networks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mylly|first1=Tiina|title=Work with a Local Network to Advance Peace|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/peace-local-activities|website=unglobalcompact.org|publisher=UN Global Compact|access-date=2016-01-26}}</ref> Local connections to supplement the international connections made by the Global Compact at large can help to broaden the engagement and impact of members. Local Networks are independent, self-governed and self managed entities, and work closely with the UN Global Compact's New York headquarters, and coordinate as points of contact for UN Global Compact signatories in their respective countries.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.unglobalcompact.org/engage-locally|title = Engage Locally- UN Global Compact|website = unglobalcompact.org}}</ref> The Local Networks of the Global Compact are showcased, but not limited to the interactions chronicled below:

=== Australia===
* The Global Compact Local Network in Australia was established in 2009 by a steering committee drawn from the Australian business community and stakeholder groups. It was formally incorporated in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Compact Network Australia|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org.au/|publisher=United Nations Global Compact Network Australia}}</ref> as the Global Compact Network Australia Limited, and  elections were held for the inaugural board of directors. In 2011 it established two business-led leadership groups dealing with human rights and anti-corruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org.au/leadership-groups/|title=Leadership Groups - Global Compact Network Australia}}</ref> The GCNA draws its funding directly from members and member-based activities, in contrast to  many networks who rely in part on government funding.

=== Bulgaria===
* The Global Compact Local Network in Bulgaria was founded in January 2003, under the auspices of President [[Georgi Parvanov]]. The voluntary initiative unites 120 Bulgarian companies, non-governmental organizations and academia into a unique network. All members are united around the idea to apply the ten principles of the UN Global Compact in their daily practices and to be responsible corporate citizens. In 2006, to strengthen and enhance the role of the initiative, a management structure was introduced consisting of Advisory Board and a Secretariat. For the period 2006-2010 the network activities were supported by the [[United Nations Development Program]] Bulgaria. With the active participation and financial contribution of its members Global Compact Bulgaria organized numerous initiatives related to environment, health, education and youth. Among them are the projects: "Unleashing Entrepreneurship"; "Love Bridge"; "Sharing Best Practices in Corporate Social Responsibility".<ref>Global Compact Network Bulgaria - {{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.bg/?page_id%3D183 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406233702/http://www.unglobalcompact.bg/?page_id=183 |archive-date=April 6, 2014 }}</ref>
* With the end of the support from UNDP Bulgaria, the Global Compact Local Network in [[Bulgaria]] had to identify and formulate a new strategy for sustainability. So, between 2009 and 2010 the members signed an institutional framework for future organizational development. As a result, on 10 September 2010 a new independent organization was founded – Association Global Compact Network Bulgaria. Its members are 20 leading companies and organizations in Bulgaria, members the UN Global Compact as well. The Association is managed by a steering committee and control committee. Their main goals are to learn from each other, to communicate, to generate an advocacy impact and initiate dialogue or partnerships with other actors such as the government, local authorities, labour organisations and civil society organizations.<ref>About GC Bulgaria - http://bg.linkedin.com/pub/global-compact-network-bulgaria/37/948/a9a{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== France===
* The [[:fr:Global Compact France|Global Compact Network France]] was established in 2004. It is the second largest local network of the UN Global Compact after Spain, with more than 1,100 participants in 2017. The main aim of the Global Compact Network France is to add personalized value to the French participants of the Global Compact, in order to help them to make progress in their CSR approach and enlarge the Global Compact network. The local network is entirely financed by its members.

=== India===
* The Global Compact Network (GCN) India was formed by organizations from India who participate in the Global Compact. It was registered on 24 November 2003, with Registrar of Societies, NCT, Delhi, as a non-profit body. The main objective of the Network is to provide a forum to various Indian Companies/ Organizations to exchange experiences, network and work together on activities related to CSR. This is expected to promote sustainable growth besides encouraging good corporate citizenship. The Network, acts as an Apex level nodal agency representing various Indian Corporate bodies/ Institutions/ NGOs/ SMEs, who are committed to the UN Global Compact principles.
* The Global Compact Network India has been one of the pioneering local initiatives of the Global Compact. It is one of the first local networks to be set up as a legal entity. Over the last nine years the network has seen modest growth and has been able to create a niche for itself within efforts by the business community directed towards realising the vision of sustainable development in India. At present Dinesh Kumar Sarraf, CMD, ONGC, is the President of the Global Compact Network India for the term 2015-17 and is managed by a Governing Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gcnindia.org|title=Travel India|website=gcnindia.org|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

=== Mexico===
* The Global Compact Network in Mexico in December 2014 endorsed the commitment of the private sector towards improving gender equality. Echoing the sentiments of initiatives such as the "HeforShe", and the large support of individuals in the region for promoting gender equality and empowering women. Much of this progress is being achieved by practical guidelines for how private entities can make a more diverse, inclusive workplace that create codes of global business.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.unglobalcompact.org/news/2151-12-10-2014|title = Global Compact Network Mexico Endorses Private Sector's Commitment to Gender Equality}}</ref>

=== Spain===
* The Global Compact Network Spain is the largest local network of signatories to the UN Global Compact.  As an independent legal entity launched in 2004, it is managed by a steering committee with a chairman, deputy chairman, secretary, treasurer and 16 directors elected by the network’s general assembly. The steering committee includes representatives from large companies, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the public sector, educational entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In order to abide by the rules of Spanish legislature, the general assembly holds a vote each year on budgetary issues and resolutions and nominates the steering committee. The Global Compact Network Spain has been successful in involving SMEs, developing interactive resources and reporting tools and emphasizing human rights through the commitment of the local companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pactomundial.org/|title=Pacto Mundial – Responsabilidad Social Empresarial – RSE – Sostenibilidad – Agenda y Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible – ODS – Derechos Humanos y Empresa}}</ref>

=== Syria===
* The Syria initiative aims at enhancing civic engagement and corporate social responsibility of private sector by promoting the ten principles of the UN Global Compact as well as forging partnerships between private sector organizations, public sector institutions and civil society. This initiative is a partnership between the Syrian Government represented by the State Planning Commission and the UNDP Country Office in Syria. It was launched under the patronage of the Head of State Planning Commission and in the presence of the Deputy Chairperson of the UN Global Compact in July 2008. The Syrian Global Compact Local Network has 26 businesses, five NGOs, and five federations of commerce and industry. It was displayed among 10 selected ones from around the world in the Global Compact Sixth Annual Local Networks Forum. The Syria story was called a "leadership case" and the Syria Network growth ratio was ranked first among the global top ten in 2008.<ref>Info on the Syria case available at: {{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.sy/index.php/un-syria-global-compact |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109203029/http://www.undp.org.sy/index.php/un-syria-global-compact |archive-date=January 9, 2010 }}</ref> The UNGC National Advisory Council has been formulated and held its founders’ meeting on October 15, 2008, with the participation of leaders from the Syrian private sector, international corporate representatives, local and international civil society organizations, UNDP, the Syrian Government, media and education sectors.

==Criticism==
Some critics believe that without any effective monitoring and enforcement provisions, the Global Compact fails to hold corporations accountable.<ref>Global Policy Forum Europe (ed.), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/17222782/Global-Compact-Alternative-Hearing-2007 Whose partnership for whose development?
