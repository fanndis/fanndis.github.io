'''''Roseanne''''' is an American [[comedy-drama]] [[sitcom]] television series created by [[Matt Williams (TV producer)|Matt Williams]] and [[Roseanne Barr]], which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from October 18, 1988 to May 20, 1997, and briefly revived with a spin-off series of the same name from March 27 to May 22, 2018. It stars Barr as Roseanne Conner and revolves around her fictional family. Lauded for its realistic portrayal of a working-class American family, the series reached No. 1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] from 1989 to 1990 in its second season.

During the initial run, the series remained in the top four for six of the nine seasons, and in the top 20 for eight. During the short-lived revival, the series reached No. 3, with an average of 18 million viewers per episode within the span of its nine episodes.  In 1993, the episode "[[A Stash from the Past]]" was ranked No. 21 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]].<ref>{{cite journal |year = 1997 |title = Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal = [[TV Guide]] |issue = June 28 – July 4 |publisher = [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] }}</ref> In 2002, ''Roseanne'' was ranked No. 35 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|''TV Guide''{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml |title = TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows |date = April 26, 2002 |newspaper = [[CBS News]] |publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] |access-date = April 20, 2015 }}</ref> In 2013, it was ranked No. 32 on ''TV Guide''{{'}}s 60 Best Series of All Time.<ref>[https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962 TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time], tvguide.com; accessed January 15, 2018.</ref>

On May 16, 2017, ABC announced it had greenlit a [[Roseanne (season 10)|revived, 10th season]] of ''Roseanne'' as a mid-season replacement in 2018, with the original cast returning.

ABC reversed its renewal decision and canceled ''Roseanne'' on May 29, 2018, after Barr likened former [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] official [[Valerie Jarrett]] to ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'', in [[Roseanne Barr#Valerie Jarrett tweets and Roseanne cancellation|a comment]] on [[Twitter]] that was described by the network's president as being "abhorrent, repugnant, and inconsistent with our values."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/29/abc-cancels-roseanne-after-barrs-racist-tweet.html|title=ABC cancels 'Roseanne' after Barr's racist tweet|author=Sasha Savitsky|date=May 29, 2018|website=[[Fox News]]|access-date = May 30, 2018|quote=Just hours after Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet about former President Obama's aide Valerie Jarrett, her wildly popular reboot of 'Roseanne' was given the boot.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/abc-cancels-roseanne-after-roseanne-barrs-tweet-about-valerie-jarrett-1527618053 |title = ABC Cancels 'Roseanne' Sitcom Hours After Star's Racist Tweet |last1 = Flint |first1 = Joe |last2 = Fritz |first2 = Ben |date = May 29, 2018|website=[[Wall Street Journal]]|access-date = May 30, 2018 |quote=Walt Disney Co.'s ABC canceled the sitcom 'Roseanne' on Tuesday after its star sent a tweet many considered racist about a top aide of former President Barack Obama, a stunning end for a hit show that had quickly become the centerpiece of the network's prime-time schedule.}}</ref><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/media/roseanne-twitter-chelsea-clinton/index.html|title = ABC cancels 'Roseanne' after star's Twitter comments |last1 = Pallotta |first1 = Frank |date = May 29, 2018 |work = CNN Money |access-date = May 29, 2018 |last2 = Stelter |first2 = Brian |quote = ABC canceled its hit sitcom 'Roseanne' on Tuesday after the show's biggest star, Roseanne Barr, went on a racist Twitter rant. }}</ref><ref name="nyt-cancelled05182" /><ref name=":3">{{cite news |url = https://www.thedailybeast.com/roseanne-valerie-jarrett-chelsea-clinton-george-soros-racist-twitter |title = ABC Cancels Roseanne's Show Over Her 'Repugnant' Racist Tirade |last = Arciga |first = Julia |date = May 29, 2018 |work = The Daily Beast |access-date = May 29, 2018 |quote = Roseanne Barr on Tuesday morning went on a shocking Twitter tirade, describing former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett in a racist and Islamophobic manner, ultimately resulting in ABC canceling her show.}}</ref> On June 21, 2018, ABC announced plans to re-tool the show as a spin-off involving the Conner family without Roseanne Barr, entitled ''[[The Conners]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/21/media/abc-the-conners-roseanne-barr/index.html|title='The Conners' is happening, without Roseanne Barr, ABC says|last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=2018-06-21 |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=2018-06-21}}</ref> The new program premiered in October 2018.

Werner had suggested that they take a chance on Barr whom they had seen on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. This was because he saw the unique "in your face" voice that they were looking for and he contacted her agent and offered her the role. Barr's act at the time was the persona of the "domestic goddess", but as Carsey and Werner explains, she had the distinctive voice and attitude for the character and she was able to transform herself into the working class heroine they envisioned.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/marcy-carsey# |title = Marcy Carsey |work = [[Archive of American Television]] |access-date = April 20, 2015 }}</ref> Many early scripts were written by women: [[Grace McKeaney]], Lauren Eve Anderson, and Laurie Gelman, and directed by [[Ellen Gittelsohn]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094540/fullcredits/ |title = Roseanne (TV Series 1988–2018) |access-date = May 31, 2018 |via = www.imdb.com }}</ref>

==Premise==
The series is centered on the Conners, an American [[Working class|working-class]] family struggling to get by on a limited household income in their home at 714 Delaware Street in the drab fictional mid-state [[Commuter town#Exurbs|exurb]] of Lanford, Illinois. Although initially nominally located in [[Fulton County, Illinois|Fulton County]], several hours away from Chicago, later on-air references over the years suggested the town is in the vicinity of [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]], [[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], and [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]], all of which are much closer to [[Chicago]].<ref>In "Vegas Interruptus" Jackie states that Lanford is "an hour and half drive to Chicago"</ref> In a 2018 interview, Barr stated that the series setting was based on Elgin.<ref name=2018thr>Rose, Lacey (February 21, 2018). [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/roseanne-returns-is-tv-ready-a-trump-loving-comic-nothing-left-prove-1086651 Roseanne Returns: Is TV Ready for a Trump-Loving Comic With "Nothing Left to Prove"?] ''The Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved February 22, 2018. "The town that ours is based on — Elgin, Illinois — is changing. It was majority white, now it's majority Hispanic. We went and interviewed people there."</ref> The family consisted of outspoken Roseanne, married to husband Dan, and their three children: Becky, Darlene, and DJ. Later in the series, Roseanne and Dan have their fourth child, Jerry Garcia Conner.

Many critics considered the show notable as one of the first sitcoms to realistically portray a [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] American family with two parents working outside the home, as well as lead characters who were noticeably overweight without their weight being the target of jokes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Tucker |first = Ken |title = And Away She Goes |journal = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher = [[Time Inc.]] |issue = 377 |date = May 2, 1997 |url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287723,00.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last = James |first = Caryn |title = 'Roseanne' and the Risks of Upward Mobility |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] |date = May 18, 1997 |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E2D71E39F93BA25756C0A961958260 }}</ref>

[[Establishing shot]]s were photographed in [[Evansville, Indiana]], the hometown of first-season producer [[Matt Williams (TV producer)|Matt Williams]]. Exterior shots of the Conner household were based on a real home located in Evansville, located at 619 S. Runnymeade Avenue, a few blocks from Williams' alma mater, the [[University of Evansville]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Roseanne House For Sale in Evansville |url = http://1061evansville.com/roseanne-house-for-sale-in-evansville |work = 106.1 KISS FM |access-date = January 31, 2018 }}</ref>

Barr's real-life brother and sister are [[Homosexuality|gay]], which inspired her to push for introducing gay characters and issues into the show. "My show seeks to portray various slices of life, and homosexuals are a reality," said Barr.<ref name="Doty 122">{{cite book |last=Doty |first=Alexander |title=Making Things Perfectly Queer: Interpreting Mass Culture |date=1993 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-2244-2 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMtihv99wSYC&q=%22slices+of+life%22}}</ref> Provocative storylines have been an integral part of the series throughout its existence; Barr has stated that they were issues that working-class Americans experience in their everyday lives and that very few scripted programs ever address them.<ref name=2018thr />

== Original series ==

=== Season 1 ===
Roseanne ([[Roseanne Barr]]) is a line worker at Wellman Plastics, along with her sister Jackie ([[Laurie Metcalf]]) and friend Crystal ([[Natalie West]]). Jackie has a brief relationship with Booker ([[George Clooney]]), the foreman at Wellman. Dan ([[John Goodman]]) finds sporadic work as a construction contractor and faces a strained relationship with his irresponsible and womanizing father ([[Ned Beatty]]). Roseanne's parents, Beverly ([[Estelle Parsons]]) and Al ([[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]]), consider moving to Lanford, but eventually decide against it.

Tomboy Darlene ([[Sara Gilbert]]) struggles with her femininity as she enters puberty and gets her first period. Becky ([[Lecy Goranson]]) faces dating problems with her first boyfriend Chip ([[Jared Rushton]]), who is introduced in the "Lover's Lane" episode. Season one also finds the Conners experiencing, and surviving, a tornado. In the "Death and Stuff" episode a door-to-door salesman dies in the Conners' kitchen, and in the season finale, Roseanne stands up to a new foreman ([[Fred Thompson]]), when she leads Jackie, Crystal, and other coworkers as they quit Wellman Plastics. DJ is played by Sal Barone in the pilot episode and by [[Michael Fishman]] for the remainder of the series. There is a running gag in this season where they use the word "corn" in every episode.<ref name="mbc">{{cite web |url = http://www.museum.tv/eotv/roseanne.htm |title = Rosanne |publisher = [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne – The Complete First Season |work = [[DVD Talk]] |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17422/roseanne-the-complete-first-season |access-date = August 16, 2010 }}</ref>

Other notable guest stars during the season include [[William Sadler (actor)|Bill Sadler]] as Dwight, Dan's friend, [[Robert Harper (actor)|Robert Harper]] as Chip's father, Andrea Walters as Chip's mother, and [[J Anthony Crane|Tony Crane]] as "The Tongue Bandit", Becky's other boyfriend. Bill Pentland, Roseanne Barr's first husband, made a cameo as one of Dan's friends in the "Saturday" episode.

=== Season 2 ===
After quitting Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie must find new jobs. Jackie applies to be a police officer. Roseanne cycles through a variety of menial jobs including telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, a cashier at a fast-food restaurant, and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) makes a startling debut when he plants a kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence that has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at [[Thanksgiving]] dinner, Dan notices a growing romance between his father and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with her new boyfriend, Gary ([[Brian Kerwin]]). Becky grows rebellious against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority, staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet and getting drunk with her friend, Dana, when Dan and Roseanne leave town for the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy, Ziggy ([[Jay O. Sanders]]), reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene shows writing talent when she wins recognition for her poem. Roseanne's own writing talents are given a boost when Dan builds a room in the basement to serve as a writer's den. This is the first season Roseanne is heard thinking out loud.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne – The Complete Second Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19096/roseanne-the-complete-second-season |access-date = August 16, 2010 }}</ref>

Other notable guest stars during the season include [[Stephen Dorff]] as Becky's boyfriend Jimmy, [[Jenny Lewis]] as Becky's friend Diane, [[Stephen Root]] as Roseanne's lawyer Peter, and [[Bert Parks]] as a judge. [[Ann Wedgeworth]] played Dan Conner's mother in the Thanksgiving episode.

=== Season 3 ===
The season opens with the Conner women confronting a possible pregnancy: Roseanne takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a waitress job in the luncheonette at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets her boss, Leon ([[Martin Mull]]), and co-worker, Bonnie ([[Bonnie Bramlett|Bonnie Sheridan]]). Jackie gets injured on the job, which results in her leaving the police force and breaking up with Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy ([[Glenn Quinn]]); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father Ed and Crystal's plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed's baby.

Roseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy ([[Meagen Fay]]). Bev's mother, Nana Mary ([[Shelley Winters]]) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While they attempt to procure a loan for business, Ziggy backs out and leaves town, not wanting Dan and Roseanne to risk their house if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money behind for Dan to open it by himself. He is never heard about again.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne – The Complete Third Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20924/roseanne-the-complete-third-season |access-date = August 16, 2010 }}</ref>

Other notable guest stars during the season include Dann Florek as Principal Hiller, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Darlene's classmate, [[Brad Garrett]] as Doug, [[Judy Gold]] as Amy, [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Becky's friend Jan, and [[Tobey Maguire]] as Jeff.

=== Season 4 ===
The opening credits of Season 4 change from Season 3 in that the show now stars "Roseanne Arnold" instead of "Roseanne Barr".

Becky surprises Roseanne by asking for birth-control pills. Dan and Roseanne begin their new motorcycle repair shop business, Lanford Custom Cycle, while Roseanne continues working at Rodbell's luncheonette.

After a brief stint working at Rodbell's perfume counter, Jackie decides to become a truck driver. Nancy ([[Sandra Bernhard]]) is introduced as Arnie's fiancée. After a night of heavy drinking, Jackie discovers she slept with the newly engaged Arnie. Darlene's personality shifts into a sullen [[Goth subculture|goth]] teen. Jackie's former boyfriend, Booker, makes a surprise appearance at a Halloween party. Roseanne's neighbors, Kathy and Jerry Bowman, move back to Chicago. Roseanne gets [[breast reduction]] surgery. Crystal gives birth to Dan's new half-brother, "Little Ed". Roseanne and Dan accompany Arnie and Nancy to their wedding in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. At the end of the season, Lanford Custom Cycle fails, and Rodbell's Luncheonette closes.

=== Season 5 ===
After the bike shop closes, Mark accepts a job in [[Minnesota]]. Becky secretly decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each receive $10,000 from their mother after she divorces their father. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the additional money they need from Bev, who becomes a partner. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father, and his two teen daughters ([[Wings Hauser]], [[Mara Hobel]], [[Danielle Harris]]), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher ([[Matt Roth (actor)|Matt Roth]]), a much younger man. When Roseanne discovers Fisher physically abused Jackie, Dan beats him up (never shown onscreen) and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to discover her father blamed his daughters for his abusive behavior. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie ([[Joan Collins]]) visits and persuades Darlene to get her [[General Educational Development|GED]] and apply to an art school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in when his mother is moving away. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne witnesses David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive to him, she decides to let him stay, a decision partially made due to her own father's abusiveness. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a business deal to renovate and sell a small [[fixer-upper]] house, then skips town, leaving Dan with a looming debt; Jackie buys the house, saving the Conners from financial ruin. David is rejected from the art school in Chicago he and Darlene applied to, while Darlene is accepted. Roseanne refuses to let Darlene go before finishing high school. She fears Darlene might run away to Chicago, but Darlene has already decided not to go to the school because David was rejected. Roseanne relents and wants Darlene to attend and not stay to be with David.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Roseanne – The Complete Fifth Season|website=DVD Talk|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23884/roseanne-the-complete-fifth-season|access-date=August 16, 2010 }}</ref> During this season, there is a running gag in which each of the Conners (save Becky) appears in a different scene in the same long-sleeved, egg-printed shirt with a large chicken on the front.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Season 6 ===
After Roseanne and Jackie pressure Bev to only be a silent partner in the diner, Bev retaliates by selling her share to Roseanne's former boss, Leon. David proposes marriage to Darlene, but she refuses. Dan and Roseanne discover an old marijuana stash in the basement and smoke it in their bathroom. Roseanne's past as an abuse victim arises when she reacts violently to DJ after he [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]] and wrecks her car, leaving her concerned she may be continuing the cycle. Becky (now played by [[Sarah Chalke]]) and Mark return home and move into the Conners' house. Mark goes to trade school but soon drops out.

Roseanne visits a gay bar with Nancy, where she receives a surprise kiss from Nancy's girlfriend. Jackie gives birth to a son, Andy. Dan confronts his mother's history of mental illness. The season concludes with Fred and Jackie's wedding.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Roseanne – The Complete Sixth Season|website=DVD Talk|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25659/roseanne-the-complete-sixth-season|access-date = August 16, 2010}}</ref>

=== Season 7 ===
The opening credits of Season 7 change from previous seasons in that the show now stars “Roseanne” instead of “Roseanne Arnold”.
On the September 21, 1994 Season 7 premiere, in celebrating Roseanne's divorce and dropping her last name, all credits (opening and closing) included the cast and crew's first names only. This was the only time this occurred in an episode during its run.

Season seven begins with Roseanne's pregnancy and goes on to tackle such issues as abortion, alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual dysfunction, and racial prejudice. Darlene and David break up after briefly maintaining an open relationship, leading to some awkwardness for Roseanne and Dan as they try to deal with living with their daughter's ex-boyfriend. David and Darlene both date other people, but eventually, they reunite. Due to tension in the household, Mark and Becky move into a trailer. DJ plays a bigger role this season, most notably in an episode wherein he refuses to kiss a black girl in his school play.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne – The Complete Seventh Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27621/roseanne-the-complete-seventh-season/ |access-date = August 16, 2010 }}</ref> Episode 19 is a special 45-minute show that recounts all the previous seasons with Roseanne being “welcomed” by other sitcom moms.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Notable guest stars during the season include [[Sharon Stone]] as a trailer-park resident, [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Jackie and Fred's psychologist, [[Danny Masterson]] as Darlene's boyfriend Jimmy, [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as DJ's friend George, and [[Traci Lords]] as Lanford Lunch Box busperson Stacy. In the season finale, a tribute is made to [[Sherwood Schwartz]]. Uncredited appearances at the end of the episode have ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' cast members playing Roseanne characters. These include [[Dawn Wells]], [[Bob Denver]], [[Tina Louise]], and [[Russell Johnson]], as well as Sherwood Schwartz. Also, [[Isabel Sanford]], [[Alley Mills]], [[Barbara Billingsley]], [[June Lockhart]], and [[Pat Crowley]] appear as themselves in another episode.

=== Season 8 ===
Season eight addresses Roseanne's baby shower and the subsequent arrival of her son, [[Jerry Garcia]] Conner. (In a [[Continuity (fiction)#Continuity errors|continuity]] error, the baby had been revealed to be a girl in season seven. Roseanne, in an after-credits out of character scene, explains that “the amnio was wrong.”). The season starts when Dan decides to leave the security of his city job to help build the new prison being constructed outside of Lanford. With the pension, final check, and retirement money he receives for leaving his job he decides to give his family the vacation they never had and takes everyone, including Mark, David, and Roseanne's mother, along to [[Walt Disney World]].

It is later revealed that one of the nights the clan was at Disney World, Darlene got pregnant. Darlene quickly decides she and David want to have the baby and the two get engaged. The season climaxes with a very rushed wedding for the couple. Immediately after the ceremony, realizing how much has been changing, Dan suffers a heart attack. In the next episode, it is revealed that he survived, with DJ saving his life. The season concludes with Dan and Roseanne having a bitter fight after Dan refuses to stick to his diet and exercise plan, rehashing many of the buried personality clashes of the entire series. They end up wrecking their living room in the process. The credits fade as Roseanne walks out on Dan.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne: Season Eight |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/29559/roseanne-season-eight |access-date = August 16, 2010 }}</ref>

Notable guest stars during the season include [[Fred Willard]] as Leon's husband Scott, [[Ed McMahon]] as himself, [[John Popper]] (with [[Blues Traveler]]) as an old friend of Dan's, [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] as himself, [[Jenna Elfman]] as hitchhiker Garland, [[Shecky Greene]] as Bar Mitzvah guest Uncle Saul, [[Norm Crosby]] as Reverend Crosley, [[June Lockhart]] as Leon's mother, [[Milton Berle]] as a transvestite, the cast of [[Stomp (theatrical show)|Stomp]] as Lanford Lunch Box patrons, [[Eric Dane]] as a Disney World bellhop, and [[Tony Curtis]] as ballroom-dance instructor Hal.

=== Season 9 ===
The opening titles of Season 9 still say the show stars "Roseanne", but the first episode credits her as "Roseanne Barr Pentland Arnold Thomas".

The ninth (and originally final) season features many changes. In previous seasons, the original theme song was played on [[saxophone]], accompanied by drums and other instruments. For this final season, the theme was re-recorded and performed by [[Blues Traveler]] with a distorted harmonica—one of the band's staples—playing in place of the saxophone. Lyrics were also added and sung into the theme by the band's lead vocalist, [[John Popper]]. Episodes in this season exhibit a much more surreal style. Additionally, the 'daily struggle' theme of previous episodes is abandoned, and the season focuses primarily on bringing the characters full circle emotionally.

The Conners win the state [[lottery]] jackpot of $108 million; Dan ponders the meaning of life, Jackie meets her prince, DJ finds love, and Darlene, after some trouble, gives birth. John Goodman is absent for most of the season, as he was busy filming ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''; in later episodes, Goodman resembles his "Lebowski" character Walter Sobchak.

In the season's final episode, Roseanne reveals the entire series itself is actually a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the season. In reality, Dan's heart attack near the end of Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. A story arc running through the final season, that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair, is revealed to be false. We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't having an affair, but dying.

Roseanne could always take the worst life could throw at her with a laugh, but she could not handle Dan's death. Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer whom Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon—who she claims isn't very hip the way she had written him to be; this seems a tad tongue in cheek.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Roseanne: The Complete Ninth Season |work = DVD Talk |url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/31275/roseanne-the-complete-ninth-season |access-date = August 16, 2010 }}</ref> Becky is dating David and Darlene is with Mark.

Guest stars during the season include [[Edward Asner]] as [[Lou Grant]], [[Heather Matarazzo]] as D.J.’s girlfriend, Dann Florek as Doctor Rudmen, [[Jim Varney]] as Jackie's boyfriend Prince Carlos, [[Tammy Faye Messner|Tammy Faye Bakker]] as Roseanne's makeup consultant, [[Dina Merrill]] as Doris, [[Joanna Lumley]] as [[Absolutely Fabulous|Patsy Stone]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]] as [[Absolutely Fabulous|Edina Monsoon]] (reprising their roles from ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''), [[Arianna Huffington]] as Estree, [[Marlo Thomas]] as Tina, [[James Brolin]] as Roseanne's business partner/love interest Edgar Wellman, Jr., and [[Ann Wedgeworth]] and [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Dan's mother Audrey, as well as [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Robin Leach]], [[Todd Oldham]], [[Moon Unit]] and [[Ahmet Zappa]], [[Tony Robbins]], [[Kathleen Sullivan (journalist)|Kathleen Sullivan]], [[Steven Seagal]], and [[Jerry Springer]] as themselves.

During the show's final season, Barr was in negotiations with [[Carsey-Werner Productions]] and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bill Carter|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0DE123DF937A35757C0A961958260 |title = Roseanne to Continue on TV But Is Expected to Leave ABC |newspaper = New York Times|date=April 4, 1997|access-date=February 18, 2011 }}</ref> However, ABC withdrew from negotiations with Carsey-Werner and Barr after failed discussions with CBS and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

In the fall of 2008, Barr commented on what the current whereabouts of the Conners would be. "I've always said now that if they were on TV, DJ would have been killed in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and the Conners would have lost their house". When asked for more details on where the rest of the Conners would be, Barr responded: "Your question is [[intellectual property]] that may be developed later, so I don't want to get into that". She added, "No preview, absolutely not".<ref>{{cite news|author=Tanner Stransky|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/03/roseanne-barr-c.html|title=Roseanne's new sitcom: Could she be resurrecting the Connors?|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 25, 2009|access-date=February 18, 2011}}</ref>

''Roseanne''{{'}}s tenth and final season premiered on March 27, 2018, with two back-to-back episodes on ABC. The premiere begins 20 years after the previous episode, with Season 9 and the final episode being almost completely retconned out of existence as both a dream of and a story by Roseanne; namely Dan's death, when he is actually alive. A now separated and unemployed Darlene moves back into the Conner household with her two children Harris (whose existence is the only surviving element from Season 9, although the character is several years younger) and Mark (whose gender presentation is cause for conflict).

Roseanne and Dan have lost weight but are now on medication. DJ has served a tour in the Army and now has a daughter named Mary (with DJ's wife still serving abroad) and Jerry is away in Alaska on a fishing boat. When the first episode begins, Roseanne and Jackie haven't spoken since the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] (Roseanne having voted for [[Donald Trump]] while Jackie voted for [[Jill Stein]] despite her having no idea who Stein was, describing her as "some doctor"), although the two are reconciled after intervention by Darlene. Meanwhile, desperate for money, Becky, who has been struggling to make ends meet after the death of her husband Mark, agrees to act as a surrogate mother for a woman named Andrea ([[Sarah Chalke]]) which is opposed by Roseanne and Dan since Becky's eggs will be used for the pregnancy.

U.S. president [[Donald Trump]], whom Roseanne Barr has publicly supported, phoned to congratulate her on the success of the premiere. Barr described the call as being "pretty exciting", stating in an interview on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' that Trump "really knows ratings and how they measure things". She commented that the show would continue to address current U.S. issues, hoping that it would "[open] up civil conversation between people instead of just mudslinging."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5220243/roseanne-barr-trump-call/ |title = President Trump Made a Personal Call to Roseanne Barr|website=Time|access-date=May 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/donald-trump-roseanne-call-ratings|title=Donald Trump Called Roseanne to Congratulate Her on His Favorite Thing: Huge TV Ratings|author=Yohana Desta|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=May 29, 2018}}</ref>

On May 29, 2018, Barr posted a message on [[Twitter]] reading "muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj."

Shortly before the cancellation was announced by ABC, Barr – who attributed the tweet about Jarrett and others made earlier that day to side effects from the sleep aid [[Zolpidem|Ambien]], a claim derided by many critics as well as by the drug's manufacturer, [[Sanofi]], in a public statement responding to Barr's reasoning<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wolfson |first1=Sam |title=Ambien maker responds to Roseanne Barr: 'Racism is not a known side effect' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/30/roseanne-ambien-racism-tweet-side-effect-response-sanofi |access-date=June 1, 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> – apologized for the remarks, saying, "I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me – my joke was in bad taste." Hours after the cancellation announcement, ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' later released a longer apology to Jarrett, the network and her show's cast and crew: "I deeply regret my comments from late last night on Twitter. Above all, I want to apologize to Valerie Jarrett, as well as to ABC and the cast and crew of the ''Roseanne'' show. I am sorry for making a thoughtless joke that does not reflect my values — I love all people and am very sorry. Today my words caused hundreds of hardworking people to lose their jobs. I also sincerely apologize to the audience that has embraced my work for decades. I apologize from the bottom of my heart and hope that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me." However, she would later retweet posts defending her, as well as another concerning the conspiracy theory of Soros being a Nazi collaborator.<ref name="tvguide-roseannecancelled" />

Some time after the cancellation was confirmed, some news sources announced that the show could possibly be re-tooled as a spin-off focusing on Sara Gilbert's character of Darlene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/darlene-roseanne-cancellation-spinoff/|title=These ''Roseanne'' Fans Want a Darlene Spinoff, and It Might Just Happen|first=Amanda|last=Bell|work=TV Guide|date=June 3, 2018|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/06/01/roseanne-spinoff-darlene-sara-gilbert-abc-renewed/|title=''Roseanne'' Lives?

Ratings slowly started slipping after season six, though the show stayed within the top 10 through season seven, falling to the top 20 during season eight.  ''Roseanne'' dropped to 35th place during the ninth and final season of its original run.

The premiere of the revival (season 10) set records for Nielsen's delayed viewing metrics; it was seen by 18.45 million live and same day viewers, but gained an additional 6.59 viewers via Live+3 metrics—the largest-ever increase in total viewership from three days of delayed viewing since the 2014 premiere of fellow ABC series ''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]''. 2.2 million additional viewers were added over the following four days (totaling 27.26 million viewers overall), resulting in a net increase of 8.81 million viewers in the week since the premiere broadcast. This established a record for the largest ratings gain from Live+7 viewership, previously set by the premiere of fellow ABC series ''[[The Good Doctor (TV series)|The Good Doctor]]'' in September 2017. The tenth and final season ranked in the top 5 in the Nelson ratings.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://deadline.com/2018/04/roseanne-revival-premiere-ratings-records-in-live7-viewing-1202358977/ |title = 'Roseanne' Revival Premiere Sets More Ratings Records In Live+7 Viewing |first = Nellie |last = Andreeva |date = April 5, 2018 |website = deadline.com |access-date = May 10, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/roseanne-ratings-climb-hit-25-million-viewers-time-shifting-record-1098904 |title = 'Roseanne' Ratings Climb, Hit 25 Million Viewers With Time-Shifting Record |website = hollywoodreporter.com |access-date = May 10, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://deadline.com/2018/04/roseanne-premiere-ratings-live3-total-viewer-lift-record-1202356769/ |title = 'Roseanne' Premiere Sets Live+3 Total Viewer Lift Record |first = Nellie |last = Andreeva |date = April 2, 2018 |website = deadline.com |access-date = May 10, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1 = Andreeva |first1 = Nellie |title = 'Roseanne' Revival's Huge Debut Stuns Hollywood, Prompts Soul-Searching |url = https://deadline.com/2018/03/roseanne-revival-huge-ratings-premiere-stuns-hollywood-prompts-soul-searching-1202354973/ |website = [[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher = [[Penske Media Corporation]] |access-date = March 29, 2018 |date = March 28, 2018 }}</ref>

[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] aired [[rerun]]s of ''Roseanne'' from 1996 through 2004. Cable channel [[Nick at Nite]] aired reruns of the show from the fall of 2003 until 2009; it has since moved to [[TV Land]]'s "TV Land Prime" schedule. [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] aired reruns for several years under the ownership of Carsey-Werner before its 2007 acquisition by [[NBCUniversal]]. The show returned to Nick at Nite's lineup on October 5, 2009, replacing ''[[Family Matters]]'' and ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' in its late-night timeslot. As of January 2010, Nick at Nite has once again taken ''Roseanne'' from its time slot. In Australia, the show is seen on the channel [[111 Hits]] and [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]]. In the UK, it aired in reruns on [[Channel 4]].

It is available through [[Amazon Prime Video]], [[Hoopla (digital media service)|Hoopla]], and [[Pluto TV]].

==Home media==
[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] (later named Starz Home Entertainment, as shown on the DVD packaging for seasons 7 - 9) released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 1 (2005–2007) and Region 2. The first season was issued with shorter, syndicated versions of the episodes because Anchor Bay was unable to obtain permission to release the original broadcasts. This issue was rectified upon release of the first season DVD, and Anchor Bay went on to release seasons 2 - 7 in their original uncut form. However, for the eighth and ninth season DVDs, some scenes have been altered to avoid disputes over music rights, including substituting some closing credit scenes with a black screen, including the Patty Duke parody from Season 8, Episode 1.

On May 4, 2011, [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] announced that they had acquired the rights to re-release the series uncut on DVD in Region 1. They have subsequently re-released all nine seasons and a complete series set with the first seven seasons in their uncut form.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-1-and-2/15591 |title = Roseanne DVD news: Announcement for Roseanne – The Complete 1st Season and Roseanne – The Complete 2nd Season |publisher = [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]] |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021135214/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-1-and-2/15591 |archive-date = October 21, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-3-and-4/16574 |title = Roseanne DVD news: Announcement for The Complete 3rd Season and The Complete 4th Season |website = Tvshowsondvd.com |access-date = April 20, 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150423033859/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-3-and-4/16574 |archive-date = April 23, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-5-and-6/17228 |title = Roseanne DVD news: Announcement for Roseanne – 'The Complete 5th Season' and 'The Complete 6th Season' from Mill Creek |publisher = TVShowsOnDVD.com |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130204181105/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-5-and-6/17228 |archive-date = February 4, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-7-and-8/17955 |title = Roseanne DVD news: Announcement for Roseanne – Season 7 and Roseanne – Season 8 |website = Tvshowsondvd.com |access-date = April 20, 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150926073004/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-Seasons-7-and-8/17955 |archive-date = September 26, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-The-Complete-Series/18206 |title = Roseanne DVD news: Announcement for Season 9 and The Complete Series – TVShowsOnDVD.com |website = Tvshowsondvd.com |access-date = April 20, 2015 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235847/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Roseanne-The-Complete-Series/18206 |archive-date = April 26, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Seasons 8 and 9 are still edited; while most of the music references were retained, some of the credit scenes are still missing.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.sitcomsonline.com/roseanneseason8millcreekdvdreview.html |title = Roseanne – The Complete Eighth Season (Mill Creek) DVD Review – Sitcoms Online |website = Sitcomsonline.com |access-date = February 12, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.sitcomsonline.com/roseanneseason9millcreekdvdreview.html |title = Roseanne – The Complete Ninth Season (Mill Creek) DVD Review – Sitcoms Online |website = Sitcomsonline.com |access-date = February 12, 2017 }}</ref>

Footage from ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' is excluded from an eighth-season episode, for unknown reasons.

In Australia and New Zealand, [[Magna Pacific]] has released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 4. Unlike the Anchor Bay releases, Magna Pacific's first season DVDs include the full-length original broadcast episodes.
