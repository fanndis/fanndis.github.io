==History==
[[File:Old Town House.GIF|thumb|left| Old Town House, 1790]]
The area that would become Concord was originally settled thousands of years ago by [[Abenaki]] Native Americans called the [[Pennacook]].<ref name="Lyford">{{cite book|last=Lyford|first=James|author2=Amos Hadley|author3=Howard F.

The stream was also the transportation route for their [[birch bark]] canoes, which could travel from [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The broad sweep of the Merrimack River valley [[floodplain]] provided good soil for farming [[bean]]s, [[gourd]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, [[melon]]s and [[maize]].

The area was first settled in 1659 as "Penacook".<ref>"Concord, NH" NHES. https://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/products/cp/profiles-htm/concord.htm</ref> On January 17, 1725, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which then claimed territories west of the Merrimack River, granted the Concord area as the Plantation of Penacook.<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|107}} It was settled between 1725 and 1727 by Captain Ebenezer Eastman and others from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. On February 9, 1734, the town was incorporated as "Rumford",<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|147}} from which [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]] would take his title. It was renamed "Concord" in 1765 by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] following a bitter boundary dispute between Rumford and the town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]]; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jacob|title=Annals of the Town of Concord|publisher=Jacob B. Moore|year=1824|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=31–34}}</ref> Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In 1779, New Pennacook Plantation was granted to Timothy Walker Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in 1800 as [[Rumford, Maine]], the site of Pennacook Falls.

Concord grew in prominence throughout the 18th century, and some of the earliest houses from this period survive at [[Concord Historic District|the northern end of Main Street]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail/c0dfaee3-eae5-4738-b57b-4c10691b0158|title=National Register of Historic Places: Concord Historic District|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> In the years following the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a [[canal]] and [[lock (water transport)|lock]] system to allow vessels passage around the [[Amoskeag Falls]] downriver, connecting Concord with [[Boston]] by way of the [[Middlesex Canal]]. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government.<ref name="Lyford" />{{rp|324–326}} The 1819 [[New Hampshire State House|State House]] is the oldest capitol in the nation in which the state's legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for [[furniture]]-making and [[granite]] [[quarry]]ing. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form [[Abbot-Downing Company|Abbot and Downing]].<ref name=Lyford/>{{rp|339–340}} Their most famous product was their [[Concord coach]], widely used in the development of the [[American West]]. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the [[railroad]] industry, with Penacook a [[textile]] manufacturing center using [[hydropower|water power]] from the [[Contoocook River]]. Today, the city is a center for health care and several [[insurance company|insurance companies]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|174.8|sqkm|order=flip}}. {{convert|166.4|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is land and {{convert|8.4|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is water, comprising 4.79% of the city.<ref name="Census 2010"/> Concord is drained by the [[Merrimack River]]. [[Penacook Lake]] is in the west. The highest point in Concord is {{convert|860|ft}} above sea level on Oak Hill, just west of the hill's {{convert|970|ft|adj=on}} summit in neighboring [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]].

Concord lies fully within the Merrimack River [[Drainage basin|watershed]],<ref name=watershed>{{cite book |title=Water Use in New Hampshire: An Activities Guide for Teachers |url=http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |last=Foster |first=Debra H. |author2=Batorfalvy, Tatianna N. |author3=Medalie, Laura |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey |year=1995 |access-date=2007-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717004543/http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is centered on the river, which runs from northwest to southeast through the city. Downtown is located on a low terrace to the west of the river, with residential neighborhoods climbing hills to the west and extending southwards towards the town of Bow. To the east of the Merrimack, atop a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} bluff, is a flat, sandy plain known as Concord Heights, which has seen most of the city's commercial development since 1960. The eastern boundary of Concord (with the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]]) is formed by the [[Soucook River]], a tributary of the Merrimack. The [[Turkey River (New Hampshire)|Turkey River]] winds through the southwestern quarter of the city, passing through the campus of St. Paul's School before entering the Merrimack River in Bow. In the northern part of the city, the [[Contoocook River]] enters the Merrimack at the village of Penacook.

===Climate===
Concord, as with much of New England, is within the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''), with long, cold, snowy winters, very warm (and at times humid) summers, and relatively brief autumns and springs. In winter, successive storms deliver light to moderate snowfall amounts, contributing to the relatively reliable snow cover. In addition, lows reach at least {{convert|0|°F|0}} on an average 15 nights per year, and the city straddles the border between [[Hardiness zone|USDA Hardiness Zone]] 5b and 6a.<ref>[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=03301&submit=Look+it+up%21 The Arbor Day Foundation]. Arborday.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.</ref> However, thaws are frequent, with one to three days per month with {{convert|50|°F}}+ highs from December to February. Summer can bring stretches of humid conditions as well as thunderstorms, and there is an average of 12 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually. The window for freezing temperatures on average begins on September 27 and expires on May 14.<ref name = "NWS Gray/Portland, ME (GYX)"/>

The monthly daily average temperature range from {{convert|20.6|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.0|°F|1}} in July. Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|−37|°F|0}} in February 1943 to {{convert|102|°F|0}} in July 1966.

===Highways===
[[Interstate 89]] and [[Interstate 93]] are the two main interstate highways serving Concord, and join just south of the city limits. Interstate 89 links Concord with [[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]] and the state of [[Vermont]] to the northwest, while Interstate 93 connects the city to [[Plymouth, New Hampshire|Plymouth]], [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], and the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] to the north and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and [[Boston]] to the south. [[Interstate 393]] is a spur highway leading east from Concord and merging with [[U.S. Route 4 in New Hampshire|U.S. Route 4]] as a direct route to New Hampshire's [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast region]]. North-south [[U.S. Route 3#New Hampshire|U.S. Route 3]] serves as Concord's Main Street, while [[U.S. Route 202#New Hampshire|U.S. Route 202]] and [[New Hampshire Route 9]] cross the city from east to west. State routes [[New Hampshire Route 13|13]] and [[New Hampshire Route 132|132]] also serve the city: Route 13 leads southwest out of Concord towards [[Goffstown, New Hampshire|Goffstown]] and [[Milford, New Hampshire|Milford]], while Route 132 travels north parallel to Interstate 93. [[New Hampshire Route 106]] passes through the easternmost part of Concord, crossing I-393 and NH 9 before crossing the [[Soucook River]] south into the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]]. To the north, NH 106 leads to [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]], [[Belmont, New Hampshire|Belmont]] and [[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]].

===Bus===
Local bus service is provided by [[Concord Area Transit]] (CAT), with three routes through the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://concordareatransit.com/route-information/|title=Concord Area Transit: Route Information|access-date=February 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202101054/http://concordareatransit.com/route-information/|archive-date=February 2, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Regional bus service provided by [[Concord Coach Lines]] and [[Greyhound Lines]] is available from the Concord Transportation Center at 30 Stickney Avenue next to Exit 14 on Interstate 93, with service south to Boston and points in between, as well as north to [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]] and northeast to [[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]].

There is no passenger rail service to Concord.

General aviation services are available through [[Concord Municipal Airport]], located {{convert|2|mi|0}} east of downtown. There is no commercial air service within the city limits; the nearest such airport is [[Manchester–Boston Regional Airport]], located {{convert|23|mi}} to the south.

=== Complete Streets Improvement Project ===
Concord's downtown underwent a significant renovation between 2015 and 2016, during the city's "Complete Streets Improvement Project". At a proposed cost of $12 million, the project promised to deliver on categories of maintenance to aging [[infrastructure]], improved [[Accessibility (transport)|accessibility]], increased [[Sustainable urbanism|sustainability]], a safer experience for walkers, bikers and motorists alike, and to stimulate [[economic growth]] in an increasingly idle downtown.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Concord Streetscape|url=https://www.ibigroup.com/ibi-projects/concord-streetscape/|access-date=2020-11-19|website=IBI Group|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Concord Downtown Complete Streets Improvement Project: Benefit/Cost Analysis|url=https://www.concordnh.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1782/Summary---Main-Street?bidId=|website=City of Concord New Hampshire}}</ref> The main infrastructural change was reducing the four-lane street (two in each direction) to two lanes plus a turning lane in the center. The freed-up space would contribute to extra width for bikes to ride in either direction, increased curb size and an added median where there is no need for a turning lane.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Concord Downtown Complete Streets Improvement Project: FY2012 TIGER Discretionary Grant Application|url=http://nh-concord.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/1772/Application-Narrative?bidId=|website=City of Concord New Hampshire}}</ref> Concord opted to add [[Shared lane marking|shared lane markings]] for bikes, rather than a dedicated [[protected bike lane]].

By adding curb space, this project created new opportunities for pedestrians to enjoy the downtown. Many power lines were buried, and [[street trees]], colorful benches, art installations, and other [[Urban green space|green spaces]] were added, all allowing people to reclaim a space long dominated by cars.<ref name=":1" /> Main Street underwent serious [[traffic calming]], including a [[road diet]], increased diagonal parking, widening sidewalks, adding shared lane markings, adding trees, texturing medians and coloring crosswalks red.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Traffic Calming 101|url=https://www.pps.org/article/livememtraffic|access-date=2020-11-19|website=www.pps.org}}</ref> Another aspect of the new construction was adding heated sidewalk capabilities, utilizing excess steam from the local Concord Steam plant, and minimizing sand and snow blowing needed during the winter months.<ref name=":1" />

Funding for Complete Streets came from a combination of $4,710,000 from a [[Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery|USDOT TIGER grant]] and the rest from the City of Concord.<ref name=":1" /> The project was initially proposed as costing $7,850,000, but ran over budget due to overambitious ideas.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-06-27|title=Concord Main Street Project: Scaled Back, Still Over Budget|url=https://patch.com/new-hampshire/concord-nh/concord-main-street-project-scaled-back-still-over-budget|access-date=2020-11-19|website=Concord, NH Patch|language=en}}</ref> After scrapping some of the most expensive offenders, the budget ended up at $14.2 million, with the project actually coming in $1.1 million below that.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Reid|first=Nick|date=2017-02-19|title=Downtown: What's Concord doing with the Main Street Project surplus?|work=The Concord Monitor|url=https://www.concordmonitor.com/downtown-column-what-does-concord-nh-plan-to-do-with-the-Main-Street-Project-surplus-8123016}}</ref> Although adding final aesthetic touches with the extra money were debated, the city council ended up deciding to save for financially straining years ahead.<ref name=":2" /> The design was carried out by McFarland Johnson, IBI Group, and City of Concord Engineering.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Downtown Complete Street Design {{!}} Concord, NH|url=https://mjinc.com/mjweb/projects/17842_02|website=McFarland Johnson}}</ref>

The [[New Hampshire State House]], designed by architect Stuart Park and constructed between 1815 and 1818, is the oldest state house in which the legislature meets in its original chambers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/publications/documents/state_house_history.pdf|title=State House History|publisher=nh.gov|access-date=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006014218/https://www.nh.gov/nhdhr/publications/documents/state_house_history.pdf|archive-date=October 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The building was remodeled in 1866, and the third story and west wing were added in 1910.

Across from the State House is the [[Eagle Hotel (Concord, New Hampshire)|Eagle Hotel]] on Main Street, which has been a downtown landmark since its opening in 1827. [[U.S. President]]s [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Rutherford Hayes]], and [[Benjamin Harrison]] all dined there, and [[Franklin Pierce]] spent the night before departing for his inauguration. Other well-known guests included [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Richard M. Nixon]] (who carried New Hampshire in all three of his presidential bids), and [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The hotel closed in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1Q7R_Eagle_Hotel__Concord_NH|title=Eagle Hotel|publisher=waymarking.com|access-date=July 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501122727/http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM1Q7R_Eagle_Hotel__Concord_NH|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

South from the Eagle Hotel on Main Street is Phenix Hall, which  replaced "Old" Phenix Hall, which burned in 1893.

The only public middle school in the Concord School District is Rundlett Middle School, which has roughly 1,500 students. Concord School District's elementary schools underwent a major re-configuration in 2012, with three newly constructed schools opening and replacing six previous schools. [[Kimball School]] and Walker School were replaced by [[Christa McAuliffe]] School on the Kimball School site, Conant School (and Rumford School, which closed a year earlier) were replaced by Abbot-Downing School at the Conant site, and Eastman and Dame schools were replaced by Mill Brook School, serving kindergarten through grade two, located next to Broken Ground Elementary School, serving grades three to five. Beaver Meadow School, the remaining elementary school, was unaffected by the changes.

Concord schools in the Merrimack Valley School District include [[Merrimack Valley High School]] and Merrimack Valley Middle School, which are adjacent to each other and to Rolfe Park in Penacook village, and Penacook Elementary School, just south of the village.

Concord has two parochial schools, [[Bishop Brady High School]] and [[Saint John Regional School]].
