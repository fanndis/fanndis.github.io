During October 2009, Clinton said, "this is a great job. It is a 24/7 job"<ref name="wapo101309">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/12/AR2009101202868.html |title=Clinton Says No to Another Presidential Bid |author=Kornblut, Anne E. |author-link=Anne E.

By the close of 2009 there were 25 female ambassadors posted by other nations to Washington; this was the highest number ever.<ref name=hillaryeffect>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/10/AR2010011002731.html|title='Hillary effect' cited for increase in female ambassadors to U.S.|first=Mary|last=Jordan|work=The Washington Post|date=January 11, 2010}}</ref>
This was dubbed the "Hillary effect" by some observers: "Hillary Clinton is so visible" as secretary of state, said [[Amelia Matos Sumbana]], the [[Mozambique – United States relations|Mozambique Ambassador to the United States]], "she makes it easier for presidents to pick a woman for Washington."<ref name=hillaryeffect /> An added fact, of course, was that two other recent U.S. Secretaries of State were women, but Clinton's international fame from her days as First Lady of the United States made her impact in this respect the greatest of the group.<ref name=hillaryeffect />

Clinton also included in the State Department budget for the first time a breakdown of programs that specifically concerned themselves with the well-being of women and girls around the world.<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> By fiscal 2012, the department's budget request for such work was $1.2&nbsp;billion, of which $832&nbsp;million was for global health programs.<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> Additionally, she initiated the [[Women in Public Service Project]], a joint venture between the State Department and the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters colleges]]. The goal was to entice more women into entering public service, such that within four decades an equal number of men and women would be working in the field.<ref name="elle-2012" />

One specific cause Clinton advocated almost from the start of her tenure was the adoption of [[cookstove]]s in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women. In September 2010, she announced a partnership with the [[United Nations Foundation]] to provide some 100&nbsp;million such stoves around the world within the next ten years, and in subsequent travels she urged foreign leaders to adopt policies encouraging their use.<ref name="nytm-rock">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/hillary-clintons-last-tour-as-a-rock-star-diplomat.html |title=Last Tour of the Rock-Star Diplomat |author=Myers, Steven Lee |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=July 1, 2012 |pages=18–23, 49}}</ref>

In February 2010 testimony before the [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs|Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs]], Secretary Clinton complained about the slow pace of Senate confirmations of Obama's nominations to diplomatic positions, a number of which were delayed for political reasons and had been subject to [[Secret hold|holds]] by individual Republican senators.<ref name="abc022410">{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/washington-political-battles-hurt-us-image-and-obama-agenda-says-sec-clinton.html |title=Washington Political Battles Hurt U.S. Image and Obama Agenda, says Sec.

In 2009, and again in 2010 and 2011, Clinton stated that she was committed to serving out her full term as secretary, but would not commit to serving a second term should Obama be re-elected.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/hillary-clinton-wont-commit-to.html |title=Hillary Clinton reaffirms: I won't commit to a second term (video) |author=Kolawole, Emi |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 19, 2011 |access-date=February 4, 2011}}</ref>

She later used U.S. allies and what she called "convening power" to help keep the Libyan rebels unified as they eventually overthrew the [[Gaddafi regime]].<ref name="time-smart" />

Throughout her tenure, Clinton has looked towards "[[smart power]]" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values, combining military strength with U.S. capacities in global economics, development aid, and technology.<ref name="time-smart" /> In late 2011 she said, "All power has limits. In a much more networked and multipolar world we can't wave a magic wand and say to China or Brazil or India, 'Quit growing. Quit using your economies to assert power' ... It's up to us to figure out how we position ourselves to be as effective as possible at different times in the face of different threats and opportunities."<ref name="time-smart" />

Clinton has also greatly expanded the State Department's use of [[social media]], including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], both to get its message out and to help empower people vis à via their rulers. Clinton said, "We are in the age of participation, and the challenge ... is to figure out how to be responsive, to help catalyze, unleash, channel the kind of participatory eagerness that is there." She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds. The change was enough for daughter [[Chelsea Clinton]] to refer to the secretary as "TechnoMom".<ref name="time-smart" />

More relevant to March 6th, 2009 is a visit Clinton made to Geneva Switzerland. UBS Group AG is a Swiss multinational investment bank. The day after settling its criminal case on 19 February 2009, the U.S. government filed a civil suit against UBS to reveal the names of all 52,000 American customers, alleging that the bank and these customers conspired to defraud the IRS and federal government of legitimately owed tax revenue. Shortly thereafter, [[Hillary Clinton]], having been sworn in as [[Secretary of State]] in January, traveled to Geneva on March, 6 2009 to meet with the Swiss Foreign Minister to announce a settlement of the IRS suit. Within a few months, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice had arranged a tentative settlement in which the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] (FINMA) would reveal information on 4,450 of the 52,000 accounts sought by the IRS, preserving the anonymity of more than 90 percent of the United States customers of UBS's cross-border business.

On 12 August 2009, UBS announced a settlement deal that ended its litigation with the IRS. U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), who conducted Senate hearings into the UBS tax evasion scandal, described the settlement agreement (known as the "Annex") "disappointing."<blockquote>[T]he tortured wording and the many limitations in this Annex shows the Swiss Government trying to preserve as much bank secrecy as it can for the future, while pushing to conceal the names of tens of thousands of suspected U.S. tax cheats. It is disappointing that the U.S. government went along.</blockquote>However, this settlement set up a showdown between the U.S. and Swiss governments over the secrecy of [[Swiss bank account|Swiss bank accounts]]. It was not until June 2010 that Swiss lawmakers approved a deal to reveal client data and account details of U.S. clients who were suspected of tax evasion.

During March 2009, Clinton prevailed over [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] on an internal debate to send an additional 20,000 troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20090611/1aclinton11_cv.art.htm |title=In a supporting role, Clinton takes a low-key approach at State Dept. |author=Dilanian, Ken |work=[[USA Today]] |date=June 11, 2009 |access-date=July 22, 2009}}</ref>

Clinton co-chaired the high-level [[U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue]] in Washington, D.C. on July 27–28, 2009 and led the Strategic Track for the United States.

In August 2009, Clinton embarked on her longest trip yet, to a number of stops in Africa.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/03/clinton.africa.trip/index.html |title=Clinton's trip to Africa her biggest yet |author=Dougherty, Jill |publisher=CNN |date=August 3, 2009 |access-date=November 7, 2009}}</ref> On August 10, 2009, at a public event in [[Kinshasa]], a Congolese student asked her what her husband, "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, "Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what "Mr Obama" thought.<ref name="nyt-pique">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/world/africa/13clinton.html |title=Clinton's Flash of Pique in Congo |author=Gettleman, Jeffrey |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 12, 2009}}</ref>

In October 2009, Clinton's intervention – including juggling conversations on two mobile phones while sitting in a limousine<ref name="nyt-me-test" /> – overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an [[2009 Armenia–Turkey Accord|historic Turkish–Armenian accord]] that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1929584,00.html |title=Turkey, Armenia Sign Historic Accord |author=Lee, Matthew |agency=Associated Press |magazine=Time |date=October 10, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104182204/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1929584,00.html |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/10/20091010181935891322.html|title=Turkey-Armenia ink historic accord|date=October 10, 2009|access-date=October 10, 2009|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}</ref>

On the same trip, Clinton visited the Middle East, in an effort to restart the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. <!-- This needs more, need to sort this mess out -->

In December 2009, Clinton attended the [[Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference]], where she pushed forward a last-minute proposal of significant new amounts of foreign aid to help developing countries deal with the effects of global warming, in an attempt to unstick stuck negotiations and salvage some sort of agreement at the conference.<ref name="wapo121809">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/17/AR2009121700165.html |title=U.S. pledges aid, urges developing nations to cut emissions |first1=Juliet |last1=Eilperin |first2=Anthony |last2=Faiola |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date= December 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30723.html |title=Hillary Clinton tries to save Copenhagen talks |author=Thrush, Glenn |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=December 17, 2009}}</ref> The secretary said, "We're running out of time.

In late November, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|WikiLeaks released confidential State Department cables]], selections of which were then published by several major newspapers around the world.

Clinton also saw the potential political changes in the Mideast as an opportunity for an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine saw as Clinton's [[categorical imperative]]).<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt – "If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible" – as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present [[Nujood Ali]] and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age.<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings."<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, but it is also a big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us."<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but because I see it as [a way] to increase security to fulfill American interests.

He had escaped house arrest and, after finding his way to the [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing]], requested an arrangement whereby he could stay in China with guarantees for his safety. After a deal towards that end fell through, he requested a seat on Clinton's plane when she flew back to the U.S. After further negotiations in parallel with the existing agenda of Clinton's trip, Chen left for the U.S. after Clinton's departure.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/chen-guangcheng-chinese-dissident-leaves-us/story?id=16384545 |title=Chen Guangcheng: Chinese Dissident Arrives US |first1=Akiko|last1=Fujita|first2=Elicia |last2=Dover|first3=Dean|last3=Schabner|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=May 19, 2012}}</ref> Clinton had negotiated personally with senior Chinese diplomat [[Dai Bingguo]] in order to get the deal back in place.<ref name="nyt-backstage" /> Despite an environment that had, as one aide said, "exploded into an absolute circus", Clinton managed to find a path for the U.S. that kept China from losing face and kept the overall agenda of the meetings intact.<ref name="nytm-rock" />

Following the June 2012 killing of high-ranking al Qaeda figure [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]] in one of the U.S. [[drone attacks in Pakistan]], Clinton defended the action, saying "We will always maintain our right to use force against groups such as al Qaeda that have attacked us and still threaten us with imminent attack.

On September 11, 2012, an [[attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi]] took place, resulting in the death of U.S. Ambassador [[J. Christopher Stevens]] and three other Americans.

On January 23, Clinton finally gave more than five hours of testimony on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]].<ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" /> She said with a choking voice, "For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it's personal.

Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], a Republican associated with the [[Tea Party movement]], questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?

Senator [[John McCain]] said that while "It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.<ref name="nyt-0123-hearings" />

Clinton also took the opportunity to address the ongoing [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in Mali]] and the rest of Northern Africa, saying "this Pandora's Box if you will" of side effects from the Arab Spring had opened a new security challenge for the U.S.<ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" /> Specifically, she said "we cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven."<ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" />

The next day, January 24, Clinton introduced John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as hearings were held on his nomination to succeed her. She called him "the right choice to carry forward the Obama Administration's foreign policy", and called out his [[Fulbright Hearings#Kerry's testimony|testimony before the same committee in 1971 in opposition to the Vietnam War]] as "speaking hard truths about a war that had gone badly off track."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/01/24/transcript-hillary-clinton-introduces-john-kerry-at-secretary-of-state-confirmation-hearing/ |title=Transcript: Hillary Clinton Introduces John Kerry at Secretary of State Confirmation Hearing |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=January 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130216023227/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/01/24/transcript-hillary-clinton-introduces-john-kerry-at-secretary-of-state-confirmation-hearing/ |archive-date=February 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On January 29, Clinton held a global and final town hall meeting, the 59th of her tenure.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/01/203337.htm |title=Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton To Hold Global Town Hall |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=January 28, 2013 |access-date=July 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} The YouTube link within shows the town hall being held.</ref> Also on January 29, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Kerry's nomination unanimously and the full Senate confirmed the nomination by a 94–3 vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/29/john-kerry-confirmed-secretary-of-state |title=John Kerry confirmed as secretary of state in landslide senate vote |agency=Reuters |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 30, 2013 |location=London}}</ref> In her final public speech, on January 31 before the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Clinton returned to the themes of "smart power".<ref name="cbs-cfr-farewell">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57566994/in-farewell-speech-clinton-calls-for-smart-power-on-global-stage/ |title=In farewell speech, Clinton calls for 'smart power' on global stage |author=Madison, Lucy |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> She suggested that a new architecture was needed for relations within the world, giving an analogy of [[Frank Gehry]] compared to [[ancient Greek architecture]]: "Some of his work at first might appear haphazard, but in fact, it's highly intentional and sophisticated.

Clinton's final day as secretary was February 1, 2013, when she met with Obama to hand in her letter of resignation and later gave farewell remarks in a meeting with employees at State Department headquarters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/01/politics/hillary-final-day/index.html |title=Clinton's farewell marred by embassy bombing |author=Cohen, Tom |publisher=CNN |date=February 1, 2013}}</ref>

==Overall themes and legacy==
Although Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State was popular at the time among the public and praised by President Obama, observers have noted that there was no signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of [[Dean Acheson]], [[George Marshall]], or [[Henry Kissinger]].<ref name="lat-legacy">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/nation/la-na-clinton-legacy-20130128 |title=Hillary Clinton's legacy at State: Splendid but not spectacular |author=Richter, Paul |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name="nykr-legacy">{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2013/02/11/130211taco_talk_packer |title=Long Engagements |author=[[George Packer|Packer, George]] |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left.<ref name="lat-legacy" /> Many of Clinton's initiatives in the "smart power" realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect.<ref name="lat-legacy" /> [[Aaron David Miller]], a vice president at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], said that "She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy."<ref name="lat-legacy" /> [[Michael E. O'Hanlon]], a [[Brookings Institution]] analyst, said that, "Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [She has been] more solid than spectacular."<ref name="lat-legacy" /> Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'', former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] and his daughter, [[Liz Cheney]] argue that Clinton's tenure, and the [[Obama administration]]'s foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since [[World War II]].<ref name="simonandschuster">{{cite web |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title=Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, By Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |publisher=Simon & Schuster |access-date=September 3, 2015}}</ref> Others, however, such as [[Eric Schmidt]] disagree, and have argued that Clinton was "perhaps the most significant secretary of state since" Acheson.<ref name="nytm-rock" /> All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, "She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do."<ref name="lat-legacy" />

[[File:Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton speakings together.jpg|thumb|Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama discuss matters in 2009, at a picnic table on the grounds of the White House]]

The divisions between Obama and Clinton that many observers had originally predicted, never happened.<ref name="nytm-rock" /> Indeed, a writer for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' declared that "Obama and Clinton have instead led the least discordant national-security team in decades, despite enormous challenges on almost every front."<ref name="nytm-rock" /> In part, this was because Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.<ref name="nytm-rock" /> Nevertheless, there were limitations to her influence: Much of the handling of the Middle East, Iraq, and Iran was done by the White House or Pentagon during her tenure,<ref name="nyt-backstage" /> and on some other issues as well, policy-making was kept inside the White House among Obama's inner circle of advisors.<ref name="nykr-legacy" /> There were also differences of opinion. Clinton failed to persuade Obama to arm and train Syrian rebels in 2012, but overcame initial opposition to gain approval of her visit to Burma in 2011.<ref name="nyt-backstage" /> Clinton's initial idea of having special envoys under her handling key trouble spots fell apart due to various circumstances.<ref name="lat-legacy" /> Clinton did find bureaucratic success in edging out the [[U.S. Commerce Department]], by having the State Department take a lead role in sales pitches in favor of U.S. companies.<ref name="bbw-legacy">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-10/hillary-clintons-business-legacy-at-the-state-department#p1 |title=Hillary Clinton's Business Legacy at the State Department |author=Dwoskin, Elizabeth |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=January 10, 2013}}</ref> In doing so, she helped negotiate international deals for the likes of [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[Westinghouse Electric Company]].<ref name="bbw-legacy" /> Clinton believed, more than most prior secretaries, that the commercial aspects of diplomacy and the promotion of international trade were vital to American foreign policy goals.<ref name="bbw-legacy" />

Obama later referred to the Libya intervention when questioned about his worst mistake.<ref name="libya-legacy-obama">{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525 |title=The Obama Doctrine |author=Goldberg, Jeffrey |work=[[The Atlantic]]}}</ref> Obama asserted that he had been reluctant to intervene but that intervention had been championed by Clinton and Susan Rice.<ref name="libya-legacy-obama" /> Obama cited the lack of preparation the Administration had made for a post-Gaddafi Libya, lack of followup by European countries and greater-than-expected intertribal divisions in Libya.<ref name="libya-legacy-clinton">{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/14/hillary-clinton-has-no-regrets-about-libya/ |title=Hillary Clinton Has No Regrets About Libya |author=Ghattas, Kim |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=April 14, 2016}}</ref> However, Clinton's stance is that the intervention was beneficial because it avoided another Syria-like scenario.<ref name="libya-legacy-clinton" />

Clinton's background as an elected politician showed in her touch for dealing with people, in remembering personal connections, in visiting State Department staff when overseas, and in sympathizing with the dilemmas of elected foreign leaders.<ref name="nytm-rock" /> It sometimes served to her detriment though, such as in Egypt when her personal relationship with the Mubaraks may have caused her to initially back them too long during the Egyptian Revolution.<ref name="nytm-rock"/> At least until the Benghazi matter, she retained personal support among a number of Republicans; in mid-2012, Republican Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] said, "I think she's represented our nation well. She is extremely well respected throughout the world, handles herself in a very classy way and has a work ethic second to none."<ref name="nytm-rock" />

Especially in the Mideast turmoil but elsewhere as well, Clinton saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.<ref name="nw-doctrine" /> Moreover, she viewed women's rights and human rights as critical for U.S. security interests,<ref name="elle-2012" /> as part of what has become known as the "[[Hillary Doctrine]]".<ref name="cfr-zenko">{{cite news |url=http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2015/06/24/book-review-the-hillary-doctrine-sex-american-foreign-policy/ |title=Book Review – 'The Hillary Doctrine: Sex & American Foreign Policy' |first=Micah |last=Zenko|author-link=Micah Zenko |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=June 24, 2015}} Also published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' as [http://www.newsweek.com/did-hillary-implement-womens-issues-foreign-policy-347219 "Did Hillary Implement a Women's-Issues Foreign Policy?"], June 26, 2015.</ref> Former State Department director and coordinator Theresa Loar said in 2011 that, "I honestly think Hillary Clinton wakes up every day thinking about how to improve the lives of women and girls.

A mid-2012 [[Pew Research]] study of public opinions found that Clinton was viewed positively in Japan and most European countries in terms of people having confidence that she would do the right thing in world affairs.<ref name="pew-global" /> She received mixed marks in China, Russia, and some Central and South American countries, and low marks in Muslim countries, on this question.<ref name="pew-global" /> Overall, Clinton's attempts to improve the image of America in Muslim countries did not find any immediate success due to many factors, including the unpopularity of [[drone strikes in Pakistan]] and elsewhere.<ref name="pew-global" /> Perceptions of the U.S. in those countries declined during her tenure according to a Pew Research, which found that only 15 percent of Muslims had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 25 percent in 2009.<ref name="pew-global">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/13/global-opinion-of-obama-slips-international-policies-faulted/ |title=Global Opinion of Obama Slips, International Policies Faulted |publisher=Pew Research |date=June 13, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2013}}</ref> Specifically in Pakistan, only 12 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 16 percent in 2009,<ref name="pew-paki">{{cite web |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/27/pakistani-public-opinion-ever-more-critical-of-u-s/ |title=Pakistani Opinion Ever More Critical of the U.S. |publisher=Pew Research |date=June 27, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2013}}</ref> and only 3 percent had confidence in Clinton compared to 37 percent not.<ref name="pew-global" />

The first secretary of state to visit countries such as [[Togo]] and [[Timor-Leste]], Clinton believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the digital age. As she said in remarks shortly before leaving office, "I have found it highly ironic that, in today's world, when we can be anywhere virtually, more than ever people want us to show up, actually. Somebody said to me the other day, 'I look at your travel schedule. Why Togo? Why the Cook Islands?' No secretary of state had ever been to Togo before. Togo happens to be on the U.N. Security Council. Going there, making the personal investment, has a real strategic purpose."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/departing-secretary-state-hillary-clinton-leaves-legacy-firsts/story?id=18039755&singlePage=true |title=Departing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Leaves Behind a Legacy of Firsts |author=Parnass, Sarah |author2=Hughes, Dana |publisher=ABC News |date=December 23, 2012}}</ref>

==Post-tenure issues==

===Financial accounting, document requests, Clinton Foundation===
{{Main|Clinton Foundation–State Department controversy}}
According to the [[Office of the Inspector General]] report made in 2014, the State Department's records failed to properly account for some $6 billion in contracts over the prior six years, including around $2 billion for the department's mission in Iraq. The report said, "The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department's contract actions," and added that investigators and auditors had found "repeated examples of poor contract file administration" which it had characterized as having been one of the department's "major management challenges" for several years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/04/watchdog-state-department-cant-fully-account-for-6b-worth-contracts/ |title=Watchdog: State Department can't fully account for $6B worth of contracts |publisher=Fox News |date=April 4, 2014}}</ref>

During 2014, the State Department failed to turn over documents to the [[Associated Press]] that it had asked for through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request based on the possibility of [[Hillary Clinton#Subsequent activities|Clinton running for president in 2016]].

The ethics agreement between the State Department and Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary's tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during early 2015. A ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' report found that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-government-gifts-to-clinton-foundation-on-the-rise-1424223031 |title=Foreign Government Gifts to Clinton Foundation on the Rise |first1=James V. |last1=Grimaldi |first2=Rebecca |last2=Ballhaus |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> A ''[[Washington Post]]'' inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the secretary's tenure found a six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary, which was permissible under the agreement, and also one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria in January 2010 for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not. The ''Post'' noted that the donation "coincided with a spike" in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record but that during 2010 and 2011 the Department still issued human rights reports critical of Algeria's restrictions on freedom of assembly, women's rights and labor rights that also pointed to instances of extrajudicial killings, corruption, and lack of transparency in the government.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html |title=Foreign governments gave millions to foundation while Clinton was at State Dept. |first1=Rosalind S. |last1=Helderman |first2=Tom |last2=Hamburger |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 25, 2015}}</ref> A ''[[Politico]]'' analysis of State Department documents found that the department approved virtually all of Bill Clinton's proposed speaking engagements, even when they lacked sufficient information about the valuation of those talks or links between them and possible subsequent donations to the Clinton Foundation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ethics-approval-came-easily-at-hillary-clintons-state-department-115468.html |title=Hillary's State Department OK'd Bill's big-money speeches |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |newspaper=Politico |date=February 25, 2015}}</ref>

From 2009 to 2013, the Russian atomic energy agency [[Rosatom]] acquired [[Uranium One]], a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20&nbsp;percent of the uranium production capacity in the United States. The strategically sensitive acquisition required the approval of the Canadian government as well as a number of U.S. governmental bodies including the State Department.

===Use of private email server===
{{Main|Hillary Clinton email controversy}}
In early March 2015, a ''[[New York Times]]'' report revealed that throughout her time as Secretary of State, Clinton used her own private [[Message transfer agent|email server]], rather than government-issued departmental ones<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html |title=Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 2, 2015 |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=13 April 2015}}</ref> Further investigation revealed that the day of her first Senate hearing to become Secretary of State, Clinton, or an associate, purchased a private email server under the pseudonym "Eric Hoteham".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-email-mystery-man-eric-hoteham/story?id=29413827|title=Hillary Clinton Email Mystery Man: What We Know About Eric Hoteham |first1=Meghan |last1=Keneally |first2=Liz |last2=Kreutz |first3=Shushannah |last3=Walshe |date=March 5, 2015 |publisher=ABC News|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-eric-hoteham-1425588492|title=Who Is Eric Hoteham?|first=James |last=Taranto|date=March 5, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> The server was set up in her home in [[Chappaqua, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-private-server/386818/|title=Hillary Clinton Ran Private Server Out of Westchester Home |first=Adam |last=Chandler|date=March 4, 2015 |work=The Atlantic|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> The matter gained widespread public attention due to concerns about the security of the mails she sent and received and whether they were exposed to hacking and surveillance; the availability and preservation of the mails for [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests and [[National Archives and Records Administration|the archival historical record]]; and whether her action had violated any federal laws, regulations, or guidelines.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/politics/using-private-email-hillary-clinton-thwarted-record-requests.html |title=Using Private Email, Hillary Clinton Thwarted Record Requests |author=Schmidt, Michael S. |author2=Chozick, Amy |work=The New York Times |date=March 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name="wapo-email">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-department-reviewing-whether-clinton-e-mail-violated-security-rules/2015/03/05/16d1547e-c378-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html |title=Clinton e-mail review could find security issues |author=Leonnig, Carol D. |author2=Helderman, Rosalind S. |author3=Gearan, Anne |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 6, 2015}}</ref> Also in question was whether the use of the private email server violated State Department transparency protocols.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/state-department-email-rule-hillary-clinton-115804.html|title=Clinton private email violated 'clear-cut' State Dept. rules|first=Josh |last=Gerstein |date=March 5, 2015 |work=[[Politico]] |access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref>

In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 turned over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and that she now wanted them made public.<ref name="wapo-email" /> These 55,000 printed pages accounted for 30,490, or slightly less than half, of the 62,320 emails that Clinton had sent or received on her private email account during her time as secretary.<ref>[http://time.com/3740357/hillary-clinton-emails-search/ The Problem With Hillary Clinton’s Email Record Search], ''Time'', March 11, 2015</ref> At a press conference Clinton said she had set up the separate server as a matter of convenience so that she could carry one device and not two, but that in retrospect "it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/hillary-clinton-email-scandal-press-conference/ |title=Hillary Clinton: I used one email 'for convenience' |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> She said that she had sent mails to State Department employees on their government accounts, ensuring such mails would be preserved, but it then turned out that the department did not automatically or routinely save such mails.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-state-department-archiving-emails-116062.html |title=Hillary Clinton email flap exposes gaps in State Department records |work=Politico |date=March 15, 2015}}</ref> After the revelations, questions were raised about whether Clinton, when she resigned in February 2013, had signed Form OF-109, a standard document declaring that she had turned over all work-related records.

A portion of the emails on Clinton's private server were emails sent in 2011 and 2012 by [[Sidney Blumenthal]], a political supporter and campaign staffer who worked for the Clinton Foundation. Blumenthal prepared, from public and other sources, about 25 memos which he sent to Clinton during 2011 and 2012 which she shared through her aide, [[Jake Sullivan]], with senior State Department personnel. In the form of intelligence briefings, the memos sometimes touted his business associates and, at times contained inaccurate information.<ref name=NYT51815>{{cite news|first1=Michael S.|last1=Schmidt|title=What Sidney Blumenthal's Memos to Hillary Clinton Said, and How They Were Handled|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/what-sidney-blumenthals-memos-to-hillary-clinton-said-and-how-they-were-handled.html|access-date=May 19, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=May 18, 2015|quote=In 2011 and 2012, Hillary Rodham Clinton received at least 25 memos about Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and confidant who at the time was employed by the Clinton Foundation.}}</ref><ref name=51815a>{{cite news|first1=Nicholas |last1=Confessore |first2=Michael S. |last2=Schmidt |title=Clinton Friend's Memos on Libya Draw Scrutiny to Politics and Business|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/politics/clinton-friends-libya-role-blurs-lines-of-politics-and-business.html|access-date=May 19, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=May 18, 2015|quote=Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, took Mr. Blumenthal's advice seriously, forwarding his memos to senior diplomatic officials in Libya and Washington and at times asking them to respond.

In August 2015, it was reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain her private server while she was Secretary of State.<ref name=WP0901>Rosalind S.

===Mis-handling of classified information===
On July 23, 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the existence of a June 2015, memorandum to the [[Justice Department (United States)|Justice Department]] from the [[Inspectors General]] of the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] and the [[State Department]] regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State.<ref name=NYT72415>{{cite news|first1=Michael S. |last1=Schmidt |first2=Matt |last2=Apuzzo |title=Hillary Clinton Emails Said to Contain Classified Data|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/us/politics/hillary-clinton-email-classified-information-inspector-general-intelligence-community.html|access-date=July 25, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=July 24, 2015|quote=Investigators said they searched a small sample of 40 emails and found four that contained government secrets.}}</ref> A transmittal memorandum, written by State Department official [[Patrick F. Kennedy]], said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Clinton's private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information.<ref name=NYT72415 /><ref name=CNN3>{{cite news | first=Elise | last=Labott | title=Clinton emails Included Classified Information | publisher= CNN | date=July 24, 2015 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/politics/hillary-clinton-email-justice-department/ | access-date= 2015-07-27}}</ref> In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.<ref name=NYT72415 /><ref name=WSJ3>{{cite news | first=Byron | last= Tau | title=Hillary Clinton Sent Classified Information Over Email While at State Department, Review Finds; Information was classified as 'secret' at the time it was sent, intelligence community inspector general says | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= July 24, 2015 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/investigation-sought-into-hillary-clintons-emails-1437714369 | access-date= 2014-07-27}}</ref>

Clinton and her campaign reiterated that the information transmitted was not classified "at the time", but the inspectors general, as well as reporting by ''The New York Times'' and others, said that it, in fact, was classified at the time.<ref name=NYT72415 /><ref name=CNN3 /><ref name=WSJ3 /> Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and government procedures and protocols require that such information be sent or stored only on government computer networks with government safeguards.<ref name=NYT72415 /><ref name=WSJ3 />

An [[FBI]] probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.<ref>{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/04/how-did-top-secret-emails-end-up-on-hillary-clintons-server/ |title=How did 'top secret' emails end up on Hillary Clinton's server? |date=February 4, 2016 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
During the summer and fall of 2016 the probe was twice concluded with a recommendation of no charges, a recommendation that was followed by the Justice Department, but according to Clinton herself, the emails matter and the way in which it would not go away contributed to her electoral defeat.<ref name="Politico111216">{{cite news|first=Gabriel |last=Debenedetti|title=Clinton blames Comey letters for defeat|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-comey-letters-defeat-231280|work=Politico|date=November 12, 2016}}</ref>

The Department of State finished its internal investigation of the matter in September 2019, citing 588 security violations. The review found that 38 current and former State Department officials – some of whom might face a disciplinary action or security clearance review – were culpable of mishandling classified information, but in 497 cases the culpability could not be established. The material was considered classified then or later, but none of the violations involved information marked classified. The investigation found Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information, but "there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information."  The investigation added that although there was no evidence that Clinton's private server had been compromised, "the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Matthew |last2=Jalonick |first2=Mary Clare |title=38 people cited for violations in Clinton email probe |url=https://www.apnews.com/14b14afc5d8647858489a2cf5385c28d |agency=The Associated Press |date=October 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/state-department-probe-of-clinton-emails-finds-no-deliberate-mishandling-of-classified-information/2019/10/18/83339446-f1dc-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html|title=State Department probe of Clinton emails finds no deliberate mishandling of classified information | newspaper= The Washington Post | date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>
