==Business career==
Cartes' father was the owner of a [[Cessna]] aircraft franchise holding company and the young Horacio studied aviation mechanics in the [[United States]]. At the age of 19, he started a currency exchange business which grew into the [[Banco Amambay]]. Over the following years, Cartes bought or helped establish 25 companies including [[Tabesa]], the country's biggest cigarette manufacturer, and a major fruit juice bottling company.<ref name="BBC">{{citation |title=Profile: Horacio Cartes |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=22 April 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22247484}}</ref>

In 1986, Cartes spent 60 days in jail during a currency fraud investigation. He was accused of making millions of dollars by obtaining a central bank loan at a preferential exchange rate and then moving it through his money exchange business before buying farm equipment in the U.S. The case was eventually dropped.<ref name='Servin01'>{{cite news |last=Servin |first=Pedro |last2=Warren |first2=Michael |title=Paraguay's new president woos foreign investment |date=15 August 2013 |url=http://www.chron.com/news/crime/article/Paraguay-s-new-president-was-targeted-by-the-DEA-4734005.php |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>

Cartes was imprisoned on charges of currency fraud for seven months in 1989. He was eventually cleared by a court.<ref name=Conservative/>

In 2000, the anti-drug police seized a plane carrying cocaine and marijuana on his ranch. He claimed that the plane had made an emergency landing, that he had no involvement with the drug trade and that he opposed the legalization of narcotics.<ref name=Conservative>{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/world/americas/horacio-cartes-wins-paraguays-presidential-election.html?_r=0 |title=Conservative Tobacco Magnate Wins Presidential Race in Paraguay |first=Simon |last=Romero |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 April 2013}}</ref>

==Early political career==
Until 2008, Cartes was uninvolved in politics and was not registered as a voter.<ref name="brecha">{{cite web |url=http://brecha.com.uy/index.php/mundo/1728-el-buen-olfato-de-horacio-cartes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505175930/http://brecha.com.uy/index.php/mundo/1728-el-buen-olfato-de-horacio-cartes |archive-date=5 May 2013 |title=Cartes' "good nose" for winning an election |date=26 April 2013 |publisher=Brecha |language=es |url-status=dead}}</ref> He joined the conservative Colorado Party in 2009 and said he wanted to counter the swing to the left in Latin American politics. He became known as an efficient politician uncompromised by his party's past support of the military dictatorship of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] who ruled until 1989.<ref name="brecha"/>

In regards to allegation of his connections to the drug trade, as well as being targeted by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]],<ref name="CBS"/> he said during his presidential campaign: "I wouldn't want to be president if I had ties to drug traffickers. Go to the courts and check. There's nothing, not a single charge against me."<ref name="CBS"/>

==President of Paraguay==

===Election===
Cartes was the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado]] candidate at the [[2013 Paraguayan general election|2013 presidential election]].<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="brecha"/> The [[BBC]] suggested that his convincing points during his campaign were the promises to raise private capital to upgrade the country's infrastructure, to modernise its public enterprises, to attract international investments, and to create jobs. On 21 April 2013, he was elected President of Paraguay with 45.80% of the vote.<ref name="BBC"/>  When he took office on 15 August, it marked only the second time in the country's 202 years of independence that a ruling party peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.

In regards to the [[impeachment of Fernando Lugo|impeachment of Lugo]] and the negative reception the country was given in the aftermath by Latin American leaders, Cartes defended the legality of the impeachment and said that Paraguay should not withdraw from [[Mercosur]], pointing to the economic benefits of the [[common market]] and freedom of trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2012/07/13/paraguayan-presidential-hopeful-said-the-country-should-in-no-way-abandon-mercosur |title=Paraguayan presidential hopeful said the country should in no way abandon Mercosur |publisher=[[MercoPress]] |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>

===Education===
In 2015, massive student protests occurred in Paraguay. The demand of students was a better quality of education, demanding an increase in the education budget to reach 7% of the national GDP as requested by [[UNESCO]]; at the time education spending represented 3.9% of GDP and was one of the lowest in the region.

===Reelection attempt===
{{main|2017 Paraguayan crisis}}
The [[constitution of Paraguay|current constitution]] limits the president to a single five-year term. In late 2016 and early 2017, Cartes and his supporters in Congress attempted to pass a constitutional amendment to run for re-election, a move described by the opposition as "a coup". On 31 March 2017, [[2017 Paraguayan crisis|a series of protests]] erupted after supporters of the amendment in the Senate voted for the amendment during a secret session in a closed office rather than on the Senate floor, during which demonstrators set fire to the [[Congress of Paraguay|Congress]] building. Several people were reported injured, including one protester who was killed after being hit by a shotgun blast by police, and one lower-house deputy who had to undergo surgery after being injured by rubber bullets.<ref>{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Romero |date=31 March 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/world/americas/paraguay-protests-horacio-cartes.html |title=Protests Erupt in Paraguay Over Efforts to Extend President's Term |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=1 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='A coup has been carried out': Paraguay's congress set alight after vote to let president run again |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/01/paraguays-congress-set-on-fire-after-vote-to-let-president-run-again |accessdate=1 April 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=1 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/protester-killed-paraguay-rodrigo-quintana-asuncion-horacio-cartes-a7662106.html |title=A protester was killed in Paraguay after a Senate vote for a constitutional amendment |last=Desantis |first=Daniela |date=1 April 2017 |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=3 April 2017 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Paraguay congress set on fire amid presidential controversy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-39465064|accessdate=1 April 2017 |publisher=BBC News |date=1 April 2017}}</ref> On 17 April, Cartes announced that he would not run for a second presidential term even if the amendment passed.

===Resignation attempt===
In the [[2018 Paraguayan general election]], Cartes, while still President, ran for a full [[Senate of Paraguay|Senate]] seat, which was perceived as an attempt of extending his political influence past his presidency, and was elected.<ref name="Servin">{{cite news |last=Servin |first=Pedro |publisher=Associated Press|title=Paraguay president withdraws resignation and Senate bid |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |url=http://www.startribune.com/paraguay-president-withdraws-resignation-and-senate-bid/486587181/}}</ref> New Senators would be sworn in on 30 June 2018, six weeks before Cartes's presidential term was scheduled to end, thus the need for Cartes to leave office before the expiration of his term, as the constitution states officials can not hold two offices concurrently. Consequently, on 28 May 2018, Cartes offered his resignation as President, which would have to be agreed to by [[Congress of Paraguay|Congress]]. Legislators were opposed to Cartes resigning and taking up the seat, stating it was unconstitutional. The opposition, as well as dissidents within Cartes' own Colorado Party, successfully blocked Cartes's resignation,<ref name="Servin"/> boycotting the vote, hence preventing a [[quorum]] from being present for a vote on the resignation.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press|title=Setback for outgoing Paraguay president’s Senate aspirations|date=May 30, 2018|url=https://www.apnews.com/bd72c653d1b4433fb4c70e886cece926}}</ref> Cartes withdrew his bid to resign and be sworn in as a senator on 26 June 2018 after not receiving enough political support to carry through his plans.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Chron |title=Presidente paraguayo Horacio Cartes retira su renuncia |accessdate=June 26, 2018 |language=es |url=https://www.chron.com/espanol/news/article/Presidente-paraguayo-Horacio-Cartes-retira-su-13027039.php}}</ref>
