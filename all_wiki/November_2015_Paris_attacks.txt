French authorities regularly gave detailed information to US authorities on the whereabouts of high-ranking IS members in the Syria-Iraq zone to be tracked and killed. This cooperation led to American air strikes being able to kill the planners of 13 November 2015 attacks. United States authorities cooperate as they consider that if terrorist attacks hadn't happened in France, they would have happened in the US instead.<ref name="france1"/>

However, in the election campaign for the regional elections of France, to begin on 6 December 2015, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Front National party who is vying to be president of the Nord-Pas de Calais area, was recommending hardline security measures.

[[Jean-Claude Juncker]], President of the [[European Commission]], rejected calls to rethink the European Union's policy on migration. Dismissing suggestions that open borders led to the attacks, Juncker said he believed that the attacks should be met with a stronger display of liberal values, including internal open borders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/news-news/index?more=9356590|title=News/Current Events (News/Activism)|access-date=5 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130193629/http://www.freerepublic.com/tag/news-news/index?more=9356590|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/eu-news/50718-pm-disappointed-at-juncker-s-words-about-migration|title=PM disappointed at Juncker's words about migration|date=15 November 2015|website=The Prague Post|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121035134/http://praguepost.com/eu-news/50718-pm-disappointed-at-juncker-s-words-about-migration|archive-date=21 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> European Commission Vice-President [[Federica Mogherini]] and EU defence ministers unanimously backed France's request for help in military missions.<ref>{{cite web|title = Paris attacks: Latest updates – BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-34840858|website = www.bbc.com|accessdate = 17 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117131840/http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-34840858|archive-date = 17 November 2015|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Intelligence review ===
[[File:Paris Shootings - The day after (22593744177).jpg|thumb|French police gathering evidence at the Bataclan theatre on 14 November]]

Shortly after the attacks, intelligence staff in multiple countries began to review electronic surveillance recorded before the attacks.<ref name="Nossiter 2015" /> [[Adam Schiff]], the [[Ranking member|ranking Democratic member]] of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]], said he did not know of any intercepted communications that would have provided warning of the attacks.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. reacts to Paris attacks; officials unaware of prior 'chatter'|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/nation_world/u-s-reacts-to-paris-attacks-officials-unaware-of-prior/article_b4c24762-8a72-11e5-9423-5f7fb85bd671.html|website=Winston-Salem Journal|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=14 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010120421/http://www.journalnow.com/news/nation_world/u-s-reacts-to-paris-attacks-officials-unaware-of-prior/article_b4c24762-8a72-11e5-9423-5f7fb85bd671.html|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

One source said the French National Police met with German police and intelligence services a month before the attack to discuss suspicions that terrorists were staking out possible targets in France. The exact targets were not known at that time.<ref name="sofrep">{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Jack|title=Breaking: French and German Police Knew Paris Attack Was Coming a Month Prior|url=http://sofrep.com/44480/french-and-german-police-knew-paris-attack-was-coming-a-month-prior/|website=SOFREP.com|accessdate=14 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115011102/http://sofrep.com/44480/french-and-german-police-knew-paris-attack-was-coming-a-month-prior/|archive-date=15 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Police in Germany stopped a car on 5 November, arrested its driver, and confiscated weapons that may have been connected to the Paris attacks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man Arrested in Germany With Weapons in Car May Have Links To Paris Attacks|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-attacks-weapons_56474262e4b06037734934e0|website=The Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=14 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115044348/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-attacks-weapons_56474262e4b06037734934e0|archive-date=15 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some of the attackers were known to law enforcement officials prior to the attacks, and at least some of the attackers had residences in the [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek|Molenbeek]] area of Brussels, which is noted for its links to extremist activities.<ref name="CoordinatedAttacks" /> A counter-terrorism expert said the fact that the perpetrators were known to authorities suggests that intelligence was "pretty good" but the ability to act on it was lacking. The number of Europeans who have links to Syria makes it difficult for security services to keep track of them all.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Andrew|last2=DE FREYTAS-TAMURA|first2=KIMIKO|last3=BENNHOLDNOV|first3=KATRIN|title=In Suspects' Brussels Neighborhood, a History of Petty Crimes and Missed Chances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/world/europe/in-suspects-brussels-neighborhood-a-history-of-petty-crimes-and-missed-chances.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117101804/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/world/europe/in-suspects-brussels-neighborhood-a-history-of-petty-crimes-and-missed-chances.html|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
