In the early history of the Equal Rights Amendment, middle-class women were largely supportive, while those speaking for the working class were often opposed, pointing out that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and employment hours. With the rise of the [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|women's movement in the United States]] during the 1960s, the ERA garnered increasing support, and, after being reintroduced by Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] in 1971, it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on October 12, 1971, and by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on March 22, 1972, thus submitting the ERA to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for ratification, as provided for in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V of the U.S. Constitution]].

Congress had originally set a ratification deadline of March 22, 1979, for the state legislatures to consider the ERA. Through 1977, the amendment received 35 of the necessary 38 state [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratifications]].<ref group="note">Article Five of the United States Constitution requires approval of three-fourths of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for the enactment of a constitutional amendment.

These women argued that the ERA would disadvantage housewives, cause women to be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the military and to lose protections such as alimony, and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">{{Cite news|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357_pf.html|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 27, 2007|access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref> Many [[Labor feminism|labor feminists]] also opposed the ERA on the basis that it would eliminate protections for women in [[United States labor law|labor law]], though over time more and more unions and labor feminist leaders turned toward supporting it.

Five state legislatures (Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, and South Dakota) voted to revoke their ERA ratifications. The first four rescinded before the original March 22, 1979, ratification deadline, while the South Dakota legislature did so by voting to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] its ratification as of that original deadline. However, it remains an unresolved legal question as to whether a state can revoke its ratification of a federal constitutional amendment.

In 1978, Congress passed (by simple majorities in each house), and President Carter signed, a joint resolution with the intent of extending the ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. Because no additional state legislatures ratified the ERA between March 22, 1979, and June 30, 1982, the validity of that disputed extension was rendered academic.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Jessica|last=Neuwirth|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-neuwirth-equal-rights-amendment-for-women-metoo-20180105-story.html|title=Unbelievably, women still don't have equal rights in the Constitution|date=January 5, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=January 6, 2018}}</ref> Since 1978, attempts have been made in Congress to extend or remove the deadline.

==Resolution text==
The resolution, "Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and women", reads, in part:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg1523.pdf|title=Proposed Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|publisher=govinfo.gov}}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Alice paul.jpg|thumb|[[Alice Paul]] toasting (with grape juice) the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. August 26, 1920<ref name="WhoWas">{{Cite web|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul|title=Who Was Alice Paul?|website=Alice Paul Institute|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>]]
On September 25, 1921, the [[National Woman's Party]] announced its plans to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to guarantee women equal rights with men. The text of the proposed amendment read:

{{quote|
Section 1. No political, civil, or legal disabilities or inequalities on account of sex or on account of marriage, unless applying equally to both sexes, shall exist within the United States or any territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof.

Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<ref name="BaltSun">{{Cite news| title=WOMAN'S PARTY ALL READY FOR EQUALITY FIGHT; Removal Of All National and State Discriminations Is Aim.

Alice Paul, the head of the National Women's Party, believed that the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] would not be enough to ensure that men and women were treated equally regardless of sex. In 1923, she revised the proposed amendment to read:

{{quote|Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.<ref name="WhoWas"/>}}

Paul named this version the [[Lucretia Mott]] Amendment, after a female abolitionist who fought for women's rights and attended the First Women's Rights Convention.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/lucretia-mott.htm. | title="Lucretia Mott" National Park Service | website=National Park Service | publisher=United States Government | access-date=March 21, 2016}}</ref>

In 1943, Alice Paul further revised the amendment to reflect the wording of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] and Nineteenth Amendments. This text became Section 1 of the version passed by Congress in 1972.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web | url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/336era.html | title=Equal Rights Amendments, 1923–1972 | website=history.hanover.edu | access-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref>

As a result, in the 1940s, ERA opponents proposed an alternative, which provided that "no distinctions on the basis of sex shall be made except such as are reasonably justified by differences in physical structure, biological differences, or social function." It was quickly rejected by both pro and anti-ERA coalitions.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioM-8naFn60C | title=Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America Since 1960 | last=Davis | first=Flora | date=January 1, 1999 | publisher=University of Illinois Press | isbn=9780252067822 | language=en}}</ref>

===Feminists split===
Since the 1920s, the Equal Rights Amendment has been accompanied by discussion among [[Feminism|feminists]] about the meaning of women's equality.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Sealander | first=Judith | year=1982 | title=Feminist Against Feminist: The First Phase of the Equal Rights Amendment Debate, 1923–1963 | journal=South Atlantic Quarterly | volume=81 | issue=2 | pages=147–161}}</ref> [[Alice Paul]] and her [[National Woman's Party]] asserted that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, even if that means sacrificing benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Cott | first=Nancy | year=1984 | title=Feminist Politics in the 1920s: The National Woman's Party | journal=[[Journal of American History]] | volume=71 | issue=1 | pages=43–68 | doi=10.2307/1899833 | jstor=1899833}}</ref> Opponents of the amendment, such as the [[Women's Joint Congressional Committee]], believed that the loss of these benefits to women would not be worth the supposed gain to them in equality. In 1924, ''The Forum'' hosted a debate between [[Doris Stevens]] and [[Alice Hamilton]] concerning the two perspectives on the proposed amendment.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Modern American Women: A Documentary History | publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education | year=1997 | isbn=0-07-071527-0 | editor-last=Ware | editor-first=Susan | chapter=New Dilemmas for Modern Women | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00susa_1 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00susa_1 }}</ref> Their debate reflected the wider tension in the developing feminist movement of the early 20th century between two approaches toward gender equality. One approach emphasized the common humanity of women and men, while the other stressed women's unique experiences and how they were different from men, seeking recognition for specific needs.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/groundingofmoder00cott | title=The Grounding of Modern Feminism | last=Cott | first=Nancy | publisher=Yale University Press | year=1987 | isbn=0-300-04228-0 | author-link=Nancy Cott}}</ref> The opposition to the ERA was led by [[Mary Anderson (labor leader)|Mary Anderson]] and the [[Women's Bureau]] beginning in 1923. These feminists argued that legislation including mandated minimum wages, safety regulations, restricted daily and weekly hours, lunch breaks, and maternity provisions would be more beneficial to the majority of women who were forced to work out of economic necessity, not personal fulfillment.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Other Women's Movement: Workplace Justice and Social Rights in Modern America | last=Cobble | first=Dorothy Sue | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2004 | isbn=0-691-06993-X | location=Princeton, New Jersey | page=[https://archive.org/details/otherwomensmovem0000cobb/page/51 51] | url=https://archive.org/details/otherwomensmovem0000cobb/page/51 }}</ref> The debate also drew from struggles between working class and professional women. Alice Hamilton, in her speech "Protection for Women Workers," said that the ERA would strip working women of the small protections they had achieved, leaving them powerless to further improve their condition in the future, or to attain necessary protections in the present.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Modern American Women: A Documentary History | last=Dollinger | first=Genora Johnson | publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education | year=1997 | isbn=0-07-071527-0 | editor-last=Ware | editor-first=Susan | pages=[https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00susa_1/page/125 125–126] | chapter=Women and Labor Militancy | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00susa_1 | url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericanwo00susa_1/page/125 }}</ref>

The [[National Woman's Party]] already had tested its approach in [[Wisconsin]], where it won passage of the Wisconsin Equal Rights Law in 1921.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Quest for Social Justice III: The Morris Fromkin Memorial Lectures, 1992–2002 | last=McBride | first=Genevieve G. | publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee | year=2005 | isbn=1-879281-26-0 | editor-last=Boone | editor-first=Peter G.

Instead, it was usually blocked in committee; except in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35—not receiving the required two-thirds supermajority.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R42979.html | title=The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues | website=everycrsreport.com | language=en | access-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref>

===Hayden rider and protective labor legislation===
In 1950 and 1953, the ERA was passed by the Senate with a provision known as "the Hayden rider", introduced by [[Arizona]] senator [[Carl Hayden]]. The Hayden rider added a sentence to the ERA to keep special protections for women: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." By allowing women to keep their existing and future special protections, it was expected that the ERA would be more appealing to its opponents. Though opponents were marginally more in favor of the ERA with the Hayden rider, supporters of the original ERA believed it negated the amendment's original purpose—causing the amendment not to be passed in the House.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt6f59n89c&brand=calisphere&doc.view=entire_text | title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment. | website=cdlib.org | publisher=Suffragists Oral History Project}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/eraname.htm | title=What's in a Name?

ERA supporters were hopeful that the second term of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] would advance their agenda. Eisenhower had publicly promised to "assure women everywhere in our land equality of rights," and in 1958, Eisenhower asked a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first president to show such a level of support for the amendment. However, the National Woman's Party found the amendment to be unacceptable and asked it to be withdrawn whenever the Hayden rider was added to the ERA.<ref name="auto1" />

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in [[1940 Republican National Convention|1940]], renewing the plank every four years until [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]].<ref name="'70s 245">{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/245 | title=How We Got Here: The '70s | last=Frum | first=David | publisher=[[Basic Books]] | year=2000 | isbn=0-465-04195-7 | location=New York, New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/245 245–248] | author-link=David Frum}}</ref> The ERA was strongly opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] and other labor unions, which feared the amendment would invalidate protective labor legislation for women. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and most [[New Deal]]ers also opposed the ERA. They felt that ERA was designed for middle class women, but that working class women needed government protection. They also feared that the ERA would undercut the male-dominated labor unions that were a core component of the [[New Deal coalition]]. Most northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions, opposed the amendment.<ref name="'70s 245" /> The ERA was supported by southern Democrats and almost all Republicans.<ref name="'70s 245"/>

At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], the Democrats made the divisive step of including the ERA in their platform, but the Democratic Party did not become united in favor of the amendment until congressional passage in 1972.<ref name="'70s 245"/> The main support base for the ERA until the late 1960s was among middle class Republican women. The [[League of Women Voters]], formerly the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], opposed the Equal Rights Amendment until 1972, fearing the loss of protective labor legislation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cwluherstory.org/classic-feminist-writings-articles/from-suffrage-to-womens-liberation | title=From Suffrage to Women's Liberation | website=CWLU HERSTORY | language=en-US | access-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref>

===1960s===
At the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention in 1960]], a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it was opposed by groups including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/annualreportamer00amer_2|title=Clearing the Main Channels, ACLU's 1954-55 Annual Report|date=1955|publisher=New York, American Civil Liberties Union|others=University of Alberta Libraries|year=1955|isbn=|location=|pages=106–107}}</ref> (ACLU), the [[AFL–CIO]], labor unions such as the [[American Federation of Teachers]], [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA), the [[American Nurses Association]], the Women's Division of the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist Church]], and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8ov6Vc4YQC&pg=PA209 | title=A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics | last=Freeman | first=Jo | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-8476-9805-9 | page=209 | author-link=Jo Freeman}}</ref>  Presidential candidate [[John F.

President Kennedy appointed a [[Blue-ribbon panel|blue-ribbon commission]] on women, the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|President's Commission on the Status of Women]], to investigate the problem of sex discrimination in the United States. The commission was chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who opposed the ERA but no longer spoke against it publicly. In the early 1960s, Eleanor Roosevelt announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that, as far as she was concerned, they could have the amendment if they wanted it. However, she never went so far as to endorse the ERA. The commission that she chaired reported (after her death) that no ERA was needed, believing that the Supreme Court could give sex the same “suspect” test as race and national origin, through interpretation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55XG0oS3XyYC&pg=PA184 | title=Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media: A Public Quest for Self-fulfillment | last=Beasley | first=Maurine Hoffman | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year=1987 | isbn=9780252013768 | page=184}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://guides.loc.gov/american-women-essays/era-ratification-effort | title=Research Guides: American Women: Topical Essays: The Long Road to Equality: What Women Won from the ERA Ratification Effort | last=Berberian | first=Laura | website=guides.loc.gov | language=en | access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court did not provide the "suspect" class test for sex, however, resulting in a continuing lack of equal rights. The commission did, though, help win passage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which banned sex discrimination in wages in a number of professions (it would later be amended in the early 1970s to include the professions that it initially excluded) and secured an [[executive order]] from Kennedy eliminating sex discrimination in the [[civil service]]. The commission, composed largely of anti-ERA feminists with ties to labor, proposed remedies to the widespread sex discrimination it unearthed.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDd2aNCoGlYC | title=Public Women, Public Words: A Documentary History of American Feminism, Volume III: 1960 to the Present | publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] | location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2005 | isbn=9780742522367 | editor-last=Keetley | editor-first=Dawn | page=251 | editor-last2=Pettegrew | editor-first2=John}}</ref>

The national commission spurred the establishment of state and local commissions on the status of women and arranged for follow-up conferences in the years to come. The following year, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] banned workplace discrimination not only on the basis of race, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of sex, thanks to the lobbying of [[Alice Paul]] and [[Coretta Scott King]] and the political influence of Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] of [[Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Haug | first=Kate | date=2016 | title=News Today: A History of the Poor People's Campaign in Real Time | url=http://www.resurrectioncity.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/News_Today.pdf | journal=Irving Street Projects | pages=1–84}}</ref>

A new women's movement gained ground in the later 1960s as a result of a variety of factors: [[Betty Friedan]]'s bestseller ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''; the network of women's rights commissions formed by Kennedy's national commission; the frustration over women's social and economic status; and anger over the lack of government and [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In June 1966, at the Third National Conference on the Status of Women in [[Washington, D.C.]], Betty Friedan and a group of activists frustrated with the lack of government action in enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act formed the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to act as an "NAACP for women", demanding full equality for American women and men.<ref name="Schneir 1994 95">{{Cite book|title=Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present|last=Schneir|first=Miriam|publisher=[[Vintage Books]]|location=New York City|year=1994|page=95}}</ref> In 1967, at the urging of Alice Paul, NOW endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The decision caused some union Democrats and social conservatives to leave the organization and form the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (within a few years WEAL also endorsed the ERA), but the move to support the amendment benefited NOW, bolstering its membership.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} By the late 1960s, NOW had made significant political and legislative victories and was gaining enough power to become a major lobbying force. In 1969, newly elected representative [[Shirley Chisholm]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] gave her famous speech "Equal Rights for Women" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chisolm|first=Shirley|authorlink=Shirley Chisholm|date=May 21, 1969|title=Equal Rights for Women|url=http://www.emersonkent.com/speeches/equal_rights_for_women.htm|access-date=June 6, 2020|work=Emerson Kent}}</ref>

==Congressional passage==
[[File:Martha Griffiths.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. representative [[Martha W. Griffiths]] championed the ERA]]
In February 1970, NOW picketed the United States Senate, a subcommittee of which was holding hearings on a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18. NOW disrupted the hearings and demanded a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment and won a meeting with senators to discuss the ERA. That August, over 20,000 American women held a nationwide [[Women's Strike for Equality]] protest to demand full social, economic, and political equality.<ref name="wommarch">[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/ Nation, Women on] ''Time'' (New York), September 7, 1970 {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406112028/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html | date=April 6, 2015}}</ref> Said [[Betty Friedan]] of the strike, "All kinds of women's groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed.

On August 10, 1970, Michigan Democrat [[Martha Griffiths]] successfully brought the Equal Rights Amendment to the House floor, after 15 years of the joint resolution languishing in the House Judiciary Committee. The joint resolution passed in the House and continued on to the Senate, which voted for the ERA with an added clause that women would be exempt from the military. The [[91st United States Congress|91st Congress]], however, ended before the joint resolution could progress any further.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/G/GRIFFITHS,-Martha-Wright-(G000471) | title=GRIFFITHS, Martha Wright {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives | website=history.house.gov | language=en | access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>

Griffiths reintroduced the ERA, and achieved success on Capitol Hill with her {{USBill|92|HJRes|208}}, which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas (For), 24 nays (Against) and 51 not voting.<ref>{{USCongRec|1971|35815}}</ref> Griffiths' joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate—without change—on March 22, 1972, by a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting.<ref>{{USCongRec|1972|93}}</ref> The Senate version, drafted by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 | title=The Art of Leadership: A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh, United States Senator from Indiana, 1963–1980 | last=Cruikshank | first=Kate | publisher=Indiana University | access-date=February 10, 2013}}</ref> passed after the defeat of an amendment proposed by Senator [[Sam Ervin]] of North Carolina that would have exempted women from the [[Conscription|draft]].<ref name="'70s 245" /><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg1523.pdf | title=H.J.

===Ratifications===
On March 22, 1972, the ERA was placed before the state legislatures, with a seven-year deadline to acquire ratification by three-fourths (38) of the state legislatures. A majority of states ratified the proposed constitutional amendment within a year. Hawaii became the first state to ratify the ERA, which it did on the same day the amendment was approved by Congress: The U.S. Senate's vote on {{USBill|92|HJRes|208}} took place in the mid-to-late afternoon in Washington, D.C., when it was still midday in Hawaii. The [[Hawaii Senate]] and [[Hawaii House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted their approval shortly after noon Hawaii Standard Time.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/23/archives/equal-rights-amendment-is-approved-by-congress-equal-rights.html |title=Equal Rights Amendment Is Approved by Congress |last=Shanahan |first=Eileen |date=March 23, 1972 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 12, 2019 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thoughtco.com/which-states-ratified-the-era-3528872 | title=Which States Ratified the ERA and When Did They Ratify? | last=Johnson | first=Jone | date=October 31, 2017 | publisher=Thoughtco.com | access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref>

During 1972, a total of 22 state legislatures ratified the amendment and eight more joined in early 1973. Between 1974 and 1977, only five states approved the ERA, and advocates became worried about the approaching March 22, 1979, deadline.<ref name="ERA: History">{{Cite web | url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm | title=ERA: History | website=equalrightsamendment.org | access-date=April 13, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410091210/http://equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm | archive-date=April 10, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> At the same time, the legislatures of four states which had ratified the ERA then adopted legislation purporting to rescind those ratifications. If, indeed, a state legislature has the ability to rescind, then the ERA actually had ratifications by only 31 states—not 35—when March 22, 1979, arrived.

Retrieved: August 15, 2016.</ref> this raised questions as to whether a state's governor, or someone temporarily acting as governor, has the power to veto any measure related to amending the United States Constitution.

===South Dakota's sunset provision===
Among those rejecting Congress's claim to even hold authority to extend a previously established ratification deadline, the [[South Dakota Legislature]] adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 on March 1, 1979. The joint resolution stipulated that South Dakota's 1973 ERA ratification would be [[Sunset provision|"sunsetted"]] as of the original deadline, March 22, 1979. South Dakota's 1979 sunset joint resolution declared: "the Ninety-fifth Congress ex post facto has sought unilaterally to alter the terms and conditions in such a way as to materially affect the congressionally established time period for ratification" (designated as "POM-93" by the U.S. Senate and published verbatim in the [[Congressional Record]] of March 13, 1979, at pages 4861 and 4862).<ref>{{USCongRec|1979|4861}}</ref>

The action on the part of South Dakota lawmakers—occurring 21 days prior to originally agreed-upon deadline of March 22, 1979—could be viewed as slightly different from a rescission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rutgerslaw.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/03_Magliocca.pdf|title=Buried Alive: The Reboot of the Equal Rights Amendment|last=Magliocca|first=Gerald N.|date=June 22, 2018|publisher=[[Rutgers University Law Review]]|pages=654–655|access-date=July 10, 2020}}</ref> [[The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation|''Constitution Annotated'']] notes that "[f]our states had rescinded their ratifications [of the ERA] and a fifth had declared that its ratification would be void unless the amendment was ratified within the original time limit", with a footnote identifying South Dakota as that "fifth" state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artV_1_2/|title=ArtV.1.2 Proposing a Constitutional Amendment|last=Library of Congress|website=Constitution Annotated|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>

===Non-ratifying states with one-house approval===
At various times, in six of the 12 non-ratifying states, one house of the legislature approved the ERA. It failed in those states because both houses of a state's legislature must approve, during the same session, in order for that state to be deemed to have ratified.

==Congressional extension of ratification deadline==
The original joint resolution ({{usbill|92|HJRes|208}}), by which the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]] proposed the amendment to the states, was prefaced by the following resolving clause:

{{quote|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States ''within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress'': [emphasis added]}}

As the joint resolution was passed on March 22, 1972, this effectively set March 22, 1979 as the deadline for the amendment to be ratified by the requisite number of states. However, the 92nd Congress did not incorporate any time limit into the body of the actual text of the proposed amendment, as had been done with a number of other proposed amendments.<ref>See Section 3 of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]]; Section 6 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], Section 3 of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], Section 2 of the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], and Section 4 of the rejected [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]</ref>

In 1978, as the original 1979 deadline approached, the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]] adopted {{usbill|95|HJRes|638}}, by Representative [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] (House: August; Senate: October 6; signing of the President: October 20), which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982.<ref>{{USStat|92|3799}}</ref> H.J.Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a [[Majority|simple majority]], not a [[supermajority]]) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H.J.Res. 638 be transmitted to then-President [[Jimmy Carter]] for signature as a safety precaution. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Virginia]]'' (1798)<ref name="Hollingsworth v. Virginia volume=3 page=378 year=1798 reporter=Dall. reporter-volume=3}}</ref">{{ussc|name=Hollingsworth v. Virginia|volume=3|page=378|year=1798|reporter=Dall.|reporter-volume=3}}</ref> that the [[President of the United States]] has no formal role in the passing of constitutional amendments. Carter signed the joint resolution, although he noted, on strictly procedural grounds, the irregularity of his doing so given the Supreme Court's decision in 1798. During this disputed extension of slightly more than three years, no additional states ratified or [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Rescinding a ratification|rescinded]].

The purported extension of ERA's ratification deadline was vigorously contested in 1978 as scholars were divided as to whether Congress actually has authority to revise a previously agreed-to deadline for the states to act upon a constitutional amendment. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102–71 in favor, but Illinois' internal parliamentary rules required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters went on a fast and seventeen chained themselves to the entrance of the Illinois Senate chamber.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC|title=From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics, Volume 1|last=O'Dea|first=Suzanne|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874369601|page=244}}</ref><ref name="hungryheart">{{Cite book|url=http://www.lunesoleilpress.com/the-hungry-heart-a-womans-fast-for-justice.html|title=The Hungry Heart: A Woman's Fast for Justice|last=Nicholson|first=Zoe Ann|year=2004|publisher=Lune Soleil Press|isbn=0972392831}}</ref><ref name="nytimes-era">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/us/women-say-they-ll-end-fast-but-not-rights-fight.html|title=Women say they'll end fast but not rights fight|last=Sheppard|first=Nathaniel|date=June 24, 1982|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> The closest that the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979, and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the [[Florida Senate]] by a vote of 16 to 22. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have fallen short of the required 38.

According to research by Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 of them explicitly referred to the original 1979 deadline.<ref>Letter to House Judiciary Committee, June 14, 1978</ref>

==In the courts==
On December 23, 1981, a federal district court, in the case of ''Idaho v. Freeman'', ruled that the extension of the ERA ratification deadline to June 30, 1982 was not valid, and that ERA had actually expired from state legislative consideration more than two years earlier on the original expiration date of March 22, 1979. On January 25, 1982, however, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] the lower court's decision, thus signaling to the legislatures of still-unratified states that they may continue consideration of ERA during their spring 1982 legislative sessions.

After the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of ''NOW v. Idaho'', 459 U.S. 809 (1982), vacated the federal district court decision in ''Idaho v. Freeman'',<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/19811636529fsupp110711473|title=State of Idaho v.

The Supreme Court declared these controversies [[Mootness|moot]] on the grounds that the ERA had not received the required number of ratifications (38), so that "the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here."<ref name="ef-nvi">{{Cite news| url=http://www.foavc.org/01page/Articles/WarrenBurgerLetter/NOW%20v.%20Idaho_459%20U.S.%20809_1982.pdf|title=NOW v.

In the 1939 case of ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the final authority to determine whether, by lapse of time, a proposed constitutional amendment has lost its vitality before being ratified by enough states, and whether state ratifications are effective in light of attempts at subsequent withdrawal. The Court stated: "We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment."<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286 Coleman v. Miller]'', 307 U.S. 433, at 450</ref> However, this case was one where the Congress had not explicitly set a deadline, unlike the ERA proposal which explicitly contained a seven year limit.

In the context of this judicial precedent, nonpartisan counsel to a Nevada state legislative committee concluded in 2017 that "If three more states sent their ratification to the appropriate federal official, it would then be up to Congress to determine whether a sufficient number of states have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Minutes/Assembly/LOE/Final/428.pdf|title=Minutes, Hearing of the Assembly Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections}}, p.16 (March 7, 2017).</ref> In 2018, Virginia attorney general [[Mark Herring]] wrote an opinion suggesting that Congress could extend or remove the ratification deadline.<ref>See Virginia Attorney General Opinion Letter, supra, at 4.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-hopes-of-era-ratification-go-down-in-flames-this-year/2018/02/09/7acfbf80-0dab-11e8-8890-372e2047c935_story.htm|title=Virginia's hopes of ERA ratification go down in flames this year|work=Washington Post}}</ref>

==Lawsuits regarding ratification==

===Alabama lawsuit to opposing ratification===
On December 16, 2019, the states of Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota sued to prevent further ratifying of the Equal Rights Amendment. Alabama Attorney General [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]] stated, “The people had seven years to consider the ERA, and they rejected it. To sneak it into the Constitution through this illegal process would undermine the very basis for our constitutional order."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/531d19366921e8b698de5770e58c34fc|title=3 states file lawsuit seeking to block ERA ratification|date=2019-12-18|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>

South Dakota Attorney General [[Jason Ravnsborg]] stated in a press release:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://atg.sd.gov/OurOffice/Media/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=2216|title=South Dakota joins Alabama and Louisiana in legal challenge to stop activists from illegally amending the U.S. Constitution|publisher=South Dakota Attorney General|date=December 18, 2019|accessdate=December 18, 2019}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=The South Dakota Legislature ratified the ERA in 1973, but in 1979 passed Senate Joint Resolution 2 which required the ERA be ratified in the original time limit set by Congress or be rescinded. Because thirty-eight states failed to ratify the amendment by March 31, 1979 the South Dakota Legislature rescinded its ratification of the ERA. It is the duty of the Attorney General to defend and support our Legislature. It would be a disservice to the citizens of South Dakota to ignore this obligation of my office.
This is an issue of following the rule of law, the rules that our founding fathers put into place to protect us from government making decisions without the consent or support of "we the people". If Congress wants to pass an updated version of the ERA, taking into consideration all the changes in the law since 1972, I have no doubt the South Dakota Legislature would debate the merits in a new ratification process. An amendment to the Constitution should not be done by procedural nuances decades after the deadline prescribed by Congress, but through an open and transparent process where each State knows the ramifications of its actions.}}

On January 6, 2020, the Department of Justice [[Office of Legal Counsel]] official Steven Engel issued an opinion in response to the lawsuit by Alabama, Louisiana, and South Dakota, stating that "We conclude that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose a deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has expired, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the States.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1232501/download|title=Ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment|publisher=Office of Legal Counsel|date=January 6, 2020|accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref> The OLC argued in part that Congress had the authority to impose a deadline for the ERA and that it did not have the authority to retroactively extend the deadline once it had expired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/us-justice-department-says-virginia-action-would-come-too-late-to-ratify-era/2020/01/08/3ebe2642-324f-11ea-9313-6cba89b1b9fb_story.html|title=U.S. Justice Department says Virginia action would come too late to ratify ERA|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=January 9, 2020|website=The Washington Post|access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref>

On February 27, 2020, the States of Alabama, Louisiana and South Dakota entered into a joint stipulation and voluntary dismissal with the Archivist of the United States. The joint stipulation incorporated the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel's opinion; stated that the Archivist would not certify the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment and stated that if the Department of Justice ever concludes that the 1972 ERA Resolution is still pending and that the Archivist therefore has authority to certify the ERA's adoption...the Archivist will make no certification concerning ratification of the ERA until at least 45 days following the announcement of the Department of Justice's conclusion, absent a court order compelling him to do so sooner."<ref>See, ''State of Alabama, et al vs. David S.

==Support for the ERA==
Supporters of the ERA point to the lack of a specific guarantee in the Constitution for equal rights protections on the basis of sex.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/why.htm |title=ERA: Why |website=equalrightsamendment.org |access-date=April 6, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419085629/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/why.htm | archive-date=April 19, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1973, future Supreme Court justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] summarized a supporting argument for the ERA in the ''[[American Bar Association Journal]]'':<blockquote>The equal rights amendment, in sum, would dedicate the nation to a new view of the rights and responsibilities of men and women. It firmly rejects sharp legislative lines between the sexes as constitutionally tolerable. Instead, it looks toward a legal system in which each person will be judged on the basis of individual merit and not on the basis of an unalterable trait of birth that bears no necessary relationship to need or ability.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Ginsburg | first=Ruth Bader | year=1973 | title=The Need for the Equal Rights Amendment | journal=American Bar Association Journal | volume=59 | issue=9 | pages=1013–1019 | jstor=25726416}}</ref></blockquote>

==Opposition to the ERA==
[[File:Anti-ERA women dnd0215.jpg|thumb|Anti-ERA women watching a committee meeting of the Florida Senate in 1979, where consideration of the ERA was postponed, thus effectively killing the resolution for the 1979 session]]
Opponents of the ERA focused on traditional gender roles, such as how men do the fighting in wartime. They argued that the amendment would guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Defense of traditional [[gender role]]s proved to be a useful tactic. In Illinois, supporters of [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republican activist from that state, used traditional symbols of the American [[housewife]]. They took homemade bread, jams, and apple pies to the state legislators, with the slogans, "Preserve us from a Congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham" and "I am for Mom and apple pie."<ref name="Rosenberg225">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&pg=PA225 | title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century | last=Rosenberg | first=Rosalind | date=2008 | publisher=Hill & Wang | isbn=9780809016310 | page=225}}</ref> They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would invalidate protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1qosJPdqPkC&pg=PA66 | title=Justice and Gender: Sex Discrimination and the Law | last=Rhode | first=Deborah L. | date=2009 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=9780674042674 | pages=66–67}}</ref> It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same-sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed.<ref name="washingtonpost.com" /> Women who supported traditional gender roles started to oppose the ERA.<ref name="kllap">{{Cite web | url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp | title=The Equal Rights Amendment | website=ushistory.org | publisher=Independence Hall Association}}</ref> Schlafly said the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women and warned that if men and women had to be treated identically, it would threaten the security of middle-aged housewives with no job skills.

After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Support in the states that had not ratified fell below 50%.{{sfn|Mansbridge|page=214}} Critchlow and Stachecki noted that public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public.

Phyllis Schlafly was a key player in the defeat.

<blockquote>As moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers.

Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTWzBcW07RwC&pg=PA19 | title=Shattering the Myths: Women in Academe | last=Glazer-Raymo | first=Judith | publisher=Johns Hopkins UP | year=2001 | isbn=9780801866418 | page=19}}</ref></blockquote>

Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on [[Advocacy group|special interest]] forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting that they had funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority.{{sfn|Critchlow and Stachecki|page=157–158}} Such supporters argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women, [[Labor feminism|labor feminists]]{{verification needed | date=May 2018}} and (until 1973) the [[AFL–CIO]].

==Post-deadline ratifications and the "three-state strategy"==
Beginning in the mid-1990s, ERA supporters began an effort to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it between 1972 and 1982. These proponents state that Congress can remove the ERA's ratification deadline despite the deadline having expired, allowing the states again to ratify it. They also state that the ratifications ERA previously received remain in force and that rescissions of prior ratifications are not valid.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm | title=The Three-State Strategy | last=Francis | first=Roberta W. | website=equalrightsamendment.org | publisher=Alice Paul Institute in collaboration with the ERA Task Force of the National Council of Women's Organizations | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127031352/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm | archive-date=January 27, 2014 | access-date=April 25, 2014}}</ref> Those who espouse the "three-state strategy" (now complete if the Nevada, Illinois and Virginia belated ERA approvals are deemed legitimate) were spurred, at least in part, by the unconventional 202-year-long ratification of the Constitution's [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] (sometimes referred to as the "Madison Amendment") which became part of the Constitution in 1992 after pending before the state legislatures since 1789.  Although the "Madison Amendment" was not associated with a ratification deadline, whereas the proposing clause of the ERA did include a deadline, states have in the past ratified amendments after a deadline,{{which|date=December 2019}} and Congress has not rejected those ratifications (as the Supreme Court has said, "Congress in controlling the promulgation of the adoption of a constitutional amendment has the final determination of the question whether by lapse of time its proposal of the amendment had lost its vitality prior to the required ratifications").<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/433 | title=Coleman v. Miller | publisher=Justia | access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref>

On June 21, 2009, the [[National Organization for Women]] decided to support both efforts to obtain additional state ratifications for the 1972 ERA and any strategy to submit a fresh-start ERA to the states for ratification.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html | title=2009 National NOW Conference Resolutions: Equal Rights Amendment | date=June 21, 2009 | publisher=National Organization for Women | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812221001/http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html | archive-date=August 12, 2009 | access-date=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

In 2013, the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[Congressional Research Service]] issued a report saying that ratification deadlines are a [[political question]]:{{quote|ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court's decision in ''Coleman v. Miller'' gives Congress wide discretion in setting conditions for the ratification process.}} The report goes on to say:{{quote|Revivification opponents caution ERA supporters against an overly broad interpretation of ''Coleman v.

However, most recently, ERA Action has both led and brought renewed vigor to the movement by instituting what has become known as the "three-state strategy".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Held | first1=Allison | last2=Herndon | first2=Sheryl | last3=Stager | first3=Danielle | date=1997 | title=The Equal Rights Amendment: Why the ERA Remains Legally Viable And Properly Before the States | url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/WM_law_article.pdf | journal=William & Mary Journal of Women and the Law | volume=3:113 | pages=113–136 | access-date=May 24, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622203657/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/misc/WM_law_article.pdf | archive-date=June 22, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2013, ERA Action began to gain traction with this strategy through their coordination with U.S. Senators and Representatives not only to introduce legislation in both houses of Congress to remove the ratification deadline, but also in gaining legislative sponsors. The Congressional Research Service then issued a report on the "three state strategy" on April 8, 2013, entitled "The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues",<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42979.pdf | title=The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues | last=Neale | first=Thomas | date=May 9, 2013 | access-date=May 25, 2017 | quote=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> stating that the approach was viable.

In 2014, under the auspices of ERA Action and their coalition partners, both the Virginia and Illinois state senates voted to ratify the ERA. That year, votes were blocked in both states' House chambers. In the meantime, the ERA ratification movement continued with the resolution being introduced in 10 state legislatures.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/index.htm |title=ERA: Home |website=equalrightsamendment.org |access-date=April 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325173052/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ratified.htm |archive-date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="35 years after">{{Cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/21/520962541/nevada-on-cusp-of-ratifying-equal-rights-amendment-35-years-after-deadline | title=Nevada Ratifies The Equal Rights Amendment … 35 Years After The Deadline | work=NPR | access-date=April 6, 2017 | language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-cardin-equal-rights-amendment-20170121-story.html | title=As women march in D.C., Cardin co-sponsors new Equal Rights Amendment | last=Brown | first=Matthew Hay | work=The Baltimore Sun | access-date=April 6, 2017 | language=en-US}}</ref>

Senator [[Robert Menendez]] (D-New Jersey) introduced the amendment symbolically at the end of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] and has supported it in the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]].

In 1983, the ERA passed through House committees with the same text as in 1972; however, it failed by six votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote on the House floor.

At the start of the 112th Congress on January 6, 2011, Senator Menendez, along with representatives Maloney, [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-New York) and [[Gwen Moore]] (D-Wisconsin), held a press conference advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment's adoption.<ref>{{Cite press release | title=As Constitution is read aloud, Maloney, Menendez, Nadler, Moore cite need for Equal Rights Amendment | date=January 6, 2011 | url=http://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/constitution-read-aloud-maloney-menendez-nadler-moore-cite-need-equal-rights-amendment | access-date=April 22, 2015 | website=maloney.house.gov}}</ref>

On March 8, 2011, the 100th anniversary of [[International Women's Day]], Representative [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-Wisconsin) introduced legislation (H.J.

==State equal rights amendments==
{{Further|State equal rights amendments}}

Twenty-five states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex. Most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the ERA, while the wording in others resembles the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name="CRSReport">{{Cite web | url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf | title=Equal Rights Amendment: State Provisions | last=Gladstone | first=Leslie | date=August 23, 2004 | publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] | access-date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> The 1879 [[Constitution of California]] contains the earliest state equal rights provision on record. Narrowly written, it limits the equal rights conferred to "entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment". Near the end of the 19th century two more states, Wyoming (1890) and Utah (1896), included equal rights provisions in their constitutions. These provisions were broadly written to ensure political and civil equality between women and men. Several states crafted and adopted their own equal rights amendments during the 1970s and 1980s, while the ERA was before the states, or afterward.
