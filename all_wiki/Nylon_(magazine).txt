==Reception==

Medialife Magazine's Jennifer Cox wrote in 2001 that ''Nylon'' was "a little uppity, and it's not hard to understand why", describing it as "bold, idiosyncratic, challenging, absolutely of-the-moment," but unnoticed by "the mainstream" until March 2001, when ''Nylon'' was nominated for the ASME National Magazine award. She described the April issue as "groundbreaking" (for a fashion magazine) to feature an overweight woman in a history of women's weight, noted that the magazine's models "are more often interesting looking than beautiful per se."  She found its photo spreads "bold with their use of white space and innovative photography" and noted ''Nylon's'' distinctive "heavy emphasis on music coverage."<ref>{{cite web
