Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single "[[Right Round]]".

Kesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the top-ten records ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012) and ''[[High Road (Kesha album)|High Road]]'' (2020). Kesha has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including "[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]", "[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]", "[[Your Love Is My Drug]]", "[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]", "[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]", "[[Die Young]]", "[[My First Kiss]]" with [[3OH!3]], "[[We R Who We R]]", "Right Round" with Flo Rida, and "[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. The single "Tik Tok", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. 

Kesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v. Dr. Luke]]'', were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims [[breach of contract]] and [[defamation]] by Kesha.

As of 2019, Kesha has reportedly sold over 71 million records in the United States and over 134 million records worldwide.<ref name="PR Newswire">{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-music-superstar-pitbull-to-host-the-2013-american-music-awards-on-sunday-november-24th-at-8-pm-etpt-on-abc-230672391.html|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The 2013 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 24th at 8 p.m. ETPT on ABC|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|agency= PR Newswire|publisher=UBM pic|access-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="CNBC">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101171769|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The "2013 American Music Awards®" on Sunday, November 24th At 8 PM ET/PT On ABC|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|publisher=CNBC|access-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> She was also listed as the 26th top artist on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''{{'}}s decade end charts from 2010 to 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/top-artists-2010s|title=Billboard's Top Artists of the 2010s|website=Billboard|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Kesha has received several awards and nominations, including her win for the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act]] in 2010.

Kesha's second studio album ''Warrior'' used considerably less autotune, although it still showed in a number of songs.
