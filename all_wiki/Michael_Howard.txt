'''Michael Howard, Baron Howard of Lympne''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|size=100%|CH|PC|QC}} (born '''Michael Hecht'''; 7 July 1941), is a British politician who served as [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from November 2003 to December 2005.  He previously held cabinet positions in the governments of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]], including [[Secretary of State for Employment]], [[Secretary of State for the Environment]] and [[Home Secretary]].

Howard was born in [[Swansea]].  He studied at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], following which he joined the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]]. In 1964, he was called to the Bar and became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1982. He first became a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], representing the constituency of [[Folkestone and Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Folkestone and Hythe]]. This quickly led to him being promoted and Howard became Minister for Local Government in 1987. Under the premiership of [[John Major]], he served as Secretary of State for Employment (1990–1992), Secretary of State for the Environment (1992–1993) and Home Secretary (1993–1997).

Following the Conservative Party's landslide defeat at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], he unsuccessfully contested the leadership, and subsequently held the posts of [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] (1997–1999) and [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (2001–2003). In November 2003, following the Conservative Party's vote of no confidence in [[Iain Duncan Smith]], Howard was [[2003 Conservative Party leadership election|elected to the leadership]] unopposed.

At the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], the Conservatives gained 33 new seats in Parliament, including five from the Liberal Democrats; but this still gave them only 198 seats to Labour's 355. Following the election, Howard resigned as leader and was succeeded by [[David Cameron]]. Howard did not contest his seat of Folkestone and Hythe in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] and entered the [[House of Lords]] as Baron Howard of Lympne. He has been supportive of the Eurosceptic pressure group [[Leave Means Leave]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42213067 |title=No Brexit unless we back Theresa May, Jeremy Hunt says |work=[[BBC News]] |date=3 December 2017}}</ref>

==Early life==
Howard was born '''Michael Hecht''' in [[Gorseinon]], [[Swansea]].  He is the son of Bernat Hecht, who was born in [[Romania]] and came to Britain in 1939.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-howard-out-of-the-shadows-750560.html |title=News – Michael Howard |work=The Independent |date= 13 April 2002 |access-date=13 April 2002 | location=London}}</ref> His mother, Hilda (Kershion), lived in Wales from the age of 6 months. Both of Howard's parents were from Jewish families.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/01/uk.immigration From Transylvania to Smith Square ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224131103/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/nov/01/uk.immigration |date=24 February 2013 }}. ''The Guardian'' (1 November 2003). Retrieved on 15 August 2013.</ref> When Howard was six, his parents became naturalised as British subjects (now called British citizens), and his surname was also changed following the parents' naturalisation with the new surname Howard.<ref name=guard103>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/02/conservatives.labour|title=What's in a name?|last=Cohen|first=Nick|date=2 November 2003|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=[[Guardian News & Media]]|access-date=11 September 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Howard passed his [[eleven-plus]] exam in 1952 and then attended [[Llanelli Boys' Grammar School]]. He joined the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] at age 15. He obtained eight [[O-levels]], and [[A-levels]], gaining a place at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].  He was President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] in 1962.  After taking a [[British undergraduate degree classification|2:1]] in the first part of the economics [[tripos]], he switched to law and graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|2:2]] in 1962.

He was one of a cluster of Conservative students at Cambridge University around this time, sometimes referred to as the "[[Cambridge Mafia]]", many of whom held high government office under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] (see: [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]]).

Howard was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1964 and specialised in employment and planning law.  He continued his career at the Bar, becoming a practising Queen's Counsel in 1982 (unlike some barrister-MPs who were awarded the title as an honorific despite no longer practising at the Bar).

In the late 1960s Howard gained promotion within the [[Bow Group]], becoming Chairman in April 1970.  At the Conservative Party conference in October 1970, he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curb [[trade union]] power and also called for state aid to strikers' families to be reduced or stopped altogether, a policy which the Thatcher government pursued over a decade later.

In the 1970s, Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the [[European Union|Common Market (EEC)]] and served on the board of the cross-party [[Britain in Europe]] group.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Howard was named as co-respondent in the high-profile divorce case of 1960s model [[Sandra Howard|Sandra Paul]] (now Sandra Howard). They subsequently married in 1975. They have a son born in 1976 and a daughter born in 1977.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

==Member of Parliament==
At the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general elections]], Howard unsuccessfully contested the safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Liverpool Edge Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Edge Hill]]; reinforcing his strong support for [[Liverpool F.C.]] which he has held since childhood.

In June 1982, Howard was selected to contest the constituency of [[Folkestone and Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Folkestone and Hythe]] in [[Kent]] after the sitting Conservative MP, Sir [[Albert Costain]], decided to retire. Howard won the seat at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].

===In Government===
Howard gained quick promotion, becoming [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] in 1985 with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the [[City of London]]. This junior post became very important, as he oversaw the [[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]] introduction of new technology in 1986. After the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], he became Minister for Local Government. Following a proposal from backbench MP [[David Wilshire]], he accepted the amendment which would become [[Section 28]] (prohibiting local governments from the "promotion" of homosexuality) and defended its inclusion.

Howard guided the 1988 Local Government Finance Act through the House of Commons. The act brought in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s new system of local taxation, officially known as the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] but almost universally nicknamed the "poll tax". Howard personally supported the tax and won Thatcher's respect for minimising the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party. After a period as Minister for Water and Planning in 1988–89, during which he was responsible for implementing [[water privatization|water privatisation]] in England and Wales, Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January 1990 following the resignation of [[Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler|Norman Fowler]]. He subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the [[closed shop]], and campaigned vigorously for Thatcher in the first ballot of the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|1990 Conservative Party leadership contest]], although he told her a day before she resigned that he felt she wasn't going to win and that [[John Major]] was better placed to defeat [[Michael Heseltine]].

He retained his Cabinet post under [[John Major]] and campaigned against trade union power during the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] campaign. His work in the campaign led to his appointment as [[Secretary of State for the Environment]] in the reshuffle after the election. In this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but shortly afterwards he was appointed [[Home Secretary]] in a 1993 reshuffle precipitated by the sacking of [[Norman Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick|Norman Lamont]] as Chancellor.

===Home Secretary===
As Home Secretary he pursued a tough approach to crime, summed up in his sound bite, "prison works". During his tenure as Home Secretary, recorded crime fell by 16.8%.<ref>Channel 4 News, [https://web.archive.org/web/20121024050729/http://www.channel4.com/fc/quote.jsp?id=23 FactCheck: Spoof Howard Cv needs policing]</ref> In 2010 Howard claimed a 45% decrease in crime since a 1993 study by Home Office criminologist Roger Tarling proved that prison worked though the prison population rose from 42,000 to nearly 85,000.  Ken Clarke disagreed, pointing to a 60% recidivism rate amongst newly released prisoners and hinting that factors such as better household and vehicle security and better policing could be influencing crime rates, not just the incapacitation effect of removing offenders to prison.<ref name=alan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/07/michael-howard-prison-works-analysis|title=Howard is right: 'prison works' – but this is no way to cut crime|author=Alan Travis|work=the Guardian|date= 7 December 2010|access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref>

Howard repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to clamp down on crime through a series of 'tough' measures, such as reducing the [[right to silence]] of defendants in their police interviews and at their trials as part of 1994's [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act]]. Howard voted for the reintroduction of the [[death penalty]] for the killing of police officers on duty and for murders carried out with firearms in 1983 and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1990/dec/17/death-penalty-for-murder | title=DEATH PENALTY FOR MURDER (Hansard, 17 December 1990)}}</ref> In 1993, he changed his mind and became opposed to the reintroduction of the death penalty and voted against it again in February 1994.

In 1993, after the [[murder of James Bulger]], two eleven-year-old boys were convicted of his murder and sentenced to be detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]], with a recommended a minimum term of eight years. [[Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth|Lord Taylor of Gosforth]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], ordered that the two boys should serve a minimum of ten years.<ref name=odnb >{{cite ODNB|last= Davenport-Hines |first= Richard |title=Bulger, James Patrick (1990–1993), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76074|year=2004 |accessdate=2 October 2009 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/76074 }} (''Subscription Required'')</ref> The editors of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper handed a petition bearing nearly 280,000 signatures to Howard, in a bid to increase the time spent by both boys in custody.<ref name="Guardian03Mar2010">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/03/james-bulger-case-venables-thompson James Bulger killing: the case history of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709061058/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/mar/03/james-bulger-case-venables-thompson |date=9 July 2013 }} ''The Guardian'' (London) 3 March 2010.</ref> This campaign was successful, and the boys were kept in custody for a minimum of fifteen years,<ref name=Guardian03Mar2010 /><ref name="BBC3008191">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3008191.stm|title=New sentencing rules: Key cases|date=7 May 2003|publisher=BBC|access-date=11 March 2010}}</ref> meaning that they would not be considered for release until February 2008, by which time they would be 25 years of age.<ref name=odnb />

A former [[Master of the Rolls]], [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington|Lord Donaldson]], criticised Howard's intervention, describing the increased tariff as "institutionalised vengeance ... [by] a politician playing to the gallery".<ref name=odnb /> The increased minimum term was overturned in 1997 by the [[House of Lords]], which ruled it was substantively "[[ultra vires]]", and therefore "unlawful", for the Home Secretary to decide on minimum sentences for young offenders.<ref name=bbc_outrage>{{Cite news|title= Outrage at call for Bulger killers' release  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/492487.stm|publisher=BBC|date=28 October 1999}}</ref> The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] and [[European Court of Human Rights]] have since ruled that, though Parliament may set minimum and maximum terms for individual categories of crime, it is the responsibility of the trial judge, with the benefit of all the evidence and argument from both prosecution and defence counsel, to determine the minimum term in individual criminal cases.<ref name=BBC3008191 />

====Controversies====
His reputation was dented on 13 May 1997 when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published. In advance of the publication, Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service. Television interviewer [[Jeremy Paxman]] asked him the same question fourteen times in all during an edition of the ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme. Asking whether Howard had intervened when [[Derek Lewis (prison governor)|Derek Lewis]] sacked a prison governor, Paxman asked: "Did you threaten to overrule him?" Howard did not give a direct answer, instead repeatedly saying that he "did not instruct him" and ignoring the "threaten" part of the question.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/3094255.stm |title=Newsnight – Jeremy Paxman biography |work=BBC News |date=10 October 2006 |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> Paxman resumed his question in another interview in 2004. A surprised Howard remarked: "Oh come on Jeremy, are you really going back over that again? As it happens, I didn't. Are you satisfied now?" Secret Home Office papers partially vindicated Howard but show that Howard asked a top civil servant if he had the power to overrule the Prison Service director general.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/mar/02/ukcrime.freedomofinformation |title=Secret Home Office papers on prison row fail to clear Howard |date= 2 March 2005 |first=Alan |last=Travis | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Shortly after the 1997 ''Newsnight'' interview, [[Ann Widdecombe]], his former minister of state at the Home Office, made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then-Director of the Prison Service, Derek Lewis, and remarked of Howard that there is "something of the night" about him.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Kim|last2=Abrams|first2=Fran|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/widdecombe-goes-for-the-jugular-1261224.html?amp|title=Widdecombe goes for the jugular|work=The Independent|date=12 May 1997|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref> This much quoted comment is thought to have contributed to the failure of his 1997 bid for the Conservative Party leadership, including by Howard and Widdecombe,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8435904.stm|title=Ann Widdecombe 'tested out' Howard quip|work=BBC News|date=31 December 2009|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Crick|first=Michael|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mission-accomplished-how-howard-was-knifed-757lktbmgdt|title='Mission accomplished': how Howard was knifed|work=The Times|date=30 March 2005|access-date=3 April 2017}} {{subscription required}} Extract from Crick's book ''In search of Michael Howard''.</ref> and led to him being caricatured as a [[vampire]], in part due to his [[Romania]]n ancestry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=David|title=Interview with a Vampire|url=http://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2011/05/03/interview-with-a-vampire-2630|work=The Tab|date=3 May 2011}}</ref> Such characterisations caused discontent among members of Britain's Jewish community.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Freedland|first1=Jonathan|title=The trailblazer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/31/conservatives.politicalcolumnists|work=The Guardian|date=31 October 2003}}</ref>

===First attempt to win party leadership===
Following the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|1997 resignation]] of [[John Major]], Howard and [[William Hague]] ran on the same ticket, with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman. The day after they agreed this, Hague decided to run on his own. Howard also stood but his campaign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary.

Howard came in last out of five candidates with the support of only 23 MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election. He then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner, [[William Hague]]. Howard served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but retired from the [[Shadow Cabinet]] in 1999, though continued as an MP.

===Leader of the Opposition===
{{see also|Shadow Cabinet of Michael Howard}}
After the Conservative defeat at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservative Party's new leader, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], appointed him [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. His performances in the post won him much praise; indeed, under his guidance, the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an 'Opposition Day' for the first time in several years. After Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership, Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November 2003. As leader, he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand. He avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith's firing of [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] as Conservative Party Chairman and imposed discipline quickly and firmly: for example, he removed the party whip from [[Ann Winterton]] after she joked about 23 Chinese migrants' deaths.

In February 2004, Howard called on then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to resign over the Iraq War, for failing to ask "basic questions" regarding [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] claims and misleading Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3460771.stm |date=5 February 2004|title= Howard calls for Blair to resign |work=BBC News}}</ref> In July, the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq War had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based. At the same time, he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because "the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3910371.stm |date=20 July 2004|title= At-a-glance Iraq debate |work=BBC News}}</ref> However, Howard's criticism of Blair was not received favourably in [[Washington, D.C.]], where [[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] refused to meet him. Bush's advisor [[Karl Rove]] reportedly told Howard, "you can forget about meeting the president. Don't bother coming."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3608006.stm |date=28 August 2004|title= Howard hits out at Bush aides |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Howard was named 2003 Parliamentarian of the Year by ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' and Zurich UK. This was in recognition of his performance at the dispatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor. However, twelve months after he became party leader, neither his personal popularity nor his party's with the public had risen appreciably in opinion polls from several years before.

Howard was part of discussions for [[British Airways]] to resume flights to [[Pakistan]] in 2003, this was until their final departure in 2008 the only European airline serving the nation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.news24.com/World/News/BA-flies-back-to-Pakistan-20031202 |title = BA flies back to Pakistan|date = 2 December 2003}}</ref>

====Further Newsnight treatment====
In November 2004, ''[[Newsnight]]'' again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a campaign trip to [[Cornwall]] and an interview with [[Jeremy Paxman]]. The piece, which purported to show that members of the public could not identify Howard and that those who recognised him did not support him, was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party. The complaint argued that the ''Newsnight'' team spoke only to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives and that Paxman's style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive. In this programme, Paxman also returned to [[#Controversies|his question from 1997]]. Howard returned briefly to ''Newsnight'' on Jeremy Paxman's final episode on 18 June 2014 for a cameo.

====2005 general election====
At the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Howard's Conservative Party suffered a third consecutive defeat, although the Conservatives gained 33 seats (including five from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]) and Labour's majority shrank from 167 to 66. The Conservatives were left with 198 seats to Labour's 355. The Conservative share of the national vote increased by 0.6% from 2001 and 1.6% from 1997. The party ended with 32.4% of the total votes cast, which was within 3% of Labour on 35.2%.

The day after the election, Howard stated in a speech in the newly gained Conservative seat in [[Putney (UK Parliament constituency)|Putney]] that he would not lead the party into the next general election as, already aged 63, he would be "too old" by that stage, and that he would stand down "sooner rather than later", following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process. Despite Labour winning a third term in government, Howard described the election as "the beginning of a recovery" for the Conservative Party following Labour's landslide victories in 1997 and 2001.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4521941.stm | work=BBC News | title=Howard will stand down as leader | date=6 May 2005}}</ref>

Howard's own constituency of [[Folkestone and Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Folkestone and Hythe]] had been heavily targeted by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] as the most sought after prize of their failed "decapitation" strategy of seeking to gain seats from prominent Conservatives. Yet Howard almost doubled his majority to 11,680, while the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] saw their vote fall.

====Criticism of 2005 campaign====
During the 2005 general election campaign, Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a campaign which addressed the issues of [[immigration]], [[asylum seeker]]s, and [[tourism|travellers]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Others noted that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches.

Some evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them, indicating that the party still had an image problem. Conservative [[John Major]]'s 30% lead in 1992 amongst the sought after [[NRS social grade|ABC1]] voters (professionals) had all but disappeared by 2005.<ref>[http://www.progressives.org.uk/magazine/Default.asp?action=magazine&articleid=920 News and debate from the progressive community ]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Progressives.org.uk. Retrieved on 15 August 2013.{{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref>

The campaign focus on immigration may have been influenced by Howard's election adviser [[Lynton Crosby]], who had run similar tactics in Australian elections earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.safecom.org.au/2005/04/lynton-crosby-globetrotting-spreading.htm  |date=18 April 2005 |work=Fixing Australia|title=Lynton Crosby globetrotting, spreading dirty dog whistles}}</ref> Crosby was later re-hired by the Conservative Party to run their successful campaign in the [[2008 London mayoral election]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the lead up to the election campaign, Howard continued to impose strong party discipline, controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger (Sedgefield), Robert Oulds and Adrian Hilton (both Slough) and [[Howard Flight]] (Arundel & South Downs).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/mar/28/conservatives.politicalcolumnists|title=The brutal world of Spin Doctor Who|author=Peter Preston|work=The Guardian|date=28 March 2005|access-date=29 August 2015}}</ref>

===Resignation===
Despite his impending resignation after the 2005 general election, Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party's front bench in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios, including [[George Osborne]] and [[David Cameron]]. This move cleared the way for Cameron (who had worked for Howard as a Special Advisor when the latter was Home Secretary) to stand for the Conservative Party leadership.

The reforms to the party's election process took several months and Howard remained in his position for six months after the election. During that period, he enjoyed a fairly pressure-free time, often making joking comparisons between himself and [[Tony Blair]], both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next general election. He also oversaw Blair's first parliamentary defeat, when the Conservative Party, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and sufficient [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] rebels voted against government proposals to extend to 90 days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge. Howard stood down as Leader of the Conservative Party in December 2005 and was succeeded by [[David Cameron]].

==Retirement==

On 19 June 2006 it was reported that Howard would become chairman of Diligence Europe, a private intelligence and risk assessment company founded by former [[CIA]] and [[MI5]] members.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/18/bloomberg/bxshake.php Former Tory leader to head risk firm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202125640/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/18/bloomberg/bxshake.php |date=2 December 2008 }} [[International Herald Tribune]] 19 June 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diligencellc.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.home&id=6&object=39 |title=Diligence announces addition of Michael Howard to Advisory Board |publisher=Diligencellc.com |access-date=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715211310/http://www.diligencellc.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.home&id=6&object=39 |archive-date=15 July 2007 }}</ref>

On 23 October 2006, Howard said that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the "[[Cash-for-Honours scandal|Cash for Honours]]" investigation surrounding fundraising and the 2005 election campaign. He was not suspected of any criminal activity,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6078788.stm Howard quizzed in honours probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107170226/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6078788.stm |date=7 November 2006 }} [[BBC News]] 23 October 2006.</ref> was not accused of any criminal activity and gave evidence purely as a witness in an investigation focusing primarily on the Labour Government's use of the peerages system and their party fundraising.

Howard stood down as MP for Folkestone and Hythe at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4818832.stm |title=Michael Howard stands down as MP |work=BBC News |date=17 March 2006 |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref> On 13 July the Conservatives selected [[Damian Collins]] to stand in his place at that election.

On 28 May 2010, Howard was included in the [[2010 Dissolution Honours|Dissolution Honours List]] to become a Conservative [[life peer]] in the House of Lords<ref name="dissolution-honours">{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/05/peerages-honours-and-appointments-51162|title=Peerages, honours and appointments|date=28 May 2010|publisher=10 Downing Street|access-date=24 June 2010}}</ref> with the title of '''Baron Howard of Lympne''', of [[Lympne]] in the County of Kent.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59491 |date=19 July 2010 |page=13713}}</ref> On 20 July 2010, he was formally introduced into the [[House of Lords]] by past colleague [[Norman Lamont]], and attended Questions and debate later that day.<ref>[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090628060238/http://services.parliament.uk/calendar/ House of Lords Future Business], 20 July 2010.</ref>

In 2010, [[David Cameron]] wanted Howard to join his [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]], possibly as [[Lord Chancellor]], via the [[House of Lords]] as part of [[David Cameron]]'s appeal to rightwing Tories. However, it did not happen, Howard having criticised the government's proposal for a 'rehabilitation revolution'.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/8037566/Top-100-most-influential-Right-wingers-75-51.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Iain | last1=Dale | first2=Brian | last2=Brivati | author-link2 = Brian Brivati|title=Top 100 most influential Right-wingers: 75-51 | date=4 October 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Companion of Honour.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Insignia of [[Companion of Honour]], to which Howard was appointed in 2011]]
In February 2011 there was increased speculation that Cameron would reshuffle his cabinet, with Lord Howard brought in to replace [[Kenneth Clarke]] as [[Secretary of State for Justice]]. Instead, [[Chris Grayling]] was appointed.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/20/kenneth-clarke-european-court-reform | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Allegra | last=Stratton | title=Kenneth Clarke offers hope to Tory critics of human rights court | date=20 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/19/tory-mps-david-cameron-reshuffle?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Toby | last=Helm | title=Tory MPs press David Cameron for cabinet reshuffle | date=19 February 2011}}</ref>

Howard was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011|page=26 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/queen%E2%80%99s-birthday-honours-list-2011 |title=The Queen's Birthday Honours List 2011 |access-date=2011-06-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609144934/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/queen%E2%80%99s-birthday-honours-list-2011 |archive-date=9 June 2012 |df=dmy }} Cabinet Office, 11 June 2011.</ref>

A few days after [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] was triggered for the United Kingdom to leave the [[European Union]], Howard was interviewed on 2 April 2017 by [[Sophy Ridge]] for her programme on [[Sky News]].  He compared the post-[[Brexit]] situation of [[Gibraltar]]'s disputed sovereignty with Spain with the resolution of a similar issue by the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. Howard said he was "absolutely certain" [[Theresa May]] "will show the same resolve in standing by the people of Gibraltar" as Margaret Thatcher had done in the South Atlantic. Leading figures from the other parties rejected this viewpoint.<ref>{{cite news|last=Asthana|first=Anushka|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/britain-and-eu-worse-off-without-brexit-deal-says-michael-fallon|title=Theresa May would go to war to protect Gibraltar, Michael Howard says|work=The Guardian|date=2 April 2017|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Peck|first=Tom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-gibraltar-falklands-war-senior-conservatives-fallon-howard-a7662656.html|title=Brexit could turn Gibraltar in to the next Falklands, senior Conservatives suggest|work=The Independent|date=2 April 2017|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref> A spokesman for Number 10 said such a conflict "isn't going to happen".<ref>{{cite news|last=Watts|first=Joe|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/downing-street-michael-howard-gibraltar-war-spain-uk-territory-brexit-eu-theresa-may-a7664246.html|title=Downing Street defends ex-Tory leader Michael Howard's claim UK would go to war with Spain over Gibraltar|work=The Independent|date=3 April 2017|access-date=3 April 2017}}</ref>

===Criticism of Somali business interests===
In 2015, [[Soma Oil & Gas|Soma Oil and Gas]], which Howard chairs, was investigated by the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/report-raises-questions-over-somali-dealings-of-firm-headed-by-u-k-s-michael-howard-1440529699|title=Report Raises Questions Over Somali Dealings of Firm Headed by U.K.'s Michael Howard|author=Justin Scheck and Jenny Gross |work=Wall Street Journal|date=25 August 2015|access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref> On 14 December 2016, The Serious Fraud Office closed its investigation of Soma, citing insufficient evidence of corruption.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2016/12/15/serious-fraud-office-closes-corruption-investigation-of-soma-oil/|title=Serious Fraud Office Closes Corruption Investigation of Soma Oil|work=WSJ Risk and Compliance Journal|date=15 December 2016|access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref>

===Charity work===
Howard is a keen supporter of the [[hospice]] movement and was chairman of Hospice UK from 2010 until 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hospiceuk.org/about-hospice-care/media-centre/press-releases/details/2018/04/27/hospice-uk-chair-set-to-retire-from-board-later-this-year |title = Hospice UK Chair set to retire from board later this year}}</ref>
