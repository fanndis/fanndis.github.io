'''''The Terminal''''' is a 2004 American [[comedy-drama]] film produced and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and starring [[Tom Hanks]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], and [[Stanley Tucci]]. The film is about an [[Eastern Europe]]an man who becomes stuck in [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York]]'s [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]] terminal when he is denied entry into the United States and at the same time is unable to return to his native country because of a military [[coup]].

The film is partially inspired by the true story of the 18-year stay of [[Mehran Karimi Nasseri]] in Terminal 1 of [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]], France, from 1988 to 2006.<ref name=CSM062104>{{cite web|first=Ethan|last=Gilsdorf|title=Behind 'The Terminal,' a true story|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0621/p11s02-almo.html|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref> After finishing his previous film, ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Spielberg decided to direct ''The Terminal'' because he wanted to make another film "that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world". Due to a lack of suitable airports willing to provide their facilities for the production, an entire working set was built inside a large hangar at the [[Palmdale Regional Airport|LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]], but a lot of general inside shots and most of the film's exterior shots were from the [[Montréal–Mirabel International Airport]].

The film was released in North America on June 18, 2004 to mixed reviews and was a commercial success, earning $219 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Viktor Navorski ([[Tom Hanks]]), a traveler from the fictional nation of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], only to discover that his [[passport]] is suddenly no longer valid. The United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as an independent country after the outbreak of a civil war, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now [[Statelessness|stateless]]. Because of this, [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] seizes his passport and airline ticket.

With no other choice, Viktor settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a [[Planters]] peanut can, much to the frustration of Frank Dixon ([[Stanley Tucci]]), the temporary customs director of the airport. Dixon is being considered for a promotion and becomes obsessed with getting rid of Viktor. Later, Dixon lets Viktor be a "free man" in the transit lounge, and cannot leave it. Viktor goes in a renovation zone where a gate will be renovated, and makes it his home. He then befriends and assists airport employees and travelers. Among them is a [[flight attendant]] named Amelia Warren ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), whom he sees periodically and tries to woo, presenting himself as a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Viktor began reading magazines and newspaper articles to learn English. Viktor had been hired by an airport contractor and paid [[Unreported employment | under the table]] after he impulsively remodeled a wall at the renovation zone.

One day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions whether she knows Viktor's true situation. Amelia confronts Viktor at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the "[[A Great Day in Harlem (photograph)|A Great Day in Harlem]]" photograph. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] newspaper in 1958, and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist [[Benny Golson]]. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor.

After nine months, his friends wake Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended, and he gets a green stamp, allowing him to leave the airport. Amelia also asked her "friend"—actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair—to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn she has renewed her relationship with the man during this process. Moreover, Viktor finds out that Dixon must sign the visa. Seizing the opportunity, Dixon threatens to cause trouble for Viktor's friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta ([[Kumar Pallana]]) back to [[India]] to potentially face a charge of assaulting a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to return home to Krakozhia. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of a plane as it taxies to the terminal, resulting in his deportation, effectively taking the burden off Viktor.

The delay gives Viktor enough time to get into the city. Dixon attempts to have his officers detain and arrest Viktor, but they instead let him leave the airport. As Viktor is getting in a taxi, Amelia arrives in another taxi, and they briefly make eye contact. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. Then he gets in a taxi, telling the driver, "I am going home."

==Production==
[[File:Airportset2w.jpg|right|thumb|The gigantic airport set built for the film.]]
Some have noted that the film appears to be inspired by the story of [[Mehran Karimi Nasseri]], also known as Sir Alfred, an [[Iran]]ian [[refugee]] who lived in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris from 1988 when his refugee papers were stolen until 2006 when he was hospitalized for unspecified ailments.<ref name=CSM062104/><ref>Duncan Walker, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3570850.stm "Life in the lounge"], BBC News Online Magazine, August 17, 2004</ref> In September 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that Spielberg bought the rights to Nasseri's life story as the basis for the film; and in September 2004 ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted Nasseri received thousands of dollars from the filmmakers.<ref name=NYT092103>Matthew Rose, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/magazine/magazinespecial/MFMERHANT.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5007&en=360b6f8f63635c6a&ex=1379476800 "Waiting For Spielberg"], ''The New York Times'', September 21, 2003.

The 1993 French film ''[[Lost in Transit]]'' was already based on the same story. In deciding to make the film, Steven Spielberg stated that after directing ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', "I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world.... This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times."<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Total Film]]|title=The Total Film Interview - Steven Spielberg|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-total-film-interview-steven-spielberg/|website=GamesRadar+|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=March 16, 2018|date=September 1, 2004}}</ref>

Spielberg traveled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length of the production, but could not find one. ''The Terminal'' set was built in a massive hangar at the [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]]. The hangar, part of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Plant 42]] complex was used to build the [[Rockwell International]] [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B bomber]]. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on [[Düsseldorf Airport]]. The shape of both the actual terminal and the set viewed sideways is a cross section of an aircraft wing. Because of this design, the film was one of the first to use the "Spider-Cam" for film production. The camera, most often used for televised sports, allowed Spielberg the ability to create sweeping shots across the set. The design of the set for ''The Terminal'', as noted by [[Roger Ebert]] in his reviews and attested by Spielberg himself in a feature by ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine, was greatly inspired by [[Jacques Tati]]'s classic film ''[[PlayTime]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hanks based his characterization of Viktor Navorski on his father-in-law Allan Wilson, a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] immigrant, who according to Hanks can speak "[[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], little bit of [[Italian language|Italian]], little bit of [[French language|French]]", in addition to his native [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].<ref>"Season 12 Episode 9."

The clarinet piece "Viktor's Tale", also composed by [[John Williams]], is taken from the movie's soundtrack.

Emily Bernstein recorded the clarinet solos for the score. Director Steven Spielberg - a former clarinetist himself - insisted that Bernstein's name appear in the film's end credits, although traditionally, individual musicians performing in studio orchestras remain anonymous.

===Critical response===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 61% of 206 sampled critics gave ''The Terminal'' positive reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Terminal'' transcends its flaws through the sheer virtue of its crowd-pleasing message and a typically solid star turn from Tom Hanks."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Terminal (2004)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1133499-1133499-terminal/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a [[Weighted mean|weighted average score]] of 55 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Terminal reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-terminal|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Find CinemaScore|format=Type "Terminal" in the search box|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=November 4, 2020}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave ''The Terminal'' three-and-a-half out of four stars, stating that "This premise could have yielded a film of contrivance and labored invention.

==Krakozhia==
'''Krakozhia''' (''Кракозия'' or ''Кракожия'') is a fictional country, created for the film, that closely resembles a former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]] or [[Eastern Bloc]] state.

The exact location of Krakozhia is kept intentionally vague in the film, sticking with the idea of Viktor being simply [[Eastern Europe]]an or from a [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republic]]. However, in one scene, a map of Krakozhia is briefly displayed on one of the airport's television screens during a news report on the ongoing conflict and its borders are those of the [[North Macedonia|Republic of North Macedonia]], but in another scene the protagonist shows his driving license, which happens to be a Belarusian license issued to a woman bearing an Uzbek name. The film presents a reasonably accurate picture of the process of naturalistic [[second-language acquisition]], according to linguist [[Martha Young-Scholten]].<ref name=sla>{{cite web|last=Young-Scholten|first=Martha|title=Hollywood: smarter than you think?

[[John Williams]], the film's composer, also wrote a [[national anthem]] for Krakozhia.<ref>Clemmensen, Christian (June 10, 2004). [http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/terminal.html ''The Terminal''] soundtrack review at [[Filmtracks.com]]</ref>

Tom Hanks’ character speaks the [[Bulgarian language]] as his native Krakozhian, and in one scene where he helps a passenger with a [[customs]] related issue, he speaks [[Russian language|Russian]].
