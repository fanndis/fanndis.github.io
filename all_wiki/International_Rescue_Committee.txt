The '''International Rescue Committee''' ('''IRC''') is a global [[humanitarian aid]], relief, and development [[nongovernmental organization]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|date=2017|website=International Rescue Committee}}</ref> Founded in 1933 as the International Relief Association, at the request of [[Albert Einstein]], and changing its name in 1942 after amalgamating with the similar [[Varian Fry#Emergency Rescue Committee|Emergency Rescue Committee]], the IRC provides emergency aid and long-term assistance to [[refugee]]s and those displaced by war, persecution, or natural disaster. The IRC is currently working in about 40 countries and 26 U.S. cities where it resettles refugees and helps them become self-sufficient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/job/2242974/grants-compliance-specialist-un-agencies|title=Grants Compliance Specialist - UN Agencies|date=September 27, 2017|website=ReliefWeb}}</ref> It focuses mainly on health, education, economic wellbeing, power, and safety.

Consisting of first responders, humanitarian relief workers, [[international development]] experts, [[health care]] providers, and educators, the IRC has assisted millions of people around the world since its founding in 1933. In 2016, 26 million people in about 40 countries and 26 U.S. cities benefited from IRC programs.<ref>International Rescue Committee. [https://www.rescue.org/international-rescue-committee-irc-annual-report-2016 2016 Annual Report], New York, NY: International Rescue Committee 2017.</ref>

The current President of the International Rescue Committee is former British [[Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom|Foreign Secretary]] [[David Miliband]] (2013–present).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/david-miliband|title=David Miliband|website=International Rescue Committee}}</ref>

== History ==
The International Rescue Committee (IRC) was the American branch of the International Relief Association (which later combined with another relief organization), which was founded by Albert Einstein in 1931.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/page/history-international-rescue-committee|title=History of the International Rescue Committee|website=rescue.org}}</ref> The IRC was initially an organization that helped those who were fleeing [[Nazi Germany]] and as need arose it expanded its clientele.

=== Founding ===
The International Relief Association (IRA) was founded in 1931 in Germany by two left-wing factions, the Communist Party Opposition (KPO) and the Socialist Workers Party (SAP). Its purpose was to aid victims of state oppression and persecution.<ref name="spinwatch.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/blog/item/5483-what-is-david-miliband-s-international-rescue-committee|last=Griffin |first=Tom |date=March 28, 2013 |title=What is David Miliband's International Rescue Committee?|publisher=Spinwatch.org|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> After the Nazis took power in 1933, the organization moved its headquarters to Paris.<ref>Chester, Eric Thomas Chester (1995). ''Covert Network: Progressives, the International Rescue Committee and the CIA''. New York: M.E. Sharpe. p.&nbsp;7.</ref>

The KPO consisted of the 'right opposition'&nbsp;&ndash; communists who had been purged by Stalin in 1929 because of their support for [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Among those purged was Jay Lovestone, the erstwhile head of the American Communist Party. It was Lovestone who formed an American section of the International Relief Association in 1933. Among those who joined him was [[Albert Einstein]]. Its purpose was to assist Germans suffering under [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] government&nbsp;&ndash; particularly supporters of the 'right opposition'. Later, refugees from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy and [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] Spain were assisted.

In 1940, European exiles and American liberals close to First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], founded the [[Varian Fry#Emergency Rescue Committee|Emergency Rescue Committee]] (ERC) to aid European refugees trapped in [[Vichy France]]. ERC founding member [[Varian Fry]] arrived in [[Marseilles]] within a few weeks of the [[fall of France]], where he pulled together a small team that was instrumental in helping many individuals escape Vichy and the Nazis to safety in the U.S. and elsewhere. Over 2,000 political, cultural, union and academic leaders were rescued in just 13 months, ending when Fry was expelled by the Vichy French. Fry also worked closely with British intelligence, helping to establish escape routes for British servicemen.<ref>Chester (1995), pp.&nbsp;11-18.</ref>

In 1942, after the US entered the Second World War, IRA and ERC joined forces under the name International Relief and Rescue Committee, which was later shortened to the International Rescue Committee.<ref name="Nono1">{{cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/page/history-international-rescue-committee|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> The organization was financed largely by the National War Fund. According to historian Eric Thomas Chester, by the 1950s the IRC had evolved into a global operation functioning as an integral link in the CIA's covert network, became deeply involved in the volatile confrontations between the two superpowers, and participated in an array of sensitive clandestine operations.<ref>Chester (1995), pp.&nbsp;17-18.</ref>

=== Timeline ===

==== 1940s ====
In the 1940s, IRC fed people during the Soviet blockade of West Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Rescue-Committee|title=International Rescue Committee {{!}} international organization|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> In 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], the IRC initiated emergency relief programs, established hospitals and children's centers, and started refugee resettlement efforts in Europe. With the descent of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1946, the IRC initiated a resettlement program for East European refugees, which continued until the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref name="Nono1" />

==== 1950s ====
In 1950, the IRC intensified its aid in Europe with Project Berlin, which provided food to the people of West Berlin amid increased Soviet oppression. After the war, the Committee's European representatives focused on rebuilding the German SPD as a bulwark against the Communists.<ref name="spinwatch.org"/>

[[Leo Cherne]], an IRC board member since 1946, was elected IRC Chairman in 1951. He would hold the position for 40 years.

Also in the 1950s, the IRC began relief and resettlement programs for refugees displaced by the North Vietnamese defeat of the French and by the Soviet forces’ crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]].<ref name="Nono1"/> According to historian Eric Thomas Chester, the IRC was instrumental in the establishment of two key Washington lobby groups supporting South Vietnam, the American Friends of Vietnam, and its successor, the Citizens Committee for Peace with Freedom in Vietnam.<ref>Chester (1995), p.&nbsp;145.</ref><ref name="spinwatch.org"/>

==== 1960s ====
In 1960, an IRC resettlement program began for Cuban refugees fleeing the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] dictatorship and for Haitian refugees escaping the [[François Duvalier|Duvalier]] regime.

IRC operations were extended to Africa in 1962 when 200,000 Angolans fled to [[Zaire]]. Also that year, the IRC began aiding Chinese fleeing to [[Hong Kong]] from the mainland.<ref name="Nono1"/>

==== 1970s ====
The IRC was active worldwide, providing support for refugees fleeing conflict and oppression in [[India]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], [[Guatemala]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Uganda]] and the [[Soviet Union]], while resettling refugees in the United States.<ref name="Nono1"/>

==== 1980s ====
At the turn of the decade, the IRC launched emergency relief programs for Afghan refugees fleeing to [[Pakistan]]. Eight years later, the IRC started community rehabilitation activities in [[Afghanistan]] for tens of thousands of returning refugees.

During the 1982 war in [[Lebanon]], the IRC assisted Palestinian and Lebanese refugees.

Spanish Refugee Aid, which served the survivors of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in [[France]], became a division of the IRC in 1984. That same year, the IRC initiated health and [[community development]] projects in [[El Salvador]] for displaced victims of the [[civil war]].

Partnering with the Polish trade union movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in 1987, the IRC began a health care program in [[Poland]].

Relief programs to assist Mozambican refugees in [[Malawi]] also began in 1987. Eight years later, the IRC was in [[Mozambique]] helping with their return.

In 1989, the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children was established by the IRC as an affiliate organization whose purpose is to serve the rights and interests of the 80% of the world's refugees who are women and children. The Women's Commission became the [[Women's Refugee Commission]] in 2009.<ref name="Nono1"/>

==== 1990s ====
After the first [[Gulf War]], the IRC came to the aid of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees who fled Saddam Hussein's regime. In 1992, the IRC began work in the former [[Yugoslavia]], first dealing with the consequences of [[ethnic cleansing]] in [[Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] and later launching community rehabilitation programs in [[Bosnia]].

IRC became headquartered in the [[Chanin Building]] in midtown [[Manhattan]] in 1994.<ref name=A/> In 1994, the IRC set up emergency programs in [[Tanzania]] and Zaire (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]) to aid refugees fleeing genocide and civil war in [[Rwanda]].

IRC operations began inside [[Kosovo]] in 1997 and were expanded in 1999 to meet the needs of Kosovar refugees in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]] and Bosnia. Also in 1997, the IRC opened a UK office.

In 1999, the IRC launched emergency operations in [[East Timor]].<ref name="Nono1"/>

==== 2000s ====
In 2000, the IRC launched emergency shelter, sanitation and education programs for [[Chechnya|Chechen]] refugees fleeing fighting between Russian forces and separatist Chechen rebels.

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the IRC undertook an advocacy campaign to reverse the U.S. government's slowdown in refugee resettlement.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/2006/03/16/2006-03-16__inhuman_rights_immigration_.html “Inhuman Rights Immigration Bill”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604223558/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/2006/03/16/2006-03-16__inhuman_rights_immigration_.html |date=2011-06-04 }}, Daily News, 16 March 2006</ref>

The IRC responded to the war in [[Iraq]] by providing water and sanitation and health care support from 2003 to 2005. In 2007, the IRC launched a campaign to aid and support displaced Iraqis.

In 2003, IRC programs in [[West Africa]] expanded to serve the growing populations of refugees and displaced persons uprooted by civil conflict.

In 2005, around two decades after Burmese refugees first began crossing into Thailand, poverty and violent conflict in Myanmar's ethnic minority areas continue to drive people into camps along the border. Since its opening in 2005, by 2012 the Resettlement Support Center (formerly known as the Overseas Processing Entity) in the Thai capital [[Bangkok]] had helped 90,000 people seek admission to the United States as refugees. The Resettlement Support Center primarily assists refugees in Thailand but also assists asylum seekers in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia. The activities of the center are funded by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue.org/program/overseas-processing-entity |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313113634/http://www.rescue.org/program/overseas-processing-entity |archive-date=2012-03-13 }}</ref>

The IRC worked closely with local aid organizations to respond to various disasters, including in [[Pakistan]] after the 2005 earthquake;<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/112920284441.htm “On the Ground: South Asia Quake – Six Days Later”], Reuters Alertnet, 13 October 2005</ref> and in [[Indonesia]] after the South Asian tsunami; and in Myanmar after the 2008 cyclone.

In 2008, the IRC released the fifth in a series of surveys demonstrating the excess loss of life in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] caused by the nation's long-running civil war. The fifth survey put the excess-death toll between August 1998 and April 2007 at 5.4 million.

The IRC affiliate Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children became the Women's Refugee Commission in 2009.<ref name="Nono1"/>

==== 2010s ====

Following the [[Haiti earthquake]] in January 2010, the IRC deployed its Emergency Response Team to Haiti to deliver help to [[Port-au-Prince]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/24/opinion/main6240444.shtml “Giving Donations That Transform Haiti”], CBS News, 24 February 2010</ref> IRC experts in emergency health, shelter and children's welfare worked with local aid groups to assist survivors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirc.org/crisis-haiti|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>

[[David Miliband]], former [[British Foreign Secretary]], became the IRC president and CEO in 2013.<ref name="A">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065447/how-a-visionary-aid-organization-is-using-technology-to-help-refugees|title=Inside The IRC: How A Visionary Aid Organization Is Using Technology To Help Refugees|last=Shaer|first=Matthew|date=2016-11-21|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref> In 2015, according to IRC it trained 15,000 farmers, gave 440,000 babies measles vaccinations, job training to 27,000 people and resettled 10,000 refugees in the United States.<ref name=A/>

In 2016, ''Fast Company'' said that IRC "might be the most under-recognized yet influential nongovernmental aid group in the world." In 2016, it had 11,000 people in it, and offices in around 40 countries. It had an annual operating budget of around $700 million.<ref name=A/> In 2016, the IRC aided around 15,000 women and girls through protection and empowerment programs in Jordan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/sites/default/files/document/1568/internationalrescuecommitteeannualreport2016-rev.pdf|title=InternatIonal rescue commIttee Annual Report 2016|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> In 2016 the IRC published the "Outcomes and Evidence Framework,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oef.rescue.org|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC) Outcomes and Evidence Framework|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref> an interactive tool that aims to create a framework for guiding humanitarian decision-making using theories of change and research evidence. The same year, they publicly committed to using this tool to ensure that all of their programs are evidence-based or evidence-generating by 2020 as part of the "Grand Bargain" commitments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agendaforhumanity.org/stakeholder/202|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC) Grand Bargain Committments|accessdate=12 February 2018}}</ref>

In July 2018, IRC was behind the Welcome Home initiative to give tours and activities for refugees in New York City and Northern California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/travel/trip-advisor-refugee-initiative.html|title=From TripAdvisor, a Program to Help Refugees Get to Know the U.S.|last=Vora|first=Shivani|date=2018-07-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 2019, the IRC in San Diego began hosting a "Refugee Film Festival" that presents documentaries about the refugee experience.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=Documentaries about The Beatles|work=The Beatles on Film|year=2008|publisher=transcript Verlag|doi=10.14361/9783839408858-008|isbn=978-3-8394-0885-8|doi-access=free|title=Documentaries about the Beatles}}</ref>

==== 2020s ====
On March 13, 2020, the second annual IRC's Refugee Film Festival in San Diego was postponed until June due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/announcement/ircs-refugee-film-festival|title=IRC's Refugee Film Festival|date=2020-02-01|website=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>

== Current work ==
The IRC is now at work in about 40 countries and in 26 U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/where-we-work|title=Where We Work|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> In 2010, notable operations included disaster response in the wake of the earthquake in [[Haiti]], ongoing programs to address the humanitarian crisis in Congo and to help community rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and advocacy and resettlement efforts on behalf of Iraqis uprooted by the war.

The organization was involved in responding to a massacre in [[Bani Walid, Libya]], where near a hundred young men attempting to escape a militia were gunned down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/article/tortured-and-run-militias|title=Tortured and on the run from militias|date=2018-08-02|website=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>

On August 5, 2018, it was reported that the agency had lowered its staff number in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] after refugee arrivals decreased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2018-08-05/resettlement-agencies-cut-staff-as-refugee-arrivals-drop|title=Resettlement Agencies Cut Staff as Refugee Arrivals Drop|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>

=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===

The IRC is one of the largest providers of humanitarian assistance in the DRC, where conflict and humanitarian crisis have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998, according to peer-reviewed studies by the IRC. The organization runs programs dedicated to health, education, civil society development, emergency response and reducing gender-based violence, in seven Congolese provinces. As rape and other forms of sexual violence have increasingly been used as a tactic of war by militias involved in the conflict, the IRC has stepped up its sexual violence aid and protection programs. Between 2002 and 2018, the IRC has provided medical care, counseling and economic support services to about 40,000 women and girls who have survived [[sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|sexual violence in Congo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirc.org/special-reports/congo-forgotten-crisis|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>{{Self-published source|date=September 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}

The IRC is at the origin of a controversial estimate of the excess mortality in the DRC due to conflicts following the genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. According to the IRC at first, the excess mortality was estimated at 3.8 million deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CD/DRC_MAPPING_REPORT_FINAL_EN.pdf|title=UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS - DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, 1993–2003 Report of the Mapping Exercise documenting the most serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003 August 2010, page 48, footnote 86}}</ref> This estimate was challenged by a group of Belgian demographers sent to the DRC by a European institution to help draw up electoral lists for the DRC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://adrass.net/|title=Bienvenue sur ADRASS - ADRASS|website=adrass.net|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> For cross-checking purposes, they made a study of the excess mortality in the DRC over the period 1998-2004 which came to 183,000 deaths, twenty times less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adrass.net/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Excess-Death-Toll-in-DRC-1998-2004-diffusion.pdf|title=Overmortality in Congo (DRC) during the 1998-2004 Conflicts: an Estimate of Excess Deaths scientifically based on Demographic Methods André Lambert and Louis Lohlé-Tart, demographers, October 2008|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>

=== Iraq ===
[[File:Yazidi refugees.jpg|thumb|right| Yazidi refugees from Iraq receive aid from the IRC at Newroz camp, Syria, 13 August 2014]]

The IRC conducted operations across Iraq from April 2003 through December 2004.  The organization resumed operations there in 2007, and is now expanding programs throughout the country. In addition to aiding displaced Iraqis within the country, the IRC is also providing assistance to Iraqi refugees in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]], as well as to those granted refuge in the United States.<ref>[http://www.theirc.org/special-reports/iraqi-refugees "Special Report: Iraqi Refugees"], IRC, retrieved 18 March 2010</ref>

== Operations ==
The IRC delivers a number of services, including emergency response, health care, programs fighting gender-based violence, post-conflict development projects, children and youth protection and education programs, water and sanitation systems, strengthening the capacity of local organizations, and supporting civil society and good-governance initiatives.

For refugees afforded sanctuary in the United States, [[VOLAG|IRC resettlement offices]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirc.org/where/united_states|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> across the country provide a range of assistance aimed at helping new arrivals settling, adjusting and acquiring the skills to become self-sufficient.

The IRC also engages in advocacy efforts on behalf of the oppressed and displaced, and its annual [[Freedom Award]] recognizes “extraordinary contributions to the cause of refugees and human freedom."

The IRC has spearheaded a campaign urging the United States to pass the International Violence Against Women Act, which is now before Congress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311181740/http://www.theirc.org/campaign/stop-violence-against-women|url-status=dead|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|archive-date=March 11, 2010|website=International Rescue Committee (IRC)}}</ref> The organization has also advocated for the United States to ratify the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rescue.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118182825/http://www.theirc.org/campaign/urge-president-obama-take-action-childrens-rights|url-status=dead|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|archive-date=January 18, 2010|website=International Rescue Committee (IRC)}}</ref> 196 nations have signed this UN convention; the US is the only UN nation which so far has not.

=== Emergency response ===
The IRC maintains an Emergency Response Team of 17 specialists who assess survival needs and mount responses to sudden or protracted emergencies.

The team includes coordinators, logisticians, doctors, and water and sanitation experts. It also includes specialists who focus on human rights protection, the special needs of children in crisis, the prevention of sexual violence, and aid for rape survivors.

Emergency Response Team members remain on standby to deploy to a crisis within 72 hours, whether they are launching new relief efforts or lending support to IRC teams already on the ground. Equipment and supplies are pre-positioned in key transport hubs so that the materials can be dispatched anywhere in the world on short notice. The IRC also maintains a kit with inventory necessary for the startup of an emergency program in a remote location, as well as a roster of IRC employees and qualified external personnel who are available on short notice for emergency deployment.

Recent IRC Emergency Response Team deployments include [[Darfur]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theirc.org/where/sudan|title=International Rescue Committee (IRC)|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> Indonesia after the South Asian tsunami, Myanmar after the 2008 cyclone, and Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.

=== Health programs ===
[[File:Getting a check-up with the International Rescue Committee (9616711348).jpg|thumb|right|An IRC doctor conducting a check-up on a young Syrian refugee, Ramtha, Jordan, 28 August 2013]]

During emergencies, the IRC endeavors to rapidly reduce illness and death rates to normal levels. When the conflict subsides, the IRC works with displaced individuals and communities to rebuild their health systems.

IRC health programs assist approximately 13 million people in 25 countries, focusing on primary health care, reproductive health care, environmental health, child survival, blindness treatment and prevention, and assistance for victims of sexual violence.

The IRC works in various settings such as in refugee camps, in disaster-stricken areas and in host countries where refugees have resettled after a conflict.

=== Gender-based anti-violence programs ===
[[File:Psychosocial workers help rape survivors (5686874987).jpg|thumb|right|IRC psychosocial workers help rape survivors access services, South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 11 June 2010]]

Gender-based violence is any harm perpetrated against a person based on power inequalities resulting from gender roles. The overwhelming majority of cases involve women and girls. The IRC's gender-based anti-violence programs aim to meet the safety, health, psychosocial and justice needs of women and girls who are survivors of or vulnerable to gender-based violence. In partnership with communities and institutions, the IRC works to empower communities to lead efforts that challenge beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that perpetuate or condone violence against women and girls.

IRC programs implement and support social work services to help individual survivors of gender-based violence, economic empowerment activities to support survivors of violence and women and girls at-risk of violence,<ref>[http://www.one.org/blog/2009/12/07/ending-violence-against-women/ “Ending Violence Against Women”], ONE blog, 7 December 2009</ref> community education and mobilization projects around gender-based violence, training and capacity-building for NGOs and governments, coordination of humanitarian services, and advocacy efforts to advance laws preventing violence against women, and the enforcement of policies ensuring survivors’ access to care and legal justice.

=== Post-conflict development ===
[[File:Netting a trade and an income in northern Lebanon (11173964734).jpg|thumb|right|A group of women learning to create a fishing net via an IRC program, Northern Lebanon, 6 November 2013]]

The IRC assists with post-conflict recovery by supporting conflict-impacted communities and countries in their transition to sustainable peace and development.

In addition to the provision of humanitarian assistance, IRC post-conflict development projects aim to restore and strengthen physical and social institutions, as well as rebuild and restore social cohesion.

Program areas include social programs emphasizing rebuilding the health, public infrastructure and education sectors; gender-based violence programs; economic recovery and development programs; and governance programs that support civil society, enhance protection and the rule of law, and rebuild ties between governments and their constituencies.

=== Programs for children ===
In 2016, the IRC and its partners helped provide over 1.5 million children with access to educational opportunities.<ref name=":0">International Rescue Committee. 2016 Annual Report. New York, NY: International Rescue Committee 2016. Print.'</ref> The IRC promotes the protection and development of children and youth from the early stages of an emergency through post-conflict and recovery. Its children's and youth programs include emergency care;<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/reliefresources/110252362835.htm “Aid World Launches Standards for Crisis Education”] Reuters, 8 December 2004</ref> formal and non-formal education; rehabilitation and community reintegration of former child soldiers; psychosocial care and protection; life skills training, recreational and cultural activities; and economic and leadership development for youth.

=== Resettling refugees ===
The IRC's 22 regional offices help to resettle newly arrived refugees in the U.S. and provide various services to refugees, asylees and victims of human trafficking.

[[Third country resettlement|Resettlement]] services include providing immediate aid, including food and shelter; assisting with job placement and employment skills; and giving access to clothing, medical attention, education, English-language classes and community orientation.

In addition to integrating refugees into the U.S., the IRC also provides immigration services to refugees and people who have been granted asylum, as well as specialized services to victims of human trafficking in the U.S.

=== Advocacy ===
The IRC seeks to focus the attention of policy makers on humanitarian crises and the needs of refugees, internally displaced people and other victims of conflict.

== Organization ==
The current president and CEO of the IRC is [[David Miliband]], formerly [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]].

Miliband's predecessor as president was [[George Erik Rupp]], a former president of [[Columbia University]] and of [[Rice University]]. It was announced on 27 March 2013 that Miliband would succeed Rupp in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rescue.org/news/david-miliband-appointed-IRC-president |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231645/http://www.rescue.org/news/david-miliband-appointed-IRC-president |archive-date=2013-03-29 }}</ref>

== Reports ==
* The IRC issued a report in 2008 detailing the plight of Iraqi refugees on the five-year anniversary of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/20/iraq.main/index.html Report: World ignoring Iraqi refugee crisis ], [[CNN]], 20 March 2008</ref>
* The next year, the organization followed up with a report on the plight of Iraqi refugees in the United States. The report argued that while “resettlement continues to be a critical and lifesaving intervention for thousands of at-risk Iraqi refugees who are living in precarious conditions in exile and unable to return home safely…the federal program no longer meets the basic needs of today’s newly arriving refugees and requires urgent reform.”<ref>[http://www.theirc.org/sites/default/files/resource-file/irc_report_iraqcommission.pdf “Iraqi Refugees in the United States: In Dire Straits"], IRC, Retrieved 18 March 2010</ref>
* In 2010, the IRC's Commission on Iraqi Refugees issued a third report on displaced Iraqis entitled, “A Tough Road Home: Uprooted Iraqis in Jordan, Syria and Iraq.” The report asserted that Iraqis are trapped in poverty and uncertainty and their needs are growing more acute, even as international attention and assistance wanes. The IRC's recommendations included increasing aid for the displaced, intensifying efforts to create conditions that would enable people to go home safely and accelerating resettlement for those who can't go back.<ref>[http://www.theirc.org/sites/default/files/resource-file/IRC_Report_02_18_ToughRoad.pdf "Iraqi Refugees: A Tough Road Home"], IRC, Retrieved 18 March 2010</ref>
* In a series of five ground-breaking mortality surveys between 2000 and 2007, the IRC documented the devastating impact of the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The most recent report estimated that 5.4 million people had died from conflict-related causes in Congo since 1998, and 2.1 million of those deaths occurred after the formal end of the war in 2002.<ref>[http://www.theirc.org/sites/default/files/resource-file/2006-7_congoMortalitySurvey.pdf “Congo Mortality Survey”], IRC, Retrieved 18 March 2010</ref> These statistics are often cited by media and nongovernmental agencies reporting on the humanitarian crisis in Congo.
