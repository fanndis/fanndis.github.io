'''Volker Bouffier''' (born 18 December 1951) is a [[Germany|German]] politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). Since 31 August 2010 he has been [[Minister-President|Minister President]] of the German state of [[Hesse]]. From 1 November 2014 until 31 October 2015 he was [[President of the Bundesrat]] and ''ex officio'' deputy to the [[President of Germany]]. He has been chairman of CDU in Hesse since July 2010. From 1999 to 2010, he was [[Interior ministry|minister of interior and sports]] in the state of [[Hesse]]. Bouffier is a lawyer by profession. Because of his participation in state government, he is the longest serving Member of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], representing Hesse since 1999.

==Early life and career==
Bouffier grew up in [[Giessen]]. His father Robert Bouffier (1920–1999) was a lawyer and CDU local politician in Giessen; his grandfather Robert Ferdinand August Bouffier (1883–1971) moved from [[Strasbourg]] to Giessen in 1906, where he later became a CDU politician.<ref>[http://www.lagis-hessen.de/pnd/104924608 Hessian Biography]</ref> His paternal family is of French [[Huguenot]] ancestry.<ref>[http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/deutscher-hugenottentag-die-spuren-franzoesischer.886.de.html?dram:article_id=329853 Die Spuren französischer Glaubensflüchtlinge in Hessen]</ref>

He studied law at the [[University of Giessen]] and completed his studies in 1977. From 1975 to 1978 he was a research assistant in [[public law]] at the University of Giessen, and in 1978 he was called to the bar. He practiced law for many years in addition to his political activities and is currently an inactive partner in the law firm Bouffier & Wolf.<ref>[http://www.bouffier-wolf.de/wir-volker-bouffier.html Volker Bouffier]</ref>

==Political career==
Bouffier was leader of the Hessian [[Young Union]], the youth organisation of the CDU, from 1978 to 1984.
Bouffier was first elected to the [[Landtag of Hesse|Parliament of the State of Hesse]] in 1982. He served as State Minister of the Interior and Sports in the government of Minister-President [[Roland Koch]] from 1999 to 2010.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QnIpDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=Volker+Bouffier+junge+union+1978#q=Volker%20Bouffier%20junge%20union%201978|title=Historical Dictionary of Contemporary Germany|last1=Lewis|first1=Derek|last2=Zitzlsperger|first2=Ulrike|date=2016-10-18|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442269576|language=en}}</ref>

When Koch announced his withdrawal from the political scene and resigned in August 2010,<ref>[http://www.fr-online.de/in_und_ausland/politik/aktuell/2682635_Liveticker-Die-Pressekonferenz-zum-Koch-Rueckzug.html ''Liveticker: Die Pressekonferenz zum Koch-Rückzug''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528163623/http://www.fr-online.de/in_und_ausland/politik/aktuell/2682635_Liveticker-Die-Pressekonferenz-zum-Koch-Rueckzug.html |date=2010-05-28 }} from fr-online.de, 25 May 2010 (downloaded on 25 May 2010)</ref> he nominated Bouffier as his successor to lead the center-right CDU-FDP government that was formed after the [[2009 Hessian state election|2009 state elections]].

In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] of the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Bouffier was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on internal and legal affairs, led by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] and [[Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger]].

In 2010, Bouffier was elected vice chairman of the CDU and has since been serving in the party’s national leadership under successive chairwomen [[Angela Merkel]] (2012-2018) and [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]] (since 2018). On 7 June 2011, he was among the guests invited to the [[state dinner]] hosted by President [[Barack Obama]] in honor of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] Angela Merkel at the [[White House]].<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/07/expected-attendees-tonights-state-dinner Expected Attendees at Tonight's State Dinner] [[Office of the First Lady of the United States]], press release of 7 June 2011.</ref>

Under Bouffier's leadership, Hesse joined forces with [[Bavaria]] in early 2013 to launch a constitutional challenge to the Germany's system of tax transfers in order to stop subsidising spending in the city of Berlin, the national capital, and all the poorer states. At the time, Hesse was the third largest net contributor, with an annual transfer of almost €1.3 billion.<ref>Quentin Peel (February 5, 2013), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a1968c60-6fb9-11e2-8785-00144feab49a.html States challenge Germany’s subsidies] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

On 8 February 2013, Bouffier agreed to the proposal of the President [[Joachim Gauck]] to hold the [[2013 Hessian state election|state elections]] on the same day as Germany's [[2013 German federal election|federal elections]]. When the official result gave no major parties and their traditional coalition partners a clear majority in the parliament, Bouffier decided to break ranks with the rest of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s conservative party and seek a coalition government with the Greens rather than the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] (SPD).<ref>Holger Hansen (November 22, 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-state-coalition-idUSL5N0J72BV20131122 Merkel ally seeks local coalition with Greens rather than SPD] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> He thereby created only the second CDU-Green coalition to govern a German state, after the [[2008 Hamburg state election|previous government of Hamburg]]. On the federal level, he was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Merkel, [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]] in the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]].

As one of the state's representatives at the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], Germany's upper house of parliament, Bouffier is a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Defence. In October 2015, while he held the rotating presidency of the Bundesrat, he hosted the three-day festivities for the 25th anniversary of the [[German reunification|reunification of the former East and West German states]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.678639 Germany Celebrates 25th Anniversary of Reunification] ''[[Haaretz]]'', October 3, 2015.</ref>

==Controversy==
German politicians from across the political spectrum criticized [[Deutsche Bank]] co-CEO [[Jürgen Fitschen]] in December 2012 following reports he had telephoned Bouffier to complain about a raid on the bank's [[Deutsche Bank Twin Towers|Twin Towers]] in Frankfurt – even though Bouffier's office was not directly responsible for overseeing the action.<ref>Noah Barkin and Matthias Sobolewski (December 17, 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutschebank-politicians-idUSBRE8BG0SX20121217 Deutsche chief blasted for call to complain over raid] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

During the trial of Beate Zschäpe for the [[NSU murders]], the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|BfV]] agent Andreas Temme who was at the scene of one of the murders, yet claimed not to have noticed it, was accused by the prosecution of having sympathies towards [[Neo-Nazism]] himself, thus casting doubt on his testimony. Bouffier, then interior minister of Hesse, shielded Temme from further investigations, citing protection of undercover agents.<ref>Thomas Meaney and Saskia Schäfer (December 15, 2016), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/15/neo-nazi-murders-revealing-germanys-darkest-secrets The neo-Nazi murder trial revealing Germany's darkest secrets] ''[[theguardian.com|The Guardian]]''.</ref><ref>dpa (February 1, 2016), [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/nsu-ausschuss-im-landtag-vorwuerfe-gegen-bouffier-14046690.html „Länder behielten Informationen für sich“] ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref>

==Personal life==
Bouffier is married to his wife Ursula, a former radiology assistant.<ref>Peter Lückemeier (August 30, 2010), [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/hessen/ursula-bouffier-der-kuenftige-ministerpraesident-war-ihr-scheidungsanwalt-11026006.html Der künftige Ministerpräsident war ihr Scheidungsanwalt] ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref> In early 2019, he underwent treatment for [[skin cancer]].<ref>Ewald Hetrodt (May 1, 2019), [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/hessens-ministerpraesident-volker-bouffier-zurueck-im-volk-16165581.html Volker Bouffier: Hessens Ministerpräsident zurück im Volk] ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''.</ref>
