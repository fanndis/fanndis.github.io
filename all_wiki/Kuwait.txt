===British Protectorate (1899–1961)===
In the 1890s, Kuwait was threatened by the Ottoman Empire. In a bid to address its security issues, ruler Sheikh [[Mubarak Al-Sabah|Mubarak Al Sabah]] signed an agreement with the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British government in India]], subsequently known as the [[Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899]] and became a [[British protectorate]]. This gave Britain exclusivity of access and trade with Kuwait, and excluded Iraq to the north from a port on the Persian Gulf. The [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait]] remained a British protectorate from 1899 to 1961.<ref name="Farah" /><ref name="casey" />

[[File:Kuwait1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Celebration at [[Seif Palace]] in 1944]]
Following the [[Kuwait–Najd War]] of 1919–20, [[Ibn Saud]] imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937.<ref name=do>{{cite thesis |first=Mohammad Khalid A. |last=Al-Jassar |type=PhD thesis |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/33/63/3363409.html|title=Constancy and Change in Contemporary Kuwait City: The Socio-cultural Dimensions of the Kuwait Courtyard and Diwaniyya |publisher=The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee |date=May 2009| page=80}}</ref> The goal of the Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and [[Najd]] were set; as a result of British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]]. Ibn Saud persuaded Sir [[Percy Cox]] to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair.

Historian [[Hanna Batatu]] explains how the British threatened to take the Kurdish area and Mosul out of Iraq provided that King Faisal granted Britain control of the oil in the region. In 1938 the Kuwaiti Legislative Council<ref>[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/65693/1/39_MichaelHerb.pdf LSE and Michael Herb. March 2016. "The origins of Kuwait's National Assembly"]</ref> unanimously approved a request for Kuwait's reintegration with Iraq. A year later an armed uprising which had raised the integration banner as its objective was put down by the British.<ref>Batatu, Hanna 1978.

With the end of the world war, and increasing need for oil across the world, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal atmosphere. The period of 1946–1982 is often termed "the golden period of Kuwait" by western academics.<ref name=venezia>{{cite book |editor-first=Noura |editor-last=Al Sager |url={{google books|201yBgAAQBAJ|page=7|plainurl=yes}} |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait's Modern Era Between Memory and Forgetting|date=2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters |isbn=9789990604238}}</ref><ref name=pavilion>{{Cite journal |editor-first=Farah |editor-last=Al-Nakib |url=https://www.academia.edu/8186917 |title=Kuwait's Modernity Between Memory and Forgetting |website=Academia.edu |date=2014 |page=7 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806191942/http://www.academia.edu/8186917/_Kuwaits_Modernity_Between_Memory_and_Forgetting_Introduction_to_Acquiring_Modernity_booklet_accompanying_the_Kuwait_Pavilion_at_La_Biennale_di_Venezias_14th_International_Architecture_Exhibition_ |archive-date=6 August 2017 |last1=Al-Nakib |first1=Farah}}</ref><ref name=farid>{{cite web |last=Farid |first=Alia |url=http://www.aliafarid.net/Art-Papers-Nov-Dec-2014 |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition |website=aliafarid.net |date=2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030085747/http://www.aliafarid.net/Art-Papers-Nov-Dec-2014 |archive-date=30 October 2016 |access-date=27 May 2017}}</ref> In popular discourse, the years between 1946 and 1982 are referred to as the "Golden Era".<ref name=venezia /><ref name=pavilion /><ref name=farid /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Gonzales |first=Desi |date=November–December 2014 |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition |url=http://www.artpapers.org/feature_articles/feature3_2014_1112.html |journal=[[Art Papers]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224135926/http://www.artpapers.org/feature_articles/feature3_2014_1112.html |archive-date=24 December 2014 |access-date=21 February 2015}}</ref> However, Kuwaiti academics argue that this period was marked by benefits accruing only to the wealthier and connected ruling classes. It saw an increased presence of British, American and French citizens connected with the new oil industry, wealth transfer to people connected with the Emir, the creation of a new privileged upper class of educated Kuwaitis, bankers, and a vast majority of Kuwaitis living a life of penury. This resulted in a growing gulf between the wealthy minority and the majority of common citizens.<ref name="Farah" /> In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a modern standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Palestine, India, and Egypt – with the latter being particularly political within the context of the [[Arab Cold War]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=2 July 2016|title=Nasser's Educators and Agitators across al-Watan al-'Arabi: Tracing the Foreign Policy Importance of Egyptian Regional Migration, 1952–1967|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=43|issue=3|pages=324–341|doi=10.1080/13530194.2015.1102708|s2cid=159943632|issn=1353-0194|url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/21822/1/s1-ln210934022089525479-1939656818Hwf-2143436348IdV150395290621093402PDF_HI0001.pdf|access-date=10 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720132456/http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/21822/1/s1-ln210934022089525479-1939656818Hwf-2143436348IdV150395290621093402PDF_HI0001.pdf|archive-date=20 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 1961, Kuwait became independent with the end of the [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait#History as a Protected State of Britain|British protectorate]] and the Sheikh [[Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah]] became [[Emir of Kuwait]].

=== Military ===
The [[Military of Kuwait]] traces its original roots to the Kuwaiti cavalrymen and infantrymen that used to protect Kuwait and its wall since the early 1900s. These cavalrymen and infantrymen formed the defense and security forces in metropolitan areas and were charged with protecting outposts outside the wall of Kuwait.

The Military of Kuwait consists of several joint defense forces. The governing bodies are the [[Ministry of Defense (Kuwait)|Kuwait Ministry of Defense]], the [[Ministry of Interior (Kuwait)|Kuwait Ministry of Interior]], the [[Kuwait National Guard]] and the Kuwait Fire Service Directorate. The [[Emir of Kuwait]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of all defense forces by default. Even in the most adverse of times, such as a war, the military is not permitted to act without the Emir's consent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== National parks ===
At present, there are five [[protected areas]] in Kuwait recognized by the [[IUCN]]. In response to Kuwait becoming the [[List of parties to the Ramsar Convention|169th signatory]] of the [[Ramsar Convention]], [[Bubiyan Island]]'s Mubarak al-Kabeer reserve was designated as the country's first Wetland of International Importance.<ref name=ramsar /> The 50,948&nbsp;ha reserve consists of small lagoons and shallow [[Saltmarsh|salt marshes]] and is important as a stop-over for migrating birds on two migration routes.<ref name=ramsar /> The reserve is home to the world's largest breeding colony of [[crab-plover]].<ref name=ramsar>{{cite web|last1=Ramsar|title=Kuwait becomes Ramsar state|url=http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|website=BirdGuides|access-date=7 September 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219121906/http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|archive-date=19 February 2016|date=7 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Wildlife of Kuwait}}
More than 363 species of birds were recorded in Kuwait, 18 species of which breed in the country.<ref name=bsc-eoc>{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/avibase.jsp?region=kw&pg=checklist&list=clements|title=Checklist of birds of Kuwait|work=Bird Checklists of the World|publisher=Avibase|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929203751/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/avibase/avibase.jsp?region=kw&pg=checklist&list=clements|archive-date=29 September 2007}}</ref> Kuwait is situated at the crossroads of several major bird migration routes and between two and three million birds pass each year.<ref name=natstrat>{{cite web|title=National Biodiversity Strategy for the State of Kuwait|url=http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|page=12|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219121906/http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=5210|archive-date=19 February 2016|date = 7 September 2015}}</ref> The marshes in northern Kuwait and Jahra have become increasingly important as a refuge for passage migrants.<ref name=natstrat /> Kuwaiti islands are important breeding areas for four species of [[tern]] and the [[socotra cormorant]].<ref name=natstrat />

Kuwait's marine and littoral ecosystems contain the bulk of the country's biodiversity heritage.<ref name=natstrat /> Twenty eight species of mammal are found in Kuwait; animals such as gerboa, desert rabbits and [[hedgehog]]s are common in the desert.<ref name=natstrat /> Large carnivores, such as the [[wolf]], [[caracal]] and [[jackal]], are not found.<ref name=natstrat /> Among the endangered mammalian species are the [[red fox]] and [[wild cat]].<ref name=natstrat /> Causes for wildlife extinction are habitat destruction and extensive unregulated hunting.<ref name=natstrat /> Forty reptile species have been recorded although none are endemic to Kuwait.<ref name=natstrat />

===Water and sanitation===
Kuwait does not have any permanent rivers. It does have some [[wadi]]s, the most notable of which is [[Wadi Al-Batin]] which forms the border between Kuwait and [[Iraq]].

Kuwait relies on water [[desalination]] as a primary source of fresh water for drinking and domestic purposes.<ref name=scidi /><ref name=fao /> There are currently more than six desalination plants.<ref name=fao>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4356e/w4356e0g.htm|title=Irrigation in the near east region in figures|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|access-date=12 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011071303/http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4356e/w4356e0g.htm|archive-date=11 October 2016}}</ref> Kuwait was the first country in the world to use desalination to supply water for large-scale domestic use. The history of desalination in Kuwait dates back to 1951 when the first distillation plant was commissioned.<ref name=scidi>{{cite journal|first=Mohamed|last=F. Hamoda|title=Desalination and water resource management in Kuwait|date=September 2001|doi=10.1016/S0011-9164(01)00259-4|volume=138|issue=1–3|journal=Desalination|pages=165}}</ref>

In 1965, the Kuwaiti government commissioned the Swedish engineering company of VBB ([[Sweco]]) to develop and implement a plan for a modern [[water-supply system]] for Kuwait City. The company built [[Kuwait Water Towers|five groups of water towers]], thirty-one towers total, designed by its chief architect [[Sune Lindström]], called "the mushroom towers". For a sixth site, the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh [[Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah|Jaber Al-Ahmed]], wanted a more spectacular design. This last group, known as [[Kuwait Towers]], consists of three towers, two of which also serve as water towers.<ref>Kultermann 1981</ref> Water from the desalination facility is pumped up to the tower. The thirty-three towers have a standard capacity of 102,000 cubic meters of water. "The Water Towers" (Kuwait Tower and the Kuwait Water Towers) were awarded the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] (1980 Cycle).<ref>Aga Khan Award</ref>

Kuwait's fresh water resources are limited to groundwater, desalinated seawater, and treated wastewater effluents.<ref name=scidi /> There are three major municipal wastewater treatment plants.<ref name=scidi /> Most water demand is currently satisfied through seawater desalination plants.<ref name=scidi /><ref name=fao /> Sewage disposal is handled by a national sewage network that covers 98% of facilities in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatona.net/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1560&Itemid=84&lang=en|title=Regulations of Wastewater Treatment and Reuse in Kuwait|publisher=Beatona|access-date=12 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219121906/http://www.beatona.net/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1560&Itemid=84&lang=en|archive-date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

Kuwait is a major source of foreign economic assistance to other states through the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]], an autonomous state institution created in 1961 on the pattern of international development agencies. In 1974, the fund's lending mandate was expanded to include all [[developing countries]] in the world.

In 2018 Kuwait enacted certain measures to regulate foreign labor. Citing security concerns, workers from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] will be subject to heightened scrutiny when applying for entry visas, and an outright ban was being imposed on the entry of domestic workers from [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Citing Security Concerns, Kuwait Bans Entry to These Nationalities| work = Al Bawaba| access-date = 8 November 2018| date = 8 November 2018| url = https://www.albawaba.com/business/citing-security-concerns-kuwait-bans-entry-these-nationalities-1210600}}</ref> Workers from [[Bangladesh]] are also banned.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Kuwait Re-Activates Ban on Bangladeshi Workers| work = Al Bawaba| access-date = 8 November 2018| date = 5 March 2018| url = https://www.albawaba.com/news/kuwait-re-activates-ban-bangladeshi-workers-1097934}}</ref>

[[File:Kuwait highway.jpg|thumb|A highway in Kuwait City]]
The country's public transportation network consists almost entirely of bus routes. The state owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance services to other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]]. The main private bus company is CityBus, which operates about 20 routes across the country. Another private bus company, Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab countries.

There are two airports in Kuwait. [[Kuwait International Airport]] serves as the principal hub for international air travel. State-owned [[Kuwait Airways]] is the largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the [[Kuwait Air Force]], as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private airline of Kuwait, [[Jazeera Airways]], was launched. In 2005, the second private airline, [[Wataniya Airways]] was founded.

Kuwait has one of the largest shipping industries in the region. The Kuwait Ports Public Authority manages and operates ports across Kuwait. The country's principal commercial seaports are [[Shuwaikh]] and Shuaiba, which handled combined cargo of 753,334 TEU in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/13916-kuwaits-ports-continue-to-break-records- |title=Kuwait's ports continue to break records – Transportation|work=ArabianBusiness.com|date=4 June 2007|access-date=28 June 2015}}</ref> Mina Al-Ahmadi, the largest port in the country, handles most of Kuwait's oil exports.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/mina-al-ahmadi.htm|title=Mina Al Ahmadi, Kuwait|work=Globalsecurity.org|access-date=28 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720012056/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/mina-al-ahmadi.htm|archive-date=20 July 2015}}</ref> Construction of another major port located in [[Bubiyan]] island started in 2007.
