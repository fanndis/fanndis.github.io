After 2008 a rapid increase in price has raised Ukraine's annual cost of gas imports; from less than $4 billion in 2005 to $14 billion in 2011 and 2012.<ref name=UkNGOSW15713/> Natural gas is Ukraine's biggest import at present and is the main cause of the [[Economy of Ukraine|country's structural trade deficit]].<ref name=UkNGOSW15713/>

In the [[17 December 2013 Ukrainian–Russian action plan]] it was agreed that the cost of Russian natural gas supplied to Ukraine would be lowered to $268 per 1,000 cubic metres (this price was more than $400 in December 2013).<ref name=BBCGPU171213>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25411118 Russia cuts Ukraine gas price by a third], [[BBC News]] (17 December 2013)</ref><ref name=IUEB171213>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/182491.html Ukraine to issue Eurobonds; Russia will purchase $15 bln, says Russian finance minister], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (17 December 2013)</ref>

During the [[Ukrainian crisis|Russian - Ukrainian crisis]], starting in February 2014 with the Russian [[2014 Crimean crisis|military intervention in Crimea]], severe tensions extended to the gas sector. Eventually, the EU commissioner for energy [[Günther Oettinger]] was called in to broker a deal securing supplies to Ukraine and transit to the EU. The package signed on 30. October included Russian supplies of gas to Ukraine in the period November 2014 through March 2015, conditioned on the payment of undisputed Ukrainian gas debt ($3 billion). The price for November and December 2014 was set at $378 per thousand cubic meters, to be adjusted in January. Deliveries were to be prepaid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-29842505 Russia-Ukraine gas deal secures EU winter supply], [[BBC]] (31 October 2014)</ref> During that winter Ukrainian monopoly [[Naftogaz]] was able to import limited quantities of gas from the EU (reverse flow from Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) at Central European hub prices, around $250 per thousand cubic meters.
 
Due to severe drop of [[Price of oil|oil market price]] (the price halved from mid-2014 to end of the year) Gazprom had to reduce the oil-linked gas price. On 9 January 2014 [[Naftogaz]] and Russia's [[Gazprom]] signed a supplement to the Russian-Ukrainian gas contract, setting the price of natural gas for Ukraine in the first quarter of 2014 at $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/185134.html Naftogaz, Gazprom sign supplement to gas contract, set gas price for Ukraine in Q1, 2014 at $268.5 per 1,000 cubic meters - Stavytsky], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (9 January 2014)</ref>

==Ukraine as transit route of natural gas==
{{main article|Natural gas transmission system of Ukraine}}
Ukraine remains the main transit route for [[Natural gas in Russia|Russian natural gas]] sold to Europe, which earns Ukraine about [[US Dollar|$]]3 billion a year in transit fees, making it the country's most lucrative export service.<ref name=UkNGOSW15713/> Following Russia's launch of the [[Nord Stream pipeline]], which bypasses Ukraine, gas transit volumes have been steadily decreasing.<ref name=UkNGOSW15713/> In 2004 more than 120 bcm of Russian gas was transported through Ukraine; this figure dropped to just 84 bcm in 2012.<ref name=UkNGOSW15713/>

[[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes]] left many countries with a significant drop in their supplies when Russia cut off all natural gas supplies passing through Ukraine in [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|2009]] and [[Russia–Ukraine gas dispute of 2005–2006|2006]].<ref name=CPUBBCNews/><ref>
