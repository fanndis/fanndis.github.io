At a 25K event in Irapuato, Mexico, Bertens won her second ITF singles title, beating Kazakh [[Yaroslava Shvedova]] in the final, propelling her to a new career high in singles ranking. The following week, she made it to the quarterfinals of the 25K tournament in Poza Rica, but her winning streak was snapped by [[Jana Čepelová]]. At the 25K tournament in Bath the week afterwards, Bertens won the title, defeating [[Annika Beck]] in the final in three sets, her fourth three-set match in a row. Bertens failed to qualify for the WTA tournament in [[2012 e-Boks Open|Copenhagen]], falling to [[Johanna Konta]].

At the [[2012 French Open|French Open]], Bertens was seeded No. 1 in qualifying and defeated Annika Beck in the first qualifying round, saving a matchpoint in the third set. She defeated [[Olga Puchkova]] in the second round and outclassed [[Mădălina Gojnea]] in the final qualifying round. This meant Bertens' first main draw appearance at a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament. In the first round she lost in three sets to [[Christina McHale]].

Bertens debuted at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in her first-round match against the No. 19 seed [[Lucie Šafářová]] and won in two sets, her first win at a Grand Slam event.

Bertens returned to form during the American hard-court circuit. In [[Montreal]], she qualified by defeating [[Vladimíra Uhlířová]], [[Zhang Shuai (tennis)|Zhang Shuai]], saving two matchpoints, and [[Alexa Glatch]]. In the main draw, Bertens caused an upset, defeating former world No. 3 (then ranked 22) [[Nadia Petrova]], coming back from a large deficit. In the second round [[Caroline Wozniacki]] proved too strong, and Bertens lost in straight sets.

However, in the main event she succumbed to fellow qualifier Sesil Karatantcheva. In Dallas, she retired with a shoulder injury against Polona Hercog.

At the US Open, Bertens exacted revenge on Christina McHale, knocking out the American in the first round but suffering a three-set loss to Olga Puchkova in the second round. Bertens stated afterwards she had been nervous during the match. At the WTA tournament in Seoul, Bertens defeated [[Vania King]] and [[Sílvia Soler Espinosa]] from Spain to reach the quarterfinals.

However, she entered the top 30 for the first time in her career.
