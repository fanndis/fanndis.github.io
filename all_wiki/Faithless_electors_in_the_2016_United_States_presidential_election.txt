In the [[2016 United States presidential election]], ten members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] voted or attempted to vote for a candidate different from the ones to whom they were pledged.<ref>https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_electors</ref> Three of these votes were invalidated under the [[faithless elector]] laws of their respective states, and the elector either subsequently voted for the pledged candidate or was replaced by someone who did.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maine-elector-bernie-sanders_us_585815ebe4b0b3ddfd8db1f6 |title=Electoral College Faithless Elector Foiled Trying To Vote For Bernie Sanders |work=The Huffington Post |date=December 19, 2016 |access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/12/19/minnesota-electors-cast-10-votes-for-clinton |title='Faithless elector' dismissed, Minnesota's 10 votes go to Clinton |publisher=MPR News |date=February 15, 2016 |access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Eason |first=Brian |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/19/colorado-electors-new-motion-federal-appeal-denied/ |title=Colorado's electoral votes go to Hillary Clinton after one is replaced |work=The Denver Post |access-date=September 26, 2018}}</ref> Although there had been a combined total of 155 instances of individual electors voting faithlessly prior to 2016 in over two centuries of previous US presidential elections, 2016 was the first election in over a hundred years in which multiple electors worked to alter the result of the election.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faithless Electors |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_electors |website=FairVote |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

As a result of the seven [[#Validated|successfully]] cast faithless votes, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee, [[Hillary Clinton]], lost five of her pledged electors while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee and then president-elect, [[Donald Trump]], lost two. Three of the faithless electors voted for [[Colin Powell]] while [[John Kasich]], [[Ron Paul]], [[Bernie Sanders]], and [[Faith Spotted Eagle]] each received one vote. The defections fell well short of the number needed to change the result of the election; only two of the seven defected from the winner, whereas 37 were needed to defect in order to force a contingent election in Congress (a tally of less than 270).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/which-candidates-did-the-seven-faithless-electors-support-election-2016/|title=Which candidates did the seven "faithless" electors support?|author=Julia Boccagno|publisher=CBS News}}</ref>

The faithless electors who opposed Donald Trump were part of a movement dubbed the '''Hamilton Electors''' co-founded by '''Micheal''' <!-- this is the correct spelling --> '''Baca''' of [[Colorado]] and '''Bret Chiafalo''' of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The movement attempted to find 37 Republican electors willing to vote for a different Republican in an effort to deny Donald Trump a majority in the Electoral College and force a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The electors advocated for voting their conscience to prevent the election of someone they viewed as unfit for the presidency as prescribed by [[Alexander Hamilton]] in [[Federalist No. 68|No. 68]] of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''.<ref name="theatlantic-2016-11-21-odonnell" /><ref>{{Cite news|title=Hamilton Electors|newspaper=Hamilton Electors|url=http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/|url-status=dead|access-date=November 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122235026/http://www.hamiltonelectors.com/|archive-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref> Despite their stated intentions to defeat Donald Trump, these electors cast their votes for persons other than the candidate to whom they were pledged, Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton.<ref>[https://www.cpr.org/2020/07/06/supreme-court-unanimously-sides-with-colorado-washington-in-faithless-electors-case/ ''Supreme Court unanimously sides with Colorado-Washington in faithless electors case'', Colorado Public Radio, July 6, 2020].  Retrieved 2020-11-22</ref>  By the time they switched their votes away from Trump's opponent, it was numerically impossible to achieve their stated goal as all but 30 of the Trump-pledged electoral votes had already been cast (in different states in the same or later time zones), with 37 votes needed to switch to deny Trump an outright victory in the Electoral College.  Electors were subjected to public pressure, including threats of death if they did not remain faithful to voting for Trump.<ref name="Intense Public Pressure">{{cite news|last=Sherlock|first=Ruth|date=December 18, 2016|title=Thousands Send Letters, Death Threats, to Pressure Electoral College to Avert Outcome of Presidential Election|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/19/thousands-send-letters-death-threats-pressure-electoral-college/}}</ref> The Washington elector who voted for Faith Spotted Eagle did so due to Hillary Clinton's support for the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]].

The seven validated faithless votes for president were the most to defect from presidential candidates who were still alive in electoral college history, surpassing the six electors who defected from [[James Madison]] in the [[1808 United States presidential election|1808 election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/electoral-college-electors-232836|title=Electoral College sees record-breaking defections|newspaper=POLITICO|access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> This number of defections has been exceeded only once: in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], a record 63 of 66 electors who were originally pledged to losing candidate [[Horace Greeley]] cast their votes for someone else (Greeley had died between election day and the meeting of the Electoral College). The six faithless vice-presidential votes in 2016 are short of the record for that office, without considering whether the vice-presidential candidates were still living, as multiple previous elections have had more than six faithless vice-presidential votes; in [[1836 United States presidential election|1836]], faithless electors moved the vice-presidential decision to the US Senate, though this did not affect the outcome.<ref name="SabatoErnst2014"/>

==Background==
[[File:ElectorsPrintedOnPresidentialBallots.png|thumb|The electors themselves are named on the presidential ballots of only eight states.<ref name=thegreenpapers-2004 />]]
[[File:Faithless elector states.svg|thumb|{{legend|red|In the indicated states, laws exist which either impose a fine or imprisonment on an elector who fails to vote according to the state-specified rules, force the elector to vote for the candidate they pledged to vote for, or disqualify the elector and provide a replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-electoral-college.aspx#faithless|title=THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures}}</ref>}}]]

In the unique system of presidential elections of the United States, the president is not determined directly by the popular vote of the national electorate, but [[indirect election|indirectly]] through the mechanism of the Electoral College determined by cumulative wins of the popular votes of state electorates. In this system of representative democracy, a presidential candidate is deemed to have won a presidential race if that candidate wins a simple majority of the electoral college vote.

Electors are selected on a state-by-state basis: in 48 states all electors are pledged to the winner of the statewide popular vote; in [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] the winner of each congressional district receives one elector and the statewide winner receives two. The electors, once selected, are free under [[federal law]] to vote for a candidate other than the one for whom they were pledged. However, at the time of the election, thirty-one states and the [[District of Columbia]] had laws requiring their electors to vote for their pledged candidate,<ref>{{cite web |title=Laws Binding Electors |url=http://presidentialelectorlaws.us |access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> and courts had issued conflicting opinions regarding the constitutionality of those laws. The [[supremacy clause]] established by the [[Constitution of the United States]] provides that state courts are bound by federal law and the Constitution in the event that state law were to contradict them.

Only four times in American history ([[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]) has a presidential candidate lost the popular vote but achieved the Electoral College majority, thereby assuming the presidency; in the last three such cases, no candidate polled an absolute majority of the popular vote.

In the event that no one receives a majority of the Electoral College vote, the selection of the president is made by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] under certain [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional guidelines]]. In [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]] the candidate with the highest popular vote ([[Andrew Jackson]]) also had the most electoral votes but, crucially, did not have a majority in the Electoral College. Despite [[John Quincy Adams]] having lost the popular vote and having received fewer electoral votes than Andrew Jackson, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] chose Adams to become President.

==Number of intended faithless electors==
In the 2016 election cycle, the threshold of 270 electoral votes to win the presidency outright could have been thwarted by garnering a minimum of at least 12 percent of all Republican electors to become faithless, that is, 37 of 306 Republican electors.  However, critics noted at the time that garnering this many electors was extremely unlikely,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13588048/electoral-college-petition-clinton-trump|title=No, the Electoral College won't make Clinton president instead of Trump|newspaper=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/195193-will-there-be-faithless-electors-in-2016-its-unlikely-theyll-change-the-elections-outcome|title=Will There Be Faithless Electors in 2016?

On November 16, 2016, journalist [[Bill Lichtenstein]] published an article entitled, "The Way Out of Trumpland: Hail Mary Pass to Save the Nation" in the ''Huffington Post'', detailing the plans by presidential elector Micheal Baca to seek to derail Trump's ascent to the presidency by convincing Democratic and Republican presidential electors to vote for a more moderate candidate on December 19, 2016, when the Electoral College voted.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-way-out-of-trumpland-hail-mary-pass-to-save-the_b_582b2f65e4b0852d9ec21d4e|title=The Way Out of Trumpland: Hail Mary Pass to Save the Nation|newspaper=Huffington Post}}</ref> Lichtenstein's article soon went viral, and on December 5, 2016, several members of the electoral college, seven from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]<ref name=guardian-2016-11-30-pilkington /> and one from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]],<ref name=guardian-2016-12-5-pilkington /> publicly stated their intention to vote for a candidate other than the pledged nominee at the Electoral College vote on December 19, 2016. 

[[Texas]] Republican elector [[Christopher Suprun]] publicly pledged to not cast his vote for [[Donald Trump]] as allowed by Texas state law.<ref name=nytimes-2016-12-5-suprun /> Suprun indicated that he had also been in confidential contact with several Republican electors who planned to vote faithlessly, stating that they would be "discussing names specifically and see who meets the [fitness for president] test that we could all get behind."<ref name="go-abc-2016-12-9-gradison" />  By December 5, 2016, two Republican electoral college members who publicly stated their intention to not vote for Trump had resigned. Texas Republican elector Art Sisneros willingly resigned in November rather than vote for Trump.<ref name=thehill-2016-11-28-zimmerman /><ref name=npr-2016-12-07/> Georgia Republican elector Baoky Vu resigned in August in the face of reaction to his public statement that he would not vote for Trump.<ref name=ajc-politics-2016-08-03-galloway /> Both Sisneros and Vu served in states that lacked any laws preventing electors from voting their conscience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/07/how-faithless-electors-are-messing-with-our-electoral-maps-explained/|title=How 'faithless electors' are messing with our electoral maps, explained|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Although it is difficult to ascertain how many more electors, especially Republican electors, considered becoming faithless and voting for a Republican other than Trump, it was reported that at least an additional 20 Republican electors had already accepted free-of-charge anonymous legal counsel and support provided for Republican faithless electors to assist them in voting against Trump.<ref name=politico-2016-12-5-cheney /><ref name="politico.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/donald-trump-electors-lessig-232598|title=Lessig: 20 Trump electors could flip|newspaper=POLITICO|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/12/16/the-hamilton-electors-dont-have-enough-republicans-to-stop-trump-but-theyre-getting-there/|title=The Hamilton Electors don't have enough Republicans to stop Trump — but they're getting there|last=Rozsa|first=Matthew|website=Salon|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref name=washingtontimes-2016-12-14-richardson /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-electoral-college-republican-faithless-electors-stop-election-result-a7473296.html|title=Harvard law professor says Republican electors close to blocking Trump win|date=December 14, 2016|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/16/why-an-electoral-college-coup-to-stop-donald-trump-isnt-at-all-likely-part-59/|title=Why an electoral college coup to stop Donald Trump isn't at all likely, Part 59|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Republican National Committee]] mounted an expansive whip operation to ensure that all those electors selected to vote for the Republican nominee indeed did so.<ref name=politico-2016-12-13-cheney-rnc /> On December 14, multiple Republican members of the electoral college stated under condition of anonymity that they were being coerced with "threats of political reprisal," adding "that the Donald Trump campaign is putting pressure on Republican electors to vote for him based on&nbsp;... future political outcomes based on whether they vote for Donald Trump or not."<ref name=salon-2016-12-13-rozsa /><ref name=independent-2016-12-14-broomfield />

== Public outreach to electors ==
On December 14, the Unite For America campaign released a video<ref name="yt-ufa-electors">{{cite video |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=0z0iuWh3sek |title=A Message for Electors to Unite For America |author=Unite For America|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> published on [[YouTube]] and other media addressed directly to Republican electors urging that each of them individually, plus 36 of their colleagues (at least 37 Republican electors in total), vote for a Republican other than Donald Trump for President. The video featured numerous public figures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/politics/watch-debra-messing-martin-sheen-and-other-stars-urge-electors-to-prevent-a-trump-presidency/|title=Watch Debra Messing, Martin Sheen and Other Stars Urge Electors to Prevent a Trump Presidency|date=December 15, 2016}}</ref> including [[Debra Messing]], [[Martin Sheen]], and [[Bob Odenkirk]], urging Republican electors to prevent a Trump presidency, expressing several times the message: "I'm not asking you to vote for Hillary Clinton".  In electing an alternative Republican, the featured speakers ask the elector to become an "American hero" by using the elector's constitutional "authority" to give "service and patriotism to the American people" through a vote of "conscience."<ref name="yt-ufa-electors"/>

Daniel Brezenoff's anti-Trump [[Change.org]] petition became the largest in that organization's history with nearly five million signatures, and on December 14, full-page ads funded by Brezenoff's related [[GoFundMe]] campaign ran in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'', ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''. Full-page ads ran the next day, December 15, in ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' and the ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]''.<ref name="Full-page Conscientious Elector Ads">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-electors-activist-campaign-electoral-college-232635 |title= Full-page ads turn up the heat on Trump electors A pro-Clinton activist is running newspaper ads in Philadelphia, Austin, Salt Lake City and Tampa Bay. |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |date=December 14, 2016}}</ref>

On December 11, Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|US Representative]] [[Jim Himes]] of [[Connecticut]] wrote on [[Twitter]] that Trump is "completely unhinged" and "the Electoral College must do what it was designed for."<ref name=twitter-2016-12-11-himes /> Himes said he made the plea to the Electoral College because Trump refused to say that the Russians hacked Democrats during the election.<ref name="nypost-2016-12-12-halper" />

==Legal counsel and advocacy==
[[File:Lessig (cropped).png|thumb|upright|Lawrence Lessig]]

On December 6, 2016, the Hamilton Electors' website was established to advocate the election of an alternative Republican as the next President of the United States. [[Lawrence Lessig]], a prominent [[Harvard University]] law professor (and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination himself), announced that he was "teaming with a California-based law firm to offer legal support for any members of the Electoral College seeking to oppose President-elect Donald Trump." Lessig said the counsel and support (namely [[Laurence Tribe]], who has argued before the Supreme Court 36 times)<ref name="The Electors Trust">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/larry-lessig-electors-trump-232231 |title=Lessig, lawyers to offer support to anti-Trump electors |last=Cheney |first=Kyle}}</ref> would be provided anonymously.<ref name=politico-2016-12-13-cheney-lessig /> Litigation is a component of Lessig's [[Equal Citizens]] movement.

Lessig and Boston attorney R.&nbsp;J. Lyman created a [[nonprofit organization]] called Electors Trust to provide potential faithless electors with [[pro bono legal counsel|''pro bono'' legal assistance]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3066634/inside-the-psychology-of-the-rebel-electors-who-seek-to-overturn-trumps-election|title=Inside the Psychology of the Rebel Electors Who Seek to Overturn Trump's Election|date=December 15, 2016|newspaper=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref><ref name="politico.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/12/10/505079091/lawrence-lessig-offers-free-legal-aid-to-anti-trump-electors|title=Lawrence Lessig Offers Free Legal Aid To Anti-Trump Electors|website=NPR.org|access-date=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Litigation prior to the vote==
In states with laws against faithlessness, depending on the particular state voting faithlessly despite the laws may incur anything from no prescribed punishment, to simple removal and replacement of the intended faithless elector, to fines and the potential imprisonment of the elector. Democratic electors filed lawsuits in [[Colorado]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[California]], but [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] declined to issue injunctions blocking these laws, and there was insufficient time to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] before the electoral college vote.<ref name="CO, WA, & CA Federal Judges Deal Critical Blow to Hamiltonian Strategy">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/anti-trump-electoral-college-fight-judge-232749 |title=Judge deals critical blow to anti-Trump Electoral College fight |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |date=December 16, 2016}}</ref> However, in ''[[Baca v. Hickenlooper]]'' a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] declared in a footnote that any attempt to remove electors "after voting has begun" would be "unlikely in light of the text of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]."<ref name="politco-unconstitutional">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/electors-colorado-court-appeals-232777 |title=Court: Removing 'faithless' electors may be unconstitutional |last=Cheney |first=Kyle |date=December 17, 2016}}</ref>

While at the time of the election the constitutionality of faithless electors had not yet been addressed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in ''[[Ray v. Blair]]'', {{ussc|343|214|1952}} the court had ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate in order to be certified as electors, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge. Nevertheless, the court had also written:<ref name=":0" />

{{quote|However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an ''assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, § 1, to vote as he may choose'' [emphasis added] in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional.}} 

In his dissent, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], joined by Justice [[William O. Douglas]], wrote: 

{{quote|No one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text&nbsp;– that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.}}
