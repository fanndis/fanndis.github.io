==Activism==
Worth was highly critical of [[Mike Leigh]]'s 2004 film ''[[Vera Drake]]'', for depicting the consequences of [[illegal abortion]]s unrealistically. She argued that the method shown in the movie, far from being fairly quick and painless, was in fact almost invariably fatal for the woman. As a result of the harm done with such illegal procedures, she approved of the [[Abortion Act 1967|legalization of abortion in the UK]], saying this was a medical, not moral, issue.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jan/06/health.healthandwellbeing |title=A midwife responds to Mike Leigh's Vera Drake |first=Jennifer |last=Worth |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 January 2005 |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>
