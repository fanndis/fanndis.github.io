'''''Ms.''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[feminism|feminist]] magazine co-founded by [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] and [[political sociology|sociopolitical]] [[activism|activist]] [[Gloria Steinem]] and [[Dorothy Pitman Hughes]].<ref>Farrell, Amy Erdman.

It now publishes quarterly.

At its peak in the 1970s, ''Ms.'' enjoyed great success but was not always able to reconcile its ideological concerns with commercial considerations. Since 2001, the magazine has been published by the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]], based in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Arlington, Virginia]].

==From 1971 to 1987==
The first preview of ''Ms.'' magazine was published in December 1971 by ''[[New York Magazine|New York]]'' magazine. The cover, illustrated by Miriam Wosk, depicts a version of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Kali]] using eight arms to hold a clock, skillet, typewriter, rake, mirror, telephone, steering wheel, and an iron.<ref name="Pacific Standard">{{cite news |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/ms-magazine-helped-make-wonder-woman-a-feminist-icon|title=How a Magazine Cover From the '70s Helped Wonder Woman Win Over Feminists|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-12-22|title=Remembering Miriam Wosk, First Ms. Cover Artist - Ms. Magazine|url=https://msmagazine.com/2010/12/22/rip-miriam-wosk-first-ms-cover-artist/|access-date=2020-07-01|work=Ms.}}</ref> 300,000 test copies of the magazine sold out in three days, and generated 26,000 subscription orders within the next few weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/msat40|title=Ms. at 40 and the Future of Feminism {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|website=gender.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref>

The magazine was viewed as a voice for women by women, a voice that had been hidden from and left out of mainstream media. ''Ms.'' magazine's first publication as an independent issue included articles about women who had experience with abortions, promoting the removal of sexist wording from the English language, and literature focused on helping women realize they could stand up for themselves against social norms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/ms-magazine-first-issue-3529076|title=Articles in the First Issue of Ms. Magazine|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref> 

Co-founder Gloria Steinem explained the motivation for starting ''Ms.'' magazine, stating, "I realized as a journalist that there really was nothing for women to read that was controlled by women, and this caused me along with a number of other women to start ''Ms.'' magazine."<ref name="Gloria 2011 documentary">Gloria: In Her Own Words (2011 documentary, directed by Peter Kunhardt)</ref> Steinem wanted a publication that would address issues that modern women cared about instead of just domestic topics such as fashion and housekeeping.<ref name="Pacific Standard"/> Steinem originally wanted ''Ms.'' to be a newsletter but was convinced to make it into a magazine by her peers. Patricia Carbine thought a magazine was better because of the money from advertisers and that it could reach their audience with its portable, visually pleasing, easy format.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Amy Erdman|date=2011|title=From a Tarantula on a Banana Boat to a Canary in a Mine: "Ms. Magazine" as a Cautionary Tale in a Neoliberal Age|jstor=23349341|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume=30|issue=2|pages=393–405}}</ref>

As to the origin of the name chosen for the magazine, she has stated, "We were going to call it ''Sojourner'', after [[Sojourner Truth]], but that was perceived as a travel magazine. Then we were going to call it ''Sisters'', but that was seen as a religious magazine. We settled on ''Ms.'' because it was symbolic, and also, it was short, which is good for a logo."<ref name="Gloria 2011 documentary" /> [[Ms.]] was being promoted by [[Sheila Michaels]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Arteaga|first=Meliss|date=2017-06-20|title=Today in Feminist History: The New York Times Says "Ms."|url=https://msmagazine.com/2017/06/20/today-feminist-history-new-york-times-says-ms/|access-date=2020-07-01|website=Ms. Magazine}}</ref> In particular, when Michaels suggested the use of Ms. in 1969, in a lull during a [[WBAI]]-radio interview with ''The Feminists'' group, a friend of Steinem heard the interview and suggested it as a title for her new magazine.<ref>{{cite news |title=On Language: Ms. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/magazine/25FOB-onlanguage-t.html |last=Zimmer |first=Ben |author-link=Ben Zimmer |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>

From 1972 until 1988, [[Suzanne Braun Levine]] served as editor of ''Ms.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/people/suzanne-braun-levine|title=Suzanne Braun Levine - The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|access-date=2013-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220142/http://gender.stanford.edu/people/suzanne-braun-levine|archive-date=2013-10-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Editorial content===
[[Gloria Steinem]] placed Wonder Woman, in costume, on the cover of the first independently published issue of ''Ms.'' in 1972 ([[Time Warner|Warner Communications]], DC Comics' owner, was an investor), which also contained an appreciative essay about the character.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|editor1-last=McAvennie|editor1-first= Michael|editor2-last=Dolan|editor2-first=Hannah|chapter= 1970s| title= DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle| publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |page= 154|quote= "After nearly five years of Diana Prince's non-powered super-heroics, writer-editor Robert Kanigher and artist Don Heck restored Wonder Woman's... well, wonder."|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9}}</ref> Steinem was offended that the world's most famous female superhero had had her powers removed in the most recently published comics. The progressive author [[Samuel R. Delany]] wrote two issues of the ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comic book in 1972, during this controversial period in the publication's history when the lead character abandoned her superpowers and became a secret agent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=WONDERLAND • The Ultimate Wonder Woman Site|url=http://www.wonderland-site.com/html/comix/comics01-04.htm|access-date=2020-07-01|website=www.wonderland-site.com}}</ref> Delany was initially supposed to write a six-issue story arc that would culminate in a battle over an abortion clinic, but the story arc was canceled after Steinem led a lobbying effort protesting the removal of Wonder Woman's powers, a change predating Delany's involvement.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Desta|first=Yohana|title=How Gloria Steinem Saved Wonder Woman|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/gloria-steinem-wonder-woman|access-date=2020-07-01|website=Vanity Fair|language=en-us}}</ref> Scholar Ann Matsuuchi concluded that Steinem's feedback was "conveniently used as an excuse" by DC management.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Matsuuchi|first=Ann|date=2012-01-01|title=Wonder Woman Wears Pants: Wonder Woman, Feminism and the 1972 'Women's Lib' Issue.|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/lg_pubs/3|journal=Colloquy|volume=24|pages=118–142}}</ref> Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume were restored in issue #204 (January–February 1973).<ref name="autogenerated2" />

[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Fall 2006.jpg|thumbnail|Fall 2006 issue of ''Ms. magazine'' for "We Had Abortions"]]"The Housewife's Moment of Truth", the first cover story for Ms. Magazine, was written by [[Jane O'Reilly]]. O'Reilly's article spoke for feminist strength and the opposition against the repression of wives in society and the home. The article also helped introduce the idea of "click!", or the realization a woman acquires when she realizes the demands being pushed upon her to act, work and behave in a certain way can be fought against.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/6/1/jane-oreilly-in-her-senior-year/|title=Jane O'Reilly {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>

In 1972, ''Ms.'' published the names of 53 women who admitted to having had [[abortion]]s when the procedure was illegal in most states of the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Jim|title=100 media moments that changed America|url=https://archive.org/details/mediamomentsthat00will|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0-313-35517-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mediamomentsthat00will/page/n143 121]–122}}</ref> The ''Ms.'' petition included a tear-out section for women to remove, sign and send back to the magazine. The tear-out section stated:
{{Quote
|text=The attitudes and laws against abortion in this country are causing untold suffering. Approximately one million American women had "illegal" abortions in 1971 — many of them self-induced or performed by the unqualified, some of them fatal. I have had an abortion. I publicly join millions of other American women in demanding a repeal of all laws that restrict our reproductive freedom.}}
Signatories included [[Billie Jean King]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Anaïs Nin]], [[Gloria Steinem]], [[Susan Sontag]], and [[Nora Ephron]].<ref name=WeHaveHadAbortions /> The petition drew on evidence that around 25% of American women had chosen to have an abortion, despite its variable legal status.<ref name=WeHaveHadAbortions /> Called the American Women's Petition, the ''Ms.'' petition was inspired by the [[Manifesto of the 343]] that had been published the previous year in which 343 French women publicly declared that they had had an abortion, which was also illegal in France at the time.<ref name=WeHaveHadAbortions>{{Cite web |url=http://images.nymag.com/images/2/promotional/11/11/week1/mrs-abortionsb.pdf |title=We have had Abortions |date=1972}}</ref> In 1973,  the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] would legalize abortion throughout the country. 

The petition was the inspiration for a similar campaign by ''Ms.'' in 2006, as well as an amicus brief signed by more than 100 American lawyers in support of overturning the abortion regulations at issue in [[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://msmagazine.com/2016/01/13/wewontgoback-why-abortion-must-remain-safe-and-legal/ |title=#WeWontGoBack: Why Abortion Must Remain Safe and Legal |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref>

From 1974 to 1977, ''Ms.'' collaborated with public broadcasting and, with the help of a grant from the Corporation for Public Funding, produced the television series [[Woman Alive!]].<ref name="Schlesinger">[https://id.lib.harvard.edu/ead/sch00977/catalog Woman Alive! Collection, 1974-1977: A Finding Aid.] MC 421. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Accessed May 18, 2020.</ref> The show was formatted to reflect the magazine, and consisted of short documentaries made by independent women filmmakers, interviews, and entertainment segments.<ref name="Schlesinger"/>

A 1976 cover story on battered women made ''Ms.'' the first national magazine to address the issue of [[domestic violence]]. The cover photo featured a woman with a bruised face.

In conjunction with other efforts towards [[feminist language reform]], ''Ms.'' challenged the common holiday phrase "Peace on earth, good will to men" by changing the salutation to "Peace on earth, good will to people." In its earliest years, the magazine's December cover proclaimed this altered holiday message in bold, colorful designs by Brazilian designer [[Bea Feitler]], as well as in editorial addresses from Steinem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.auswhn.org.au/blog/peace-earth-good-will-people/|title="Peace on earth good will to people": Holiday reflections on Ms. Magazine|last=Stevenson|first=Ana|date=2016-12-18|website=Australian Women's History Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>[[File:Feminist majority foundation - stierch.jpg|thumbnail|''Ms.'' Magazine offices in Los Angeles, California|218x218px]]

Over its long history, the magazine has featured articles written by and about many women and men at the forefront of business, politics, activism, and journalism. The magazine's investigative journalism broke several landmark stories on topics including overseas [[sweatshop]]s, [[Trafficking in human beings|sex trafficking]], the [[Gender pay gap|wage gap]], the [[glass ceiling]], [[date rape]], and [[domestic violence]].

==Since 1987==
In 1987, ''Ms.'' was bought by [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]], an [[Australia]]n media company, which appointed the head of its US arm, Sandra Yates, to oversee the magazine's editorial and financial turnaround.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Deutsch|first1=Claudia H.|title=Sassy Publisher: Sandra Yates; The Ms. on the Masthead Wants the Magazine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/03/business/sassy-publisher-sandra-yates-the-ms-on-the-masthead-wants-the-magazine.html|accessdate=2014-09-08|work=The New York Times|date=1988-04-03}}</ref> In 1989, concerned about a perceived 'Cher cover'-centered editorial direction under [[Anne Summers]], [[American Feminists]] bought it back and began publishing the magazine without ads.

[[Robin Morgan]] and [[Marcia Ann Gillespie]] served respective terms as Editors in Chief of the magazine. Gillespie was the first African American woman to lead ''Ms.'' For a period, the magazine was published by [[MacDonald Communications Corp.]], which also published ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' and ''[[Working Mother]]'' magazines. Known since its inception for unique feminist analysis of current events, its 1991 change to an ad-free format also made it known for exposing the control that many advertisers assert over content in [[List of women's magazines|women's magazines]].

In 1998, Gloria Steinem and other investors created Liberty Media (not the cable/satellite conglomerate of the same name) and brought the magazine under independent ownership. It remained ad-free and won several awards, including an [[UTNE Independent Press Awards|Utne award]] for social commentary. With Liberty Media facing bankruptcy in November 2001, the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]] purchased the magazine, dismissed Gillespie and staff, and moved editorial headquarters from New York to Los Angeles. Formerly bimonthly, the magazine has since published quarterly.
[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Fall 2007.jpg|thumb|Ms. Magazine's 35th anniversary edition showcasing Wonder Woman on the front cover]]
In 2005, under editor-in-chief [[Elaine Lafferty]], ''Ms.'' was nominated for a [[National Magazine Award]] for Martha Mendoza's article "Between a Woman and Her Doctor". Despite this success, Lafferty left the magazine after only two years following various disagreements including the editorial direction on a cover story on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alternet.org/mediaculture/21748/ | title='Desperate Housewives' Causes Another Breakup | author=Sheelah Kolhatkar | date=April 14, 2005 | work=New York Observer | accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref> and a perceived [[generation gap]] towards [[third-wave feminists]] and [[grunge]], a genre that Lafferty had trashed as being opposed to feminism. {{Verify source|date=July 2007}}

===Later editorial content===
Another "We Had Abortions" petition appeared in the October 2006 issue as part of the issue's cover story. This time, the petition contained signatures of over 5,000 women declaring that they had an [[abortion]] and were "unashamed of (the) decision", including actresses [[Amy Brenneman]] and [[Kathy Najimy]], comedian [[Carol Leifer]], and Steinem herself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15119353/ns/health-womens_health/t/ms-magazine-names-women-who-had-abortions/ |title=Ms. magazine names women who had abortions |date=October 5, 2006}}</ref>

In 2017, ''Ms.'' celebrated its 45th anniversary of publication. In honor of this event, ''Ms.'' made a reference to their very first issue in 1972 that featured Wonder Woman on the cover. This choice was based on Wonder Woman's belief in "sisterhood and equality",<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2017/07/06/wonder-woman-back-cover-ms-see-name-issue/|title=Wonder Woman is Back on the Cover of Ms.—And You Could See Your Name in the Issue! - Ms. Magazine Blog|date=2017-07-06|work=Ms. Magazine Blog|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}</ref> something Ms. states is a "driving value" for feminist beliefs not only when the magazine first began, but in today's society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/ms-magazine-helped-make-wonder-woman-a-feminist-icon|title=How a Magazine Cover From the '70s Helped Wonder Woman Win Over Feminists|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}</ref>

On January 10, 2008, the [[American Jewish Congress]] released an official statement<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ajcongress.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=6709 | title=Ms. Magazine Blocks Ad on Israeli Women | author=[[American Jewish Congress]] | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> which was critical of ''Ms.'' magazine's refusal to accept from them a full page advertisement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajcongress.org/site/DocServer/Ms.pdf?docID=1961 |title=This is Israel.

The New York ''[[The Jewish Week|Jewish Week]]'' reported that a number of [[Jewish feminism|Jewish feminists]], including [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] founder [[Blu Greenberg]], were mostly disappointed with ''Ms.''{{'}}s decision to reject the ad.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ain|first=Stewart|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a2011/News/New_York.html |title=Feminist Moment Of Truth Ms. magazine's refusal to print pro-Israel ad raises questions about the 'Palestinianization' of the women's movement|work=[[The Jewish Week]]|date=January 16, 2008 |access-date=2008-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120135101/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a2011/News/New_York.html |archive-date=January 20, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm?contentid=28720&mode=a&sectionid=56&contentname=Ms%2E_Magazine%27s_Msogyny_Toward_Israel&recnum=0 | title=''Ms.'' Magazine's Msogyny Toward Israel |last=Chester|first=Phyllis|author-link=Phyllis Chesler|work=The [[Jewish Press]]| date=January 16, 2008 | access-date=2008-01-20}}</ref>

However, [[Katherine Spillar]], executive editor of ''Ms.'' magazine, responded to these criticisms on ''Ms.'' magazine's website, rejecting claims of anti-Israel bias. She argued that the proposed advertisement was inconsistent with the magazine's policy to accept only "mission-driven advertisements from primarily non-profit, non-partisan organizations", suggesting that the advertisement could have been perceived "as favoring certain political parties within Israel over other parties, but also with its slogan 'This is Israel', the ad implied that women in Israel hold equal positions of power with men".<ref name="msmagazine1">{{cite web | url=http://www.msmagazine.com/AJCongress.asp | title=Statement of Katherine Spillar, executive editor Ms. magazine concerning the AJC ad | author=Katherine Spillar, Ms. magazine | date=January 14, 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108215212/http://www.msmagazine.com/AJCongress.asp | archive-date=November 8, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Spillar stated that the magazine had "covered the Israeli feminist movement and women leaders in Israel ... eleven times' in its last four years of issues".<ref name="msmagazine1"/>
