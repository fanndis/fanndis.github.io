'''Soul music''' (often referred to simply as '''soul''') is a popular [[music genre]] that originated in the [[African-American culture|African American]] community throughout the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American [[gospel music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]]. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]].<ref name="Mojapelo2008">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA1 |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music |last=Max Mojapelo |publisher=African Minds |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-920299-28-6 |pages=1– |access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>

According to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is "music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |website=Rockhall.com}}</ref> Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] between the lead vocalist and the [[backup vocals|chorus]] and an especially tense vocal sound.<ref name=valter/> The style also occasionally uses [[Musical improvisation|improvisational]] additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds.<ref name="valter">{{Cite book |title=Popmuusikast |last=Valter Ojakäär |publisher=Eesti Raamat |year=1983}}</ref> Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture.

Soul music dominated the U.S. [[R&B chart]] in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.<ref name="bbc" /> By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by [[psychedelic rock]] and other genres, leading to [[psychedelic soul]]. The United States saw the development of [[neo soul]] around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.

The key subgenres of soul include the [[Motown (music style)|Motown]] style, a more [[pop music|pop]]-friendly and rhythmic style; ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'', driving, energetic soul styles combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with southern [[gospel music]] sounds; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which came out of the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] sound with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals; as well as [[psychedelic soul]], a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music.

Soul music has its roots in [[traditional black gospel music|traditional African-American gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles – in both lyrical content and instrumentation – that began in the 1950s. The term "soul" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States.<ref>Szatmary, David P. (2014). Rockin' in Time. New Jersey: Pearson. p. 177.</ref>  According to [[musicologist]] [[Barry Hansen]],<ref name="hansen">Barry Hansen, ''Rhythm and Gospel'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', 1976, pp. 15–18.</ref><blockquote>Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of [[rock and roll]] sung gospel-style.</blockquote>

According to AllMusic, "[s]oul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s."<ref name="allmusic">[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/soul-ma0000002865 ''About Soul'', AllMusic].

[[Gospel music|Gospel]] groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The [[jazz]] style that originated from gospel became known as [[soul jazz]]. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for the African-American popular music at the time.<ref name="grove">{{Cite book |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |year=2001 |volume=23 |location=London |chapter=Soul music}}</ref><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/little-richard-p4765 Richie Unterberger, "Little Richard – Artist Biography"], AllMusic</ref>

Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included [[Clyde McPhatter]], [[Hank Ballard]], and [[Etta James]].<ref name=hansen/> [[Ray Charles]] is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's "[[I Got a Woman]]".<ref name="pc15">{{Pop Chronicles |15 || Ray Charles}}</ref> Singer [[Bobby Womack]] said, "Ray was the genius.

[[Sam Cooke]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers.<ref name="bbc" /><ref name="pc17">{{Gilliland |show=17 |https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19767/m1/ |Show 17 – The Soul Reformation: More on the evolution of rhythm and blues.

His recording of "[[You Send Me]]" in 1957 launched a successful [[pop music]] career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of "[[Bring It On Home To Me]]" has been described as "perhaps the first record to define the soul experience".<ref>Joe McEwen, ''Sam Cooke'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', 1976, pp. 113–116.</ref> Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success, especially with his 1957 hit "[[Reet Petite]]".

== 1960s ==
[[File:Solomon Burke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Solomon Burke]] {{small|(1940–2010)}} recorded for Atlantic in the 1960s]]
Writer [[Peter Guralnick]] is among those to identify [[Solomon Burke]] as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and [[Atlantic Records]] as the key [[record label]]. Burke's early 1960s songs, including "[[Cry to Me]]", "[[Just Out of Reach]]" and "Down in the Valley" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: <blockquote>"Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's "Just Out Of Reach". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein.  Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement."<ref name="Guralnick (soul)">Peter Guralnick, ''Soul'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', 1976, pp. 206.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Aretha Franklin on January 20, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aretha Franklin]] is widely known as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Soul]]"]]
[[Ben E. King]] also achieved success in 1961 with "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand By Me]]", a song directly based on a gospel hymn.<ref name="bbc" /> By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including [[Stax Records|Stax]] artists such as [[Otis Redding]] and [[Wilson Pickett]], who mainly recorded in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]].  According to [[Jon Landau]]:<ref>Jon Landau, ''Otis Redding'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', 1976, pp. 210–213.</ref><blockquote>"Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home.... He soon became known as "Mr. Pitiful" and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads."</blockquote>

The most important female soul singer to emerge was [[Aretha Franklin]], originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalised by her recordings for Atlantic.  Her 1967 recordings, such as "[[I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)]]", "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]" (written and originally recorded by Otis Redding), and "[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]]" (written by [[Chips Moman]] and [[Dan Penn]]), were significant and commercially successful productions.<ref name="pc52"/><ref>{{Cite book |title=Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942–2004 |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |publisher=Record Research |year=2004 |page=215 |author-link=Joel Whitburn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=I Never Loved a Man the Way I Loved You: Aretha Franklin, Respect, and the Making of a Soul Music Masterpiece |last=Dobkin |first=Matt |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-312-31828-6 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ineverlovedmanwa0000dobk/page/7 7–8, 187–188] |url=https://archive.org/details/ineverlovedmanwa0000dobk/page/7 }}</ref>{{sfn|Rolling Stone 2010, 500 Songs, p. 112}}

Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S.  Otis Redding was a huge success at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967.<ref name="bbc" /> The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. "Soul" became an umbrella term for an increasingly wide variety of R&B-based music styles – from the dance and pop-oriented acts at [[Motown Records]] in [[Detroit]], such as [[The Temptations]], [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], to "[[deep soul]]" performers such as [[Percy Sledge]] and [[James Carr (musician)|James Carr]].<ref name="Motown Museum">{{Cite web |url=https://www.motownmuseum.org/story/motown/ |title=Motown: The Sound that Changed America |website=Motown Museum |access-date=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Erlewine (Sledge)">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/percy-sledge-mn0000838195/biography |title=Percy Sledge: Artist Biography |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=AllMusic |access-date=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Huey (Carr)">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-carr-mn0000107877/biography |title=James Carr: Artist Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=AllMusic |access-date=October 27, 2016}}</ref> Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[New Orleans]], [[Philadelphia]], and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of [[FAME Studios]] and [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studios]]) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name="Brown (Muscle Shoals)">{{Cite web |url=http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/muscle-shoals/index.html |title=Deep Soul |last=Brown |first=Mick |website=Telegraph |access-date=October 27, 2016}}</ref>

By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into disparate subgenres.  Artists such as James Brown and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] evolved into [[funk]] music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Al Green]] developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre.<ref name="bbc" /> However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.<ref name=allmusic/>

As [[disco]] and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of [[quiet storm]]. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].

After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994.

== Notable record labels and producers ==
=== Motown records ===
[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}
{{Main|Motown Records}}
[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name="pc25">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].

Hits were made using a quasi-industrial "[[Assembly line|production-line]]" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to "[[The Tracks of My Tears]]" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.

=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===
{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}
Stax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Pop Music: The Textbook |publisher=Peters Editions |date=November 1, 2013 |first1=Julia |last1=Winterson |first2=Peter |last2=Nickol |first3=Toby |last3=Bricheno |first4=Ben |last4=Kaye |first5=Jessica |last5=Winterson |isbn=978-1843670391}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}  [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]].

=== Deep soul and southern soul ===

{{further|Southern soul}}
The terms ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'' generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]'s energy with pulsating southern United States [[gospel music]] sounds. [[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).

=== Memphis soul ===
{{further|Memphis soul}}
''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.

=== Birmingham soul ===
Impactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving "southern soul" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the "Swampers" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.

=== New Orleans soul ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
{{further|New Orleans soul}}
The New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] ("the Soul Queen of New Orleans"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels—notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York–based Amy Records and the Meters for New York–based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.

=== Chicago soul ===
{{further|Chicago soul}}
Chicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].

=== Philadelphia soul ===
{{further|Philadelphia soul}}
Based primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].

=== Psychedelic soul ===
{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}
Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as "black rock", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name="Harrington2002">J.

{{Main|British soul}}
In the early 1960s, small soul scenes began popping up around the UK. Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Britfunk: Black British Popular Music, Identity and the Recording Industry in the Early 1980s |last=Strachan |first=Robert |date=2014 |publisher=Aldershot: Ashgate |page=69}}</ref> Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the [[British Invasion]], most significantly [[The Beatles]].<ref>P.

American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]], [[Northern soul]] and Modern soul movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when a number of artists including [[George Michael]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Simply Red]], [[Lisa Stansfield]] and [[Soul II Soul]] enjoyed commercial success.<ref name="Wald1997">G.

=== Neo soul ===
{{further|Neo soul}}
''Neo soul'' is a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with [[contemporary R&B]] sounds, [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] beats and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] "pads" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.

=== Northern soul and modern soul ===
{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}
Northern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].
  
Modern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of [[Hi-Fi]] and [[FM radio]] technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Hypersoul ===
Hyper soul is a medley of soul and dance music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=180 |title=What is Hypersoul? (2001) - Riddim.ca |website=Riddim.ca |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref> It maintains the vocal quality, techniques, and style, but includes a movement towards technology, materialism, and heightened sexuality and sensationalism in the rhythm and lyricism.  It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.

=== Nu-jazz and soul-influenced electronica ===
{{further|Nu jazz|Electronica}}
Many artists in various genres of [[electronic music]] (such as [[House music|house]], [[drum n bass]], [[UK garage]], and [[downtempo]]) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.

=== Non-black musicians ===
The impact of soul music was manifold; internationally, white and other non-black musicians were influenced by soul music. [[British soul]] and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England, are examples. 

Several terms were introduced, such as "blue-eyed soul", which is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of '''blue-eyed soul''' has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by [[Motown Records]] and [[Stax Records]].<ref name="pc52">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit. [Part 8] |show=52}}</ref> The Righteous Brothers, The Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, [[Steve Winwood]], Van Morrison & Them and [[The Grass Roots]] were famous blue-eyed soul musicians in 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, [[Frankie Valli]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as blue-eyed soul singers.

Another term is '''brown-eyed soul''', or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in [[Southern California]] during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.<ref name="ALLmu">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11241|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Brown-eyed Soul].

Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the [[funk]]-influenced Philadelphia soul, or [[Philly soul|"Philly" soul]]. The West Coast [[Chicano rock|Latin rock]] scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as [[Cannibal & the Headhunters]] ("[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]") and [[Thee Midniters]] played brown-eyed R&B music with a rebellious [[rock and roll]] edge. Many of these artists drew from the [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]] scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B to romantic soul, and the results were "some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late '60s and '70s."<ref name=ALLmu/>
