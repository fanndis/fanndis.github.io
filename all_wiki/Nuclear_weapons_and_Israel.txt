However, Israel maintains a policy of [[deliberate ambiguity]], never officially denying nor admitting to having nuclear weapons, instead repeating over the years that "Israel will not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons to the [[Middle East]]".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/books/14book.html?ref=bookreviews | title= Vague, Opaque and Ambiguous — Israel's Hush-Hush Nuclear Policy |last= Bronner | first = Ethan |newspaper= The New York Times |date= October 13, 2010 |accessdate= March 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01korblt.html | title = The Quiet Bomb | last= Korb | first = Lawrence | newspaper = The New York Times |date=November 1, 1998 |accessdate= March 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v20/d349 | work = Office of the Historian | format = historical documents | title = Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968 | volume = XX, Arab-Israeli Dispute, 1967–68 | at = Document 349 | publisher= Department of State | date= December 12, 1968 | accessdate = July 3, 2012}}</ref> Israel has also declined to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT), despite international pressure to do so, saying that would be contrary to its national security interests.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Shalom Life | date = September 21, 2010 | url = http://www.shalomlife.com/eng/13853/Israel_Rejects_Offer_to_Join_UN_Atomic_Agency/ | title = Israel Rejects Offer to Join UN Atomic Agency}}.</ref>

Additionally, Israel developed the [[Begin Doctrine]] of [[counter-proliferation]] and [[Preventive war|preventive strikes]], denying other regional actors the ability to acquire their own nuclear weapons. The [[Israeli Air Force]] conducted [[Operation Opera]] and [[Operation Orchard]], destroying the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction#Program development 1960s – 1980s|Iraqi]] and [[Syria and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear program|Syrian nuclear reactors]] in 1981 and 2007, respectively, and the [[Stuxnet]] [[malware]] that severely damaged [[Nuclear facilities in Iran|Iranian nuclear facilities]] in 2010 is thought to have been developed by Israel. As of 2019, Israel remains the only country in the Middle East believed to possess nuclear weapons.<ref name = "NTI" /> The [[Samson Option]] refers to Israel's [[Deterrence theory|deterrence strategy]] of [[massive retaliation]] with nuclear weapons as a "last resort" against a country whose military has invaded and/or destroyed much of Israel.<ref name=doctrine />

Israel began to investigate the nuclear field soon after it [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] in 1948 and, with French co-operation, secretly began building the [[Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center]],{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | Then known simply as the ''Negev Nuclear Research Center''
}} a facility near [[Dimona]] housing a [[nuclear reactor]] and [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plant]] in the late 1950s. The first extensive details of the weapons program came in October 5, 1986, with media coverage of revelations from [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a technician formerly employed at the center. Vanunu was soon kidnapped by the [[Mossad]] and brought back to Israel, where he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for [[treason]] and [[espionage]].<ref name = sunday-times-20040421 /><ref name=bbc-20040420>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3640613.stm |title=Vanunu: Israel's nuclear telltale |website=BBC News |date=April 20, 2004 |accessdate=October 17, 2012|quote=[Vanunu blew] the whistle on Israel's secret nuclear activities....It was a decision that led him first to London and the Sunday Times - then to Rome and kidnapping by Israeli intelligence service Mossad - then back to Israel and a long jail sentence.}}</ref>

==Development history==

===Before Dimona, 1949–1956===
Israel's first [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] was "nearly obsessed" with obtaining nuclear weapons to prevent the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] from recurring. He stated, "What [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]], and [[Edward Teller|Teller]], the [[American Jews|three of them are Jews]], [[Manhattan Project|made for the United States]], could also be done by scientists in Israel, for their own people".<ref name="goldberg201009"/> Ben-Gurion decided to recruit Jewish scientists from abroad even before the end of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] that established Israel's independence. He and others, such as head of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] and defense ministry scientist [[Ernst David Bergmann]], believed and hoped that Jewish scientists such as Oppenheimer and Teller would help Israel.<ref name="is2002">{{cite journal | jstor=30246784 | title= Atomic Power to Israel's Rescue: French-Israeli Nuclear Cooperation, 1949–1957 | last1 = Pinkus | first1 = Binyamin | last2 = Tlamim | first2 = Moshe | journal=Israel Studies |date=Spring 2002 | volume=7 | issue= 1 | pages =104–38 | doi=10.1353/is.2002.0006}}</ref>

In 1949 a unit of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] Science Corps, known by the [[Hebrew]] acronym HEMED GIMMEL, began a two-year [[geological survey]] of the [[Negev]]. While a preliminary study was initially prompted by rumors of [[petroleum]] fields, one objective of the longer two year survey was to find sources of [[uranium]]; some small recoverable amounts were found in [[phosphate]] deposits.<ref name = "FAS"/> That year Hemed Gimmel funded six Israeli physics graduate students to study overseas, including one to go to the [[University of Chicago]] and study under [[Enrico Fermi]], who had overseen the world's first artificial and self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]].{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 26}} In early 1952 Hemed Gimmel was moved from the IDF to the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]] and was reorganized as the Division of Research and Infrastructure (EMET). That June, Bergmann was appointed by Ben-Gurion to be the first chairman of the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] (IAEC).{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 30–1}}

Hemed Gimmel was renamed Machon 4 during the transfer, and was used by Bergmann as the "chief laboratory" of the IAEC; by 1953, Machon 4, working with the Department of Isotope Research at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science|Weizmann Institute]], developed the capability to extract uranium from the phosphate in the Negev and a new technique to produce indigenous [[heavy water]].<ref name= "FAS" />{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 19}} The techniques were two years more advanced than American efforts.<ref name="is2002" /> Bergmann, who was interested in increasing nuclear cooperation with the French, sold both patents to the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] (CEA) for 60 million francs. Although they were never commercialized, it was a consequential step for future [[French-Israeli cooperation]].{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 33–4}} In addition, Israeli scientists probably helped construct the G-1 plutonium production reactor and UP-1 reprocessing plant at [[Marcoule]]. France and Israel had close relations in many areas. France was principal arms supplier for the new Jewish state, and as instability spread through French colonies in North Africa, Israel provided valuable intelligence obtained from contacts with [[Sephardi Jews]] in those countries.{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}} At the same time Israeli scientists were also observing [[France and nuclear weapons|France's own nuclear program]], and were the only foreign scientists allowed to roam "at will" at the nuclear facility at Marcoule.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 30}} In addition to the relationships between Israeli and French Jewish and non-Jewish researchers, the French believed that cooperation with Israel could give them access to international Jewish nuclear scientists.{{r |is2002}}

After [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] announced the [[Atoms for Peace]] initiative, Israel became the second country to sign on (following Turkey), and signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States on July 12, 1955.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 44}}<ref name="is2002" /> This culminated in a public signing ceremony on March 20, 1957, to construct a "small swimming-pool research reactor in [[Soreq Nuclear Research Center|Nachal Soreq]]", which would be used to shroud the construction of a much larger facility with the French at [[Dimona]].{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 65}}

In 1986 [[Francis Perrin]], [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|French high-commissioner for atomic energy]] from 1951 to 1970 stated publicly that in 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]], this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the [[Manhattan Project]].{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}<ref name="wisconsinproject.org"/><ref name="wrmea.org"/> According to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the [[USAF Counterproliferation Center]] while France was previously a leader in nuclear research "Israel and France were at a similar level of expertise after the war, and Israeli scientists could make significant contributions to the French effort. Progress in nuclear science and technology in France and Israel remained closely linked throughout the early fifties." Furthermore, according to Farr, "There were several Israeli observers at the French nuclear tests and the Israelis had 'unrestricted access to French nuclear test explosion data.'"{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}

===Dimona, 1956–1965===
{{Main|Negev Nuclear Research Center}}

====Negotiation====
The French justified their decision to provide Israel a nuclear reactor by claiming it was not without precedent. In September 1955 Canada publicly announced that it would help the Indian government build a heavy-water research reactor, the [[CIRUS reactor]], for "peaceful purposes".{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 37}} When Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the [[Suez Canal]], France proposed Israel attack Egypt and invade the Sinai as a pretext for France and Britain to invade Egypt posing as "peacekeepers" with the true intent of seizing the Suez Canal (see [[Suez Crisis]]). In exchange, France would provide the nuclear reactor as the basis for the Israeli nuclear weapons program. [[Shimon Peres]], sensing the opportunity on the nuclear reactor, accepted. On September 17, 1956, Peres and Bergmann reached a tentative agreement in [[Paris]] for the CEA to sell Israel a small research reactor. This was reaffirmed by Peres at the [[Protocol of Sèvres]] conference in late October for the sale of a reactor to be built near Dimona and for a supply of uranium fuel.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 53–4}}<ref name="is2002" />

Israel benefited from an unusually pro-Israel French government during this time.<ref name="is2002" /> After the Suez Crisis led to the threat of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intervention and the British and French were being forced to withdraw under pressure from the U.S., Ben-Gurion sent Peres and [[Golda Meir]] to France. During their discussions, the groundwork was laid for France to build a larger nuclear reactor and chemical reprocessing plant, and Prime Minister [[Guy Mollet]], ashamed at having abandoned his commitment to fellow [[socialist]]s in Israel, supposedly told an aide, "I owe the bomb to them,"{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 42–43}} while General Paul Ely, [[Chief of the Defence Staff (France)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], said, "We must give them this to guarantee their security, it is vital." Mollet's successor [[Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury]] stated, "I gave you [Israelis] the bomb in order to prevent another Holocaust from befalling the Jewish people and so that Israel could face its enemies in the Middle East."{{r |is2002}}

The French–Israeli relationship was finalized on October 3, 1957, in two agreements the contents of which remain secret:{{r |is2002}} One political that declared the project to be for peaceful purposes and specified other legal obligations, and one technical that described a 24 [[megawatt]] EL-102 reactor. The one to actually be built was to be two to three times as large{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 59}} and be able to produce 22 [[kilogram]]s of [[plutonium]] a year.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 45–6}} When the reactor arrived in Israel, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion declared that its purpose was to provide a pumping station to desalinate a billion gallons of seawater annually and turn the desert into an "agricultural paradise". Six of seven members of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission promptly resigned, protesting that the reactor was the precursor to "political adventurism which will unite the world against us".<ref name=Thomas>{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = Gordon | authorlink =Gordon Thomas (author)| title = Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad | year = 1999| title-link = Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad }}.</ref>

====Excavation====
Before construction began it was determined that the scope of the project would be too large for the EMET and IAEC team, so Shimon Peres recruited Colonel [[Manes Pratt]], then Israeli [[military attaché]] in Burma, to be the project leader. Building began in late 1957 or early 1958, bringing hundreds of French engineers and technicians to the [[Beersheba]] and Dimona area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In addition, thousands of newly immigrated [[Sephardi Jews]] were recruited to do digging; to circumvent strict [[labor law]]s, they were hired in increments of 59 days, separated by one day off.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 60–1}}

====Creation of LEKEM====
By the late 1950s Shimon Peres had established and appointed a new intelligence service assigned to search the globe and clandestinely secure technology, materials and equipment needed for the program, by any means necessary. The new service would eventually be named [[Lekem|LEKEM]] (pronounced LAKAM, the Hebrew acronym for 'Science liaison Bureau'). Peres appointed IDF Internal Security Chief, Benjamin Blumberg, to the task. As head of the LEKEM, Blumberg would rise to become a key figure in Israel's intelligence community, coordinating agents worldwide and securing the crucial components for the program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=179209 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625043534/http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=179209 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 25, 2010 |title=Netanyahu: Pollard acted as Israeli agent |last=Hoffman |first=Gil |date=June 22, 2010 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |quote=One of those agents, [[Arnon Milchan]], was considered among the most successful and prolific agents who secured items such a [[uranium enrichment]] centrifuges and [[Krytron]] nuclear triggers, would latter become one of the most successful movie producers in [[Hollywood]] history. |accessdate=June 23, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/business/global/new-book-tells-tale-of-israeli-arms-dealer-in-hollywood.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=New Book Tells Tale of Israeli Arms Dealer in Hollywood | date=July 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://fas.org/irp/world/israel/lekem/index.html "Lekem"] Federation of American Scientists</ref><ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/pollard1.html "Report of an Investigation Commission on the Pollard Case"] Jewish Virtual Library</ref>

====Rift between Israel and France====
When [[Charles de Gaulle]] became [[French President]] in late 1958 he wanted to end French–Israeli nuclear cooperation, and said that he would not supply Israel with uranium unless the plant was opened to international inspectors, declared peaceful, and no plutonium was reprocessed.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 73–4}} Through an extended series of negotiations, Shimon Peres finally reached a compromise with Foreign Minister [[Maurice Couve de Murville]] over two years later, in which French companies would be able to continue to fulfill their contract obligations and Israel would declare the project peaceful.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 75}} Due to this, French assistance did not end until 1966.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 70}} However the supply of uranium fuel was stopped earlier, in 1963.<ref name=nsa-20130625/> Despite this, a French uranium company based in [[Gabon]] may have sold Israel uranium in 1965. The US government launched an investigation but was unable to determine if such a sale had taken place.<ref name=FP/>

====1963 standoff between Israel and United States====
[[File:Kennedy&Gurion.jpg|thumb|right|[[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]] in 1961.|alt=A candid portrait of Kennedy and Ben-Gurion standing facing each other, dressed formally, Kennedy with his hands in his suit jacket pockets.]]
Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported in 2019 that, throughout the spring and summer of 1963, the leaders of the United States and Israel – President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Prime Ministers [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Levi Eshkol]] – were engaged in a high-stakes battle of wills over Israel's nuclear program. The tensions were invisible to the publics of both countries, and only a few senior officials, on both sides, were aware of the severity of the situation. According to [[Yuval Ne'eman]], [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]], Ben-Gurion's successor, and his associates saw Kennedy as presenting Israel with a real ultimatum. According to Ne'eman, the former Israel Air Force commander Maj. Gen. (res.) [[Dan Tolkowsky]], seriously entertained the fear that Kennedy might send U.S. airborne troops to [[Dimona]], the home of [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|Israel's nuclear complex]].<ref name="Haaretz2019">[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-a-standoff-with-the-u-s-almost-blew-up-israel-s-nuclear-program-1.7193419]</ref>

On March 25, 1963, President Kennedy and CIA Director [[John A. McCone]] discussed the Israeli nuclear program. According to McCone, Kennedy raised the "question of Israel acquiring nuclear capability," and McCone provided Kennedy with [[Sherman Kent|Kent's]] estimate of the anticipated negative consequences of Israeli nuclearization. According to McCone, Kennedy then instructed National Security Adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]] to guide Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], in collaboration with the CIA director and the AEC chairman, to submit a proposal "as to how some form of international or bilateral U.S. safeguards could be instituted to protect against the contingency mentioned." That also meant that the "next informal inspection of the Israeli reactor complex [must] …be undertaken promptly and... be as thorough as possible."<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

On April 2, 1963, Ambassador Barbour met Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and presented the American request for his "assent to semi-annual visits to Dimona perhaps in May and November, with full access to all parts and instruments in the facility, by qualified U.S. scientists." Ben-Gurion, apparently taken by surprise, responded by saying the issue would have to be postponed until after Passover, which that year ended on April 15. To highlight the point further, two days later, Assistant Secretary [[Phillips Talbot|Talbot]] summoned Israeli Ambassador [[Avraham Harman|Harman]] to the State Department and presented him with a diplomatic démarche on the inspections. This message to Ben-Gurion was the first salvo in what would become "the toughest American-Israeli confrontation over the Israeli nuclear program".<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

On April 26, 1963, more than three weeks after the original U.S. demand concerning Dimona, Ben-Gurion responded to Kennedy with a seven-page letter that focused on broad issues of Israeli security and regional stability. Claiming that Israel faced an unprecedented threat, Ben-Gurion invoked the specter of "another Holocaust," and insisted that Israel's security should be protected by joint external security guarantees, to be extended by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Kennedy, however, was determined not to let Ben-Gurion change the subject. On May 4, 1963, he replied to the prime minister, assuring him that while "we are watching closely current developments in the Arab world," as to Ben-Gurion's proposal for a joint superpower declaration, Kennedy dismissed both its practicality and its political wisdom. Kennedy was much less worried about an "early Arab attack" than he was by "a successful development of advanced offensive systems which, as you say, could not be dealt with by presently available means."<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

Kennedy would not budge on Dimona, and the disagreements became a "pain in the neck" for him, as [[Robert Komer]] later wrote. The confrontation with Israel escalated when the State Department transmitted Kennedy's latest letter to the Tel Aviv embassy on June 15 for immediate delivery to Ben-Gurion by Ambassador Barbour. In the letter Kennedy fleshed out his insistence on biannual visits with a set of detailed technical conditions. The letter was akin to an ultimatum: If the U.S. government could not obtain "reliable information" on the state of the Dimona project, Washington's "commitment to and support of Israel" could be "seriously jeopardized." But the letter was never presented to Ben-Gurion. The telegram with Kennedy's letter arrived in Tel Aviv on Saturday, June 15, the day before Ben-Gurion's announcement of his resignation, a decision that stunned his country and the world. Ben-Gurion never explained, in writing or orally, what led him to resign, beyond citing "personal reasons." He denied that his move was related to any specific policy issues, but the question of the extent to which Kennedy's Dimona pressure played a role remains open to discussion to the present day.<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

On July 5, less than 10 days after Levi Eshkol succeeded Ben-Gurion as prime minister, Ambassador Barbour delivered to him a first letter from President Kennedy. The letter was virtually a copy of the undelivered letter of June 15 to Ben-Gurion.<ref>https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//dc.html?doc=5983570-National-Security-Archive-Doc-35-State</ref> As Yuval Ne'eman stated, it was immediately apparent to Eshkol and his advisers that Kennedy's demands were akin to an ultimatum, and thus constituted a crisis in the making. A stunned Eshkol, in his first and interim response, on July 17, requested more time to study the subject and for consultations. The premier noted that while he hoped that U.S-Israeli friendship would grow under his watch, "Israel would do what it had to do for its national security and to safeguard its sovereign rights." Barbour, apparently wanting to mitigate the bluntness of the letter, assured Eshkol that Kennedy's statement was "factual": Critics of strong U.S.-Israel relations might complicate the diplomatic relationship if Dimona was left uninspected.<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

On August 19, after six weeks of consultations that generated at least eight different drafts, Eshkol handed Barbour his written reply to Kennedy's demands. It began by reiterating Ben-Gurion's past assurances that Dimona's purpose was peaceful. As to Kennedy's request, Eshkol wrote that given the special relationship between the two countries, he had decided to allow regular visits of U.S. representatives to the Dimona site. On the specific issue of the schedule, Eshkol suggested – as Ben-Gurion had in his last letter to Kennedy – that late 1963 would be the time for the first visit: By then, he wrote, "the French group will have handed the reactor over to us and it will be undertaking general tests and measurements of its physical parameters at zero power."<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

Eshkol was vague on the proposed frequency of visits. Eshkol disregarded Kennedy's demand for biannual tours, while avoiding a frontal challenge to Kennedy's request. "Having considered this request, I believe we shall be able to reach agreement on the future schedule of visits," Eshkol wrote. In sum, the prime minister split the difference: To end the confrontation, he assented to "regular visits" by U.S. scientists, but he did not accept the idea of the prompt visit that Kennedy wanted and avoided making an explicit commitment to biannual inspections. Kennedy's appreciative reply did not mention these divergences, but assumed a basic agreement on "regular visits."<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

In the wake of Eshkol's letter, the first of the long-sought regular inspection visits to Dimona took place in mid-January 1964, two months after [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]]. The Israelis told the American visitors that the reactor had gone critical only a few weeks earlier, but that claim was not accurate. Israel acknowledged years later that the Dimona reactor became operational in mid-1963, as the Kennedy administration had originally assumed.<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

It turned out that Kennedy's insistence on biannual visits to Dimona was not implemented after his death. U.S. government officials remained interested in such a schedule, and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] did raise the issue with Eshkol, but he never pressed hard on the subject the way that Kennedy had.<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

In the end, the confrontation between President Kennedy and two Israeli prime ministers resulted in a series of six American inspections of the Dimona nuclear complex, once a year between 1964 and 1969. They were never conducted under the strict conditions Kennedy laid out in his letters. While Kennedy's successor remained committed to the cause of nuclear nonproliferation and supported American inspection visits at Dimona, he was much less concerned about holding the Israelis to Kennedy's terms. In retrospect, this change of attitude may have saved the Israeli nuclear program.<ref name="Haaretz2019" />

===Criticality===
In 1961, the [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] informed the [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[John Diefenbaker]] that a pilot plutonium-separation plant would be built at Dimona. British intelligence concluded from this and other information that this "can only mean that Israel intends to produce nuclear weapons".<ref name = "JIC/1103/61" /> The nuclear reactor at Dimona [[critical mass|went critical]] in 1962.{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}} After Israel's rupture with France, the Israeli government reportedly reached out to Argentina.

The exact costs for the construction of the Israeli nuclear program are unknown, though Peres later said that the reactor cost $80 million in 1960,{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 70}} half of which was raised by foreign Jewish donors, including many American Jews. Some of these donors were given a tour of the Dimona complex in 1968.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 66–7}}

===Weapons production, 1966–present===
[[File:Nuclear reactor in dimona (israel).jpg|thumb|right|Completed Dimona complex as seen by US [[Corona (satellite)|Corona satellite]] on November 11, 1968]]
Israel is believed to have begun full-scale production of nuclear weapons following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], although it had built its first operational nuclear weapon by December 1966.<ref name="auto" /> A [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) report from early 1967 stated that Israel had the materials to construct a bomb in six to eight weeks{{Sfn |Cohen |1998 |p=298}} and some authors suggest that Israel had two crude bombs ready for use during the war.{{Sfn|Farr|1999}} According to US journalist [[Seymour Hersh]], everything was ready for production at this time save an official order to do so. Israel crossed the nuclear threshold on the eve of the Six-Day War in May 1967. "[Prime Minister Levi] Eshkol, according to a number of Israeli sources, secretly ordered the Dimona [nuclear reactor] scientists to assemble two crude nuclear devices. He placed them under the command of Brigadier General Yitzhak Yaakov, the chief of research and development in Israel's Defense Ministry. One official said the operation was referred to as Spider because the nuclear devices were inelegant contraptions with appendages sticking out. The crude atomic bombs were readied for deployment on trucks that could race to the Egyptian border for detonation in the event Arab forces overwhelmed Israeli defenses."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog-post/israels-nuclear-weapons-program-and-lessons-iran|title=Israel's Nuclear Weapons Program and Lessons for Iran|author=|date=|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=June 25, 2017}}</ref>

Another CIA report from 1968 states that "Israel might undertake a nuclear weapons program in the next several years."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001211143/DOC_0001211143.pdf|title=Special National Intelligence Estimate 11-12-68: Emplacement of Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed|date=August 15, 1968|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105065948/http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0001211143/DOC_0001211143.pdf|archivedate=November 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Moshe Dayan]], then Defense Minister, believed that nuclear weapons were cheaper and more practical than indefinitely growing Israel's conventional forces.<ref name="time19760412">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,914023,00.html |title=Violent Week: The Politics of Death |accessdate=March 4, 2011 |date=April 12, 1976 |work=Time}}</ref> He convinced the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]]'s finance minister [[Pinchas Sapir]] of the value of commencing the program by giving him a tour of the Dimona site in early 1968, and soon after Dayan decided that he had the authority to order the start of full production of four to five nuclear warheads a year. Hersh stated that it is widely believed that the words "[[Never Again (disambiguation)#Other uses|Never Again]]" were welded, in English and Hebrew, onto the first warhead.{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|p=179–80}}

In order to produce plutonium the Israelis needed a large supply of [[uraninite|uranium ore]]. In 1968, the [[Mossad]] purchased 200 tons from [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] mining company, on the pretense of buying it for an Italian chemical company in [[Milan]]. Once the uranium was shipped from [[Antwerp]] it was transferred to an Israeli freighter at sea and brought to Israel. The orchestrated disappearance of the uranium, named [[Operation Plumbat]], became the subject of the 1978 book ''The Plumbat Affair''.{{Sfn|Hersh|1991|p=181}}

Estimates as to how many warheads Israel has built since the late 1960s have varied, mainly based on the amount of fissile material that could have been produced and on the revelations of Israeli nuclear technician [[Mordechai Vanunu]].

[[File:Vanunu-glove-box-bomb-components.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mordechai Vanunu]]'s photograph of a [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] glove box containing nuclear materials in a model bomb assembly, one of about 60 photographs he later gave to the British press]]

==Nuclear testing==
{{Main|Nuclear weapons testing|Vela Incident}}
According to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the [[USAF Counterproliferation Center|US Air Force Counterproliferation Center]], much lateral proliferation happened between pre-nuclear Israel and France, stating "the French nuclear test in 1960 made two nuclear powers, not one—such was the depth of collaboration" and that "the Israelis had unrestricted access to French nuclear test explosion data," minimizing the need for early Israeli testing, although this cooperation cooled following the success of the French tests.{{Sfn|Farr|1999}}

In June 1976, a West Germany army magazine, ''Wehrtechnik'' ("military technology"), claimed that Western intelligence reports documented Israel conducting an underground test in the Negev in 1963. The book ''Nuclear Weapons in the Middle East: Dimensions and Responsibilities'' by Taysir Nashif cites other reports that on November 2, 1966, the country may have carried out a non-nuclear test, speculated to be zero yield or [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]] in nature in the Israeli [[Negev]] desert.<ref name="FAS" />{{Sfn|Farr|1999}}

On September 22, 1979, Israel may have been involved in a possible nuclear bomb test, also known as the [[Vela Incident]], in the southern Indian Ocean. A committee was set up under then-U.S. president Jimmy Carter, headed by Professor [[Jack Ruina]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Most of the committee's members assumed that South African navy vessels had sailed out of [[Naval Base Simon's Town|Simonstown]] port, near [[Cape Town]], to a secret location in the Indian Ocean, where they conducted the nuclear test. The committee defined the nuclear device tested as compact and especially clean, emitting little radioactive fallout, making it very nearly impossible to pinpoint. Another committee assessment concluded a cannon had fired a nuclear artillery shell, and the detected test was focused on a small tactical nuclear weapon. After [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|renouncing their nuclear weapons program]] South Africa was revealed to only have six large, primitive, aircraft-deliverable atomic bombs with a seventh being built, but no sophisticated miniaturized devices of the artillery shell size.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/did-israel-play-a-role-in-1979-south-africa-nuclear-test-1.281226|title=Did Israel play a role in 1979 South Africa nuclear test?|date=August 2, 2009|work=Haaretz}}</ref>
Professor [[Avner Cohen]], professor at the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies]], and the Director of the Education Program and Senior Fellow at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, stated regarding the Vela Incident that "Now, 40 years later, there is a scientific and historical consensus that it was a nuclear test and that it had to be Israeli."<ref>Haaretz, 22 Sept. 2019 [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/u-s-covered-up-an-israeli-nuclear-test-in-1979-foreign-policy-says-1.7873517 "U.S. Covered Up an Israeli Nuclear Test in 1979, Foreign Policy Says"]</ref>
In what they called the "Last Secret of the Six-Day War", ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that in the days before the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] Israel planned to insert a team of paratroopers by helicopter into the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] set up and remote detonate a nuclear bomb on command from the prime minister and military command on a mountaintop as a warning to belligerent surrounding states. However, Israel won the war before the test could even be set up. Retired Israeli brigadier general Itzhak Yaakov referred to this operation as the Israeli [[Samson Option]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/world/middleeast/1967-arab-israeli-war-nuclear-warning.html|title='Last Secret' of 1967 War: Israel's Doomsday Plan for Nuclear Display |first1=William J.|last1=Broad|first2=David E.|last2=Sanger|date=June 3, 2017|accessdate=June 5, 2017|work=New York Times}}</ref>

Pioneering American nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] commented on the uncertainties involved in the process of boosting small fission weapons and the thermonuclear designs seen in the Vanunu leaked photographs. He stated that these designs required more than theoretical analysis for full confidence in the weapons' performance. Taylor therefore concluded that Israel had "unequivocally" tested an advanced series miniaturized nuclear device.<ref name="auto4">{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/israel-aims.html |title=Israel Aims to Improve Missile Accuracy|work=Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control|date=June 1995 |accessdate=2014-04-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003212249/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/israel-aims.html |archivedate=October 3, 2014 |df=mdy}}</ref>

==Revelations==

===Negev Nuclear Research Center (Dimona)===
{{main|Negev Nuclear Research Center}}
The Israeli nuclear program was first revealed on December 13, 1960, in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873321,00.html|title=The Atom: The Nth Power|magazine=Time|date=December 19, 1960|access-date=July 2, 2007|url-access=subscription}}</ref> which said that a non-[[Communist]], non-[[NATO]] country had made an "atomic development". On December 16, the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in London revealed this country to be Israel, and on December 18, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] chairman [[John McCone]] appeared on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' to officially confirm the Israeli construction of a nuclear reactor and announce his resignation.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 72}} The following day ''[[The New York Times]]'', with the help of McCone, revealed that France was assisting Israel.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 88–9}}

The news led Ben-Gurion to make the only statement by an Israeli Prime Minister about Dimona. On December 21 he announced to the [[Knesset]] that the government was building a 24 megawatt reactor "which will serve the needs of industry, agriculture, health, and science", and that it "is designed exclusively for peaceful purposes".{{Sfn | Cohen | 1991 | p = 91}} Bergmann, who was chairman of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1954 to 1966, however said that "There is no distinction between nuclear energy for peaceful purposes or warlike ones"<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/One-on-One-Existential-espionage | title = One on One: Existential espionage | newspaper = Jerusalem Post | first = Ruthie | last = Blum Leibowitz | date = October 7, 2008 | accessdate = June 4, 2011 }}</ref> and that "We shall never again be led as lambs to the slaughter".<ref>{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Gallagher | title= Israel and Palestine | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir-iUPZZJ-0C&pg=PT26 | accessdate = June 4, 2011 |date=July 30, 2005 |publisher=Black Rabbit Books |isbn=978-1-58340-605-2 |pages = 26–}}</ref>

===Weapons production===
The first public revelation of Israel's nuclear capability (as opposed to development program) came from [[NBC News]], which reported in January 1969 that Israel decided "to embark on a crash course program to produce a nuclear weapon" two years previously, and that they possessed or would soon be in possession of such a device.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 327}} This was initially dismissed by Israeli and U.S. officials, as well as in an article in ''The New York Times''. Just one year later on July 18, ''The New York Times'' made public for the first time that the [[U.S. government]] believed Israel to possess nuclear weapons or to have the "capacity to assemble atomic bombs on short notice".{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 338}} Israel reportedly assembled 13 bombs during the [[Yom Kippur War]] as a last defense against total defeat, and kept them usable after the war.{{r |time19760412}}

The first extensive details of the weapons program came in the London [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''Sunday Times'']] on October 5, 1986, which published information provided by [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a technician formerly employed at the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] near [[Dimona]]. For publication of state secrets Vanunu was [[kidnap]]ped by the [[Mossad]] in Rome, brought back to Israel, and sentenced to 18 years in prison for [[treason]] and [[espionage]].<ref name=bbc-20040420 /> Although there had been much speculation prior to Vanunu's revelations that the Dimona site was creating nuclear weapons, Vanunu's information indicated that Israel had also built [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.<ref name = sunday-times-20040421 />

[[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]], a former U.S. weapon designer leading the field in small, efficient nuclear weapons, reviewed the 1986 leaks and photographs of the Israeli nuclear program by Mordechai Vanunu in detail. Taylor concluded that Israel's thermonuclear weapon designs appeared to be "less complex than those of other nations," and as of 1986 "not capable of producing yields in the megaton or higher range." Nevertheless, "they may produce at least several times the yield of fission weapons with the same quantity of plutonium or highly enriched uranium." In other words, Israel could "boost" the yield of its nuclear fission weapons. According to Taylor, the uncertainties involved in the process of boosting required more than theoretical analysis for full confidence in the weapons' performance. Taylor therefore concluded that Israel had "unequivocally" tested a miniaturized nuclear device. The [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA) concluded after reviewing the evidence given by Vanunu that as of 1987, "the Israelis are roughly where the U.S. was in the fission weapon field in about 1955 to 1960." and would require supercomputers or parallel computing clusters to refine their hydrogen bomb designs for improved yields without testing, though noting they were already then developing the computer code base required.<ref name="wisconsinproject.org"/> Israel was first permitted to import US built supercomputers beginning in November 1995.<ref name="auto4"/>

According to a 2013 report by the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', which cited US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] sources, Israel began the production of nuclear weapons in 1967, when it produced its first two nuclear bombs. According to the report's calculations, Israel produced nuclear weapons at an average rate of two per year, and stopped production in 2004. The report stated that Israel has 80 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce 190 more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-80-nuclear-warheads-report-says/|title=Israel has 80 nuclear warheads, report says|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4429556,00.html|title=Report: Israel halted nuclear warheads production in 2004|work=ynet}}</ref> In 2014, former US president [[Jimmy Carter]] stated that "Israel has, what, 300 or more, nobody knows exactly how many" nuclear weapons.<ref name="israelhayom.com">[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=16847 Carter says Israel has stockpile of over 300 nuclear bombs] by Yoni Hirsch and Israel Hayom Staff, [[Israel Hayom]], April 14, 2014</ref>

===South African documents===
{{see also|Israel–South Africa relations|South Africa and weapons of mass destruction}}
In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' released South African government documents that it alleged confirmed the existence of Israel's nuclear arsenal. According to the newspaper, the documents are minutes taken by the South African side of alleged meetings between senior officials from the two countries in 1975. ''The Guardian'' alleged that these documents reveal that Israel had offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons that year. The documents appeared to confirm information disclosed by a former South African naval commander [[Dieter Gerhardt]] – jailed in 1983 for spying for the Soviet Union, who said there was an agreement between Israel and South Africa involving an offer by Israel to arm eight Jericho missiles with atomic bombs.<ref name= "McGreal">{{cite news | title = Revealed: how Israel offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/23/israel-south-africa-nuclear-weapons | newspaper = The Guardian| date= May 24, 2010| location= London | first= Chris | last = McGreal | accessdate = May 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title= The memos and minutes that confirm Israel's nuclear stockpile | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/23/israel-south-africa-nuclear-documents | newspaper = The Guardian | date=May 24, 2010 | location=London | first= Chris | last= McGreal | accessdate= May 24, 2010}}</ref> Waldo Stumpf—who led a project to dismantle [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|South Africa's nuclear weapons program]]<ref>Von Wielligh, N. & von Wielligh-Steyn, L.

Pretoria: Litera.</ref>—doubted Israel or South Africa would have contemplated a deal seriously, saying that Israel could not have offered to sell nuclear warheads to his country due to the serious international complications that such a deal could entail. [[Shimon Peres]], then Defense Minister (later Israeli President), rejected the newspaper's claim that the negotiations took place. He also asserted that ''The Guardian'''s conclusions were "based on the selective interpretation of South African documents and not on concrete facts".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3893589,00.html | newspaper = Ynet news | date = May 24, 2010 | title = S.

Avner Cohen, author of ''Israel and the Bomb'' and ''The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb'', said "Nothing in the documents suggests there was an actual offer by Israel to sell nuclear weapons to the regime in [[Pretoria]]."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/avner-cohen-yitzhak-rabin-would-have-opposed-sale-of-nuclear-weapons-1981962.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Avner Cohen: Yitzhak Rabin would have opposed sale of nuclear weapons | date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

===US pressure===
{{main|Israel–United States relations}}
The United States was concerned over possible Israeli nuclear proliferation. US intelligence began to notice the Dimona reactor shortly after construction began, when American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes overflew the reactor,<ref name=relevance>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/policy-library|title=Policy Library|author=|date=|website=NRDC|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}</ref> leading to a diplomatic clash. In 1960, the outgoing [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration asked the Israeli government for an explanation for the mysterious construction near Dimona. Israel's response was that the site was a future textile factory, but that no inspection would be allowed. When Ben-Gurion visited Washington in 1960, he held a series of meetings with [[United States Department of State|State Department]] officials, and was bluntly told that for Israel to possess nuclear weapons would affect the balance of power in the region.<ref name=Thomas/> After [[John F. Kennedy]] took office as US President in 1961, he put continuous pressure on Israel to open the plant to American inspection. Reportedly, every high-level meeting and communication between the US and Israeli governments contained a demand for an inspection of Dimona. To increase pressure, Kennedy denied Ben-Gurion a meeting at the [[White House]] – when they met in May 1961, it was at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]] in New York. The meeting itself was dominated by this issue. Ben-Gurion was evasive on the issue for two years, in the face of persistent US demands for an inspection. Finally, in a personal letter dated May 18, 1963, Kennedy threatened Israel with total isolation unless inspectors were allowed into Dimona. However, Ben-Gurion resigned as Prime Minister shortly afterward. His successor, [[Levi Eshkol]], received a similar letter from Kennedy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/When-Ben-Gurion-said-no-to-JFK|title=When Ben-Gurion said no to JFK|website=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|first=Gerald|last=Steinberg|date=March 28, 2010|department=Opinion}}</ref>

Israel eventually accepted an inspection, and Kennedy made two concessions – the US would sell Israel [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] anti-aircraft missiles after having refused to sell Israel any major weapon systems for years. In addition, the US government agreed to the Israeli demand that the inspections would be carried out by an all-American team which would schedule its visits weeks in advance, rather than the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]].

In 1964, the US government tried to prevent Argentina's sale of [[yellowcake]] to Israel, with no success.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/07/01/israels_secret_uranium_buy|title=Israel's Secret Uranium Buy|work=Foreign Policy|first1=William|last1=Burr|first2=Avner|last2=Cohen|date=July 2, 2013}}</ref>

Allegedly, because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors' visits, it was able to disguise the true purpose of the reactor. The inspectors eventually reported that their inspections were useless, due to Israeli restrictions on what parts of the facility they could investigate. According to British writer and intelligence expert [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]], former [[Mossad]] agent [[Rafi Eitan]] told him how the inspectors were fooled:

<blockquote>A bogus control center was built over the real one at Dimona, complete with fake control panels and computer-lined gauges that gave a credible impression of measuring the output of a reactor engaged in an irrigation scheme to turn the Negev into a lush pastureland. The area containing the "heavy" water smuggled from France and Norway was placed off-limits to the inspectors "for safety reasons". The sheer volume of heavy water would have been proof the reactor was being readied for a very different purpose.<ref name=Thomas/></blockquote>

In 1968, the CIA stated in a top-secret National Intelligence Estimate that Israel had nuclear weapons. This assessment was given to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The basis for this claim was the CIA's belief, although never proven, that the uranium that went missing in the [[The Apollo Affair|Apollo Affair]] had been diverted to Israel (Seymour Hersh claims that during the plant decommissioning nearly all of the missing uranium was recovered trapped in the facility pipes or accounted for.),<ref>Hersh, Seymour (1991). The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and America's Foreign Policy. Random House. pp. 243, 250, 252, 255. {{ISBN|0-394-57006-5}}.</ref> as well as evidence gathered from [[National Security Agency|NSA]] electronic eavesdropping on Israeli communications, which proved that the [[Israeli Air Force]] had engaged in practice bombing runs that only made sense for the delivery of nuclear weapons.<ref name=relevance/>

In 1969, the year [[Richard Nixon]] became President, the US government terminated the inspections. According to US government documents declassified in 2007, the Nixon administration was concerned with Israel's nuclear program, worrying that it could set off a regional nuclear arms race, with the [[Soviet Union]] possibly granting the Arab states a nuclear guarantee. In a memorandum dated July 19, 1969, National Security Adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] warned that "The Israelis, who are one of the few peoples whose survival is genuinely threatened, are probably more likely than almost any other country to actually use their nuclear weapons." However, Kissinger warned that attempting to force Israel to disarm could have consequences, writing that "Israel will not take us seriously on the nuclear issue unless they believe we are prepared to withhold something they very much need" (Kissinger was referring to a pending sale of [[F-4 Phantom]] fighter jets to Israel). Kissinger wrote that "if we withhold the Phantoms and they make this fact public in the United States, enormous political pressure will be mounted on us. We will be in an indefensible position if we cannot state why we are withholding the planes. Yet if we explain our position publicly, we will be the ones to make Israel's possession of nuclear weapons public with all the international consequences this entails." Among the suggestions Kissinger presented to Nixon was the idea of the United States adopting a policy of "nuclear ambiguity", or pretending not to know about Israel's nuclear program.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/world/middleeast/29nixon.html|title=Israel's Nuclear Arsenal Vexed Nixon|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 29, 2007|first=David|last=Stout|url-access=limited}}</ref>

According to Israeli historian Avner Cohen, author of ''Israel and the Bomb'', historical evidence indicates that when Nixon met with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] at the White House in September 1969, they reached a secret understanding, where Israel would keep its nuclear program secret and refrain from carrying out nuclear tests, and the United States would tolerate Israel's possession of nuclear weapons and not press it to sign the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]].<ref name=NYT/>

==Stockpile==
The State of Israel has never made public any details of its nuclear capability or arsenal. The following is a history of estimates by many different sources on the size and strength of Israel's nuclear arsenal. Estimates may vary due to the amount of material Israel has on store versus assembled weapons, and estimates as to how much material the weapons actually use, as well as the overall time in which the reactor was operated.

In June 2002, former State Department and Pentagon officials confirmed that the US Navy observed Israeli missile tests in the Indian Ocean in 2000, and that the Dolphin-class vessels have been fitted with nuclear-capable cruise missiles of a new design.

Shortly after the rejection, an Israeli official told ''[[Defense News]]'': "History has taught us that we cannot wait indefinitely for Washington to satisfy our military requirements.

==Policy==
{{main|Policy of deliberate ambiguity}}
Israel's deliberately ambiguous policy to confirm or deny its own possession of nuclear weapons, or to give any indication regarding their potential use, make it necessary to gather details from other sources, including diplomatic and intelligence sources and 'unauthorized' statements by its political and military leaders. Alternatively, with the [[Begin Doctrine]], Israel is very clear and decisive regarding the country's policy on potential developments of nuclear capability by any other regional adversaries, which it will not allow.

===Possession===
Although Israel has officially acknowledged the existence of the reactor near Dimona since Ben-Gurion's speech to the Knesset in December 1960, Israel has never officially acknowledged its construction or possession of nuclear weapons.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 343}} In addition to this policy, on May 18, 1966, Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] told the Knesset that "Israel has no atomic weapons and will not be the first to introduce them into our region," a policy first articulated by Shimon Peres to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in April 1963.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 233–4}} In November 1968, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. [[Yitzhak Rabin]] informed the [[U.S. State Department]] that its understanding of "introducing" nuclear weapons meant testing, deploying or making them public, while merely possessing the weapons did not constitute "introducing" them.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Avner | last1 = Cohen | first2 = William | last2 = Burr | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042801326_pf.html | title = The Untold Story of Israel's Bomb | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = April 30, 2006 | page = B01 |url-access = limited}}.</ref><ref name= kissinger-19690716>{{Citation | url = http://nixon.archives.gov/virtuallibrary/documents/mr/071969_israel.pdf | title =Memorandum for the President: Israeli Nuclear Program | first = Henry A | last = Kissinger | date= July 16, 1969| publisher= The White House| accessdate = July 26, 2009}}</ref> Avner Cohen defines this initial posture as "nuclear ambiguity", but he defines the stage after it became clear by 1969 that Israel possessed nuclear weapons as a policy of ''amimut'',<ref name = "goldberg201009">Goldberg, Jeffrey.

===Doctrine===
{{main|Nuclear strategy|Deterrence theory|Assured destruction}}
Israel's nuclear doctrine is shaped by its lack of strategic depth: a subsonic fighter jet could cross the {{convert |72|km|nmi}} from the [[Jordan River]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in just 4 minutes. It additionally relies on a reservist-based military which magnifies civilian and military losses in its small population. Israel tries to compensate for these weaknesses by emphasising [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]], maneuverability and firepower.<ref name=doctrine>{{cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/israel/doctrine.htm | title=Strategic Doctrine| publisher = Global Security | date=April 28, 2005}}</ref>

As a result, its strategy is based on the premise that it cannot afford to lose a single war, and thus must prevent them by maintaining deterrence, including the option of [[preemptive war|preemption]]. If these steps are insufficient, it seeks to prevent escalation and determine a quick and decisive war outside of its borders.<ref name=doctrine />

Strategically, Israel's long-range missiles, nuclear-capable aircraft, and possibly its submarines present an effective [[second strike]] deterrence against unconventional and conventional attack, and if Israel's defences fail and its population centers are threatened, the [[Samson Option]], an all-out attack against an adversary, would be employed. Its nuclear arsenal can also be used tactically to destroy military units on the battlefield.<ref name=doctrine />

Although nuclear weapons are viewed as the ultimate guarantor of Israeli security, as early as the 1960s the country has avoided building its military around them, instead pursuing absolute conventional superiority so as to forestall a last-resort nuclear engagement.<ref name=doctrine />

According to historian Avner Cohen, Israel first articulated an official policy on the use of nuclear weapons in 1966, which revolved around four "red lines" that could lead to a nuclear response:{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 237}}
# A successful military penetration into populated areas within Israel's [[Green Line (Israel)|post-1949 (pre-1967) borders]].
# The destruction of the [[Israeli Air Force]].
# The exposure of Israeli cities to massive and devastating air attacks or to possible [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[Biological warfare|biological]] attacks.
# The use of nuclear weapons against Israeli territory.

===Deployment===
Seymour Hersh alleges weapons were deployed on several occasions. On October 8, 1973, just after the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]], [[Golda Meir]] and her closest aides decided to put eight nuclear armed [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4s]] at [[Tel Nof Israeli Air Force Base|Tel Nof Airbase]] on 24-hour alert and as many nuclear missile launchers at [[Sedot Mikha Airbase]] operational as possible. Seymour Hersh adds that the initial target list that night "included the Egyptian and Syrian military headquarters near [[Cairo]] and [[Damascus]]".{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | p = 225}} This nuclear alert was meant not only as a means of precaution, but to push the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] to restrain the Arab offensive and to convince the US to begin sending supplies. One later report said that a [[Soviet intelligence]] officer did warn the Egyptian chief of staff, and colleagues of US National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]] said that the threat of a nuclear exchange caused him to urge for a [[Operation Nickel Grass|massive Israeli resupply]].{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 227, 230}} Hersh points out that before Israel obtained its own satellite capability, it engaged in [[espionage]] against the United States to obtain nuclear targeting information on Soviet targets.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1991 | pp = 17, 216, 220, 286, 291–96}}

After [[Iraq]] attacked Israel with [[Scud|Scud missiles]] during the 1991 [[Gulf War]], Israel went on full-scale nuclear alert and mobile nuclear missile launchers were deployed.{{Sfn | Hersh | 1998a | p = 318}} In the buildup to the United States [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], there were concerns that Iraq would launch an unconventional weapons attack on Israel. After discussions with President [[George W. Bush]], the then Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] warned "If our citizens are attacked seriously — by a [[weapon of mass destruction]], chemical, biological or by some mega-terror attack act — and suffer casualties, then Israel will respond." Israeli officials interpreted President Bush's stance as allowing a nuclear Israeli retaliation on Iraq, but only if Iraq struck before the U.S. military invasion.<ref>{{Citation | first = Ross | last = Dunn | url = http://www.news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1223502002 | title = Sharon eyes 'Samson option' against Iraq | newspaper = The Scotsman | date = November 3, 2002}}.</ref>

Israeli military and nuclear doctrine increasingly focused on [[preemptive war]] against any possible attack with conventional, chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, or even a potential conventional attack on [[Israel's weapons of mass destruction]].{{Sfn | Farr | 1999}}<ref>{{Citation | first = Louis René | last = Beres | author-link = Louis René Beres | url = http://www.acpr.org.il/english-nativ/issue1/beres-1.htm | publisher = ACR | place = [[Israel|IL]] | title = Israel's Bomb in the Basement: Reconsidering a Vital Element of Israeli Nuclear Deterrence | year = 2003}}.</ref>

[[Louis René Beres]], who contributed to [[Project Daniel]], urges that Israel continue and improve these policies, in concert with the increasingly preemptive nuclear policies of the United States, as revealed in the [[Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Louis René | last = Beres | author-link = Louis René Beres | url = http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/beres.htm | publisher = Army | title = Israel's Uncertain Strategic Future | journal = Parameters |date=Spring 2007 | place =United States| pages = 37–54}}.</ref>

===Maintaining nuclear superiority===
Alone or with other nations, Israel has used diplomatic and military efforts as well as covert action to prevent other Middle Eastern countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.<ref>{{Citation | first = Ze'ev | last = Schiff | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&id=18387 | title = Israel Urges US Diplomacy on Iran | publisher = Carnegie Endowment | date = May 30, 2006}}.</ref>

===Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and United Nations' Resolutions===
Israel was originally expected to sign the 1968 [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) and on June 12, 1968, Israel voted in favor of the treaty in the [[UN General Assembly]].

However, when the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August by the Soviet Union delayed ratification around the world, Israel's internal division and hesitation over the treaty became public.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 300–1}} The [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson administration]] attempted to use the sale of 50 [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]] to pressure Israel to sign the treaty that fall, culminating in a personal letter from [[Lyndon Johnson]] to Israeli Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]]. But by November Johnson had backed away from tying the F-4 sale with the NPT after a stalemate in negotiations, and Israel would neither sign nor ratify the treaty.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | p = 315}} After the series of negotiations, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security [[Paul Warnke]] was convinced that Israel already possessed nuclear weapons.{{Sfn | Cohen | 1998a | pp = 318–9}} In 2007 Israel sought an exemption to non-proliferation rules in order to import atomic material legally.<ref>{{Citation|first=George |last=Jahn |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j_4W7czAS_qwahtut4_GkhQ3iuCQ |title=Israel Seeks Exemption From Atomic Rules |publisher=The Associated Press |date=September 25, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
