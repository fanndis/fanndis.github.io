{{Rights}}
Rights affecting [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people vary greatly by country or jurisdiction – encompassing everything from the legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

Notably, {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, 30 countries recognize [[same-sex marriage]]; they are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Perper |first1=Rosie |title=The 28 countries around the world where same-sex marriage is legal |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-is-same-sex-marriage-legal-world-2017-11 |accessdate=15 August 2019 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=12 June 2019}}</ref> By contrast, not counting non-state actors and extrajudicial killings, only one country is believed to impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts: Iran<!--please find a RS about Somalia/Jubaland, not some online LGBT journal that doesn't understand what they're reporting-->. The death penalty is on the books but, as far as is known, not enforced in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Nigeria (in the northern third of the country), Saudi Arabia and Somalia (in the autonomous Jubaland region). Sudan rescinded its unenforced death penalty for anal sex (hetero- or homosexual) in 2020. 15 countries have stoning on the books as a [[Adultery#Punishment|penalty for adultery]], which would include gay sex, but this is only enforced by the legal authorities in Iran<!--not Somalia.

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including [[hate crime]]s, criminalization of [[homosexual activity]], and [[discrimination]]. Following the issuance of the report, the [[United Nations]] urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dougherty|first=Jill|date=17 June 2011|title=U.N. council passes gay rights resolution|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/17/un.lgbt.rights/index.html|url-status=live|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UN issues first report on human rights of gay and lesbian people|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>

===Ancient India===

Ayoni or non-vaginal sex of all types are punishable in the [[Arthashastra]]. Homosexual acts are, however, treated as a smaller offence punishable by a fine, while unlawful heterosexual sex carries much harsher punishment. The [[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmsastras]], especially the later ones, prescribe against non-vaginal sex like the [[Vashistha Dharmasutra]]. The [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]] prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men. [[Manusmriti]] prescribes light punishments for such acts.<ref name="DharmaLGBT">{{Cite book|last=Ali|first=Daud|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uP57zh13BqQC&pg=PA50|title=Sexual Diversity in Asia, c. 600–1950|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415600590|editor-last=Reyes|editor-first=Raquel A.

===Assyria===
In [[Assyria]]n society, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.<ref name="Nissinen">Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA24#v=onepage p. 24–28]</ref> An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal [[social class]], a cult prostitute, or with someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine.<ref name="Nissinen" /> Such sexual relations were even seen as good [[Luck|fortune]], with an [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian tablet]], the ''[[Šumma ālu]]'', reading, "If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers".<ref name="Greenberg">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&q=equal+basis|title=The Construction of Homosexuality|first=David F.|last=Greenberg|date=15 August 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226306285}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epistle.us/hbarticles/neareast.html|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt by Bruce Gerig in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt|website=epistle.us}}</ref> However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]], were treated as bad [[omens]].<ref>Pritchard, p. 181.</ref><ref>Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11</ref>

Middle Assyrian [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuality in the military]], which reads: "If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Halsall|first1=Paul|title=The Code of the Assura|url=https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|website=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230918/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|archivedate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name="Homosexuality, Erik Holland page 334">The Nature of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC&pg=PA69|title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex|isbn=9781453503164|last1=Wilhelm|first1=Amara Das|date=18 May 2010}}</ref> A similar law code reads, "If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]". This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual [[rape]]. Any Assyrian male could visit a [[prostitute]] or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.<ref>G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws (Oxford, Clarendon Press [1935]), 71.</ref>

===Ancient Rome===

In ancient Rome, the bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.</ref> Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], male [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men.<ref>Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 214–215; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," ''passim''.</ref> In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|effeminacy]] and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ''([[populares]])'' such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].<ref>Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63–64.</ref>

[[Roman law]] addressed the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape of a male citizen]] as early as the 2nd century BC, when a ruling was issued in a case that may have involved a man of same-sex orientation. It was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex.<ref>As recorded in a fragment of the speech ''De Re Floria'' by [[Cato the Elder]] (frg. 57 Jordan = [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12.7), noted and discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.</ref> A law probably dating to the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.<ref>Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 562–563. See also ''Digest'' 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.</ref> A male classified as ''infamis'', such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.<ref>Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]]''. See McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 314.</ref>

In the [[Roman army]] of the Republic, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|sex among fellow soldiers]] violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death,<ref>McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 40.</ref> as a violation of [[military discipline]].<ref>Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.</ref> The Greek historian [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) lists [[desertion|deserters]], thieves, [[perjury|perjurers]], and "those who in youth have abused their persons" as subject to the ''[[fustuarium]]'', clubbing to death.<ref>[[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html#37 6.37.9] (translated as [[bastinado]]).</ref> Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of [[sexual harassment]] by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself.<ref>Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', pp. 280–285.</ref> Soldiers were free to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|relations with their male slaves]];<ref>Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 3.</ref> the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.<ref>Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 112 ''et passim''.</ref> By the late Republic and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as "homosexual" in the modern sense served openly.<ref>Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyFdUxqYZ48C&pg=PA285#v=onepage&q=%22more%20tolerant%20of%20homosexual%20relations%20between%20soldiers%22 pp. 285–292.]</ref>

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating [[Marriage in ancient Rome|traditional marriage rites]]. [[Juvenal]] remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies.<ref>Juvenal, ''Satire'' 2; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 28.</ref> The emperor [[Nero]] had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a [[freedman]] [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]]) and once as the groom. His consort [[Sporus]] appeared in public as Nero's wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.<ref>[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Nero'' 28–29; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279ff.</ref>

Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by [[Philip the Arab]]. By the end of the 4th century, after the [[Roman Empire]] had come under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], passive homosexuality was [[Death by burning|punishable by burning]].<ref>Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.</ref> "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the [[Theodosian Code]].<ref>''Codex Theodosianus'' 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342.</ref> Under [[Justinian]], all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.<ref>Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia," p. 193.</ref>

<sup>1</sup>During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] annexed territory or established [[reichskommissariat]]s which extended [[Paragraph 175|Germany's laws against same-sex sexual intercourse]] to those territories and reichskommissariats. Age of consent was previously equalized for same-sex couples in the following countries or territories before German annexation or establishment of reichskommissariats: [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]), [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] ([[LGBT rights in Poland|always legal, confirmed in 1932]]), and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] ([[LGBT rights in Italy|legal in 1890]]). All countries and territories listed that where annexed or established into reichskommissariats by Nazi Germany during World War II where restored as independent countries or reincorporated into their previous countries during or after the war and thus re-legalized equal age of consent laws for same-sex couples in those areas.]]</div>
