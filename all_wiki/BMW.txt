'''Bayerische Motoren Werke AG''', commonly referred to as '''BMW''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbeːˈʔɛmˈveː|–|De-BMW.ogg}}), is a German multinational company which produces [[luxury vehicle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of [[Aircraft engine|aircraft engines]], which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] and [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]], and motorcycles are marketed under the brand [[BMW Motorrad]]. In 2015, BMW was the world's [[List of manufacturers by motor vehicle production|twelfth-largest producer of motor vehicles]], with 2,279,503 vehicles produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=WORLD MOTOR VEHICLE PRODUCTION - OICA correspondents survey|url=http://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads//ranking2015.pdf|website=www.oica.net|access-date=19 September 2017|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828220013/http://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking2015.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> The company has significant motorsport history, especially in [[touring car racing|touring cars]], [[Formula 1]], [[sports car racing|sports cars]] and the [[Isle of Man TT]].

BMW is headquartered in [[Munich]] and produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. The Quandt family are long-term shareholders of the company (with the remaining shares owned by public float), following brothers [[Herbert Quandt|Herbert]] and [[Harald Quandt]]'s investments in 1959 which saved the company from bankruptcy.

==History==
{{Main|History of BMW}}
{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2020}}
''Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG'' was formed in 1916. This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name was founded by [[Karl Rapp]] (initially as ''[[Rapp Motorenwerke|Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH]]''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the [[BMW IIIa]]. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.
 
BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.

Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.

The 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.

The ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.

The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.

In 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.

The 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.

The first modern mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, (from 1973 to 1975, BMW built 1672 units of a turbocharged [[BMW M10|M10 engine]] for the [[BMW_02_Series|BMW 2002 turbo]]),<ref>BMW Group (ed.): ''[https://bmw-grouparchiv.de/research/detail/index.xhtml?id=3826800 BMW 2002 turbo]'', retrieved 26 August 2020</ref> with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the 2010s. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first mass-production electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013, (from 1968 to 1972, BMW built two battery-electric [[BMW_02_Series|BMW 1602 Elektro]] saloons for the 1972 Olympic Games).<ref>BMW (ed.): ''[https://bmw-grouparchiv.de/research/detail/index.xhtml?id=3921907 BMW 1602 Elektro]'', retrieved 26 August 2020</ref> After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

=== Company name ===
The name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩ ˈvɛɐ̯kə}}). This name is grammatically incorrect (in German, compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the name's grammatically correct form ''Bayerische Motorenwerke'' ({{IPA-de|ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩vɛɐ̯kə|-|GT BMW-AG.ogg}}) has been used in several publications and advertisements in the past.<ref>Hans List: ''Vorwort und Einführung zum Gesamtwerk.

[[File:BMW logo (gray).svg|thumb|150px|Logo used for publicity purposes since March 2020]]
The circular blue and white BMW logo or [[Roundel#Corporate use|roundel]] evolved from the circular [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] company logo, which featured a black ring bearing the company name surrounding the company logo,<ref name="bmw.com">https://www.bmw.com/en/automotive-life/bmw-logo-meaning-history1.html</ref> ''on a plinth a horse's head couped''.<ref>Described heraldically</ref>

BMW retained Rapp's black ring inscribed with the company name, but adopted as the central element a circular escutcheon bearing a quasi-heraldic reference to the coat of arms (and flag) of the [[Bavaria|Free State of Bavaria]] (as the state of their origin was named after 1918), being the arms of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Dukes and Kings of Bavaria]].<ref name="bmw.com"/> However as the local law regarding trademarks forbade the use of state coats of arms or other symbols of sovereignty on commercial logos, the design was sufficiently differentiated to comply, but retained the [[tincture]]s azure (blue) and argent (white).<ref>The heraldic blazon of the BMW quasi-heraldic circular escutcheon is ''Quarterly of 4: 1&4: Azure; 2&3: Argent''</ref><ref name="bmw.com"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znBnNJ1Fv08 |title=The origin of the BMW logo |access-date=29 December 2011 |author=BMW |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202033152/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znBnNJ1Fv08 |archive-date=2 February 2013  }}</ref>

The current iteration of the logo was introduced in 2020,<ref>[https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/bmw-changes-logo-digital-age BMW changes logo for the digital age], Retrieved March 8, 2020</ref> removing 3D effects that had been used in renderings of the logo, and also removing the black outline encircling the rondel.

The origin of the logo as a portrayal of the movement of an aircraft propeller, the BMW logo with the white blades seeming to cut through a blue sky, is a myth which sprang from a 1929 BMW advertisement depicting the BMW emblem overlaid on a rotating propeller, with the quarters defined by strobe-light effect, a promotion of an aircraft engine then being built by BMW under license from Pratt & Whitney.<ref name="bmw.com"/> ''"For a long time, BMW made little effort to correct the myth that the BMW badge is a propeller"''
(quote by Fred Jakobs, Archive Director, BMW Group Classic).<ref>[https://www.bmw.com/en/automotive-life/bmw-logo-meaning-history1.html]</ref> It is well established that this propellor portrayal was first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929 – twelve years after the logo was created – so this is not the true origin of the logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/bmw-roundel-not-born-from-planes/ |title=BMW Roundel: Not Born From Planes |access-date=29 December 2011 |author=Stephen Williams |work=The New York Times |date=7 January 2010 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110222011/http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/bmw-roundel-not-born-from-planes |archive-date=10 January 2010  }}</ref>

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].

The entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.

During the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|date=30 November 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204163429/http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|archive-date=4 February 2020|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>

In 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).
Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future.

[[File:4 cilindros y museo BMW, Múnich, Alemania 2012-04-28, DD 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright|BMW Headquarters]]
The global [[BMW Headquarters]] in Munich represents the cylinder head of a [[inline-four engine|4-cylinder engine]]. It was designed by [[Karl Schwanzer]] and was completed in 1972. The building has become a European icon<ref name=Patton2009/> and was declared a protected historic building in 1999. The main tower consists of four vertical cylinders standing next to and across from each other. Each cylinder is divided horizontally in its center by a mold in the facade. Notably, these cylinders do not stand on the ground; they are suspended on a central support tower.

[[BMW Museum]] is a futuristic cauldron-shaped building, which was also designed by Karl Schwanzer and opened in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=Touring the Temples of German Automaking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/automobiles/03museums.html|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=21 October 2017|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022085155/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/automobiles/03museums.html|archive-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> The interior has a spiral theme and the roof is a 40-metre diameter BMW logo.

[[BMW Welt]], the company's exhibition space in Munich, was designed by [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]] and opened in 2007. It includes a showroom and lifting platforms where a customer's new car is theatrically unveiled to the customer.<ref>{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UPi7nca0jukC&pg=PA64 |page= 64 |title= Happy Customers Everywhere: How Your Business Can Profit from the Insights of Positive Psychology |first1= Bernd |last1= Schmitt |first2= Glenn |last2= Van Zutphen |publisher= Macmillan |year= 2012 |isbn= 9781137000460 |url-status = live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180319230302/https://books.google.com/books?id=UPi7nca0jukC&pg=PA64 |archive-date= 19 March 2018 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>

BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became ''BMW South Africa'', the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Unlike United States manufacturers, such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]], which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa.

Following the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5 Series and 7 Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3 Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to [[right hand drive]] markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in [[left-hand drive]] for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.

Three unique models that [[BMW Motorsport]] created for the South African market were the [[BMW E23|E23]] M745i (1983), which used the [[BMW M88|M88]] engine from the [[BMW M1]], the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre [[BMW M30|M30]] engine to the [[BMW E30|E30]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |title=BMW South Africa – Plant Rosslyn |publisher=Bmwplant.co.za |access-date=11 April 2009 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327080227/http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |archive-date=27 March 2009  }}</ref> and the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an [[Alpina]]-derived 2.7-litre engine.
