===Eurozone entry===
{{See also|Greek Financial Audit, 2004}}
[[File:Euro banknotes 2002.png|thumb|Greece entered the [[Eurozone]] in 2001]]
Greece was accepted into the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] by the [[European Council]] on 19 June 2000, based on a number of [[euro convergence criteria|criteria]] (inflation rate, budget deficit, public debt, long-term interest rates, exchange rate) using 1999 as the reference year. After an audit commissioned by the incoming [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] government in 2004, [[Eurostat]] revealed that the statistics for the budget deficit had been under-reported.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report by Eurostat on the revision of the Greek government deficit and debt figures|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/4187653/5765001/GREECE-EN.PDF/2da4e4f6-f9f2-4848-b1a9-cb229fcabae3?version=1.0|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=20 June 2015|location=Luxembourg|date=22 November 2004}}</ref>

In the 2005 OECD report for Greece,<ref name="OECD Greece 2005">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wstn-8rGQZQC |title= OECD Economic Surveys (Greece), Vol. 2005/12, September 2005, p.47 |publisher= OECD Publishing |accessdate=25 September 2011|isbn= 9789264011748 |date= 2005-09-22 }}</ref> it was clearly stated that "the impact of new accounting rules on the fiscal figures for the years 1997 to 1999 ranged from 0.7 to 1 percentage point of GDP; this retroactive change of methodology was responsible for the revised deficit exceeding 3% in 1999, the year of [Greece's] EMU membership qualification". The above led the Greek minister of finance to clarify that the 1999 budget deficit was below the prescribed 3% limit when calculated with the ESA79 methodology in force at the time of Greece's application, and thus the criteria had been met.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2004/04-12-08.ana.html#09|title=Finmin says fiscal data saga has ended in wake of EU report|date=8 December 2004}}</ref>

The original accounting practice for military expenses was later restored in line with Eurostat recommendations, theoretically lowering even the ESA95-calculated 1999 Greek budget deficit to below 3% (an official Eurostat calculation is still pending for 1999).

An error sometimes made is the confusion of discussion regarding Greece's Eurozone entry with the controversy regarding usage of derivatives' deals with U.S. Banks by Greece and other Eurozone countries to artificially reduce their reported budget deficits. A currency swap arranged with [[Goldman Sachs]] allowed Greece to "hide" 2.8 billion Euros of debt, however, this affected deficit values after 2001 (when Greece had already been admitted into the Eurozone) and is not related to Greece's Eurozone entry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2011/07/goldman-bet-against-its-european.html |title=Goldman bet against Entire European Nations|date=16 July 2011 |publisher=Washingtons Blog}}</ref>

A study of the period 1999–2009 by forensic accountants has found that data submitted to Eurostat by Greece, among other countries, had a statistical distribution indicative of manipulation; "Greece with a mean value of 17.74, shows the largest deviation from [[Benford's law]] among the members of the eurozone, followed by Belgium with a value of 17.21 and Austria with a value of 15.25".<ref>{{cite news

==== Historical Debt ====

Greece, like other European nations, had faced [[List of sovereign debt crises|debt crises in the 19th century]], as well as a similar crisis in 1932 during the [[Great Depression]]. In general, however, during the 20th century it enjoyed one of the highest GDP growth rates on the planet

|}Between 1981 and 1993 it steadily rose, surpassing the average of what is today the Eurozone in the mid-1980s (see chart right).

For the next 15 years, from 1993 to 2007 (i.e., before the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]]), Greece's government debt-to-GDP ratio remained roughly unchanged (the value was not affected by the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]]), averaging 102%<ref name="Historical Debt IMF"/><ref name="Debt 1980">{{cite news |url=http://www.economicsinpictures.com/2011/09/greek-debtgdp-only-22-in-1980.html|title= Greek Debt/GDP: Only 22% In 1980|work= Economics in Pictures |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref> - a value lower than that for Italy (107%) and Belgium (110%) during the same 15-year period,<ref name="Historical Debt IMF"/> and comparable to that for the U.S. or the OECD average in 2017.<ref name="OECD Debt">{{cite news |url= https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp|title= Debt-To-GDP Ratio
|work= Investopedia (2018) |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

During the latter period, the country's annual budget deficit usually exceeded 3% of GDP, but its effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio was counterbalanced by high GDP growth rates. The debt-to-GDP values for 2006 and 2007 (about 105%) were established after [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|audits]] resulted in corrections according to Eurostat methodology, of up to 10 percentage points for the particular years (as well as similar corrections for the years 2008 and 2009). These corrections, although altering the debt level by [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|a maximum of about 10%]], resulted in a popular notion that "Greece was previously hiding its debt".

==== Evolution of the debt crisis ====

The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the [[Great Recession]], which lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name="Debt Past"/> In Greece's case, the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP - as calculated after all corrections<ref name="Debt Past"/>). Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name="Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat">{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=teina225&language=en|title= Eurostat (Government debt data)|work= Eurostat |accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref> In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]]. 
Finally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which lead to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|about 10%]], i.e., a public debt to GDP of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of [[Greek government-debt crisis#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was "punished" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.

Thus, the Greek economy faced [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis|its most-severe crisis]] since the restoration of democracy in 1974 as the Greek government revised its deficit forecasts from 3.7% in early 2009 and 6% in September 2009, to 12.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in October 2009.<ref>Lynn, Matthew (2011).

A German derivatives dealer had commented to ''Der Spiegel'' that "The Maastricht rules can be circumvented quite legally through swaps," and "In previous years, Italy used a similar trick to mask its true debt with the help of a different US bank."<ref name="Der Spiegel" /> These conditions had enabled Greek as well as many other European governments to spend beyond their means, while meeting the deficit targets of the European Union and the [[Euro convergence criteria|monetary union guidelines]].<ref name="Europe derivatives 1">{{Cite news| title =  Greece not alone in exploiting EU accounting flaws | url =  https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61L3EB20100222 |agency=Reuters  | date = 22 February 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="Europe derivatives 2">{{Cite news| title = Greece is far from the EU's only joker | url = http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/wealth-of-nations/2010/02/19/greece-is-far-from-the-eu-s-only-joker.html |work=Newsweek| date = 19 February 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = The Euro PIIGS out | url = http://librus.ca/2010/10/the-euro-piigs-out | work = Librus Magazine | date = 22 October 2010 | accessdate = 17 May 2011 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820012838/http://librus.ca/2010/10/the-euro-piigs-out/ | archivedate = 20 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = 'Creative accounting' masks EU budget deficit problems | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133622280.html | work = Sunday Business | date = 26 June 2005 | accessdate = 17 May 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515060036/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133622280.html | archive-date = 15 May 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = How Europe's governments have enronized their debts

As a consequence, there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece's ability to repay its sovereign debt, as reflected by the rise of the country's borrowing rates (although their slow rise – the 10-year government bond yield only exceeded 7% in April 2010 – coinciding with a large number of negative articles, has led to arguments about the role of international news media in the evolution of the crisis). In order to avert a default (as high borrowing rates effectively prohibited access to the markets), in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries, and the IMF, agreed to a "rescue package" which involved giving Greece an immediate €{{Nowrap|45 billion}} in bail-out loans, with more funds to follow, totaling €{{Nowrap|110 billion}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greece Faces 'Unprecedented' Cuts as $159B Rescue Nears|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-02/greece-faces-unprecedented-cuts-as-159b-rescue-nears.html|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=3 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kerin Hope |title= EU Puts Positive Spin on Greek Rescue |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html |work=Financial Times  |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> In order to secure the funding, Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Rick|title=Lessons for Congress From the Chaos in Greece|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2011/11/03/lessons-for-congress-from-the-chaos-in-greece|accessdate=3 November 2011|newspaper=US News|date=3 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104005053/http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2011/11/03/lessons-for-congress-from-the-chaos-in-greece|archive-date=4 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their implementation was to be monitored and evaluated by the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the IMF.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10099143.stm "Greece's Austerity Measures"].

=== Telecommunications ===

Between 1949 and the 1980s, [[telephone]] communications in Greece were a [[state monopoly]] by the [[OTE|Hellenic Telecommunications Organization]], better known by its acronym, OTE. Despite the liberalization of telephone communications in the country in the 1980s, OTE still dominates the Greek market in its field and has emerged as one of the largest telecommunications companies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref name="OTE">{{cite web|title=Company Profile|url=https://www.ote.gr/en/web/guest/corporate/company/who-we-are/profile|publisher=[[OTE]]|accessdate=10 January 2014|location=Athens}}</ref> Since 2011, the company's major [[shareholder]] is [[Deutsche Telekom]] with a 40% stake, while the Greek state continues to own 10% of the company's shares.<ref name="OTE" /> OTE owns several subsidiaries across the [[Balkans]], including [[Cosmote]], Greece's top mobile telecommunications provider, [[Cosmote Romania]] and [[Albanian Mobile Communications]].<ref name="OTE" />

Other [[mobile telecommunications]] companies active in Greece are [[Wind Hellas]] and [[Vodafone Greece]]. The total number of active [[cellular phone]] accounts in the country in 2009 based on statistics from the country's mobile phone providers was over 20 million,<ref name="Eleftherotypia syndeseis">{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.ellada&id=100711 |work=Hellenic Tellecommunications Organization ([[OTE]]) |publisher=enet.gr |title=Δύο φορές ο πληθυσμός μας σε συνδέσεις |accessdate=20 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920233721/http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.ellada&id=100711 |archive-date=20 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a penetration of 180%.<ref name="Eleftherotypia syndeseis" /> Additionally, there are 5.745 million active landlines in the country.<ref name="CIAFactBook" />

Greece has tended to lag behind its European Union partners in terms of [[Internet]] use, with the gap closing rapidly in recent years. The percentage of households with [[Internet access]] more than doubled between 2006 and 2013, from 23% to 56% respectively (compared with an EU average of 49% and 79%).<ref name="Eurostat Internet 2011">{{cite web|title=Internet access and use in 2011|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-14122011-BP/EN/4-14122011-BP-EN.PDF|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=19 December 2013|location=Luxembourg|date=14 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131144248/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-14122011-BP/EN/4-14122011-BP-EN.PDF|archive-date=31 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Eurostat Internet 2013">{{cite web|title=Internet access and use in 2013|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-18122013-BP/EN/4-18122013-BP-EN.PDF|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=19 December 2013|location=Luxembourg|date=18 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219063234/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-18122013-BP/EN/4-18122013-BP-EN.PDF|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the same time, there was a massive increase in the proportion of households with a [[broadband]] connection, from 4% in 2006 to 55% in 2013 (compared with an EU average of 30% and 76%).<ref name="Eurostat Internet 2011" /><ref name="Eurostat Internet 2013" /> By 2019, the percentage of Greek households with Internet access and a broadband connection had reached 78.5% and 78.1% respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=SURVEY ON THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES BY HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS: 2019|url=http://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/11bf1710-4021-1994-4594-97f251d88215|publisher=Hellenic Statistical Authority|accessdate=8 November 2019|location=Piraeus|date=8 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Tax evasion ===
{{Main|Tax evasion and corruption in Greece}}

Greece suffers from very high levels of [[tax evasion]]. In the last quarter of 2005, tax evasion reached 49%,<ref name="Ethnos Forodiafygi">{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22770&subid=2&pubid=29345 |script-title=el:Πτώση της φοροδιαφυγής στο 41,6% από 49% το τελευταίο εξάμηνο |year=2006 |publisher=Ethnos |accessdate=12 October 2011 |language=el |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512060357/http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22770&subid=2&pubid=29345 |archive-date=12 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> while in January 2006 it fell to 41.6%.<ref name="Ethnos Forodiafygi" /> It is worth noting that the newspaper [[Ethnos (newspaper)|Ethnos]] which published these figures went bankrupt; it is no longer published and some sources suggest that the information it had published was highly debatable.<ref>[http://www.politisonline.com/%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B1/438149/louketo-ston-pigaso-klinoun-ethnos-imerisia-sto-dromo-450-ergazomeni/ Κλείνει το Εθνος (12 September 2017)]</ref> A study by researchers from the [[University of Chicago]] concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in Greece (accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers) was €28 billion or 31% of the budget deficit that year.<ref>Inman, Phillip (9 September 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/greece-tax-evasion-professional-classes?CMP=twt_gu Primary Greek tax evaders are the professional classes] The Guardian.

Greece's "shadow economy" was estimated at 24.3% of GDP in 2012, compared with 28.6% for Estonia, 26.5% for Latvia, 21.6% for Italy, 17.1% for Belgium, 14.7% for Sweden, 13.7% for Finland, and 13.5% for Germany, and is certainly related to the fact that the percentage of Greeks that are self-employed is more than double the EU average (2013 est.).<ref name="Debt Past"/>

In 2012, Swiss estimates suggested that Greeks had some 20 billion euros in Switzerland of which only one percent had been declared as taxable in Greece.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greece-and-switzerland-set-to-sign-tax-treaty-a-852526.html | title=Greek-Swiss Treaty: Athens Closes in on Wealthy Tax Evaders| newspaper=Spiegel Online| date=28 August 2012}}</ref> Estimates in 2015 were even more dramatic. They indicated that the amount due to the government of Greece from Greeks' accounts in Swiss banks totaled around 80 billion euros.<ref name="The Local ch">{{cite web|title=Greek minister slams Swiss over tax evasion|url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20150624/greek-minister-slams-swiss-over-tax-evasion|publisher=The Local ch|date=24 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="Swissinfo.ch">{{cite web|title=Swiss await Greek input on hidden billions|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-await-greek-input-on-hidden-billions/41292816|publisher=Swissinfo.ch|date=25 February 2015}}</ref>

A mid-2017 report indicated Greeks have been "taxed to the hilt" and many believed that the risk of penalties for tax evasion were less serious than the risk of bankruptcy. One method of evasion is the so-called black market, grey economy or shadow economy: work is done for cash payment which is not declared as income; as well, VAT is not collected and remitted.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/greece-bailout-black-market.html |title = Greeks Turn to the Black Market as Another Bailout Showdown Looms|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 18 February 2017|last1 = Alderman|first1 = Liz}}</ref> A January 2017 report<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dianeosis.org/en/2016/06/tax-evasion-in-greece/ |title = Tax Evasion in Greece – A Study|date = 22 June 2016}}</ref> by the DiaNEOsis think-tank indicated that unpaid taxes in Greece at the time totaled approximately 95 billion euros, up from 76 billion euros in 2015, much of it was expected to be uncollectable. Another early 2017 study estimated that the loss to the government as a result of tax evasion was between 6% and 9% of the country's GDP, or roughly between 11 billion and 16 billion euros per annum.<ref name="keeptalkinggreece.com">{{Cite web|url = http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2017/03/23/tax-evasion-in-greece-between-e11bn-e16bn-annually/|title = Tax evasion in Greece between €11bn-€16bn annually|date = 23 March 2017|access-date = 30 August 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180615055546/http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2017/03/23/tax-evasion-in-greece-between-e11bn-e16bn-annually/|archive-date = 15 June 2018|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The shortfall in the collection of VAT (sales tax) is also significant. In 2014, the government collected 28% less than was owed to it; this shortfall was about double the average for the EU. The uncollected amount that year was about 4.9 billion euros.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2017-06-23|title=If Poland Can Fix Tax Fraud, So Can Greece|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-23/if-poland-can-fix-tax-fraud-so-can-greece|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-26|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref> The DiaNEOsis study estimated that 3.5% of GDP is lost due to VAT fraud, while losses due to smuggling of alcohol, tobacco and petrol amounted to approximately another 0.5% of the country's GDP.<ref name="keeptalkinggreece.com"/>

==== Planned solutions ====
Following similar actions by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], the Greek government was in talks with [[Switzerland]] in 2011, attempting to force Swiss banks to reveal information on the back accounts of Greek citizens.<ref name="Skai Elvetia">{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/184756/mehri-to-telos-tou-2011-i-sumfonia-gia-ti-forologisi-ton-katatheseon-stin-elvetia-/ |script-title=el:Μέχρι το τέλος του 2011 η συμφωνία για τη φορολόγηση των καταθέσεων στην Ελβετία |trans-title=Deal to tax Swiss bank accounts to be reached by end of 2011 |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=30 October 2011|language=el}}</ref> The [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Finance]] stated that Greeks with Swiss bank accounts would either be required to pay a tax or reveal information such as the identity of the bank account holder to the Greek internal revenue services.<ref name="Skai Elvetia" /> The Greek and Swiss governments were to reach a deal on the matter by the end of 2011.<ref name="Skai Elvetia" />

The solution demanded by Greece still had not been effected as of 2015. That year, estimates indicated that the amount of evaded taxes stored in Swiss banks was around 80 billion euros. By then, however, a tax treaty to address this issue was under serious negotiation between the Greek and Swiss governments.<ref name="The Local ch"/><ref name="Swissinfo.ch"/> An agreement was finally ratified by Switzerland on 1 March 2016 creating a new tax transparency law that would allow for a more effective battle against tax evasion. Starting in 2018, banks in both Greece and Switzerland will exchange information about the bank accounts of citizens of the other country to minimize the possibility of hiding untaxed income.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3185_en.htm |title = European Commission - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - EU-Swiss relations}}</ref>

In 2016 and 2017, the government was encouraging the use of [[credit card]]s or [[debit card]]s to pay for goods and services in order to reduce cash only payments. By January 2017, taxpayers were only granted tax-allowances or deductions when payments were made electronically, with a "paper trail" of the transactions that the government could easily audit. This was expected to reduce the problem of businesses taking payments but not issuing an invoice;<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tornosnews.gr/en/greek-news/economy/26979-tax-evasion-safari-in-greek-tourist-spots-snags-major-violators.html |title = Tax evasion 'safari' in Greek tourist spots snags major violators}}</ref> that tactic had been used by various companies to avoid payment of VAT (sales) tax as well as income tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/12/13/fin-ministry-bill-gives-tax-breaks-to-greeks-making-payments-with-credit-and-debit-cards/|accessdate=28 August 2017|title=Fin Ministry Bill Gives Tax Breaks to Greeks Making Payments With Credit and Debit Cards|date=13 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0411/Why-Greeks-swap-of-cash-for-cards-could-end-a-culture-of-tax-evasion|accessdate=28 August 2017|title=WORLD EUROPE Why Greeks' swap of cash for cards could end a culture of tax evasion|journal=Christian Science Monitor|date=11 April 2016}}</ref>

By 28 July 2017, numerous businesses were required by law to install a point of sale device to enable them to accept payment by credit or debit card. Failure to comply with the electronic payment facility can lead to fines of up to 1,500 euros. The requirement applied to around 400,000 firms or individuals in 85 professions. The greater use of cards was one of the factors that had already achieved significant increases in VAT collection in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/220705/article/ekathimerini/business/clear-incentives-for-greater-card-use | title=Clear incentives for greater card use, Nick Malkoutzis &#124; Kathimerini}}</ref>

Between 1832 and 2002 the currency of Greece was the [[drachma]]. After signing the [[Maastricht Treaty]], Greece applied to join the [[eurozone]]. The two main [[euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]] were a maximum budget deficit of 3% of GDP and a declining public debt if it stood above 60% of GDP. Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account. On 1 January 2001, Greece joined the eurozone, with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1. However, in 2001 the euro only existed electronically, so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002. This was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro, which ended on 1 March 2012.<ref name="Bank of Greece drachma">{{cite web|title=Deadline for the exchange of Drachma Banknotes |url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Bank/News/Announcements/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=3852&List_ID=1af869f3-57fb-4de6-b9ae-bdfd83c66c95&Filter_by=AN |publisher=[[Bank of Greece]] |accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref>

Prior to the adoption of the euro, 64% of Greek citizens viewed the new currency positively,<ref name="Public Issue Evro">{{cite web |url=http://www.publicissue.gr/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/eurosurvey-09-2011.pdf |title=Οι Έλληνες, το Ευρώ και η Δραχμή Νο. 2 |trans-title=The Greeks, the Euro and the Drachma No. 2 |publisher=Public Issue ([[Kathimerini]]) |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> but in February 2005 this figure fell to 26% and by June 2005 it fell further to 20%.<ref name="Public Issue Evro" /> Since 2010 the figure has risen again, and a survey in September 2011 showed that 63% of Greek citizens viewed of the euro positively.<ref name="Public Issue Evro" />

== Unemployment rate ==
IMF's forecast said that Greece's unemployment rate would hit the highest 14.8 percent in 2012 and decrease to 14.1 in 2014.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10110.pdf Greece:Staff report on request for stand-by arrangement] IMF, Country report No. 10/110 (2010)</ref> But in fact, the Greek economy suffered a prolonged high unemployment.<ref name=BB12Nov2015GOE>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/greece-comes-to-a-standstill-as-unions-turn-against-tsipras Greece Comes to a Standstill as Unions Turn Against Tsipras] N. Chrysoloras, Bloomberg, News, 12 November 2015</ref> The unemployment figure was between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in 2009, and it soared to 28 per cent in 2013. In 2018, Greece's jobless rate was around 20.1 per cent. It is thought that Greece's potential output has been eroded by this prolonged massive unemployment due to the associated hysteresis effects.<ref name=BB12Nov2015GOE />

== Poverty rate==
As a result of the recession sparked by the public debt crisis, [[poverty]] has increased. The rate of people at risk of poverty or [[social exclusion]] was 30% in 2019.<ref name="Eurostat poverty" /> Those living in [[extreme poverty]] rose to 15% in 2015, up from 8.9% in 2011, and a huge increase from 2009 when it was not more than 2.2%.<ref name="Greece Poverty">{{cite web|last1=Georgakopoulos|first1=Thodoris|title=Extreme Poverty in Greece|url=http://www.dianeosis.org/en/2016/06/extreme-poverty-greece-survey/|website=dianeosis|publisher=dianeosis|accessdate=1 December 2016|date=8 June 2016}}</ref> The rate among children 0-17 is 17.6% and for young people 18-29 the rate is 24.4%.<ref name="Greece Poverty"/> With [[unemployment]] on the rise, those without jobs are at the highest risk of poverty (70–75%), up from less than 50% in 2011.<ref name="Greece Poverty"/> Those out of work lose their [[health insurance]] after two years, further exacerbating the poverty rate. Younger unemployed people tend to rely on the older generations of their families for financial support. However, long-term unemployment has depleted [[pension fund]]s due to fewer workers making social security contributions, resulting in higher poverty rates in intergenerational households reliant on the reduced [[pension]]s received by their [[retirement|retired]] members. Over the course of the economic crisis, Greeks have endured significant job losses and [[wage]] cuts, as well as deep cuts to [[workers' compensation]] and [[welfare]] benefits. From 2008 to 2013, Greeks became 40% poorer on average, and in 2014 saw their [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable household income]] drop below 2003 levels.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|last1=Georgiopoulos|first1=George|title=Greeks 40 percent poorer than in 2008|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-incomes-idUSBRE99L0I420131022|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=1 December 2016|date=22 October 2013}}</ref>
