The '''United States District Court for the Northern District of California''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''N.D. Cal.''')  is the [[United States federal courts|federal]] [[United States district court]] whose jurisdiction comprises following counties of [[California]]: [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa]], [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte]], [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]], [[Lake County, California|Lake]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino]], [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[Napa County, California|Napa]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Francisco County, California|San Francisco]], [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]], [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]], [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]], and [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]]. The court hears cases in its courtrooms in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. It is headquartered in San Francisco.

Cases from the Northern District of California are appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] (except for [[patent]] claims and claims against the U.S. government under the [[Tucker Act]], which are appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]).

==History==

California was admitted as a state on September 9, 1850, and was initially divided into two districts, the Northern and the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of California|Southern]], by Act of Congress approved September 28, 1850, 9 Stat. 521.<ref name=fjcca>[http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_district_ca.html U.S. District Courts of California, Legislative history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531215137/http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_district_ca.html |date=May 31, 2010 }}, ''[[Federal Judicial Center]]''.</ref> The boundary line was at the 37th parallel of North Latitude.<ref name=calif>Willoughby Rodman, ''History of the Bench and Bar of Southern California'' (1909), p. 46.</ref> The creating act provided that:

:In addition to the ordinary jurisdiction and powers of a District Court of the United States, with which the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District Court of New York]] has been invested, the said Courts be and hereby are invested respectively within the limits of its district with the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction and power in all civil cases now exercised by the Circuit Courts of the United States; and that in all cases where said Courts shall exercise such jurisdiction, appeals may be taken from the judgments, orders or decrees of said Courts to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

The Act of August 31, 1852 made the Judge of the Northern District be Judge of the Southern District as well until otherwise provided, by 10 Stat. 76, 84,<ref name=fjcca /> effectively creating a single District in all but name until an Act of January 18, 1854 provided for the appointment of a Judge for the Southern District.<ref name=calif /> The Southern District of California was abolished and the State made to constitute a single district – the [[United States District Court for the District of California]] – by Act of Congress approved July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 300.<ref name=fjcca /><ref name=calif />

Twenty years later, on August 5, 1886, Congress re-created the Southern District of California by 24 Stat. 308.<ref name=calif /> [[Erskine M. Ross]] was appointed Judge of the new district and served until his promotion to the Circuit Judgeship, when he was succeeded by [[Olin Wellborn]].<ref name=calif /> On March 18, 1966, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of California|Eastern]] and [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central]] Districts were created from portions of the Northern and Southern Districts by 80 Stat. 75.<ref name=fjcca />

==Specialization==
The court has become known as the presumptive destination for major cases (such as large [[class actions]] and [[multi-district litigation]]) involving defendants based in East Asia and the high tech sector.
