'''''Willkommenskultur''''' (in German: '''Welcoming culture''') is a German concept which designates firstly a positive attitude of politicians, businesses, educational institutions, sports clubs, civilians and institutions towards foreigners, including and often especially towards migrants. Secondly, the term expresses the wish that all foreigners and migrant people  encountered by these institutions may be accepted and particularly not be exposed to [[discrimination]]. Thirdly, the word ''welcoming culture'' means all the measures promoted by a positive attitude towards foreigners and migrants in others.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/47/muslims-islam-west-terrorism/seite-6 |title=Muslims: The Willkommenskultur is a chance for reconciliation &#124; ZEIT ONLINE |website=Zeit.de |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/willkommenskultur-in-germany-non-merci-in-france/a-18721427 |title=′Willkommenskultur′ in Germany, ′non merci′ in France &#124; Germany &#124; DW.COM &#124; 17.09.2015 |website=DW.COM |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hill |first=Jenny |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29686248 |title=Germany struggles to adapt to immigrant influx |publisher=BBC News |date= 3 November 2014|accessdate=2016-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationsportal.de/glossar/willkommenskultur |title=Glossarartikel: Willkommenskultur &#124; IQ Netzwerk Niedersachsen |language=de |website=Migrationsportal.de |accessdate=2016-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091107/http://www.migrationsportal.de/glossar/willkommenskultur |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wirtschaftsfoerderung-sbh.de/mcms.php?_oid=3d87e3a-c60c-b10d-545f-5b50787c7ef95&_template=view |title=Gewinnung und Bindung von Neubürgern in der Region Schwarzwald-Baar-Heuberg |website=Wirtschaftsfoerderung-sbh.de |accessdate=2016-03-29}}</ref>

==Foreign perspectives==
''[[The Guardian]]'' distinguishes two meanings of the term '''welcoming culture''':

Originally it was meant to attract people from abroad to Germany to compensate for a huge shortage of skilled workers, particularly in sparsely populated areas. Since the beginning of the [[European migrant crisis|European refugee crisis in 2015]], the term was being used to promote assistance for millions of refugees coming to Germany,<ref>{{cite news|author=Doris Akrap |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/06/germany-refugee-crisis-syrian |title=Germany's response to the refugee crisis is admirable. But I fear it cannot last &#124; Doris Akrap &#124; Opinion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}</ref> who were received by highly visible posters "refugees welcome", and by actual help of any kind, mainly on private initiative of uncountable German citizens.

The French daily ''[[Libération]]'' adds that the word "welcome culture" was originally created decades ago in the [[tourism]] industry.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2015/12/30/willkommenskultur_1423633 |title=Willkommenskultur - Libération |website=Liberation.fr |date=2015-12-30 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}</ref> According to this view "welcome culture" would also be a Germanisation of the technical term ''Hospitality Management''.

''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that Chancellor Angela Merkel was also laying the foundation for new "hyphenated German" groups, namely "the Syrian-Germans, Iraqi-Germans, Afghan-Germans", alluding to the phenomenon of [[hyphenated American]] identities. The concept has dramatically increased the sphere of influence of Germany.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/world/europe/as-germany-takes-in-refugees-it-also-rehabilitates-its-image.html?_r=1|title=As Germany Takes in Refugees It Also Rehabilitates Its Image|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-01-27}}</ref>
