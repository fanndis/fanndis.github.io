The '''Gulfstream IV''' (or '''G-IV''' or '''GIV''') and derivatives are a family of [[twinjet]] aircraft, mainly for private or [[Business jet|business]] use. They were designed and built by [[Gulfstream Aerospace]], a [[General Dynamics]] company based in [[Savannah, Georgia]], [[United States]], from 1985 until 2018. Aircraft power is provided by two [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay]] [[turbofans]].

Upon delivery of the last G450, over 900 GIV/GIV-SP/G450 units had been produced. The last G450 was delivered on 19 January 2018 after 365 deliveries over 12 years, ending a 30-year production run, to be replaced by the [[Gulfstream G500|G500]].<ref name=161021PR>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/gulfstream-launches-g500-global-demo-tour-445118/ |title= Gulfstream launches G500 global demo tour |date= 23 Jan 2018 |author= Kate Sarsfield |work= Flightglobal}}</ref>

==Design and development==
Gulfstream, in collaboration with [[Grumman]], began work on the Gulfstream IV in March 1983 as a re-engined, stretched fuselage derivative of the [[Gulfstream III]].  A decision to redesign the wing structure for weight reduction presented an opportunity for an aerodynamic redesign of the wing to reduce cruise drag and increase range. Wing contour modifications had to be restricted to the forward 65% of wing chord so that no redesign of the control surfaces would be necessary. Modification of the inboard wing would have entailed a redesign of the fuselage floor structure, consequently this region of the wing was not modified. Outboard wing modifications were aimed at reducing the peak subcritical pressure coefficient and moving it aft in an effort to reduce shock strength and increase shock sweep.<ref>Chandrasekharan, R.M., Murphy, W.R., Taverna, F.P. and Boppe, C.W., "Computational Aerodynamic of the Gulfstream IV Wing", AIAA paper 85-0427, presented at the AIAA 23rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno Nevada, January 1985.</ref> The Gulfstream IV wing has a weaker, more swept outboard shock resulting in a lower cruise drag. Other benefits arising from this design are a lower root bending moment due to the more inboard center of pressure, a lower stall speed due to washout and a larger fuel volume due to increased chord. These aerodynamic improvements result in an increase in range of over 300 nautical miles.<ref>Boppe, Charles W., "Computational Aerodynamic Design: X-29, the Gulfstream Series and a Tactical Fighter", SAE paper 851789, 1985 Wright Brothers Award Paper, presented at the Aerospace Technology Conference & Exposition, Long Beach California, October 1985.</ref>

In addition to the wing redesign, the Gulfstream IV also became the first business jet to have an entire glass cockpit.<ref name=thomas>{{cite web |publisher= stratos jet charters|author= Joel Thomas |title= History of the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation |url= https://www.stratosjets.com/history-of-gulfstream-aerospace-corporation/ |date= 19 May 2014}}</ref> The first GIV made its maiden flight on September 19, 1985.<ref name=Frawley_Civil_GIV/> The model received type certification from the FAA on April 22, 1987.<ref name= typeCert/> The G-IV entered into service with serial number 1000 in 1987 and was upgraded to the special purpose ''GIV-SP'' version at serial number 1214 in 1993.  It was later redesignated ''G400'' at serial number 1500.<ref name="flagship">{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/gulfstream-iv |title= Gulfstream IV

A shorter range variant was created based on the GIV and given the ''G300'' designation in 2002.<ref name=Frawley_Civil_GIV>Frawley, Gerald. "Gulfstream IV, G300 & G400". ''The International Directory of Civil Aircraft, 2003/2004''. Fishwick, Act: Aerospace Publications, 2003. {{ISBN|1-875671-58-7}}.</ref> The G400 has a large cabin, long range of 4,350 nautical miles (8,060&nbsp;km) and the same comfort and design that characterize the G series. Maximum cruise height and speed are 45,000&nbsp;ft and [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.77. Earlier models were fitted with Honeywell's SPZ 8000 Avionics package. The SPZ 8400 Avionics Package was an option, becoming standard on later models. Its second-hand price was below $15 million in 2009.<ref name="flagship"/>

In 2001, Gulfstream began work on an improved version of the GIV-SP, originally designated ''GIV-X''.  It was later renamed ''G450''.  The G450 is lengthened 1&nbsp;ft (0.305 m) over the G400 and shares the forward fuselage and larger cockpit of the [[Gulfstream G550|G550]].  Production of the G450 began in October 2004, replacing the G400.  The G450 has better performance and comes with the PlaneView cockpit with four 14-inch (355&nbsp;mm) [[liquid crystal display]]s and a [[Head up display]] (HUD).  The shorter range G350 version of the G450 was developed and received certification in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/flight-test-gulstream-g450-heir-apparent-190572/ |title= Flight test : Gulstream G450 - Heir apparent |publisher= Flight International |date= November 23, 2004}}</ref>

By 2018, 1990 to 1992 GIVs were for sale at $1.6-4.4 million, 1992 to 1999 GIVSPs were listed for $1.25-5.2 million, 15-year-old G300s and G400s were available for $4.5-7 million and 2006 to 2016 G450s at $9.95-23.75 million.<ref name=AINdec2018>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.ainonline.com/sites/default/files/full-issues/ain_1218.pdf |title= For many models, market hitting the apex |magazine= Aviation International News |author= Mark Huber |date= December 2018 |pages= 20–21, 24}}</ref>

==Operational history==

The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) operates a GIV-SP (N49RF) modified to fly [[scientist]]s and crew members at 45,000 feet around [[tropical cyclone]]s. The aircraft was modified to drop instruments called "[[dropsonde]]s" to measure windspeed, [[barometric pressure]], [[humidity]], and temperature as they fall to the surface of the ocean. By sampling the cyclone with these dropsondes over a 4,000 mile track around the storm, the forecasters at NOAA's [[National Hurricane Center]] and [[Hurricane Research Division]] can better predict where the hurricane will be "steered" by the upper level winds. They also predict [[wind shear]] that will either increase or decrease a hurricane's strength. The GIV-SP is suited for this mission since it is fast, and can fly long distances with ample cabin space for the crew and instruments.<ref name="noaa_givsp">"[http://www.aoc.noaa.gov/aircraft_g4.htm Gulfstream IV-SP (G-IV)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218124547/http://www.aoc.noaa.gov/aircraft_g4.htm |date=2007-02-18 }}." [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] web site.</ref>  In 2009, the NOAA GIV-SP was further modified by the addition of a side-scanning Doppler radar to the rear fuselage. This radar is used for storm cloud profiling.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/photo/NOAA/Gulfstream-Aerospace-G-IV/1566075/L Picture of the Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV Gulfstream IV-SP aircraft] Retrieved 1 November 2011.</ref>

In June 1987 a Gulfstream IV set 22 world records in its class in flying west around the world in 45 hr 25 min.  The next year another GIV set 11 world records flying east around the world.<ref name=G-IV_airliners.net>[http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=238 "Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV"]. airliners.net</ref>  In 1990, Gulfstream [[CEO]] [[Allen Paulson]] and a Gulfstream flight crew set 35 international records for around-the-world flight in a GIV.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Clay|title=Clay Lacy on Allen Paulson|url=https://www.claylacy.com/clay-lacy-allen-paulson|publisher=Clay Lacy|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref>

===G350/G450===
[[File:GULFSTREAM g450 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Gulfstream G450]]

The '''G450''' is a designation for the model '''GIV-X''', approved by the FAA on August 12, 2004, as is the '''G350''', which has a reduced fuel capacity. Compared to the '''Gulfstream IV''', its fuselage is 12 inches longer and the main entry door relocated aft. The [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay|Rolls-Royce Tay]] 611 engines are replaced by 611-8Cs with FADEC, redesigned thrust reversers, nacelles and pylons which increases range and payload, coupled with  aerodynamic improvements. Many [[Gulfstream V-SP]] improvements are used: the [[Honeywell]] advanced flight deck display suite, electrical power generation, cabin temperature control and pressurization, nose and nose landing gear. It also has an improved APU and flap/stab actuation system, redesigned main landing gear wheels and brakes, flight control system hard-over protection system.<ref name= typeCert>{{cite web |url= http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/2d504046f9657ec386257f610074fcfb/$FILE/A12EA_Rev46.pdf |title= Type Certificate date Sheet NO.
