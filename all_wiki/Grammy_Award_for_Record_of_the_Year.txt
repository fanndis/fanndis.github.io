The '''Grammy Award for Record of the Year''' is presented by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to sales or chart position."<ref name="Overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}</ref><ref name="Grammy">{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref> The Record of the Year award is one of the four "General Field" categories at the awards (alongside [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]) presented annually since the [[1st Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1959.

According to the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is presented:
{{quote|For commercially released singles or tracks of new vocal or instrumental recordings. Tracks from a previous year's album may be entered provided the track was not entered the previous year and provided the album did not win a Grammy. Award to the artist(s), producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s) if other than the artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-winners-list|title=2020 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Winners List|date=2020-01-26|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|accessdate=2020-01-27}}</ref>}}

Arrangers, songwriters, musicians and background singers of a winning recording can apply for a Winners Certificate.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf Grammy Blue Book]</ref> Songwriters can only apply for a certificate if it is a new song.

Since the [[55th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2013, mastering engineers are considered nominees and award recipients in this category.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/news/the-recording-academy-announces-board-of-trustees-meeting-results |title=The Recording Academy Announces Board Of Trustees Meeting Results |date=June 8, 2012 |access-date=June 11, 2012 |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}</ref>

Record of the Year is related to but is conceptually different from Song of the Year or Album of the Year:

* Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, "record" means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.
* Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. "Song" in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.
* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, "album" means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.

==History and description==
The Record of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/grammy-rewind-1st-annual-grammy-awards|title=GRAMMY REWIND: 1ST ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS|publisher=The Recording Academy|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|the Song of the Year award]] and Record of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes to the performer and production team of the song whereas the Song of the Year award goes only to the composer(s) of the song. According to the [[54th Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is given for commercially released singles or tracks of new vocal or instrumental recordings. Tracks from a previous year's album may be entered provided the track was not entered the previous year and provided the album did not win a Grammy Award to the artist(s), producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s) if other than the artist.  Associate producers and executive producers are not eligible".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper|title=Category Mapper|accessdate=November 25, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

The honorees through its history have been:
*1959–1965: Artist only.
*1966–1998: Artist and producer.
*1999–2012: Artist, producer, recording engineer and mixing engineer
*2013–present: Artist, producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer and mastering engineer

The category has expanded to include eight nominees in [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019]].<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/recording-academy-announces-61st-grammy-awards-update Recording Academy Announces 61st GRAMMY Awards Update]</ref>
