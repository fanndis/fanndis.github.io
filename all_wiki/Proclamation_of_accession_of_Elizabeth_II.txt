Proclamations were made in different [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth realms]] on 6, 7, 8, and 11 February (depending on geographic location and time zone).

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Accession Council]] met twice at [[St James's Palace]]: first at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 February, before the queen had returned from Kenya, to make their proclamation declaring the accession of the new sovereign, as the late king's successor in accordance with the [[line of succession to the British throne]],<ref>{{cite hansard| jurisdiction=United Kingdom| url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1952/feb/06/preamble| house=House of Lords| date=6 February 1952}}</ref> and, secondly, at a meeting begun at 10 a.m. on Friday, 8 February, when the queen was personally present, to receive her oath for the security of the [[Church of Scotland]] and her own personal declaration, pledging that she would always work to uphold constitutional government and to advance the happiness and prosperity of her peoples all the world over.<ref name=trove.nla.gov.au>{{citation| url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49014603| title=Elizabeth's Pledge as Queen Heavy Task Accepted| date=9 February 1952| newspaper=The West Australian| accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> Her declaration for securing the Protestant succession, as required by the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Accession Declaration Act 1910]],<ref>{{citation| last1=Maer| first1=Lucinda| last2=Gay| first2=Oonagh| title=The Coronation Oath| date=27 August 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer}}</ref> was to be made later, at the next state opening of parliament on 4 November.<ref>{{citation| url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpolcon/1615/1615we02.htm| last=Parliament of the United Kingdom| title=Written evidence submitted by Professor Robert Blackburn, PhD, LLD, Professor of Constitutional Law, King's College London| date=November 2011| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>

After the Accession Council had completed the formalities for their proclamation on 6 February, it had been issued for publication in a supplement to that day's ''[[London Gazette]]'':<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=39458|page=757| date=6 February 1952}}</ref>

Brief pause for trumpets. And then shouts
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN}}</div>

The accession proclamation was published in ''[[The Times]]'' on 7 February, quoting the ''London Gazette''. According to the ''Times'', it was expected that the public proclamation would be made in due form by the heralds of the [[College of Arms]]. The practice had been to read it first from the [[Friary Court]] balcony at St James's Palace and, in the [[City of London]], the custom had been to lay it before the Court of Aldermen and to read it, after a ceremony at [[Temple Bar, London]], at the corner of [[Chancery Lane]], in [[Fleet Street]], and at the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].

After the meeting with the Queen at St James's Palace in the morning of 8 February, the accession proclamation was read to the public by the [[Garter King of Arms]], Sir [[George Bellew]], first at 11 a.m. from the Friary Court balcony, then in [[Trafalgar Square]], in [[Fleet Street]], and at the Royal Exchange.<ref name=trove.nla.gov.au/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6510000/newsid_6511800/6511853.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&bbcws=1| title=1952: New Queen proclaimed for UK| publisher=BBC| accessdate=22 April 2013| date=2007-05-04}}</ref>

After the announcement of George VI's death had been formally communicated to the [[House of Assembly (Turks and Caicos Islands)|Legislative Board]] of [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (at that time a dependency of [[Jamaica]], itself then a [[Crown colony]]), a proclamation was issued and published there on Friday, 8 February.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tcmuseum.org/culture-history/royal-events/queen-elizabeth-ii/| title=Culture & History > Royal Events > Queen Elizabeth II > Queen Elizabeth II Biography| publisher=Turks and Caicos National Museum| accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref>

==Royal title==
The proclamation in the United Kingdom marked the first inclusion, by an Accession Council, of the title ''[[Head of the Commonwealth]]'', and the first reference to "representatives of other Members of the Commonwealth" as among those proclaiming. Also, [[the Crown]], which had been referred to as the ''Imperial Crown of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]'', was also now non-specific, and Elizabeth's title was not her official one. These last two points reflected the existence of the [[Republic of Ireland]] (Ireland would not be officially removed from the Queen's title until the year following), as well as the sovereignty of countries over which Elizabeth was now separately queen. However, the Canadian proclamation, necessarily separate due to the country's legal independence from the UK, continued to refer to the new sovereign as Queen of Ireland, and the Crown she inherited as being that of "Great Britain, Ireland and all other His late Majesty's dominions." Elizabeth was also proclaimed Queen of Ireland in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/brit-proclamations.htm#Elizabeth2| title=Proclamations of Accession of English and British Sovereigns (1547-1952)| publisher=Heraldica| accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref>

Changes of the royal style and title in any realm do not as such change the constitutional status or position of the monarch or the Crown.<ref>Noel Cox ''The Development of a Separate Crown in New Zealand''[http://www.reocities.com/noelcoxfiles/Development_of_Separate_Crown_in_New_Zealand.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715173716/http://www.reocities.com/noelcoxfiles/Development_of_Separate_Crown_in_New_Zealand.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} which considers also the positions of Australia and Canada; and see Noel Cox LLM (Hons), PhD, Lecturer, Auckland University of Technology, in Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law Volume 9, Number 3 (September 2002): ''Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence'' (Ontario Court of Appeal).[http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html]</ref>
