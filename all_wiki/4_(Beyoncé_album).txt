'''''4''''' is the fourth solo studio [[album]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. It was released on June 24, 2011, by [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Following a career hiatus that reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional [[rhythm and blues]] that stood apart from contemporary [[pop music|popular music]]. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers [[The-Dream]], [[Tricky Stewart]] and [[Shea Taylor]] produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[soul music]].

Severing professional ties with father and manager [[Mathew Knowles]], Beyoncé eschewed the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. ''4''{{'}}s lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition.

''4'' was promoted in mid-2011 by television performances and festival appearances, such as Beyoncé's headlining [[Glastonbury Festival 2011|Glastonbury Festival]] set. The album received generally positive reviews by music critics; several publications included it on their year-end lists. It was her fourth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and it also reached number one in Brazil, France, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. ''4'' spawned the international singles "[[Run the World (Girls)]]", "[[Best Thing I Never Had]]", "[[Party (Beyoncé song)|Party]]", "[[Love On Top]]" and "[[Countdown (Beyoncé song)|Countdown]]". "Love on Top" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance]] at the [[55th Annual Grammy Awards|55th annual ceremony]]. As of December 2015, ''4'' has sold 1.5&nbsp;million copies in the United States.<!--Sourced below.-->

==Background and development==
Following the release of her third album ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008) and a world tour, Beyoncé took a career hiatus in 2010 "to live life [and] to be inspired by things again".<ref name="documentary">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1666719/beyonce-year-of-4.jhtml|title=Beyonce Shrugs Off 'Fear' In 'Year Of 4'|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> During her hiatus, she "killed" Sasha Fierce, the alter-ego used in her [[I Am...

In an interview for ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio.<ref name="complex">{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Gabriel|title=Beyoncé: Mighty Fly|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/07/beyonce-2011-cover-story-gallery|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=July 19, 2011|page=1}}</ref> She intended ''4'' to help change that status, commenting, "Figuring out a way to get [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] back on the radio is challenging&nbsp;...

I wanted musical changes, [[bridge (music)|bridges]], [[vibrato|vibrata]], live instrumentation and classic songwriting."<ref name="complex"/> On her website she wrote, "The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on my previous albums because I'm bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences I have, the more I have to talk about. I really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I'm 40 and when I'm 60."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/06/20/andre-3000-calls-beyonce-one-of-the-best-performers/|title=André 3000 Calls Beyoncé One of the Best Performers|work=[[Rap-Up]]|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=August 3, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034804/http://www.rap-up.com/2011/06/20/andre-3000-calls-beyonce-one-of-the-best-performers/|archivedate=19 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Beyoncé also sought to make more artistic music, rather than purely commercially oriented songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oldenberg|first=Ann|title=Beyonce: 'Not just radio songs' on new album|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/07/beyonce-not-just-radio-songs-on-new-album/1?csp=34#.Uih259KBmoY|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

Three months into her hiatus in March 2010, Beyoncé began recording at her husband [[Jay-Z]]'s Roc the Mic Studios in [[New York City]].<ref name="yearof4"/><ref name="sound"/> One song—"[[Party (Beyoncé song)|Party]]"—was recorded because she wanted to see what working relationship would develop with engineer [[DJ Swivel]].<ref name="sound"/> [[Kanye West]] assisted the production of "Party" after Beyoncé was impressed by his work on ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010).<ref name="complex"/> [[André 3000]], the only featured artist on ''4'', contributed a rap verse to the song, which he recorded in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name="notes"/>

Six weeks later, in May 2010, she asked Swivel to work on the entire project.<ref name="sonic"/> Concerning his working relationship with Beyoncé, he commented, "There was no 'We're doing ''this'' today.' It was a very kind of open project, where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us."<ref name="sonic"/> With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments.<ref name="sound">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct11/articles/dj-swivel.htm|title=DJ Swivel: Recording Beyoncé's 4|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}</ref> Mostly inspired by the ''[[Fela!]]'' sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from ''Fela!''<ref name="sound"/> The project was moved to KMA Studios for a week and a half because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording "[[I Care (Beyoncé song)|I Care]]", "[[Best Thing I Never Had]]" and "[[Rather Die Young]]", and completed "Party". They recorded the songs "[[Schoolin' Life]]", "[[1+1 (song)|1+1]]" and "[[Start Over (song)|Start Over]]" at [[Jungle City Studios]] in New York.<ref name="notes"/>

[[MSR Studios]] was the final New York City-based studio used, and where most of ''4'' was recorded—only "Party" and "[[I Was Here (song)|I Was Here]]" were recorded entirely at other studios.<ref name="sound"/><ref name="notes"/> At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of [[live instrumentation|live instruments]] on songs such as "I Care" and "End of Time".<ref name="sonic"/><ref name="notes"/> Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by [[Jeff Bhasker]] and [[Shea Taylor]].<ref name="sound"/><ref name="notes"/> Beyoncé asked [[Frank Ocean]] to write and record "[[I Miss You (Beyoncé song)|I Miss You]]" at MSR, saying to ''Complex'', "[Jay-Z] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. I asked him to fly to New York and work on my record."<ref name="complex"/>

After listening to each song, Beyoncé would often request the addition of specific instruments, leaving her production team to make the sounds cohesive.<ref name="sonic"/> Her vocals were recorded through an Avalon Design 737 preamp and compressed in a [[1176 Peak Limiter]] with a 4:1 ratio.<ref name="sonic">{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicscoop.com/2011/06/26/engineer-profile-dj-swivel-on-the-making-of-beyonces-4/|title=Engineer Profile: DJ Swivel on the Making of Beyoncé's '4'|first=David|last=Weiss|publisher=SonicScoop|date=June 26, 2011|accessdate=July 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722005038/http://www.sonicscoop.com/2011/06/26/engineer-profile-dj-swivel-on-the-making-of-beyonces-4/|archivedate=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> After recording the lead vocals for a track, Swivel cut them in different ways and he and Beyoncé picked the best, then recording the backing vocals.<ref name="sound"/> Beyoncé composed her own vocal [[arrangement]]s and [[harmony|harmonies]] for each song. Her microphones were carefully placed to achieve a blend of sounds with a clear quality.<ref name="sound"/> Swivel spoke of her work ethic in an interview for ''Sound on Sound'':

{{quote|She's so fast and good at what she does that you can't afford to waste time on anything, so if we're ready to record drums, for example, we're going to work with whatever we have available right there and then.

After the move to MSR, Beyoncé and her production team began travelling.<ref name="sonic"/> In the United Kingdom, they worked at [[Peter Gabriel]]'s [[Real World Studios]] in Wiltshire—particularly using Gabriel's multi-instrument room—to create "[[Love On Top]]".<ref name="sonic"/><ref name="notes"/> Soon after, Beyoncé joined Jay-Z in a Sydney mansion, as he was working on his collaboration album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'' (2011) with Kanye West.
