'''Madras State''' was a [[States of India|state]] of [[India]] during the mid-20th century. At the time of its formation in 1950, it included the whole of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] (except [[Kanyakumari district]]), [[Coastal Andhra]], [[Rayalaseema]], the [[Malabar district|Malabar region]] of North and central Kerala, and [[Bellary district|Bellary]], [[South Canara]]. [[Coastal Andhra]] and [[Rayalaseema]] were separated to form [[Andhra State]] in 1953, while South Canara and Bellary districts were merged with [[Mysore State]], and [[Malabar District]] with the [[Travancore-Cochin|State of Travancore-Cochin]] to form [[Kerala]] in 1956. On January 14, 1969, Madras State was renamed to [[Tamil Nadu]], meaning "Tamil country".<ref>{{cite book|title=Migrant women and urban labour market: concepts and case studies|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMlVGtjbcSIC&q=madras+state+became+Tamilnadu&pg=PA105|isbn=9788176299664|last1=Sundari|first1=Dr. S.|year=2007}}</ref>

== History ==
After [[Partition of India|Indian Independence]], the [[Madras Presidency]] became the [[Madras Province]] on 15 August 1947. On 26 January 1950, it was formed as Madras State by the [[Government of India]]. As a result of the 1956 [[States Reorganisation Act]], the state's boundaries were re-organized following linguistic lines. The state was finally renamed as Tamil Nadu on 14 January 1969 by C.N.Annadurai, Chief Minister.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_states.html The states of India since 1947]</ref>

====Madras Temple Entry Authorization Act ====
The act called for permitting the [[Dalits]] into [[Hindu]] temples for worship, who was till then were barred from entering into the temple. While the former [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], now reemerged as [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] headed by [[Periyar E. V.

The Omandur cabinet passed another landmark law related to women, being pressurized by social activists like [[Muthulakshmi Reddi]] and [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]] for a long time. The act known as [[Madras Devadasis (Prevention of Dedication) Act]] which gave [[Devadasi]]'s the legal right to Marry and also making it illegal to dedicate girls to Hindu temples was passed on 9 October 1947 within 2 month of Independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|author=Parvathi Menon|title=Ideals, Images and Real Lives: Women in Literature and History |editor=Alice Thorner |editor2=Maithreyi Krishnaraj|year=2000|volume=18|issue=16|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1816/18160740.htm|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|page=264|title=Woman, Her History and Her Struggle for Emancipation|author=B.

===P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja===

P.S. Kumarasamy Raja took office on 6 April 1949. He was the first Congress Chief Minister of Madras State after the adaptation of Republican constitution since 26 January 1950. The Madras Province now became Madras State was the administrative area still included present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Cochin State]] and [[Malabar district]] of  present-day [[Kerala]] and [[South Canara]] districts in present-day [[Karnataka]]. He  stated that the change of the Premier and Members of the Cabinet would not mean a change in the policies of the Government and that his government would follow the same principles of the former Ministry.<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/87347/8/mangala_chapter6.pdf</ref>

=== Chakravarti Rajagopalachari ===
In the 1952 elections, the first as a part of Republic India, the [[Indian National Congress]] emerged as the single largest party in the assembly. However, Congress could not form the government as lacked a clear majority, while the [[Communist Party of India]] led coalition was in a better position to form the government. Nevertheless, a Congress government was formed in the state, and [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] was selected by the cadres of the Congress party to rule the state. Also, Rajaji was not an elected member of the Madras Legislative Assembly but was nominated by the then governor to the Legislative Council and took office as the chief minister of Madras state.<ref>[http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19971108/31250413.html Leader, amend thy mind<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924055217/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19971108/31250413.html |date=24 September 2012 }}</ref>

<!--had introduced the scheme of conducting classes in the schools in the forenoon and asking the students to learn the traditional jobs of their parents in the afternoon. At the first stage, it was implemented in the rural areas of the state. The Dravidian leaders assessed that the scheme was a clever device to keep the Shudra and Panchama castes as illiterates or semi-literates. They dubbed C. Rajagopalachari's scheme as Castiest Education Plan (Kula Kalvi Thittam) and began to agitate under Periyar's leadership demanding its withdrawal. As a consequence, the Chief Minister had to resign in March 1954, and Kamaraj assumed office on 14 April. Kamaraj abolished the half-day-teaching scheme and assured Periyar that his Government would extend educational facilities to people in every nook and corner of the state.

Rajaji became the Chief Minister due to a constitutional impropriety in 1952. In the 1952 elections Congress Party was reduced to a minority in the State Assembly  But Governor Sri Prakasa nominated Rajaji to the Legislative Council without the advice of the council of ministers and the selection of a nominated member as Chief Minister and 
the further majority was obtained by luring opposition MLA<ref>

Dr. P. C. Alexander, himself a former [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Maharashtra]] governor, writes that the most conspicuous case of constitutional impropriety was the one by [[Sri Prakasa]] when he invited Rajagopalachari to form the government in the Madras state.

====Andhra statehood agitation====
During this time, freedom fighter [[Potti Sriramulu]] called for a separate state for Telugu speaking districts, to be named Andhra, and went on an unconditional fast until his goal was achieved. He died following complications that arose during the fast, and violent riots broke out in the [[Telugu people|Telugu]] areas of Madras State including [[Madras]] city. Jawaharlal Nehru who initially opposed to the idea of linguistic states, agreed to the demand after death of [[Potti Sriramulu]],  for separate state of Andhra. But the [[Madras Manade|demand that Madras]] city be included in the new state of Andhra was rejected.

It was alleged that Rajaji failed to intervene, either to break the fast or to provide medical help for Sriramulu, even though the fast had continued for over 50 days. On a side note, only one other person, [[Jatin Das]], before Sriramulu, in modern Indian history actually fasted to death. In most cases they either gave up, were hospitalised or arrested and force fed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822565-1,00.html | work=Time | title=INDIA: Fast & Win | date=29 December 1952 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>
The State of Andhra was carved out of the Madras State in 1953, Rajaji remained aloof from the Andhra State and related issues.<ref>

====Family vocation education policy====
Rajaji also  removed controls on foodgrains and introduced a new education policy based on family vocation. According to this policy students had to go to school in the morning and to compulsorily learn the family vocation practised by their parents, like carpentry, masonry,  etc. after school. It was severely opposed by [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] and [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] as casteist and dubbed [[Kula Kalvi Thittam]] (Hereditary Education Policy) by his close friend and political opponent [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] who vehemently opposed it. This policy was under attack this from within the Congress as well as outside it. This ultimately led to his resignation in 1954.<ref>[http://sify.com/news/politics/fullstory.php?id=13569138 What if Periyar had not been born? – Sify.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/periyar.htm Periyar E.V.Ramaswamy – பெரியார்<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.periyar.org/html/dk_movement_eng.asp |title=Periyar.org<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=8 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130222128/http://www.periyar.org/html/dk_movement_eng.asp |archive-date=30 January 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Kamaraj ===
{{Keralahistory}}
On 13 April 1954, K. Kamaraj became the chief minister of Madras State.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Committed to his version of "socialism" meaning that "those who are backward should progress", Kamaraj remained truthful to the simple dictum of his "socialism", providing "what is essential for man's living" such as "dwelling, job, food and education". The great feature of Kamaraj rule was the ending of the retrogressive educational policies and setting the stage for universal and free schooling.

====Cabinet reorganisation====
One of the first political acts of Kamaraj during his tenure as chief minister was to widen representation of the rising non-Brahmins in the cabinet, yet to everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and [[M. Bhakthavatsalam]], who had contested his leadership, 
Ministerial berths were given to other parties like Tamil Nadu Toilers Party and Commonwealth Party. In a move to counter Tamil cultural politics espoused by the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]], Kamaraj made conscious attempts to partake in the linguistic cultural matters. To placate Tamil aspirations, Kamaraj effected some measures.

====Language policy====
The efforts towards introducing Tamil language as a medium of instruction in schools and colleges was accompanied by the publication of textbooks on 'scientific and technical subjects' in Tamil. In 1960 the state education minister took steps to introduce Tamil in government arts colleges as a medium of instruction.

Similarly the usage of Tamil in the courts received encouragement. To affirm his role in the linguistic politics of the state, Kamaraj introduced a bill in February 1962 in the legislative assembly for changing the name of Madras to 'Tamil Nadu' for 'intrastate communication', the bill also proposing [[Madurai]] as the capital. But no decision was taken on it. The DMK would later make capital out of this, routing Congress in the 1967 elections four years after Kamaraj relinquished his office as chief minister in accordance with the Kamaraj Plan to concentrate on Congress organisational work.

====Education policy====
Kamaraj removed the family vocation–based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard and introduced the [[Mid-day Meal Scheme]] to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.indianyojana.com/shiksha-yojana/mid-day-meal-scheme.htm|title = Information About Mid-Day Meal Scheme India|date = |accessdate = 1 August 2015|website = Indian Yojana|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Almost every village within a radius of one mile with a population of 300 and above inhabitants was provided with a school. With a view to encouraging and attracting the rural poor children to the schools, Kamaraj pioneered a scheme of free mid-day meals for primary school children in panchayat and government institutions. This scheme, aided by the American voluntary organisation CARE, was launched in 1957. In addition the government came forward to supply school uniforms to poor students. To make the education easily accessible to children from various backgrounds, full exemption from school fees was introduced. Public enthusiasm and participation in raising funds and procuring equipment for the schools were entertained through different schemes making education a social responsibility. Such measures made education affordable for many who were denied basic educational opportunities for centuries.

====Electrification and industrial development====
Kamaraj's other feat was his role in facilitating developmental programmes chiefly electrification and industrial development. Thousands of villages were electrified. Rural electrification led to the large-scale use of pumpsets for irrigational purposes and agriculture-received impetus. Major irrigation schemes were planned in Kamaraj's period. Dams and irrigation canals were built across higher Bhavani, Mani Muthar, Aarani, Vaigai, Amaravathi, Sathanur, Krishnagiri, Pullambadi, Parambikulam and Neyyaru among others. The Malapuzha Dam at Palghat District was inaugurated by him as Chief Minister in 1955 (before Kerala was formed as a separate state in 1956). Large- and small-scale industries were flagged off generating employment opportunities. Kamaraj made the best use of the funds available through the Five-Year Plans and guided Tamil Nadu in deriving the maximum benefit.

=== M. Bhaktavatsalam Mudaliar ===
In 1962, the Indian National Congress won the [[1962 Madras Legislative Assembly election|Madras state elections]] and formed the government in the state for the fifth time in 25 years. Kamaraj became Chief Minister. It was his third tenure as Chief Minister (3 March 1962 – 2 October 1963). Later Kamaraj resigned his Chief Ministership to work for the Congress Party under the "KAMARAJ PLAN", wherein senior leaders were invited to do party work. Hence on 2 October 1963, Bhaktavatsalam took office as the chief minister of Madras as Kamaraj desired to spend more time serving the party.<ref name="chiefminister">{{cite web|title=List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu |url=http://www.tn.gov.in/tnassembly/cmlist-1920.htm |publisher=Government of Tamil Nadu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423150027/http://www.tn.gov.in/tnassembly/cmlist-1920.htm |archivedate=23 April 2013 }}</ref> Bhaktavatsalam is, till date, the last Chief Minister of Madras from the Indian National Congress.<ref name="lastcongresscm">{{cite news|work=The Hindu: Metro Plus|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/10/23/stories/2002102300090300.htm|date=23 October 2002|title=Playing host to wildlife|last=Muthiah|first=S.|authorlink=S.

As 26 January 1965, the day when the 15-year-long transition period recommended by the Indian Parliament came to an end, neared, the agitations intensified, leading to police action and casualties.<ref name="threelanguage2" /> Five of the agitators (Sivalingam, Aranganathan, Veerappan, Mutthu, and Sarangapani) immolated themselves while three others (Dandapani, Mutthu, and Shanmugam) consumed poison. One of the agitators, eighteen-year-old Rajendran, was killed on 27 January 1965 as a result of police firing.<ref name="languagedevotion" />

On 13 February 1965, Bhaktavatsalam claimed that the opposition [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] and the Left parties were responsible for the large-scale destruction of public property and violence during the anti-Hindi agitations of 1965.<ref name="antihindi_asianrecorder">{{cite book|title=Asian Recorder|publisher=K.
