'''Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒwɐˈkĩ mɐˈɾi.ɐ mɐˈʃadu dʒi ɐˈsis|lang}}), often known by his surnames as '''Machado de Assis''', ''Machado,'' or ''Bruxo do [[Cosme Velho]]''<ref name="vainfas3">Vainfas, p. 505.</ref> (21 June 1839 – 29 September 1908), was a pioneer [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] novelist, poet, playwright and short story writer, widely regarded as the greatest writer of [[Brazilian literature]].<ref>[[Antonio Candido|Candido; Antonio]] (1970), ''Vários escritos.'' São Paulo: Duas Cidades. p. 18.</ref><ref>Caldwell, Helen (1970), ''Machado de Assis: The Brazilian Master and his Novels.'' Berkeley, Los Angeles/London: University of California Press.</ref><ref>Fernandez, Oscar, "Machado de Assis: The Brazilian Master and His Novels", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (April 1971), pp. 255–256.</ref> Nevertheless, Assis did not achieve widespread popularity outside Brazil during his lifetime. In 1897 he founded and became the first President of the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]]. He was [[multilingualism|multilingual]], having [[autodidacticism|taught himself]] French, English, German and Greek in later life.

Born in Morro do Livramento, Rio de Janeiro from a poor, mixed race family, he barely studied in public schools and never attended university. With only his own intellect to rely on, and largely self-taught, he struggled to rise socially.  To do so, he took several public positions, passing through the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Public Works, and achieving early fame in newspapers where he published his first poetry and chronicles. 

Machado's works had a great influence on Brazilian literary schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1941, the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]] founded in his honor the [[Prêmio Machado de Assis]] (Machado de Assis Award), the most prestigious literary award in the country. For his innovation and audacity in early themes, Assis is often seen as a writer of unprecedented innovation, known for his irony and wide vocabulary. Generally considered to be Machado's greatest works are ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), ''[[Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas]]'' ("Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas", also translated as ''Epitaph of a Small Winner'') and ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' (also known in English as ''Philosopher or Dog?''). Machado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest{{Citation needed|reason=Where does Bloom say they are the greatest? He goes out of his way to say the authors he choose were a sample, not an exhaustive list|date=November 2020}} 100 geniuses of literature. Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in [[Western literature]].

==Biography==

===Birth and adolescence===
[[File:Morro do Livramento, onde Machado nasceu.jpg|thumb|left|Morro do Livramento. The arrow in the right corner shows the house where Machado was probably born and spent his childhood.]]
Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis was born on 21 June 1839 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], then capital of the [[Empire of Brazil]].<ref name="scarano14">Scarano, p. 766.</ref><ref name="vainfas5">Vainfas, p. 504.</ref><ref name="enciclop2">''Enciclopédia Barsa'', p. 267.</ref> His parents were Francisco José de Assis, a wall painter, the son of [[Slavery in Brazil|freed slaves]],<ref name="demografia">{{Cite web|url=https://www.livrariapublica.com.br/p/biografia-de-machado-de-assis.html|title=Machado de Assis |language= |author= |work= |date= |access-date=}}</ref> and Maria Leopoldina da Câmara Machado, an [[Azorean]] Portuguese washerwoman.<ref name="vainfas5" /><ref>Scarano, p. 765.</ref> He was born in Livramento country house, owned by ''Dona'' Maria José de Mendonça Barroso Pereira, widow of senator Bento Barroso Pereira, who protected his parents and allowed them to live with her.<ref name="scarano14" /><ref name="vainfas5" /> ''Dona'' Maria José became Joaquim's godmother; her brother-in-law, commendatory Joaquim Alberto de Sousa da Silveira, was his godfather, and both were paid homage by giving their names to the baby.<ref name="scarano14" /><ref name="vainfas5" /> Machado had a sister who died young.<ref name="enciclop2" /> Joaquim studied in a public school, but was not a good student.<ref name="scarano14" /> While helping to serve masses, he met Father Silveira Sarmento, who became his Latin teacher and also a good friend.<ref name="scarano14" /><ref name="vainfas5" />

When Joaquim was ten years old, his mother died, and his father took him along as he moved to [[São Cristóvão]]. Francisco de Assis met the [[mulatta]] Maria Inês da Silva, and they married in 1854.<ref name="scarano14" /><ref name="vainfas5" /><ref name="enciclop2" /> Joaquim had classes in a school for girls only, thanks to his stepmother who worked there making candies. At night he learned French with an immigrant baker.<ref name="scarano14" /> In his adolescence, he met the mulatto Francisco de Paulo Brito, who owned a bookstore, a newspaper and typography.<ref name="scarano14" /> On 12 January 1855, Francisco de Paula published the poem ''Ela'' ("Her") written by Joaquim, then 15 years old, in the newspaper ''Marmota Fluminense''.<ref name="scarano14" /><ref name="vainfas5" /><ref name="enciclop2" /> In the following year, he was hired as typographer's apprentice in the ''Imprensa Oficial'' (the Official Press, charged with the publication of Government measures), where he was encouraged as a writer by [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]], the newspaper's director and also a novelist.<ref name="scarano14" /> There he also met [[Francisco Otaviano]], journalist and later liberal senator, and [[Quintino Bocaiúva]], who decades later would become known for his role as a republican orator.<ref name="scarano15">Scarano, p. 767.</ref>

===Early career and education===
[[File:Imprensa Nacional onde trabalhou como tipógrafo, por Marc Ferrez.jpg|thumb|left|National Press, c.1880, where Machado de Assis began his services as typographer and reviser.]]
Francisco Otaviano hired Machado to work on the newspaper ''Correio Mercantil'' as a proofreader in 1858.<ref name="enciclop2" /><ref name="scarano15" /> He continued to write for the ''Marmota Fluminense'' and also for several other newspapers, but he did not earn much and had a humble life.<ref name="enciclop2" /><ref name="scarano15" /> As he did not live with his father anymore, it was common for him to eat only once a day for lack of money.<ref name="scarano15" />

Around this time, he became a friend of the writer and liberal politician [[José de Alencar]], who taught him English. From [[English literature]], he was influenced by [[Laurence Sterne]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Jonathan Swift]]. He learned German years later and in his old age, [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name="scarano15" /> He was invited by Bocaiúva to work at his newspaper ''Diário do Rio de Janeiro'' in 1860.<ref name="vainfas5" /><ref name="scarano16">Scarano, p. 769</ref> Machado had a passion for theater and wrote several plays for a short time; his friend Bocaiúva concluded: "Your works are meant to be read and not played."<ref name="scarano16" /> He gained some notability and began to sign his writings as J. M. Machado de Assis, the way he would be known for posterity: Machado de Assis.<ref name="scarano16" /> He established himself in advanced Liberal Party circles by taking stands in defense of religious freedom and [[Ernest Renan]]'s controversial ''Life of Jesus'' while attacking the venality of the clergy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Borges |first1=Dain |title=Mockery and Piety in Eça de Queirós and Machado de Assis |journal=Revista de Estudos Literários |date=2016 |volume=6 |page=97}}</ref>

[[File:Machado 25 anos.jpg|thumb|right|Machado de Assis when he was 25 years old, 1864.]]

His father Francisco de Assis died in 1864. Machado learned of his father's death through acquaintances. He dedicated his compilation of poems called "''Crisálidas''" to his father: "To the Memory of Francisco José de Assis and Maria Leopoldina Machado de Assis, my Parents."<ref name="scarano9">Scarano, p. 770.</ref> With the Liberal Party's ascension to power about that time, Machado thought he might receive a patronage position that would help him improve his life. To his surprise, aid came from the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]], who hired him as director-assistant in the ''Diário Oficial'' in 1867, and knighted him as an honor.<ref name="scarano9" /> In 1888 Machado was made an officer of the [[Order of the Rose]].<ref name="enciclop2" />

===Marriage and family===

In 1868 Machado met the Portuguese Carolina Augusta Xavier de Novais, five years older than him.<ref name="scarano9" /> She was the sister of his colleague Faustino Xavier de Novais, for whom he worked on the magazine ''O Futuro''.<ref name="enciclop2" /><ref name="scarano15" /> Machado had a stammer and was extremely shy, short and lean. He was also very intelligent and well learned.<ref name="scarano9" /> He married Carolina on 12 November 1869; although her parents Miguel and Adelaide, and her siblings disapproved because Machado was mulatto and she was of purely European ancestry.<ref name="vainfas5" /><ref name="scarano9" /> They had no children.<ref name=Scarano780>Scarano, p. 780.</ref>

===Literature===
[[File:MarcFerrez MachadodeAssis.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Machado de Assis around age 41, by [[Marc Ferrez (photographer)|Marc Ferrez]], c. 1880.]]
Machado managed to rise in his bureaucratic career, first in the Agriculture Department. Three years later, he became the head of a section in it.<ref name="vainfas5" /><ref name="scarano13">Scarano, p. 773.</ref> He published two poetry books: ''Falenas'', in 1870, and ''Americanas'', in 1875.<ref name="scarano13" /> Their weak reception made him explore other literary genres.

He wrote five [[Romanticism|romantic]] novels: ''[[Ressurreição]]'', ''[[A Mão e Luva]]'', ''[[Helena (Machado de Assis novel)|Helena]]'' and ''Iaiá Garcia''.<ref name="scarano13" /> The books were a success with the public, but literary critics considered them mediocre.<ref name="scarano13" /> Machado suffered repeated attacks of [[epilepsy]], apparently related to hearing of the death of his old friend José de Alencar. He was left [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]], pessimistic and fixed on death.<ref>Scarano, pp. 774–774.</ref> His next book, marked by "a skeptical and [[Literary realism|realistic]] tone": ''[[Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas]]'' (Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas, also translated as ''Epitaph of a Small Winner''), is widely considered a masterpiece.<ref name="scarano10">Scarano, p. 774.</ref> By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.<ref name="enciclop2" />

Although he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public.<ref name="scarano13" /><ref name="daniel3">Daniel, pp. 61–152.</ref> He avoided discussing politics.<ref name="scarano10" /><ref name="daniel3" /> He was criticized by the [[slavery in Brazil|abolitionist]] [[José do Patrocínio]] and by the writer [[Lima Barreto]] for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition.<ref name="vainfas3" /><ref name="daniel3" /> He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman.<ref name="vainfas3" /> Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889.<ref name="scarano10" /> Machado had no sympathy towards [[republicanism]],<ref name="scarano10" /> as he considered himself a liberal [[monarchism|monarchist]]<ref name="bueno1">Bueno, p. 310.</ref> and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as "a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect."<ref>Vainfas, p. 201: "Machado de Assis, porém, soube definí-lo em rápidos traços: um homem lhano, probo, instruído, patriota, que soube fazer do sólio uma poltrona, sem lhe diminuir a grandeza e a consideração."</ref> When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: "The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order."<ref name="scarano10" />

The birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time.<ref>Bueno, p. 311.</ref> From then on, he wrote "not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature."<ref name="bueno1" /> Works such as ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' ''(Philosopher or Dog?)'' (1891), ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), ''Esaú e Jacó'' (1904) and ''Memorial de Aires'' (1908), considered masterpieces,<ref name="bueno1" /> were successes with both critics and the public.<ref>Scarano, p. 777.</ref> In 1893 he published "A Missa do Galo" ("Midnight Mass"), considered his greatest short story.<ref>Scarano, p. 775.</ref>

===Later years===
[[File:Enterro de Machado de Assis 2 (1908).jpg|thumb|Students and friends, among them Euclides da Cunha, leave the Academy carrying the coffin of Machado de Assis to the Cemetery St. John the Baptist, 1908.]]
Machado de Assis, along with fellow [[monarchist]]s such as [[Joaquim Nabuco]], [[Manuel de Oliveira Lima]], [[Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto]] and [[Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay]], and other writers and intellectuals, founded the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]]. He was its first president, from 1897 to 1908, when he died.<ref name="vainfas3" /><ref name="enciclop2" /> For many years, he requested that the government grant a proper headquarters to the Academy, which he managed to obtain in 1905.<ref name="scarano11">Scarano, p. 778.</ref> In 1902 he was transferred to the accountancy's directing board of the [[Brazilian Ministry of Industry|Ministry of Industry]].<ref name="scarano11" />

His wife Carolina Novais died on 20 October 1904, after 35 years of a "perfect married life".<ref name="vainfas3" /><ref name="scarano11" /><ref>''Enciclopédia Barsa'', p. 267: "vida conjugal perfeita".</ref> Feeling depressed and lonely, Machado died on 29 September 1908.<ref name=Scarano780 />

==Narrative style==
[[File:Memorias Posthumas de Braz Cubas.jpg|thumb|left|Volume of [[The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas]] dedicated by the author himself to the [[National Library of Brazil]].]]
Machado's style is unique, and several [[literary critic]]s have tried to describe it since 1897.<ref>Romero, Silvio (1897), ''Machado de Assis: Estudo Comparativo da Literatura Brasileira'', Rio de Janeiro: Laemmert.</ref> He is considered by many the greatest Brazilian writer of all time, and one of the world's greatest novelists and short story writers. His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of [[Augusto dos Anjos]], another Brazilian writer.
Machado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]. Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in Western literature; this is based on United States's conceptions of race, which are [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|not the same in Brazil]],<ref>Daniel, pp. 10–76.</ref> where he is considered [[mulato]].<ref name="Daniel0">Daniel (2012): "As a mulatto, Machado experienced the ambiguity of racial identity throughout his life."</ref>

His works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), [[Helen Caldwell]] (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B. Dixon (US), Keith Ellis (US), [[Edith Fowke]] (Canada), [[Anatole France]] (France), Richard Graham (US), Pierre Hourcade (France), David Jackson (US), G. Reginald Daniel (US), Linda Murphy Kelley (US), John C. Kinnear, Alfred Mac Adam (US), Victor Orban (France), [[Daphne Patai]] (US), Houwens Post (Italy), [[Samuel Putnam]] (US), John Hyde Schmitt, Tony Tanner (England), Jack E. Tomlins (US), Carmelo Virgillo (US), Dieter Woll (Germany) and [[Susan Sontag]] (US).<ref>Susan Sontag, Foreword. ''Epitaph of a Small Winner''. By J. M. Machado de Assis. Trans. William Grossman. New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 1990. xi–xxiv.</ref>

Critics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality—but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as "Romantic Realism."<ref name="daniel2">Daniel, pp. 190–237.</ref> In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an exposé of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil.<ref>Daniel, pp. 153–218.</ref> Schwarz,  argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.<ref name="daniel2" />

Machado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the ''Comissão Machado de Assis'' ("Machado de Assis Commission"), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages. Great 20th-century writers such as [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Cabrera Infante]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]], as well as the American film director [[Woody Allen]], have expressed their enthusiasm for his fiction.<ref name=rocha>{{cite journal |first=João Cezar de Castro |last=Rocha |url=http://www.plcs.umassd.edu/pdfs/plcs13_14_intro.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625042658/http://www.plcs.umassd.edu/pdfs/plcs13_14_intro.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |title=Introduction |journal=Portuguese Literature and Cultural Studies |volume=13/14 |year=2006 |pages=xxiv }}</ref> Despite the efforts and patronage of such well-known intellectuals as [[Susan Sontag]], [[Harold Bloom]], and [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]], Machado's books—the most famous of which are available in English in multiple translations—have never achieved large sales in the English-speaking world and he continues to be relatively unknown, even in comparison with other Latin American writers.

In his works, Machado appeals directly to the reader, breaking the so-called [[fourth wall]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
