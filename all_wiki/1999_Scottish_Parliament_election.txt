The '''first election to the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]]''', to fill 129 seats, took place on 6 May 1999. Following the election, the [[Scottish Labour|Labour Party]] and the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] formed the [[Scottish Executive]], with Labour [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP)]] [[Donald Dewar]] becoming [[First Minister]].

The Scottish Parliament was created after a [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum on devolution]] took place on 11 September 1997 in which 74.3% of those who voted approved the idea. The [[Scotland Act 1998|Scotland Act (1998)]] was then passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] which established the devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive. The parliament was elected using [[Mixed member proportional representation]], combining 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions 1999 to 2011|(First-past-the-post) constituencies]]<ref group = "note">The same constituency boundaries were used as in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]] with the exception of [[Orkney (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Orkney]] and [[Shetland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Shetland]], which were made into separate constituencies.</ref> and [[proportional representation]] with the 73 constituencies being grouped together to make [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions 1999 to 2011|eight regions]] each electing seven [[Member of Scottish Parliament|additional members]] to make a total of 129. This meant that it would be unlikely for any party to gain a majority of seats in the new parliament and either [[minority government|minority]] or [[coalition]] Scottish Executives would have to be formed.

The first general election to the [[Scottish Parliament]] overall produced few surprises with the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] still enjoying high popularity following their landslide victory in the 1997 UK general election as widely expected was the largest party winning 56 seats, mostly in their traditional [[Central Belt]] heartlands, which was nine seats short of an overall majority. Labour formed a coalition government with the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]], who won 17 seats. The [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) had done well in opinion polls running up to the election, gaining 40% in some approval ratings, but this level of support was not maintained. The SNP were the second largest party with 35 seats, which still represented their best performance since the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 UK general election]]. The [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative Party]], still recovering from their wipeout in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 UK general election]] across [[Scotland]], failed to win a single [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituency]] seat but did manage to win 18 seats through the Additional Member System.

The [[Scottish Socialist Party|Scottish Socialist Party (SSP)]] and the [[Scottish Green Party|Greens]] picked up unexpected [[additional member system|additional member]] seats. [[Robin Harper]] became the first ever elected Green parliamentarian in the history of the United Kingdom. [[Dennis Canavan]], who had failed to become an approved Labour candidate, won the [[Falkirk West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]] constituency as an independent candidate.

Following the election the new parliament met in the [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland]] in Edinburgh for the first time on Wednesday 12 May 1999 although the actual [[devolution]] of powers from [[Houses of Parliament|Westminster]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]] did not take place until midnight on Thursday 1 July 1999, almost two months later.
