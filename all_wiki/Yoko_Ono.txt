'''Yoko Ono Lennon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n|oʊ}} {{respell|OH|noh}}; {{lang-ja|小野 洋子|Ono Yōko}}, <small>usually spelled in [[katakana]]</small> {{lang|ja|オノ・ヨーコ}}; born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese [[multimedia]] artist, singer, songwriter and [[peace activist]]. Her work also encompasses [[performance art]], which she performs in both English and Japanese, and filmmaking.<ref name="my.entertainment.yahoo.com">{{cite news|url=http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|title=Yoko Ono retrospective opens in Frankfurt|date=February 16, 2013|publisher=Yahoo Malaysia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912052307/http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|archivedate=September 12, 2013|access-date=February 16, 2013}}</ref> She was married to English singer-songwriter [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]] from 1969 until [[Murder of John Lennon|his murder]] in 1980.

Ono grew up in Tokyo and moved to [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1953 to live with her family. She became involved in New York City's downtown artists scene, which included the [[Fluxus]] group. With their [[Performance art|performance]] [[Bed-In|''Bed-Ins for Peace'']] in Amsterdam and [[Montreal]] in 1969, Ono and Lennon used their honeymoon at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]] as a stage for public [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. The [[feminist]] themes of her music have influenced musicians as diverse as the [[B-52s]] and [[Meredith Monk]]. She achieved commercial and critical acclaim in 1980 with the chart-topping album ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before his murder.

==Early life and family==
Ono was born on February 18, 1933, in [[Tokyo City]], to {{nihongo|Isoko Ono|小野 磯子|Ono Isoko}} and {{nihongo|Eisuke Ono|小野 英輔|Ono Eisuke}}, a wealthy banker and former [[classical pianist]].<ref name="allmusicB">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|title=Yoko Ono: biography|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130101749/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|archivedate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Isoko's maternal grandfather {{nihongo|[[Zenjiro Yasuda]]|安田 善次郎|Yasuda Zenjirō}} was an affiliate of the [[Yasuda clan]] and [[Yasuda zaibatsu|zaibatsu]]. Eisuke came from a long line of [[samurai]] warrior-scholars.<ref name=Stan/> The [[kanji]] translation of [[Yoko (name)|''Yōko'']] ({{lang|ja|洋子}}) means "ocean child".<ref name="allmusicB"/><ref name=nme/>

Two weeks before Ono's birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco by his employer, the [[Yokohama Specie Bank]].<ref name="sayle"/> The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono meeting her father when she was two.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=Yoko Ono – Charts & Awards – Billboard Singles|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-p19685/charts-awards/billboard-singles|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 12, 2014}}</ref> Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936. Ono was enrolled in [[piano lesson]]s from the age of 4.<ref name=MH231>{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=231}}</ref> In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan, and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's elite [[Gakushūin]] (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan.<ref name="sayle"/>

The family moved to New York City in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to [[Hanoi]], and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the [[Mitsui]] family. She remained in Tokyo throughout [[World War II]] and the great [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|fire-bombing of March 9, 1945]], during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special [[bunker]] in Tokyo's [[Azabu]] district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] [[mountain resort]] with members of her family.<ref name="sayle"/>

Starvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family was forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings in a wheelbarrow. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her "aggressive" attitude and understanding of "outsider" status. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods to the countryside, where they were [[barter]]ed for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made [[sewing machine]] for {{convert|60|kg}} of rice to feed the family.<ref name="sayle"/> During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a [[POW camp|prisoner of war camp]] in China. However, unbeknownst to them, he remained in the city. Ono told [[Amy Goodman]] of ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' on October 16, 2007, that "He was in [[French Indochina]], which is Vietnam actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|title=EXCLUSIVE: Yoko Ono on the New Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, Art & Politics, the Peace Movement, Government Surveillance and the Murder of John Lennon|last=Goodman|first=Amy|date=October 16, 2007|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|access-date=February 25, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222184454/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|archivedate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>

By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the [[Kōkyo|Tokyo Imperial Palace]], had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of [[Akihito|Prince Akihito]], the future [[emperor of Japan]].<ref name="allmusicB"/><ref name=Stan/> She graduated in 1951 and was accepted into the philosophy program of [[Gakushuin University]] as the first woman to enter the department.

==New York City==
===College and downtown beginnings===
After the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the United States and settled in [[Scarsdale, New York]], an affluent town 25 miles north of [[midtown Manhattan]]. When Ono later rejoined her family in 1953, she enrolled at nearby [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. Ono's parents approved of her college choice but she said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people that they felt were beneath her.

[[File:112 Chambers St jeh.jpg|thumb|237px|112 Chambers Street, the location of Ono's 1960s loft where [[Fluxus]] events took place.]]

In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited [[Art galleries|galleries]] and art [[happening]]s in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American [[avant-garde]] artist, composer, and musician [[La Monte Young]] was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] loft in [[Tribeca]] as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor [[John Cage]] advised her to treat the paper with [[flame retardant]].<ref name="Stan">{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|title=Yoko Ono to speak at Stanford, Stanford Report|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Stanford University|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112012256/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|archivedate=November 12, 2013}}</ref>

===Return to Japan, early career, and motherhood===
In 1956, Ono left college to [[elope]] with Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]],<ref name=Stan/><ref name=BioA>{{cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=biography.com|access-date=February 14, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080529/http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|archivedate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> a star in Tokyo's experimental community.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=23}} After living apart for several years, they filed for divorce in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents and was suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] when she was briefly placed into a Japanese [[mental institution]].<ref name="allmusicB"/><ref name=BioChannel>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|title=Yoko Ono Biography|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213213142/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|archivedate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>

Later that year, on November 28, 1962, Ono married [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]], an American jazz musician, film producer, and art promoter who was instrumental in securing her release from the institution.<ref name="Stan" /> Ono's second marriage was [[annullment|annulled]] on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later, on August 8, 1963.<ref name="allmusicB" />

The marriage quickly fell apart, but the Coxes stayed together for the sake of their joint careers. They performed at Tokyo's [[Sogetsu]] Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko's parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her publicity.

Ono and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. During a 1971 [[custody battle]], Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use.<ref name="BioChannel" /> Ono's ex-husband changed Kyoko's name to "Ruth Holman" and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the [[The Living Word Fellowship|Church of the Living Word]] (or "the Walk").<ref>{{cite book|last=Hockinson|first=Michael J.|title=The Ultimate Beatles Quiz Book|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She finally saw Kyoko again in 1998.<ref name="BioChannel" />

==Marriage==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2020}}
Ono married four times to three different people. She was married to Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]] from 1956 until they divorced in 1962. Her marriage with the producer [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]] lasted from 1962 to 1968, with a brief hiatus in 1963. In 1969, she married John Lennon, whom she had met in 1966 at her own [[art exhibition]] in London. She has a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from her marriage to Anthony Cox and a son, [[Sean Lennon|Sean Taro Ono Lennon]], from her marriage to Lennon.

As Lennon's widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded the [[Strawberry Fields memorial]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]], the [[Imagine Peace Tower]] in Iceland, and the [[John Lennon Museum]] in [[Saitama (city)|Saitama]], Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, [[peace]], disaster relief in Japan and the Philippines, and other causes. In 2012, Ono received the Dr. [[Rainer Hildebrandt]] Human Rights Award. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, nonviolent commitment to human rights. Ono continued her social activism when she inaugurated a biennial $50,000 [[LennonOno Grant for Peace]] in 2002. She also co-founded the group [[Artists Against Fracking]] in 2012.

==John Lennon==

[[Fluxus]], a loose association of [[Dada]]-inspired [[avant-garde]] artists that developed in the early 1960s, was active in New York and Europe.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=27}} Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist [[Gustav Metzger]]'s Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966. She was the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=168}}

Her first contact with a member of [[the Beatles]] was when she visited [[Paul McCartney]] at his home in London to obtain a Lennon–McCartney song manuscript for a book [[John Cage]] was working on, ''[[Notations]]''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=246}} McCartney declined to give her any of his manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=246}} Lennon later gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}

Ono and Lennon first met on November 9, 1966 at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where she was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=682}} Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece, ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]'', had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he looked through the spyglass and saw the word "YES" which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was "anti" everything.<ref name=HSW>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|title=John Lennon: John Lennon Meets Yoko Ono|last=Buskin|first=Richard|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|access-date=April 17, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427092641/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|archivedate=April 27, 2014}}</ref>

Lennon was also intrigued by Ono's ''Hammer a Nail''. Viewers hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it." Ono supposedly had not heard of the Beatles, but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five [[shilling (British coin)|shillings]], to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."<ref name="HSW" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2000}}</ref>

In a 2002 interview, she said, "I was very attracted to him. It was a really strange situation."<ref name="Scot" /> The two began corresponding and, in September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono's solo show at [[Lisson Gallery]] in London.<ref name="RS" /> When Lennon's wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]] asked for an explanation of why Ono was telephoning them at home, he told her that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her "avant-garde bullshit".{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=683}}

In early 1968, while the Beatles were making their visit to India, Lennon wrote the song "[[Julia (The Beatles song)|Julia]]" and included a reference to Ono: "Ocean child calls me", referring to the translation of Yoko's Japanese spelling.<ref name="nme">{{cite book|chapter="Brought to Book", 31 July 1971 interview with Alan Smith|title=Uncut Presents NME Originals Beatles-The Solo Years|year=2010|page=42}}</ref> In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit.

On September 24 and 25, 1968, Lennon wrote and recorded "[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]",<ref>Spizer, Bruce, ''The Beatles on Apple Records'', 498 Productions, {{ISBN|0-9662649-4-0}}, 2003, pp. 107–108</ref> which contains sexual references to Ono.

===Bed-Ins and other early collaborations===

[[Hilton Amsterdam]], March 1969]]
During the final two years of the Beatles, Lennon and Ono created and attended public [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. On March 20, 1969, they were married at the registry office in [[Gibraltar]] and spent their honeymoon in [[Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country.<ref>Kruse, Robert J.

Lennon later stated his regrets about feeling "guilty enough to give [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]] credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me."<ref>Norman, Philip, John Lennon: The Life, 2008, Doubleday Canada, p. 608, {{ISBN|978-0-385-66100-3}}</ref> The couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in "[[bagism]]", first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they [[satire|satirised]] prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]".<ref>Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1992, p. 550</ref>

During the Amsterdam Bed In press conference, Yoko also earned controversy in the Jewish community for claiming during the press conference that, "If I was a Jewish girl in Hitler’s day, I would approach him and become his girlfriend. After 10 days in bed, he would come to my way of thinking. This world needs communication. And making love is a great way of communicating."<ref name=sexnotcoolhere>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/yoko-ono-if-only-hitler-had-sex-with-jewish-women/|title=Yoko Ono: If Only Hitler Had Sex With Jewish Women|first=Jonathan|last=Mark|website=The Times of Israel}}</ref> It was acknowledged that some Nazis, including Nazi "First Lady" [[Magda Goebbels]], had Jewish lovers at one point in their lives.<ref name=sexnotcoolhere />

Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on April 22, 1969, switching out ''Winston'' for ''Ono'' as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon after that, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.<ref>Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1984b, p. 64</ref> The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire]], in southeast England.<ref name="PNorman">Norman, Philip, John Lennon The Life, Hammersmith, England: Harper Collins, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-00-719741-5}}, p. 615 et seq</ref> When Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last recorded album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.<ref>Emerick, Massey, 2006, pp. 279–80</ref>

The two artists collaborated on many albums, beginning in 1968 when Lennon was still a Beatle, with ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'', an album of experimental [[musique concrète]]. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental piece to ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' called "[[Revolution 9]]". Also on ''The White Album'', Ono contributed backing vocals on "[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]",<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibron|first=Bill|url=http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|title=An in-depth Look at the Songs on Side-Three|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=The White Album Project|date=December 21, 1968|access-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113003559/http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|archivedate=January 13, 2014}}</ref> and one line of lead vocals on "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]".

Ono influenced Lennon to produce more "autobiographical" output. After "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", they decided it would be better to form their own band rather than put the material out under the Beatles name.<ref>[[Ian MacDonald|McDonald, Ian]], ''[[Revolution in the Head]]'', 3rd ed., Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55652-733-3}}, 1556527330</ref> In 1969, the Plastic Ono Band's first album, ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', was recorded during the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] festival.

Ono released her first solo album, ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]'', in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and [[free jazz]] techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included [[Ornette Coleman]], other renowned [[free jazz]] performers, and [[Ringo Starr]]. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence [[Meredith Monk]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|title=Women in Music: Trailblazing Female Singers, Songwriters and Musicians|publisher=makers.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025326/http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|archivedate=February 3, 2014}}</ref> and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise instead of words.

When Lennon was invited to play with [[Frank Zappa]] at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore]] (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them.<ref>Liner notes to Disc 2, ''Sometime in New York City'' album.</ref> Later that year, she released ''[[Fly (Yoko Ono album)|Fly]]'', a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional [[psychedelic rock]] with tracks including "Midsummer New York" and "Mind Train", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments. She also received minor airplay with the ballad "[[Mrs. Lennon]]". The track "[[Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)|Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)]]" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Beatles: An illustrated record|page=83|year=1978|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53367-7|author1=Carr, R.|author2=Tyler, T.|name-list-style=amp}}</ref> and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In 1971, while studying with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in [[Majorca]], Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from the kindergarten. They reached an out of court agreement and the charges were dismissed. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko.<ref>''Kyoko'' (2018), documentary by Marcos Cabotá. Far Visuals.

Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)|Happy Christmas (War Is Over)]]" when Yoko whispers "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, "Happy Christmas, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]]."<ref>Jackson, Andrew Grant.

In a 2018 issue of ''[[Portland Magazine]]'', editor [[Colin Sargent|Colin W. Sargent]] writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine, in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. "We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water… We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don't really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful."<ref>Sargent, Colin W. "Imagine".

===Separation and reconciliation===
After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then moved permanently to [[Manhattan]] to escape perceived tabloid racism towards Ono.<ref name="TA">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|title=John Lennon's power for the people|date=February 2, 2010|last=Ali|first=Tariq|newspaper=The Guardian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109115346/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|archivedate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Their relationship became strained because Lennon was facing deportation due to drug charges that had been filed against him in England, and because of Ono's separation from her daughter.

By December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, Lennon failed to return home or call Pang. When she telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=700-01}}

Ono and Lennon's son, [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], was born on October 9, 1975, Lennon's 35th birthday. John did not help relations with his first son when he described [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] in 1980 as being part of the "ninety percent of the people on this planet [who resulted from an unplanned pregnancy]" and that "Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference." He said, "I don't love Julian any less as a child.

===Lennon's murder, tributes, and memorials===
{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}
[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|left|Lennon and Ono in 1980, shortly before his murder]]Following Sean's birth in 1975, Lennon took a hiatus from the music industry and became a [[SAHD|stay-at-home dad]] to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 [[Death of John Lennon|murder]], which Ono witnessed at close range. She stated the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but decided to return to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Lennon Remembered|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|publisher=CBS News|date=December 8, 2005|last=Dakss|first=Brian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426211600/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|archivedate=April 26, 2014}}</ref> Following her husband's murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|title=Yoko Ono headlining shows for Japan relief efforts|publisher=On the Red Carpet|last=Allin|first=Olivia|date=March 27, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106130956/http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|archivedate=November 6, 2013|access-date=October 31, 2013}}</ref>

Ono funded the construction and maintenance of the [[Strawberry Fields memorial]] in Manhattan's [[Central Park]], directly across from the [[The Dakota|Dakota Apartments]], which was the scene of the murder and remains Ono's residence to this day. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday. In 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant [[Jeff Pollack (Media Consultant)|Jeff Pollack]] to honor what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]. Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.<ref>{{cite news|title=Worldwide Broadcast Planned in Honor of Lennon's 50th Birthday|newspaper=The Tufts Daily|date=October 5, 1990|page=3}}</ref>

In 2000, she founded the [[John Lennon Museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], Japan. In March 2002, she was present with [[Cherie Blair]] at the unveiling of a seven-foot statue of Lennon to mark the renaming of [[Liverpool]] airport to [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]].<ref name=Scot/> (Julian and Cynthia Lennon were present at the unveiling of the [[John Lennon Peace Monument]] next to [[ACC Liverpool]] in the same city eight years later.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/a-monument-in-the-life|title=A Monument in the Life|author=Steve Hochman, National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221185840/http://www.grammy.com/news/a-monument-in-the-life|archivedate=February 21, 2014}}
</ref> On October 9, 2007, she dedicated a new memorial called the [[Imagine Peace Tower]], located on the island of [[Viðey]], 1&nbsp;km outside the Skarfabakki harbour in [[Reykjavík]], Iceland. Each year, between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light high into the sky. In 2009, Ono created an exhibit called "John Lennon: The New York City Years" for the NYC [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon's life in New York. A portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by Lennon and Ono.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespiritfoundation.com|title=Spirit Foundation|access-date=January 31, 2014}}</ref>

Every time Lennon's killer [[Mark David Chapman]] has a parole hearing – which is mandated by law every two years – Ono has come out strongly against his release from prison.

===Fluxus===
Ono is often associated with the [[Fluxus]] group, which was founded by Lithuanian-American artist [[George Maciunas]]. Maciunas admired and enthusiastically promoted her work and gave Ono her first solo exhibition at his AG Gallery in New York in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newhall|first=Edith|title=A Long and Winding Road|work=ARTnews|date=October 2000|page=163}}</ref> However, she did collaborate with him,{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=40-41}} [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[George Brecht]], and the poet [[Jackson Mac Low]], among others associated with the group.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

After Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown [[Manhattan]] at 112 [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] and used the apartment as a studio and living space. Ono supported herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the [[Japan Society of New York|Japan Society]], and she allowed composer [[La Monte Young]] to organize concerts in the loft.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}} They both held a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961;<ref name=MH232/> the events were attended by people such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]].<ref name=MH21>{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=21}}</ref> Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kotz|first=Liz|author-link=Liz Kotz|title=Post-Cagean Aesthetics and the "Event" Score|journal=October|volume=95|date=Winter 2001|jstor=779200|pages=55–89 [56]}}</ref> with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including ''Painting to Be Stepped On'', a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.<ref name=MH21/>

Ono is credited for the album cover art for ''Nirvana Symphony'' by [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]] (Time Records, 1962).

In 2000, Yoko Ono installed the sculpture ''Tajo'' in a happening in the [[Museo Vostell Malpartida]] of the German Fluxus artist [[Wolf Vostell]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=History of the Museo Vostell Marpartida (official homepage)|url=http://museovostell.gobex.es/25aniversario.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624013851/http://museovostell.gobex.es/25aniversario.htm|archive-date=June 24, 2018|access-date=June 21, 2020|website=museovostell.gobex.es}}</ref> Even before the happening, a painting by Yoko Ono was permanently exhibited in the Fluxus collection of the Italian Fluxus collector [[Gino Di Maggio]] in the museum.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Fluxus Collection donated by Gino Di Maggio (official homepage Museo Vostell Marpartida)|url=http://museovostell.gobex.es/coleccion2.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222094520/http://museovostell.gobex.es/coleccion2.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2020|access-date=June 21, 2020|website=museovostell.gobex.es}}</ref>

===''Cut Piece'', 1964===
Ono was a pioneer of [[conceptual art]] and performance art. A seminal performance work is ''Cut Piece'', first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref name=MH158>{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=158}}</ref> The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965 and London's [[Africa Centre, London|Africa Center]] as part of the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phelan|first1=Peggy|editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Cornelia|editor1-link=WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution|title=The Returns of Touch: Feminist Performances, 1960–80|date=2007|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art|location=Los Angeles|page=350}}</ref> Of the piece, John Hendricks wrote in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective: "[''Cut Piece''] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model{{nbsp}}... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art."<ref name="MH158" />

Other performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and John Hendricks.<ref name="MH158" /> Ono reprised the piece in Paris in 2003, in the low [[post-9/11]] period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is "a time where we need to trust each other".<ref name="Stan" /> In 2013, the Canadian singer, [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]] reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the [[Southbank Centre]] in London, which Ono curated.<ref name="guML">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|last=Empire|first=Kitty|title=Yoko Ono's Meltdown – review|date=June 22, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231011026/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|archivedate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>

===''Grapefruit'' book, 1964===
{{main|Grapefruit (book)}}

Ono's small book titled ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' is another seminal piece of conceptual art. First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies." ''Grapefruit'' has been published several times, most widely distributed by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. [[:de:David Bourdon|David Bourdon]], art critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', called ''Grapefruit'' "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s". He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like [[Joseph Kosuth]] and [[Lawrence Weiner]] came in and "did virtually the same things" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.<ref name=Whit/>

Ono would enact many of the book's scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized [[retrospective exhibition]], ''This Is Not Here'' in 1971 at the [[Everson Museum]] in [[Syracuse, New York]],<ref name="Grove">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&q=596|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Joan M.

===Experimental films, 1964–72===
Ono was also an [[experimental filmmaker]] who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply ''No. 4'', often referred to as ''Bottoms''.<ref name=BioB>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|title=Yoko Ono Biography: Films|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100643/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|archivedate=February 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=ICA/> The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the [[gluteal cleft]] and the [[horizontal gluteal crease]].

Another example of Ono's participatory art was her ''Wish Tree'' project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 ''Wish Piece'' had the following instructions:

:Make a wish
:Write it down on a piece of paper
:Fold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree
:Ask your friends to do the same
:Keep wishing
:Until the branches are covered with wishes.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=294}}

=== ''Arising'', 2015 ===
In 2015, Ono created the piece ''Arising'' in [[Venice]]. As part of the exhibition ''Personal Structures'', organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the [[European Cultural Centre]]'s [[Palazzo Bembo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|title=WM {{!}} whitehot magazine of contemporary art {{!}} June 2013: Yoko Ono: Arising a call for Women – the Whitehot Magazine Interview|website=Whitehotmagazine.com|access-date=July 11, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150417/https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|archivedate=January 13, 2018}}</ref> In this feminist work of art, female [[silicon]] bodies were burnt in the [[Venetian lagoon]], evoking the imagery of mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenixes]]. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record ''Rising'' and this piece, Ono responded: "''Rising'' was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope ''Arising'' will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/?p=15615|title=Sarah Gold and Karlyn De Jongh Talk with Yoko Ono – NY Arts Magazine|date=January 31, 2014|work=NY Arts Magazine|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

===''Refugee Boat'', 2019===
Participating in Lower Manhattan's River to River Festival in 2019, Ono presented her participatory installation ''Add Color (Refugee Boat)'' (1960/2019). The work comprises a white room with a white rowing boat in it, which were both covered by messages and drawings from members of the audience throughout the festival. Through the participatory nature of the work, the artist emphasised the need for solidarity and the history of immigrants and refugees in the United States. ''Refugee Boat'' belongs to Ono's ‘Add Color Painting’ series, first enacted in 1960, which invites the audience to make marks over the designated objects, often white.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ocula.com/artists/yoko-ono/|title=Yoko Ono|last=Paik|first=Sherry|website=Ocula}}</ref>

In 1989, the [[Whitney Museum]] held a [[retrospective]] of her work, ''Yoko Ono: Objects, Films'', marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono's live-in companion at the time, interior decorator [[Sam Havadtoy]], she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. "I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way – solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified."<ref name=Whit>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Taylor|author-link=Paul Taylor (art critic)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Yoko Ono's New Bronze Age at the Whitney|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1989|access-date=January 31, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113183517/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|archivedate=November 13, 2013}}</ref>

==Musical career==
===Early career===
Ono studied piano from the age of 4 to 12 or 13. She attended [[kabuki]] performances with her mother, who was trained in [[shamisen]], [[koto (instrument)|koto]], [[otsuzumi]], [[kotsuzumi]], [[nagauta]], and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in [[lieder]]-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with [[Alastair Reid]], [[English literature]] with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the [[Vienna|Viennese]]-trained André Singer.<ref name=MH231/> Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the [[twelve tone technique|twelve-tone composers]] [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]. She said, "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'"

===1980s===
In early 1980, John Lennon heard [[Lene Lovich]] and [[the B-52's]]' "[[Rock Lobster]]" while on vacation in Bermuda.

On the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were in the [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studio]] and working on Ono's song "Walking on Thin Ice". When they returned to The Dakota (their home in Manhattan), Lennon was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot dead]] by [[Mark David Chapman]], a fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. "Walking on Thin Ice (For John)" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at No. 58 and gaining significant underground airplay. In 1981, she released the album ''[[Season of Glass (album)|Season of Glass]]'', which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the [[liner notes]] to ''Season of Glass'', Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because "he would have been offended—he was one of us." The album received highly favorable reviews<ref name="allmusic"/> and reflected the public's mood after Lennon's assassination.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/season-of-glass-r46036 AllMusic Season of Glass Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218232922/http://www.allmusic.com/album/season-of-glass-r46036 |date=December 18, 2010 }}.

Ono's final album of the 1980s was ''[[Starpeace]]'', a [[concept album]] that she intended as an antidote to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" [[National missile defense|missile defense system]]. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. ''Starpeace'' became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort. The single "[[Hell in Paradise]]" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Hot 100, and the video, directed by [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] received major airplay on MTV and won "Most Innovative Video" at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI::FILM AND VIDEO AWARD|url=http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|work=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI|access-date=July 26, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723194533/http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011}}</ref> In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for ''Starpeace'', primarily visiting Eastern European countries.<ref name=RS/>

For many years, Ono was frequently criticized by both the press and the public.

Her name still connotes the figure of the evil female interloper to the mainstream.

Lennon and Ono were injured in a car accident in June 1969, partway through recording ''[[Abbey Road]]''. According to journalist [[Barry Miles]], a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=552}} Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members.

While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as [[Lennon–McCartney]] regardless of whether the song was a [[collaboration]] or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, ''Please Please Me'', which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called ''[[Wings over America]]'', which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|title=Talking Point &#124; Lennon-McCartney: Who do you give credit to?|work=BBC News|date=December 23, 2002|access-date=April 18, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407163230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|archivedate=April 7, 2012}}</ref>{{clarify|date=August 2020|reason=unclear referent; primarily written by Lennon or McCartney?}} but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making "an attempt to rewrite history".<ref name="billboard_controversy"/>

In a ''Rolling Stone'' interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the disintegration of the band.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|title=Yoko Ono Blames Paul McCartney for the Beatles' Breakup?|last=Vultaggio|first=Maria|date=December 29, 2012|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231180229/http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|archivedate=December 31, 2012}}</ref> On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, ''[[Lennon Legend]]'', the composer credit of "Give Peace a Chance" was changed to "John Lennon" from its original composing credit of "Lennon–McCartney". Although Lennon wrote the song during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the "Plastic Ono Band" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song.<ref name=PN/> In 2002, McCartney released another live album, ''[[Back in the U.S.|Back in the U.S. Live 2002]]'', and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as "composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it "an attempt to rewrite history".

In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song "Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the [[Hiroshima Massacre|atomic bombing of that Japanese city]]. Of Ono, McCartney stated: "I thought she was a cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself."

Accepting an award at the 2005 [[Q Awards]], Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, "You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London|title=Yoko Ono claims she was misquoted over McCartney outburst|first=Ian|last=Herbert|date=October 15, 2005|access-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225032027/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|archivedate=February 25, 2014}}</ref>

He has expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, "when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn't he do that with me?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|title=Julian Lennon blames father John for his lack of children|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 4, 2011|access-date=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327161916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|archivedate=March 27, 2014}}</ref> Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the papers reported was "believed to" be in the area of £20&nbsp;million, which Julian has denied.<ref name=Scot/>

He has said that he is his "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind."<ref name=yahoo1/> Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010,<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian.<ref name=yahoo1/> She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.<ref name="Imagine Peace"/>

==In art and popular culture==

[[Mary Beth Edelson]]'s ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'' (1972) appropriated [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s ''The Last Supper'', with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles; Ono was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became "one of the most iconic images of the [[feminist art movement]]."<ref name="Frost Art Museum">{{cite web|url=http://drawingproject.frostartmuseum.org/mary-beth-edelson/|title=Mary Beth Edelson|work=The Frost Art Museum Drawing Project|access-date=January 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Clara - Edelson">{{cite web|url=http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail&entity_id=1321|title=Mary Beth Adelson|work=Clara - Database of Women Artists|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|location=Washington, D.C.|access-date=January 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110213429/http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail&entity_id=1321|archive-date=January 10, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The post-punk rock band [[Death of Samantha]], founded in 1983, named themselves after a song from Ono's 1972 album ''[[Approximately Infinite Universe]]'', also called "[[Death of Samantha (song)|Death of Samantha]]".<ref>Christopher Evans, "Death of Samantha: Notes from the Underground", ''The Plain Dealer Magazine'', February 22, 1987, p. 6.</ref>

Canadian rock band [[Barenaked Ladies]]' debut single was "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]", first released in 1990 and later appearing on their 1992 album ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]''.<ref name=FM>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono|publisher=last.fm|access-date=February 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105123126/http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> The lyrics are "a shy entreaty to a potential girlfriend, caged in terms that self-deflatingly compare himself to one of pop music's foremost geniuses". It also has a "sarcastic imitation of Yoko Ono's unique vocal style in the bridge".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono (Overview)|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=February 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129225235/http://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|archivedate=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 2000, American folk singer [[Dar Williams]] recorded a song titled "I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dar-Williams-I-Wont-Be-Your-Yoko-Ono/release/3762272|title=Dar Williams – I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono|publisher=discogs|access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Bryan Wawzenek of the website ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' described the song as "us[ing] John and Yoko as a starting point for exploring love, and particularly, love between artists".<ref name="Ultimate">{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yoko-ono-inspired-songs/|title=Top 10 Songs Inspired by Yoko Ono|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=June 24, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619103724/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yoko-ono-inspired-songs/|archivedate=June 19, 2017}}</ref>

The British band [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] mentioned Ono in their song "New York Morning" from their 2014 album ''[[The Take Off and Landing of Everything]]'' ("Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It's the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko"). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon's relationship with the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881|title=Yoko Ono thanks Elbow for new song 'New York Morning' in open letter|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=March 5, 2014|website=[[NME]]|access-date=April 23, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308151301/http://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881|archivedate=March 8, 2014}}</ref> In [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s song "[[Bring the Noise]]", [[Chuck D]] and [[Flavor Flav]] rap, "Beat is for [[Sonny Bono]]/Beat is for Yoko Ono!"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dancinginyourhea0000sant|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/dancinginyourhea0000sant/page/118 118]|quote=beat is for sonny bono beat is for yoko ono.|title=Dancing in Your Head: Jazz, Blues, Rock, and Beyond|first=Gene|last=Santoro|date=December 29, 1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780195101232}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=baaFL4PyjS0C&q=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&pg=PA34|title=<!--ACTUAL ARTICLE TITLE BELONGS HERE!--> |date=February 1, 1988|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|via=Google Books}}</ref>
