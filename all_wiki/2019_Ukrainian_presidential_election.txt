The '''2019 Ukrainian presidential election''' was held on 31 March and 21 April in a [[two-round system]].

There were a total of 39 candidates for the election on the [[ballot]]. The [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 annexation]] of [[Crimea]] by [[Russia]] and the [[War in Donbass|occupation]] of parts of [[Donetsk Oblast]] and [[Luhansk Oblast]] prevented around 12% of eligible voters from participating in the election. As no candidate received an [[absolute majority]] of the vote, a second round was held between the top two candidates, [[Volodymyr Zelensky]], who played the role of Ukraine's president in a popular television comedy and the incumbent president, [[Petro Poroshenko]], on 21 April 2019. According to the [[Central Election Commission (Ukraine)|Central Election Commission]], Zelensky won the second round with 73.22% of the votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-election-result-latest-volodymyr-zelenskiy-win-exit-poll-president-a8880371.html|title=Comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy has won 73% of the vote in Ukraine's election, an exit poll suggests|date=21 April 2019|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-ukraine-presidential-election-20190421-story.html|title=Comedian who plays president on TV headed for landslide victory in Ukraine's presidential election|last=Karmanau|first=Yuras|website=chicagotribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=":10"/>

[[Dmytro Firtash]]'s very powerful [[Inter (TV channel)|Inter]] supported [[Yuriy Boyko]] and Poroshenko.

[[Rinat Akhmetov]]'s [[Ukraine (TV channel)|TRK Ukraina]], which is owned by Akhmetov's [[SCM Holdings|System Capital Management Holdings]], supported Poroshenko, [[Oleh Lyashko]], and [[Oleksandr Vilkul]]. Akhmetov's [[Opposition Bloc]] nominated Vilkul.

[[Petro Dyminskyi]]'s [[:uk:ZIK (телеканал)|ZIK]] supported Poroshenko's allies allowing them to explain their story while they were under investigation.

Three TV groups were very critical of Poroshenko:

[[Ihor Kolomoisky]]'s [[1+1 (TV channel)|1+1]] media group supported [[Volodymyr Zelensky]]. Zelenesky worked for Kolomoisky's channel. According to an analysis by Ukrainian [[NGO]] {{ill|Detektor Media|uk|Детектор медіа}} by September 2020 1+1 was not supporting (if not hostile too) Zelensky and his [[Servant of the People party]].<ref name="pravda.com.u7267718"/> Detektor Media claimed it was instead promoting promoting [[For the Future (political party)|For the Future]].<ref name="pravda.com.u7267718">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/09/25/7267718/ Zelensky's team does not have completely loyal media and systematic PR - monitoring], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (25 September 2020)</ref>

[[Andriy Sadovyi]]'s [[:uk:24 (телеканал)|Channel 24]], supported [[Anatoliy Hrytsenko]] and opposed Poroshenko.

Pro-Russia [[Yevheniy Murayev]]'s [[:uk:НАШ|Nash TV]] supported pro-Russia Vilkul and was against Poroshenko but neutral to Tymoshenko and Lyashko.

Poroshenko tweeted that "a new inexperienced Ukrainian president... could be quickly returned to Russia's orbit of influence."<ref name=BBC_22_April_2019 /> Some of Zelensky's critics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10520724-kolomoisky-going-to-return-to-ukraine-after-zelensky-wins-presidential-election.html|title=Kolomoyskyi's return to Zelensky's Ukraine|accessdate=21 April 2019|work=RT News}}</ref> have expressed concerns over his close ties with billionaire oligarch [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]], doubting whether Zelensky will be able to stand up against the country's influential oligarchs and the Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref name=BBC_22_April_2019 />

Similar sentiments were expressed by [[Andrzej Duda]], [[President of Poland]], [[Donald Tusk]], the President of the [[European Council]], and [[NATO Secretary General]] [[Jens Stoltenberg]]. Russia's deputy foreign minister, [[Grigory Karasin]], stated that "The new leadership now must understand and realise the hopes of its electors" in both domestic and foreign policy.<ref name=BBC_22_April_2019 />
