'''Hands Up United''' is a [[social justice]] activist organization based in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], formed after the fatal [[shooting of Michael Brown]] by a police officer.

==History==
===Establishment===
Hands Up United rose to prominence when it joined with other organizations to publicly demand the resignation of Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson and mayor James Knowles III. They also called for the recusal of county prosecutor McCulloch.<ref name=Swaine /><ref name=Phillips /><ref name=Mejia /><ref name=Mosendz /> It has coordinated and been involved in large-scale protests in the St. Louis area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Camille|title=More Than 1,000 March For Michael Brown In Downtown St. Louis; Night Ends With Sit-In, Arrests|url=http://www.newsweek.com/peaceful-ferguson-october-march-recalls-missouri-protests-276921|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=October 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tef Poe Breaks Down The Hands Up Don't Shoot Movement|url=http://newsone.com/3075059/tef-poe-breaks-down-the-hands-up-dont-shoot-movement/|publisher=News One|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=December 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Rivas|first1=Rebecca|title=Ferguson protest leaders meet with Obama|url=http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/article_fe536f48-7b08-11e4-aa0c-e34ba64de040.html|publisher=The St. Louis American|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=December 3, 2014}}</ref>

In response to the killing of Michael Brown and related unrest, the organization issued a set of eleven demands for local and national leaders including: the immediate release of jailed protesters, the identification and suspension of officers accused of using excessive force, and a demand that President Obama visit Ferguson.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Nichole|title=Sophisticated network, social media drive Ferguson protests|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/12/05/sophisticated-network-social-media-drive-ferguson-protests/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=December 5, 2014}}</ref><ref name=huu_demands>{{cite web|title=Demands|url=http://www.handsupunited.org/#demands-section|publisher=Hands Up United|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Hands Up' Founder: Obama Out of Touch with Black People|url=https://www.wsj.com/video/hands-up-founder-obama-out-of-touch-with-black-people/513673E8-6A1D-4890-AF39-8C349F07C115.html|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=6 December 2014|date=November 24, 2014}}</ref> Local demands were stated on behalf of local organizations such as the [[Organization for Black Struggle]] and [[Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment]] while national demands were developed by organizations such as [[Color of Change]], [[Freedom Side]], and [[Dream Defenders]].<ref name=huu_demands/>

In August 2014, the organization coordinated a nationwide demonstration called "Hands Up, Walk Out" in support of Hands Up United's mission of establishing more accountability for police, releasing people arrested during protests and improving transparency in police and justice departments across the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kite|first1=Allison|title=University students, staff and faculty participate in 'Hands Up, Walk Out' demonstration on Wescoe Beach|url=http://www.kansan.com/news/university-students-staff-and-faculty-participate-in-hands-up-walk/article_2bb8985a-2cda-11e4-87eb-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=The University Daily Kansan|accessdate=December 6, 2014|date=August 25, 2014}}</ref> Two months later in October 2014, two months after the shooting death of Michael Brown, Hands Up United in collaboration with the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment organized a weekend of activities "to build momentum for a nationwide movement against police violence." The weekend featured a rally outside the [[St. Louis County Jail|St. Louis Justice Center]], marches, candlelight vigil, educational programs, and panel discussions.<ref>{{cite web|title='Weekend of resistance' planned in Ferguson|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/weekend-of-resistance-planned-in-ferguson/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref>

Following the [[Shooting of Tamir Rice]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Hands Up United co-founder Tory Russell noted that Hands Up United was not involved in "the civil rights movement" but the "oppressed peoples movement" which includes people of many different backgrounds including gays and those with low socioeconomic status with goals of improving bias within the judicial, legislative, and educational systems.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ifill|first1=Gwen|title=Why do you march?

===United Nations Committee Against Torture statement===
On November 12, 2014, Michael Brown's parents submitted a prepared statement with Hands Up United, the Organization for Black Struggle, and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment to the [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] stating that their son's death and the "excessive force by police officers on peaceful protesters" in Ferguson in the weeks that followed violated the principles of the U.N. convention entitled Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.<ref name=wapo_111214>{{cite web|title=Michael Brown's parents take their case to United Nations torture panel|last1=Bever|first1=Leslie|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/12/michael-browns-parents-take-their-case-to-united-nations-torture-panel/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 5, 2014|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> The statement made several requests of the United Nations including: recommending the immediate arrest of police officer Darren Wilson, the resignation of Police Chief Thomas Jackson, and granting amnesty to protesters arrested during related demonstrations. It also urged that the [[Ferguson Police Department (Missouri)|Ferguson Police Department]] be held responsible for "systematically targeting and harassing residents of color in a predatory and degrading manner".<ref name=wapo_111214/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Marcus|title=Michael Brown Shooting: Parents of Late Teen Testify to United Nations Committee Against Torture Regarding Situation in Ferguson, Missouri|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/25770/20141113/michael-brown-shooting-parents-late-teen-testify-united-nations-comittee.htm|publisher=Latin Post|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=November 20, 2014}}</ref>
