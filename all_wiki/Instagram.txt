</ref> is an American [[photo]] and [[video sharing]] [[social networking service]] owned by [[Facebook, Inc.|Facebook]], created by [[Kevin Systrom]] and [[Mike Krieger]] and originally launched on [[iOS]] in October 2010. The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited [[Desktop computer|desktop]] interface in November 2012, a [[Fire OS]] app in June 2014, and an app for [[Windows 10]] in October 2016. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with [[Photographic filter|filters]] and organized by [[hashtag]]s and [[Geotag|geographical tagging]]. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can [[Like button|like]] photos and follow other users to add their content to a [[news feed|feed]], a function that seems to be discontinued as of September 2020.

Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] with 640 pixels to match the display width of the [[iPhone]] at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main opposition [[Snapchat]]—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500&nbsp;million users daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-stories-is-now-being-used-by-500-million-people-daily/547270/|title=Instagram Stories is Now Being Used by 500 Million People Daily|website=Social Media Today|access-date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>

After its launch in 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10&nbsp;million in a year, and 1&nbsp;billion as of June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Instagram hits 1 billion monthly users, up from 800M in September|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/instagram-1-billion-users/|access-date=2020-10-23|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US}}</ref> In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1&nbsp;billion in cash and stock. {{As of|2015|10}}, over 40&nbsp;billion photos had been uploaded. Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and [[User interface|interface]] changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.

As of July 2020, the most followed person is footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] with over 233&nbsp;million followers. As of January 14, 2019, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a [[Instagram egg|picture of an egg]], posted by the account @world_record_egg, created with the sole purpose of surpassing the previous record of 18&nbsp;million likes on a [[Kylie Jenner]] post.

[[File:Instagram logo 2016.svg|thumb|100px|Instagram Icon since 2016]]

Instagram began development in [[San Francisco]] as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by [[Kevin Systrom]] and [[Mike Krieger]].<ref name="inc2011" /> Realizing that Burbn was too similar to Foursquare, Systrom and Krieger refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among Burbn users.<ref name="NYT history">{{cite news |first1=Somini |last1=Sengupta |first2=Nicole |last2=Perlroth |first3=Jenna |last3=Wortham |title=Behind Instagram's Success, Networking the Old Way |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/14/technology/instagram-founders-were-helped-by-bay-area-connections.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref> They renamed the app Instagram, a [[portmanteau]] of "[[instant camera]]" and "[[telegram]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-most-popular-instagram-accounts-164126625.html|title=5 Of The Most Popular Instagram Accounts|publisher=Yahoo!

=== 2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app ===
In June 2015, the desktop website [[user interface]] was redesigned to become more [[flat design|flat]] and [[minimalism#Software and UI design|minimalistic]], but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Kastrenakes |title=Instagram is launching a redesigned website with bigger photos |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/9/8753023/instagram-website-redesign-launching-bigger-photos |website=[[The Verge]]  |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Napier |last=Lopez |title=Instagram for the Web is getting a cleaner, flatter redesign |url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/06/09/instagram-for-the-web-is-getting-a-cleaner-flatter-redesign/ |website=The Next Web |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Shadman|first=Aadil|date=|title=Instagram on Web Just Got a Major Design Overhaul|url=https://propakistani.pk/2015/06/11/instagram-on-web-just-got-a-major-design-overhaul/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=propakistani.pk}}</ref> Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout.

In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.

On May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white [[flat design]] theme for the app's [[user interface]], and a less [[skeuomorph]]istic, more [[:wikt:abstract|abstract]], "modern" and colorful icon.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Kastrenakes |title=Instagram launches redesigned app and icon |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/11/11656252/instagram-redesigns-icon-app |website=[[The Verge]]  |date=May 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Instagram's big redesign goes live with a colorful new icon, black-and-white app and more |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/instagrams-big-redesign-goes-live-with-a-colorful-new-icon-black-and-white-app-and-more/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Titcomb |title=Instagram is changing its iconic logo – here's why |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/05/11/instagram-is-changing-its-iconic-logo--heres-why/ |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=May 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref> Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when ''[[The Verge]]'' received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Instagram is testing a new black-and-white design |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/26/11512718/instagram-redesign-black-white |website=[[The Verge]]  |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>

On December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox.

In August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the "Following" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused and that some users were "surprised" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903080/instagram-following-activity-tab-disappearing|title=Instagram's Following tab is going away this week|last=Lee|first=Dami|date=October 7, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mic.com/p/instagrams-following-tab-will-be-removed-for-all-users-19195621|title=Instagram will no longer snitch on your thirsty late-night likes|website=Mic|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref>

In March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called "Co-Watching". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family as more people are told to stay at home and "social distance" as a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-co-watching-feature-group-video-calling-sharing-posts-coronavirus-2020-3|title=Instagram has announced a new feature that lets you share posts over video chat, and the platform sped up the rollout to make it available now that more people are quarantining amid the coronavirus outbreak|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>

Users on Instagram have created "trends" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/instagram-through-the-week-with-these-popular-hashtag-games/|title=#ThrowbackThursday is only the start: Instagram hashtags for every day of the week|date=May 4, 2017|website=[[Digital Trends]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wix.com/blog/2015/03/instagrams-most-popular-hashtags-explained/|title=Instagram's Most Popular Hashtags Explained|date=March 4, 2015|website=[[Wix.com]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

===Photographic filters===
Instagram offers a number of [[photographic filter]]s that users can apply to their images:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-1-of-2}}
* Normal: No filter applied.
* 1977: The increased exposure with a red tint gives the photograph a rosy, brighter, faded look.
* Amaro: Adds light to an image, with the focus on the center.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Essential Guide to Using Instagram Filters like a Pro|url=https://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2012/11/22/the-essential-guide-to-using-instagram-filters-like-a-pro/2/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=April 10, 2014|date=November 22, 2012}}</ref>
* Brannan: Increases contrast and exposure and adds a metallic tint.
* Earlybird: Gives photographs an older look with a sepia tint and warm temperature.

===Instagram Direct===
In December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Crook |title=Instagram Introduces Instagram Direct |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/12/instagram-messaging/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Instagram announces Instagram Direct for private photo, video, and text messaging |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/12/5203302/instagram-direct-photo-text-messaging |website=[[The Verge]]  |date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Laurie |last=Segall |title=Instagram launches direct messaging |url=https://money.cnn.com/2013/12/12/technology/mobile/instagram-direct/ |publisher=CNN |date=December 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref> The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding [[conversation threading]] and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed.

===Instagram Stories===
In August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to [[Snapchat]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Instagram launches "Stories," a Snapchatty feature for imperfect sharing |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/instagram-stories/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Instagram's new stories are a near-perfect copy of Snapchat stories |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview |website=[[The Verge]]  |date=August 2, 2016 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}</ref> In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told ''[[Recode]]'' that "Day One: Instagram was a combination of [[Hipstamatic]], [[Twitter]] [and] some stuff from [[Facebook]] like the [[Facebook like button|'Like' button]]. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as "fair", ''Recode'' wrote that "he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences". Systrom further stated that "When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that." He also told the publication that Snapchat "didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/6/5/15738276/instagram-snapchat-stories-copying-kevin-systrom-filters-facebook-snap-kara-swisher-decode-podcast|title=Did Instagram copy Snapchat?

In July 2014, it released '''Bolt''', a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=This is Bolt, Instagram's new messaging app |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/29/5948845/this-is-bolt-instagrams-new-messaging-app |website=[[The Verge]]  |date=July 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Alyson |last=Shontell |title=Instagram Launches Its One-Tap Photo App Bolt To Rival TapTalk And Mirage |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-launches-bolt-2014-7 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=July 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref> It was followed by the release of [[Hyperlapse (application)|Hyperlapse]] in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses "clever algorithm processing" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.<ref>{{cite web |first=Cliff |last=Kuang |title=Hyperlapse, Instagram's New App, Is Like a $15,000 Video Setup in Your Hand |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/08/hyperlapse-instagrams-new-app-is-like-a-15000-video-setup-in-your-hand/ |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=August 26, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Instagram's New Hyperlapse App Makes Mobile Timelapse And Steady Video Capture Easy |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/26/instagram-hyperlapse/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 26, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref> Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official [[Hyperlapse (application)|Hyperlapse app]] from Instagram for either of these platforms to date.<ref>{{cite web |first=Emil |last=Protalinski |title=Microsoft Hyperlapse apps launch on Android and Windows to turn your shaky videos into smooth timelapses |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/05/14/microsoft-hyperlapse-apps-launch-on-android-and-windows-to-turn-your-shaky-videos-into-smooth-timelapses/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=May 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref> In October 2015, it released '''Boomerang''', a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Chaykowski |title=Instagram Launches New App 'Boomerang' For Making GIF-Like Videos |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2015/10/22/instagram-launches-new-app-boomerang-for-making-gif-like-videos/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=October 22, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Sawers |title=Instagram launches Boomerang, an app that creates crazy, looping 1-second videos |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/10/22/instagram-launches-boomerang-an-app-that-creates-crazy-looping-1-second-videos/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=October 22, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref>

===Third-party services===
The popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third-party services designed to integrate with it, including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos (including physical print-outs), analytics, and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram (such as in the past, [[iPad]]s).<ref>{{cite web |first=Heather |last=Kelly |title=10 cool things to do with Instagram |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1160269/software-photography/instagramprojects.html |website=[[MacWorld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=June 3, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2015/11/17/just-instagram/|title=Instagram Kills Off Feed Reading Apps|website=TechCrunch|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref>

In November 2015, Instagram announced that effective June 1, 2016, it would end "feed" [[API]] access to its platform in order to "maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers" and "set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform", including those oriented towards content creation, publishers, and advertisers. It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third-party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience (due to increasing monetization of the service), and security reasons (such as preventing abuse by automated [[click farm]]s, and the hijacking of accounts). In the wake of the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal|Cambridge Analytica scandal]], Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in 2018.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/|title=Instagram suddenly chokes off developers as Facebook chases privacy|website=TechCrunch|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2015/11/19/instagram-third-party-apps/|title=Instagram is cracking down on third-party apps|last=Bell|first=Karissa|website=Mashable|access-date=December 29, 2019}}</ref>

===Fact checking===
On December 16, 2019, [[Facebook, Inc.|Facebook]] announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kozlowska|first=Hanna|title=Instagram will finally fact-check posts|url=https://qz.com/1770264/instagram-will-finally-fact-check-posts/|date=December 17, 2019|access-date=August 9, 2020|website=Quartz|language=en}}</ref> by using third-party fact-checkers organizations false information is able to be identified, reviewed and labeled as false information. Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages, additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such. With the addition of Facebook fact-checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation. If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on [[Facebook]] or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false.<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 16, 2019|title=Combatting Misinformation on Instagram|url=https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/combatting-misinformation-on-instagram/|access-date=August 9, 2020|website=About Facebook|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Algorithm and design changes===
In April 2016, Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user's timeline, shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm.<ref>{{cite news|last=Titcomb|first=James|date=March 16, 2016|title=Instagram is changing its feed to show photos out of order|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/16/instagram-is-changing-its-feed-to-show-photos-out-of-order/|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref> Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked,<ref name="Instagram about timeline">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=March 15, 2016|title=See the Moments You Care About First|url=http://blog.instagram.com/post/141107034797/160315-news|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315223405/http://blog.instagram.com/post/141107034797/160315-news|archive-date=March 15, 2016|accessdate=April 24, 2017|website=Instagram Blog|publisher=Instagram}}</ref> but there was significant negative feedback, with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates.<ref>{{cite news|last=Titcomb|first=James|date=March 29, 2016|title=Instagram changes: Don't panic, you don't have to turn on notifications|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/29/instagram-changes-dont-panic-dont-have-to-turn-on-notifications/|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Alba|first=Alejandro|date=March 28, 2016|title=Instagram users are upset, anxious about the new algorithmic timeline update|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/instagram-users-upset-anxious-new-timeline-article-1.2580081|accessdate=July 14, 2017|website=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thottam|first=Isabel|date=March 30, 2016|title=Here's What Instagram Influencers Think of the New Algorithmic Timeline|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/4-influencers-react-to-instagrams-algorithmic-time.html|accessdate=July 14, 2017|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]}}</ref> The company wrote a [[Twitter|tweet]] to users upset at the prospect of the change, but did not back down,<ref>{{cite web|last=Brueck|first=Hilary|date=March 29, 2016|title=Instagram Asks Everyone to Calm Down After Algorithm Uproar|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/29/instagram-algorithmic-filtering-concerns/|accessdate=July 14, 2017|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}</ref> nor provide a way to change it back.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patkar|first=Mihir|date=April 11, 2016|title=How (and Why) to Disable Algorithmic Feeds on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-and-why-to-disable-algorithmic-feeds-on-twitter-instagram-and-facebook/|accessdate=July 14, 2017|website=MakeUseOf}}</ref>

Since 2017, Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts ("[[Shadow banning|shadowbanning]]") it believes may be generating non-genuine engagement and spam (including excessive use of unneeded hashtags), preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app's Explore section. In a now-deleted [[Facebook]] post, Instagram wrote that "When developing content, we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lintao|first=Carissa|date=July 4, 2017|title=Instagram is cracking down on fake influencers|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/07/04/instagram-is-cracking-down-on-fake-influencers/|accessdate=July 7, 2017|website=The Next Web}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lorentz|first=Taylor|date=June 7, 2017|title=Instagram's "shadowban," explained: How to tell if Instagram is secretly blacklisting your posts|url=https://mic.com/articles/178987/instagrams-shadowban-explained-how-to-tell-if-instagram-is-secretly-blacklisting-your-posts|accessdate=July 7, 2017|website=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}</ref> Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances, particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Joseph|first=Chanté|date=November 8, 2019|title=Instagram's murky 'shadow bans' just serve to censor marginalised communities {{!}} Chanté Joseph|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/08/instagram-shadow-bans-marginalised-communities-queer-plus-sized-bodies-sexually-suggestive|access-date=December 29, 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In November 2020, Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new “Shop” tab, moving the activity feed to the top.

====Demographics====
Instagram's users are divided equally with 50% iPhone owners and 50% Android owners. While Instagram has a neutral gender-bias format, 68% of Instagram users are female while 32% are male. Instagram's geographical use is shown to favor urban areas as 17% of US adults who live in urban areas use Instagram while only 11% of adults in suburban and rural areas do so. While Instagram may appear to be one of the most widely used sites for photo sharing, only 7% of daily photo uploads, among the top four photo-sharing platforms, come from Instagram. Instagram has been proven to attract the younger generation with 90% of the 150&nbsp;million users under the age of 35. From June 2012 to June 2013, Instagram approximately doubled their number of users. With regards to income, 15% of US Internet users who make less than $30,000 per year use Instagram, while 14% of those making $30,000 to $50,000, and 12% of users who make more than $50,000 per year do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-demographics-2013-12|title=Instagram Demographics|work=[[Business Insider]]|publisher=Smith, Cooper|date=March 13, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> With respect to the education demographic, respondents with some college education proved to be the most active on Instagram with 23%.

=== User behavior ===
Ongoing research continues to explore how media content on the platform affects user engagement. Past research has found that media which show peoples' faces receive more 'likes' and comments and that using filters that increase warmth, exposure, and contrast also boosts engagement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bakhshi|first1=Saeideh|last2=Shamma|first2=David A.|last3=Gilbert|first3=Eric|year=2014|title=Faces Engage Us: Photos with Faces Attract More Likes and Comments on Instagram|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=965–974|doi=10.1145/2556288.2557403|isbn=9781450324731|s2cid=8719061}}</ref> Users are more likely to engage with images that depict fewer individuals compared to groups and also are more likely to engage with content that has not been watermarked, as they view this content as less original and reliable compared to user-generated content.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=T.

The motives for using Instagram among young people are mainly to look at posts, particularly for the sake of social interactions and recreation. In contrast, the level of agreement expressed in creating Instagram posts was lower, which demonstrates that Instagram's emphasis on visual communication is widely accepted by young people in social communication.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Yi-Ting|last2=Su|first2=Sheng-Fang|date=August 9, 2018|title=Motives for Instagram Use and Topics of Interest among Young Adults|journal=Future Internet|volume=10|issue=8|page=77|doi=10.3390/fi10080077|issn=1999-5903|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Mental health===
In May 2017, a survey conducted by the United Kingdom's [[Royal Society for Public Health]], featuring 1,479 people aged 14–24, asking them to rate social media platforms depending on anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image, concluded that Instagram was the "worst for young mental health". Some have suggested it may contribute to [[Digital media use and mental health|digital dependence]], whist this same survey noticed its positive effects, including self-expression, self-identity, and community building. In response to the survey, Instagram stated that "Keeping Instagram a safe and supportive place for young people was a top priority".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-39955295|title=Instagram 'worst for young mental health'|date=May 18, 2017|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/instagram-rated-worst-media-mental-health-032700830.html|title=Instagram rated worst media for mental health|date=May 19, 2017|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 2017, researchers from [[Harvard University]] and [[University of Vermont]] demonstrated a [[machine learning]] tool that successfully outperformed general practitioners' diagnostic success rate for depression. The tool used color analysis, metadata components, and face detection of users' feeds.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reece|first1=Andrew G.|last2=Danforth|first2=Christopher M.|year=2017|title=Instagram photos reveal predictive markers of depression|journal=EPJ Data Science|volume=6|issue=1|page=15|arxiv=1608.03282|doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0110-z|s2cid=19494738}}</ref>

Throughout 2019, Instagram began to test the hiding of like counts for posts made by its users.

==== Negative comments ====
In response to abusive and negative comments on users' photos, Instagram has made efforts to give users more control over their posts and accompanying comments field. In July 2016, it announced that users would be able to turn off comments for their posts, as well as control the language used in comments by inputting words they consider offensive, which will ban applicable comments from showing up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/07/29/instagram-will-soon-let-you-filter-comments-on-your-own-account/|title=Instagram will soon let you filter comments on your own account|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|date=July 29, 2016|website=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/29/12327312/instagram-anti-harassment-commenting-tools|title=Instagram is building the anti-harassment tools Twitter won't|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=July 29, 2016|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref> After the July 2016 announcement, the ability to ban specific words began rolling out early August to celebrities,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12365786/instagram-anti-abuse-comment-filter-celebrity-chrissy-teigen|title=Instagram's anti-abuse comment filter is rolling out now|last=McCormick|first=Rich|date=August 2, 2016|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref> followed by regular users in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/12/12887514/instagram-comments-abusive-words-filter-section|title=Instagram is now letting everyone filter abusive words out of their comments|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=September 12, 2016|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref> In December, the company began rolling out the abilities for users to turn off the comments and, for private accounts, remove followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13853172/instagram-turn-off-comments-remove-followers|title=Instagram will soon let you turn off comments and boot followers from private accounts|last=Vincent|first=James|date=December 6, 2016|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/12/06/technology/instagram-turn-off-comments/index.html|title=Instagram finally lets users disable comments|last=O'Brien|first=Sarah Ashley|date=December 6, 2016|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref>

In September 2017, the company announced that public users would be able to limit who can comment on their content, such as only their followers or people they follow. At the same time, it updated its automated comment filter to support additional languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/instagram-now-lets-you-choose-who-can-comment-on-your-posts/|title=Instagram now lets you choose who can comment on your posts|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=September 26, 2017|website=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[Oath Inc.]]|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16366060/instagram-comment-controls-launch|title=Instagram now lets you limit who can comment on your pics|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=September 26, 2017|website=[[The Verge]]|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>

In June 2017, Instagram announced that it would automatically attempt to filter offensive, harassing, and "spammy" comments by default. The system is built using a Facebook-developed [[deep learning]] algorithm known as DeepText (first implemented on the social network to detect spam comments), which utilizes [[natural-language processing]] techniques, and can also filter by user-specified keywords.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Nicholas|date=June 29, 2017|title=Instagram unleashes an AI system to blast away nasty comments|url=https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-launches-ai-system-to-blast-nasty-comments/|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/29/instagram-implements-an-ai-system-to-fight-mean-and-harassing-comments/|title=Instagram implements an AI system to fight mean and harassing comments|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=June 29, 2017|website=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/technology/instagram-bully-filter.html|title=Instagram Unveils a Bully Filter|date=May 1, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 16, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In July 2019, the service announced that it would introduce a system to proactively detect problematic comments and encourage the user to reconsider their comment, as well as allowing users the ability to "restrict" others' abilities to communicate with them, citing that younger users felt the existing block system was too much of an escalation.<ref name=":2" />

=== Culture ===
On August 9, 2012, English musician [[Ellie Goulding]] released a new music video for her song "[[Anything Could Happen]]." The video only contained fan-submitted Instagram photographs that used various filters to represent words or lyrics from the song, and over 1,200 different photographs were submitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/08/09/ellie-goulding-instagram-music-video/|title=Singer Composes Music Video From Fans' Instagram Photos|last=Colbert|first=Annie|date=August 9, 2012|website=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

=== Security ===
In August 2017, reports surfaced that a [[software bug|bug]] in Instagram's developer tools had allowed "one or more individuals" to gain access to the contact information, specifically email addresses and phone numbers, of several high-profile verified accounts, including its most followed user, [[Selena Gomez]].

Citing misinterpretations about its intention to "communicate that we'd like to experiment with innovative advertising that feels appropriate on Instagram", Systrom also stated that it was "our mistake that this language is confusing" and that "it is not our intention to sell your photos". Furthermore, he wrote that they would work on "updated language in the terms to make sure this is clear".<ref>{{cite web|last=Systrom|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Systrom|date=December 18, 2012|title=Thank you, and we're listening|url=http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219104024/http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening|archive-date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2017|website=Instagram Blog|publisher=Instagram}}</ref><ref name="cnet criticism" />

We could have had the exact same freakout last week, or a year ago, or the day Instagram launched".<ref name="verge-policy"/>

The policy update also introduced an arbitration clause, which remained even after the language pertaining to advertising and user content had been modified.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Dan|date=December 24, 2012|title=Instagram furor triggers first class action lawsuit|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-instagram-lawsuit-idUSBRE8BN0JI20121224|accessdate=April 24, 2017|agency=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

=== Facebook acquisition as a violation of US antitrust law ===
Columbia Law School professor [[Tim Wu]] has given public talks explaining that Facebook's 2012 purchase of Instagram was a [[felony]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqkau41MFvI Tim Wu: Facebook's Purchase of Instagram was a Felony], at the 2019 Aspen Ideas Festival (The Aspen Institute YouTube channel, published on June 28, 2019)</ref> A [[New York Post]] article published on February 26, 2019, reported that "the FTC had uncovered [a document] by a high-ranking Facebook executive who said the reason the company was buying Instagram was to eliminate a potential competitor".<ref>[https://nypost.com/2019/02/26/facebook-boasted-of-buying-instagram-to-kill-the-competition-sources/ Facebook boasted of buying Instagram to kill the competition], by Josh Kosman, February 26, 2019</ref> As Wu explains, this is a violation of [[United States antitrust law#Horizontal mergers|US antitrust law]] (see [[monopoly]]). Wu stated that this document was an email directly from [[Mark Zuckerberg]], whereas the Post article had stated that their source had declined to say whether the high-ranking executive was the CEO. The article reported that the FTC "has formed a task force to review "anticompetitive conduct" in the tech world amid concerns that tech companies are growing too powerful. The task force will look at "the full panoply of remedies" if it finds "competitive harm," FTC competition bureau director Bruce Hoffman told reporters."

===Algorithmic advertisement with a rape threat===
In 2016, Olivia Solon, a reporter for ''[[The Guardian]]'', posted a screenshot to her Instagram profile of an email she had received containing threats of rape and murder towards her. The photo post had received three likes and countless comments, and in September 2017, the company's algorithms turned the photo into an advertisement visible to Solon's sister. An Instagram spokesperson apologized and told ''The Guardian'' that "We are sorry this happened – it's not the experience we want someone to have. This notification post was surfaced as part of an effort to encourage engagement on Instagram. Posts are generally received by a small percentage of a person's Facebook friends". As noted by the technology media, the incident occurred at the same time parent company Facebook was under scrutiny for its algorithms and advertising campaigns being used for offensive and negative purposes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Sam|date=September 21, 2017|title=Instagram uses 'I will rape you' post as Facebook ad in latest algorithm mishap|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/21/instagram-death-threat-facebook-olivia-solon|accessdate=November 8, 2017|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Liao|first=Shannon|date=September 21, 2017|title=Instagram accidentally advertises itself on Facebook with rape threat photo|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16346900/instagram-facebook-advertisement-rape-death-threat|accessdate=November 8, 2017|website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref>

==Censorship and restricted content==
According to a Facebook spokesperson, on January 11, 2020, Instagram and its parent company [[Facebook]] are picking up posts "that voice support for slain Iranian commander [[Qassem Soleimani]] to comply with US sanctions".<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Donie |last2=Moshtaghian |first2=Artemis |title=Instagram says it's removing posts supporting Soleimani to comply with US sanctions |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/10/tech/instagram-iran-soleimani-posts/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 11, 2020}}</ref>

===Illicit drugs===
Instagram has been the subject of criticism due to users publishing images of drugs they are selling on the platform. In 2013, the [[BBC]] discovered that users, mostly located in the United States, were posting images of drugs they were selling, attaching specific hashtags, and then completing transactions via instant messaging applications such as [[WhatsApp]]. Corresponding hashtags have been blocked as part of the company's response and a spokesperson engaged with the BBC explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-24842750|title=Instagram blocks some drugs advert tags after BBC probe|date=November 7, 2013|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/07/instagram-illegal-drugs-bbc-investigation|title=Instagram acts after BBC finds site users are advertising illegal drugs|last=Batty|first=David|date=November 7, 2013|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site. We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos.</blockquote>

However, new incidents of illegal drug trade have occurred in the aftermath of the 2013 revelation, with Facebook, Instagram's parent company, asking users who come across such content to report the material, at which time a "dedicated team" reviews the information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/11/how-instagrams-drug-deals-go-undetected/|title=How Instagram's drug deals go undetected|last=Babb|first=Fletcher|date=September 19, 2014|website=[[VentureBeat]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

In 2019, Facebook announced that influencers are no longer able to post any [[Electronic cigarette|vape]], [[tobacco]] products, and [[weapon]]s promotions on Facebook and Instagram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/18/tech/instagram-influencers-vaping-guns/index.html|title=Instagram influencers can no longer promote vaping and guns|last=Business|first=Kaya Yurieff, CNN|publisher=CNN|access-date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>

===Women's bodies===
In October 2013, Instagram deleted the account of Canadian photographer [[Petra Collins]] after she posted a photo of herself in which a very small area of pubic hair was visible above the top of her bikini bottom. Collins claimed that the account deletion was unfounded because it did not break any of Instagram's terms and conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/petra-collins/why-instagram-censored-my-body_b_4118416.html|title=Why Instagram Censored My Body|last=Collins|first=Petra|date=January 23, 2014|website=[[HuffPost]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> Audra Schroeder of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' further wrote that "Instagram's terms of use state users can't post "pornographic or sexually suggestive photos," but who actually gets to decide that? You can indeed find more sexually suggestive photos on the site than Collins', where women show the side of "femininity" the world is "used to" seeing and accepting."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/instagram-petra-collins-deleted-censorship/|title=Was this tame photo too racy for Instagram?|last=Schroeder|first=Audra|date=October 17, 2013|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> Nick Drewe of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote a report the same month focusing on hashtags that users are unable to search for, including #sex, #bubblebutt, and #ballsack, despite allowing #faketits, #gunsforsale and #sexytimes, calling the discrepancy "nonsensical and inconsistent".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/30/instagram-s-sex-censorship-is-inconsistent-and-hilarious|title=Instagram's Sex Censorship is Inconsistent and Hilarious|last=Drewe|first=Nick|date=October 30, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017|publisher=[[IAC (company)|IAC]]}}</ref>

Similar incidents occurred in January 2015, when Instagram deleted Australian fashion agency Sticks and Stones Agency's account because of a photograph including pubic hair sticking out of bikini bottoms,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/21/instagram-ban-the-bush_n_6508694.html|title=Did Instagram Ban This Account Because of a Photo Showing Women's Pubic Hair?|last=Hinde|first=Natasha|date=January 23, 2015|website=[[HuffPost]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and March 2015, when artist and poet [[Rupi Kaur]]'s photos of menstrual blood on clothing were removed, prompting a rallying post on her Facebook and [[Tumblr]] accounts with the text "We will not be censored", gaining over 11,000 shares.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/10/pics-or-it-didnt-happen-reclaiming-instagrams-censored-art|title=Pics Or It Didn't Happen: reclaiming Instagram's censored art|last=Banks|first=Grace|date=April 10, 2017|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

The incidents have led to a #FreetheNipple campaign, aimed at challenging Instagram's removal of photos displaying women's nipples. Although Instagram has not made many comments on the campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allure.com/story/free-the-nipple-instagram-account|title=Free the Nipple: You Need to See This Badass Instagram Account|last=Fuller|first=Gillian|date=December 7, 2016|website=[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> an October 2015 explanation from CEO Kevin Systrom highlighted [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s content guidelines for apps published through its [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], including Instagram, in which apps must designate the appropriate age ranking for users, with the app's current rating being 12+ years of age. However, this statement has also been called into question due to other apps with more explicit content allowed on the store, the lack of consequences for men exposing their bodies on Instagram, and for inconsistent treatment of what constitutes inappropriate exposure of the female body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nylon.com/articles/instagram-free-the-nipple-guidelines|title=Instagram Explains Why It Won't #FreetheNipple|last=Deczynski|first=Rebecca|date=October 5, 2015|website=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]|publisher=Diversis Capital|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/free-the-nipple-what-types-of-nipples-are-allowed-on-instagram-a6683271.html|title=Free the Nipple: What types of nipples are allowed on Instagram?|last=Bolton|first=Doug|date=October 6, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2017|website=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

=== Censorship by countries ===
