'''''My Name Is Rachel Corrie''''' is a [[Verbatim theatre|play based on the diaries and emails]] of activist [[Rachel Corrie]], who was killed by an Israeli soldier when she was aged 23.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben Norton |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/remembering_alan_rickmans_pro_palestinian_play_about_rachel_corrie_american_activist_crushed_by_israeli_bulldozer/ |title=Remembering Alan Rickman's pro-Palestinian play about Rachel Corrie, American activist crushed by Israeli bulldozer |website=Salon.com |date=2016-01-14 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> It was jointly edited by journalist [[Katharine Viner]] and actor [[Alan Rickman]] who also directed it.

[[Rachel Corrie]] (April 10, 1979&nbsp;– March 16, 2003) was an American [[Evergreen State College]] student and member of the [[International Solidarity Movement]] (ISM) who traveled to the [[Gaza Strip]] during the [[Second Intifada]]. She was killed in the Gaza Strip by a [[Caterpillar D9]]R [[armored bulldozer]] operated by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) while protecting the family home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah from demolition by the IDF.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/09/ma_497_01.html |title=The Death of Rachel Corrie |publisher=Mother Jones |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=273498&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y "American peace activist killed by army bulldozer in Rafah" Haaretz March 18, 2003]</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Philip Rizk in Gaza City |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2008/09/2008999272950161.html |title=Gaza's tunnel economy stumbles |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref><ref name="NYT">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D71631F934A25750C0A9659C8B63&scp=12&sq=rachel+corrie+crushed&st=nyt Israeli Army Bulldozer Kills American Protesting in Gaza] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 2003</ref> According to the Israeli authorities the demolitions were carried out to eliminate weapons smuggling tunnels. According to human rights groups the demolitions were collective punishment. The exact nature of her death and the culpability of the bulldozer operator are disputed, with fellow ISM protesters saying that the Israeli soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran over Corrie, and Israeli eyewitnesses saying that it was an accident since the bulldozer operator could not see her.

==Initial stagings and response==
[[Alan Rickman]] first staged ''My Name is Rachel Corrie'' in April 2005 at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[London]], and the play went on to win the Theatregoers' Choice Awards for Best Director and Best New Play, as well as Best Solo Performance for actress [[Megan Dodds]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Viner |title= Let me fight my monsters'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1454990,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= 8 April 2005|accessdate=19 February 2009 | location=London}}
</ref>

The play was scheduled to be transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in March 2006. However, the New York theatre decided that, because of its political content, the play was to be "postponed indefinitely", after the artistic director polled numerous Jewish groups to get their reaction to the play.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jesse |last=McKinley |title=Play About Demonstrator's Death is Delayed |work=[[New York Times]]  |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/28/theater/newsandfeatures/28thea.html?_r=1&oref=slogin }}
</ref> Rickman and Viner denounced the decision and withdrew the show.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090701084339/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060403/weiss ]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/davis03062006.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418001044/http://www.counterpunch.org/davis03062006.html |archive-date=2006-04-18 }}</ref>

Rickman said: "I can only guess at the pressures of funding an independent theatre company in New York, but calling this production "postponed" does not disguise the fact that it has been cancelled. This is censorship born out of fear, and the New York Theatre Workshop, the Royal Court, New York audiences – all of us are the losers."<ref>{{cite news|first=Julian|last=Borger|date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=13 June 2016 |title= Rickman slams 'censorship' of play about US Gaza activist'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/28/usa.israel|work=[[The Guardian]]| location=London}}</ref>

The play ran as a commercial production at the Minetta Lane Theatre in Greenwich Village in the fall of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Healy|title=Workshop May Present Play Critical Of Israel |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/theater/18chur.html|work=[[New York Times]] |quote=The London producers called the workshop's move censorship|date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009 }}

==Reviews==
[[File:Mynameisrachelcorriecover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of book version of play.]]
The play received the following review from [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in April 2005:

{{quote|...Corrie went to Gaza specifically to support Palestinians whose homes were being demolished and makes no attempt to hide her partiality.

And, while she distinguishes between Jewish people and Israeli politicians, she is appalled by what she sees: the checkpoints that prevent people getting to jobs and places of education, the casual destruction of wells, the children who grow up with tank-shell holes in their walls. Theatre has no obligation to give a complete picture. Its only duty is to be honest. And what you get here is a stunning account of one woman's passionate response to a particular situation. 

And the passion comes blazing through in Corrie's eloquent reaction to her father's inquiry about Palestinian violence. As she says, if we lived where tanks and soldiers and bulldozers could destroy our homes at any moment and where our lives were completely strangled, wouldn't we defend ourselves as best we could? The danger of right-on propaganda is avoided by the specificity of Rickman's Theatre Upstairs production. Above all, this is a portrait of a woman....<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1459252,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819160807/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0%2C%2C1459252%2C00.html |archive-date=2006-08-19 }}</ref>}}

The production was reviewed by Peter Birnie of the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' January 29, 2008:

{{quote|An excellent piece of polemic, My Name is Rachel Corrie is a powerful slap at the state of Israel. Weighing the show simply on its merits as left-wing agitprop, this is a compelling production. The play asks us to condemn Israel's heavy-handed treatment of Palestinians, and does so with compelling intelligence. It closes with a particularly powerful piece of video, showing an adolescent Rachel Corrie speaking with youthful enthusiasm about helping shape a better world.

Fine. Okay. But can we please see a companion piece of theatre about a certain desert-kingdom royal family and its deep complicity in fomenting terrorism against, among many others, Israel and the world's Jewish communities? Let's call it My Name is Osama bin Laden.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=506cdf57-e542-4743-8a00-4ebf3309d75b&k=1507/Vancouver Sun Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108194618/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=506cdf57-e542-4743-8a00-4ebf3309d75b&k=1507%2FVancouver |date=2012-11-08 }}</ref>}}

The American record-music producer [[Clive Davis]] gave a short assessment of the play for ''[[The Times]]'' in April 2005:
	
{{quote|As for the scenes set in Israel — brilliantly evoked by Hildegard Bechtler's bullet-pocked concrete set — an element of unvarnished propaganda comes to the fore. With no attempt made to set the violence in context, we are left with the impression of unarmed civilians being crushed by faceless militarists. Early on, Corrie makes a point of informing us that more Israelis have been killed in road accidents than in all the country's wars put together. As she jots down thoughts in her notebook and fires off e-mails to her parents, she declares that "the vast majority of Palestinians right now, as far as I can tell, are engaging in Gandhian non-violent resistance". Even the late Yassir Arafat might have blushed at that one.<ref>Clive Davis [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14936-1571035,00.html "My Name is Rachel Corrie"], ''The Times'', 18 April 2005</ref>}}
