The '''National Honor Society''' ('''NHS''') is a nationwide organization for high school students in the [[United States]] and outlying territories, which consists of many chapters in [[high school]]s. Selection is based on four criteria: [[scholarship]] (academic achievement), [[leadership]], [[Selfless service|service]], and [[Moral character|character]]. The National Honor Society requires some sort of service to the community, school, or other organizations. The time spent working on these projects contributes towards the monthly service hour requirement. The National Honor Society was founded in 1921 by the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]]. The Alpha chapter of NHS was founded at [[Fifth Avenue High School]] by Principal Edward S. Rynearson in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhs.us/AboutUs/tabid/2126/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123020416/http://www.nhs.us/AboutUs/tabid/2126/Default.aspx |archive-date=2010-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

National Honor Society groups are commonly active in [[community service]] activities both in the community and at the school. Many chapters maintain a requirement for participation in such service activities.

In addition, NHS chapters typically elect officers, who, under the supervision of the chapter adviser, coordinate and manage the chapter as a student organization.

==Membership==
Over one million students are estimated to participate in the National Honor Society. NHS and NJHS chapters are found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, many U.S. territories, and Canada. They can also be found in areas of Asia; Pakistan has three schools maintaining an active chapter. They further can be found in international and American schools throughout the globe.
<!-- pretty serious to not be cited ==Charge of scam==
Charges have been made of NHS using volunteers for profitmaking, and the finances of the organization have not been properly disclosed and audited, although the organization requires these dues as a way to maintain the status of the program. -->

== Motto ==
The NHS motto is ''[[noblesse oblige]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.us/s_nhs/sec.asp?CID=126&DID=5270|author=NASSP|title=History of NJHS and NHS|accessdate=2008-10-31}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> (French: "nobility obligates"). The ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'' defines it thus:
<blockquote>
# Whoever claims to be noble must conduct himself nobly.
# (Figuratively) One must act in a fashion that conforms to one's position, and with the reputation that one has earned.
</blockquote>

== Scholarship ==
Since 1946, the National Honor Society has given out more than [[US$]]15 million in scholarship awards. In the 2018-19 school year, 600 awards were to be distributed, including 1 National Winner ($25,000), 24 national finalists ($5,625 each), and 575 national semifinalists ($3,200 each).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.us/students/the-nhs-scholarship/|title=The NHS Scholarship|date=2017-01-17|website=NHS|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>
