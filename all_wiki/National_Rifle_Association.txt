===Early history===
[[File:William Conant Church.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Conant Church]], one of the NRA's founders]]
A few months after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began in 1861, a national rifle association was proposed by Americans in England. In a letter that was sent to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', R.G. Moulton and R.B. Perry recommended forming an organization similar to the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|British National Rifle Association]], which had formed a year and a half earlier. They suggested making a shooting range, perhaps on the base on [[Staten Island]], and were offering [[Whitworth rifle]]s for prizes for the first shooting competition with those rifles. They suggested a provisional committee to start the Association which would include: President Lincoln, Secretary of War, officers, and other prominent New Yorkers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/09/archives/a-national-rifle-association-patriotic-action-of-americans-residing.html|title=A National Rifle Association.; Patriotic Action of Americans Residing Abroad|date=August 9, 1861|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 13, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/mal.1025500/?st=gallery|title=Abraham Lincoln papers: Series 1.

The NRA organized a team through a subsidiary amateur rifle club. [[Remington Arms]] and [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company]] produced [[breech-loading weapon]]s for the team. Although [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s had long been considered more accurate, eight American riflemen won the match firing breech-loading rifles. Publicity of the event generated by the ''New York Herald'' helped to establish breech-loading firearms as suitable for military marksmanship training, and promoted the NRA to national prominence.<ref name="craige"/>

====Legal cases, 2019–present====
In April 2019 the group unexpectedly sued its longtime public relations firm [[Ackerman McQueen]], which was responsible for two decades of aggressive gun-rights advertising on behalf of the NRA. The lawsuit alleges that the firm refused to turn over financial records to support its billings to the NRA, which amounted to $40 million in 2017. The lawsuit questioned recent programming on NRATV, an online channel operated by Ackerman, which has taken political positions unrelated to the NRA's traditional focus on gun-related issues. There were also concerns about possible conflicts of interest, such as the $1 million contract to host [[NRATV]] between Ackerman and NRA president [[Oliver North]].<ref name="beset">{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/bda97817dabf492e9be8099bdd1a4cd6|title=NRA beset by infighting over whether it has strayed too far|last=Pane|first=Lisa Marie|date=April 24, 2019|work=AP News|access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Hakim|first=Danny|date=2019-04-15|title=N.R.A.

When the National Rifle Association was officially incorporated on November 16, 1871,<ref name = incorporation/> its primary goal was to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis".

In 1934, the National Rifle Association created a Legislative Affairs Division and testified in front of Congress in support of the first substantial federal gun control legislation in the US, the [[National Firearms Act]].<ref name=Walker>{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-nra-marksman-s-friend-that-took-aim-at-washington-8429536.html | title=The NRA – marksman's friend that took aim at Washington | work=[[The Independent]] | date=December 22, 2012 | access-date=May 30, 2018 | last=Walker | first=Tim}}</ref>

The Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), the lobbying branch of the NRA, was established in 1975. According to [[Political science|political scientists]] John M. Bruce and Clyde Wilcox, the NRA shifted its focus in the late 1970s to incorporate political advocacy, and started seeing its members as political resources rather than just as recipients of goods and services. Despite the impact on the volatility of membership, the politicization of the NRA has been consistent and its PAC, the Political Victory Fund established in 1976, ranked as "one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections" as of 1998.<ref name=BruceWilcox1998p158>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bruce |editor1-first=John M. |editor2-last=Wilcox |editor2-first=Clyde |year=1998 |title=The Changing Politics of Gun Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvNb5s8Z3b0C&pg=PA158|location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |pages=158–59 |isbn=978-0847686148 |oclc=833118449 }}</ref>

A 1999 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] magazine survey said that lawmakers and their staffers considered the NRA the most powerful lobbying organization three years in a row.<ref name=FortuneSurvey1999/> [[Chris W. Cox]] was the NRA's chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, a position he held from 2002 until 2019. In 2012, 88% of Republicans and 11% of Democrats in Congress had received an NRA PAC contribution at some point in their career. Of the members of the Congress that convened in 2013, 51% received funding from the NRA PAC within their political careers, and 47% received NRA money in their most recent race. According to Lee Drutman, political scientist and senior fellow at the [[Sunlight Foundation]], "It is important to note that these contributions are probably a better measure of allegiance than of influence."<ref name=Drutman121218>{{cite web |url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/18/nra-and-congress/ |title=NRA's allegiances reach deep into Congress |last=Drutman |first=Lee |date=December 18, 2012|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}}</ref>

===Litigation===
In November 2005, the NRA and other gun advocates filed a lawsuit challenging [[San Francisco Proposition H (2005)|San Francisco Proposition H]], which banned the ownership and sales of firearms. The NRA argued that the proposition overstepped local government authority and intruded into an area regulated by the state.

In April 2006, [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, police began returning to citizens guns that had been [[New Orleans Police Department#Hurricane Katrina|confiscated after Hurricane Katrina]].

In 2009 the NRA again filed suit (''[[Guy Montag Doe v. San Francisco Housing Authority]]'') in the city of San Francisco challenging the city's ban of guns in public housing.

In 2010, the NRA sued the city of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] (''[[McDonald v.

In March 2013, the NRA joined a federal lawsuit with other gun rights groups challenging New York's gun control law (the [[NY SAFE Act]]), arguing that Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] "usurped the legislative and democratic process" in passing the law, which included restrictions on magazine capacity and expanding the state's assault weapons ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/22/nra-joins-lawsuit-challenging-new-york-gun-control-law/ |title=NRA joins lawsuit challenging New York's gun control law |publisher=FOX News |date=March 25, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014 the NRA lobbied for a bill in Pennsylvania which grants it and other advocacy groups [[legal standing]] to sue municipalities to overturn local firearm regulations passed in violation of a state law [[wikt:preemption|preempting]] such regulations, and which also allows the court to force cities to pay their legal fees. As soon as it became law, the NRA sued three cities: [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. In Philadelphia, seven regulations the NRA sued to overturn included a ban on gun possession by those found to be a risk for harming themselves or others, and a requirement to report stolen guns to the police within twenty-four hours after discovery of the loss or theft.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Brian|title=Here's the Lawsuit the NRA Just Filed Against Philadelphia Organization says city has "openly defied state law for decades."|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2015/01/14/heres-lawsuit-nra-just-filed-philadelphia/|access-date=February 22, 2015|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]] |date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> In Lancaster, a city of fewer than 60,000, mayor [[Rick Gray (Pennsylvania politician)|Rick Gray]], who has chaired the pro-gun control group [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]], was also named in the suit.

====Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF)====
By 1976, as the NRA became more politically-oriented, the Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), a PAC, was established as a subsidiary to the NRA, to support NRA-friendly politicians.<ref name=BruceWilcox1998p186/> [[Chris W. Cox]], who is the NRA's chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, is also the NRA-PVF chairman. Through the NRA-PVF, the NRA began to rate political candidates on their positions on gun rights. An NRA "A+" candidate is one who has "not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment", whereas an NRA "F" candidate is deemed a "true enemy of gun owners' rights".<ref name=Lowes140311/>

In the 2008 elections, the PVF spent millions on "direct campaign donations" and "grassroots operation".<ref name=NRAPVF2015>{{cite web |year=2015 |title=About PVF |url=https://www.nrapvf.org/about-pvf/|publisher=National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund |access-date=April 14, 2015}}</ref> In 2012, NRA-PVF income was $14.4&nbsp;million and expenses were $16.1&nbsp;million.<ref name=CRP-PVF2012/> By 2014, the NRA-PVF income rose to 21.9&nbsp;million with expenses of 20.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=CRP-PVF2014/>

====New York lawsuit====
In 2018, the NRA alleged in an official Court document that it suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage from actions of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the State's financial regulator.  The state's Department of Financial Services was directed by the Cuomo administration to encourage institutions it oversees, insurance companies, banks and other financial services companies licensed in New York state, to review their business interactions with the NRA and "other similar organizations" and assess if they would pose "reputational risk."  The NRA's suit states that Cuomo's actions violate the organization's first-amendment rights and the NRA had suffered tens of millions of dollars in financial losses.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fortin |first1=Jacey |title=N.R.A.

====Stoneman Douglas High School shooting====
{{main|Stoneman Douglas High School shooting}}
In February 2018 a school shooting at a high school in Florida left 17 dead and another 17 injured, and student survivors organized a movement called [[Never Again MSD]] to demand passage of certain gun control measures.

===Media campaigns===
In 2017, Zack Beauchamp of ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' and Mark Sumner of ''[[Daily Kos]]'' criticized a video advertisement from the NRA. In the video, Dana Loesch runs through a list of wrongs committed by an unspecified "they":

<blockquote>They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that the president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars, and singers, and comedy shows, and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march. Make them protest. Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia. To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding. Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this. The only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.</blockquote>

Sumner alleged the NRA was trying to boost gun sales by "convincing half of America to declare war on the other half." Beauchamp wrote, "It's a paranoid vision of American life that encourages the NRA's fans to see liberals not as political opponents, but as monsters."<ref name="cummings">{{cite news|last1=Cummings|first1=William|title=NRA video declares war on liberals, critics say|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/30/controversial-nra-video/441506001/|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>

In May 2018, the NRA ran an advertisement which criticized the media for giving too much coverage to school shooters by showing their faces and revealing their names, in effect causing a "glorification of carnage in pursuit of ratings", and satirically suggested that Congress pass legislation to limit such coverage in order to make provocative point about gun control.
