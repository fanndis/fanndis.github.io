The '''Human Development Index''' ('''HDI''') is a statistic composite index of [[life expectancy]], [[education]] (Literacy Rate, Gross Enrollment Ratio at different levels and Net Attendance Ratio), and [[per capita income]] indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]. A country scores a higher HDI when the [[life expectancy at birth|lifespan]] is higher, the [[education]] level is higher, and the gross national income [[GNI (PPP) per capita]] is higher. It was developed by  Pakistani economist [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and was further used to measure a country's development by the United Nations Development Programme ([[UNDP]])'s Human Development Report Office.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=A.

The 2010 [[Human Development Report]] introduced an [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index]] (IHDI). While the simple HDI remains useful, it stated that "the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for [[Social inequality|inequality]])", and "the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality)". The index does not take into account several factors, such as the [[List of countries by wealth per adult|net wealth per capita]] or the relative [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries, such as the [[G7]] members and others.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2D0AAAAMAAJ|title=The Courier|date=1994|publisher=Commission of the European Communities|language=en}}</ref>

The index is based on the human development approach, developed by [[Mahbub ul Haq]], often framed in terms of whether people are able to "be" and "do" desirable things in life. Examples include—Being: well fed, sheltered, healthy; Doing: work, education, voting, participating in community life. The freedom of choice is central—someone choosing to be hungry (as during a religious [[Fasting|fast]]) is quite different from someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food, or because the country is in a [[famine]].<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|title=What is Human Development|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/what-human-development|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=27 October 2017|year=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027132851/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/what-human-development|archive-date=27 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|quote=...&nbsp;human development approach, developed by the economist Mahbub Ul Haq&nbsp;...'}}</ref>

== Origins ==

[[File:Mahbub-ul-Haq.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|[[Mahbub ul Haq]]]]

The origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP). These were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose "to shift the focus of development economics from [[national income]] accounting to [[People-centered development|people-centered policies]]". Haq believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human [[well-being]].

* A long and healthy life: [[Life expectancy at birth]]
* [[Education index]]: Mean years of schooling and Expected years of schooling
* A decent standard of living: [[Gross national income|GNI]] per capita ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[international dollar]]s)
In its 2010 Human Development Report, the UNDP began using a new method of calculating the HDI. The following three indices are used:

1.{{anchor|Life Expectancy Index}} Life Expectancy Index (LEI) <math>= \frac{\textrm{LE} - 20}{85-20}</math>
::LEI is 1 when [[Life expectancy at birth]] is 85 and 0 when [[Life expectancy at birth]] is 20.
2. [[Education Index]] (EI) <math>= \frac{{\textrm{MYSI} + \textrm{EYSI}}} {2}</math><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/141517-New-method-of-calculation-of-Human-Development-Index-HDI.aspx|title=New method of calculation of Human Development Index (HDI)|date=2011-06-01|work=India Study Channel|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110171412/http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/141517-New-method-of-calculation-of-Human-Development-Index-HDI.aspx|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

:: Fifteen is the projected maximum of this indicator for 2025.
:2.2 Expected Years of Schooling Index (EYSI) <math>= \frac{\textrm{EYS}}{18}</math><ref>(ESYI is a calculation of the number of years a child is expected to attend school, or university, including the years spent on repetition. It is the sum of the age-specific enrollment ratios for primary, secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education and is calculated assuming the prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates were to stay the same throughout the child's life. Expected years of schooling is capped at 18 years. (Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2010). Correspondence on education indicators. March. Montreal.)</ref>
:: Eighteen is equivalent to achieving a [[master's degree]] in most countries.
3. Income Index (II) <math>= \frac{\ln(\textrm{GNIpc}) - \ln(100)}{\ln(75,000) - \ln(100)}</math>
::II is 1 when GNI per capita is $75,000 and 0 when GNI per capita is $100.
Finally, the HDI is the [[geometric mean]] of the previous three normalized indices:

<math>\textrm{HDI} = \sqrt[3]{\textrm{LEI}\cdot \textrm{EI} \cdot \textrm{II}}.</math>

<small>LE: [[Life expectancy at birth]]<br />
MYS: Mean years of schooling (i.e. years that a person aged 25 or older has spent in formal education)<br />
EYS: Expected years of schooling (i.e. total expected years of schooling for children under 18 years of age)<br />
GNIpc: [[List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita|Gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita]]</small>

=== Old method (before 2010 Index) ===
The HDI combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 Report:

* [[Life expectancy]] at birth, as an index of population health and longevity to HDI 
* Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult [[literacy]] rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary [[gross enrollment ratio]] (with one-third weighting).
* [[Standard of living]], as indicated by the [[natural logarithm]] of [[gross domestic product]] [[per capita]] at [[purchasing power parity]].

This methodology was used by the UNDP until their 2011 report.

The formula defining the HDI is promulgated by the United Nations Development Programme ([[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/faq/question,68,en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220162154/http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/faq/question%2C68%2Cen.html|url-status=dead|title=Definition, Calculator, etc. at UNDP site|archive-date=20 December 2007|accessdate=26 May 2020}}</ref> In general, to transform a raw [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], say <math>x</math>, into a unit-free [[Index (economics)|index]] between 0 and 1 (which allows different indices to be added together), the following [[formula]] is used:

* <math>x\text{ index} = \frac{x - a}{b - a}</math>

where <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are the [[maxima and minima|lowest and highest values]] the variable <math>x</math> can attain, respectively.

The Human Development Index (HDI) then represents the uniformly weighted sum with {{frac|1|3}} contributed by each of the following factor indices:

* [[Life Expectancy Index]] = <math>\frac{LE - 25} {85-25}</math>
* [[Education Index]] = <math>\frac{2} {3} \times ALI + \frac{1} {3} \times GEI</math>
** [[Adult Literacy Index]] (ALI) = <math>\frac{ALR - 0} {100 - 0}</math>
** [[Gross Enrollment Ratio|Gross Enrollment Index]] (GEI) = <math>\frac{CGER - 0} {100 - 0}</math>
* [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] = <math>\frac{\log\left(GDPpc\right) - \log\left(100\right)} {\log\left(40000\right) - \log\left(100\right)}</math>

Other organizations/companies may include other factors, such as infant mortality, which produces a different HDI.

== Criticism ==
[[File:Human welfare and ecological footprint.jpg|thumb|HDI vs. [[ecological footprint]]]]
The Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds, including alleged lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization, focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking, lack of attention to development from a global perspective, measurement error of the underlying statistics, and on the UNDP's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of "low", "medium", "high" or "very high" human development countries.<ref name="Wolff et al. 2011">{{cite journal |last1=Wolff |first1=Hendrik |last2=Chong |first2=Howard |last3=Auffhammer |first3=Maximilian |year=2011 |title=Classification, Detection and Consequences of Data Error: Evidence from the Human Development Index |journal=Economic Journal |volume=121 |issue=553 |pages=843–870 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2010.02408.x |s2cid=18069132 |url=https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/articles/338 }}</ref>

=== Sources of data error ===
Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and [[Maximilian Auffhammer]] discuss the HDI from the perspective of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country's development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.<ref name="Wolff et al. 2011" />

In 2010, the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to ''[[The Economist]]'' in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/user/UNDP%2BHuman%2BDevelopment%2BReport%2BOffice/comments |title=UNDP Human Development Report Office's comments |date=January 2011 |work=The Economist |access-date=12 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211083547/http://www.economist.com/user/UNDP%2BHuman%2BDevelopment%2BReport%2BOffice/comments |archive-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17849159?story_id=17849159 |title=The Economist (pages 60–61 in the issue of Jan 8, 2011) |date=6 January 2011 |access-date=12 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113063006/http://www.economist.com/node/17849159?story_id=17849159 |archive-date=13 January 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which discusses the Wolff ''et al.'' paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI, and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff ''et al.'' in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human-development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.

In 2013, Salvatore Monni and Alessandro Spaventa emphasized that in the debate of GDP versus HDI, it is often forgotten that these are both external indicators that prioritize different benchmarks upon which the quantification of societal welfare can be predicated. The larger question is whether it is possible to shift the focus of policy from a battle between competing paradigms to a mechanism for eliciting information on well-being directly from the population.<ref name="Monni and Spaventa, 2013">{{cite journal |last1=Monni |first1=Salvatore |last2=Spaventa |first2=Alessandro |year=2013 |title=Beyond Gdp and HDI: Shifting the focus from Paradigms to Politics |journal=Development |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=227–231 |doi=10.1057/dev.2013.30 |s2cid=84722678 }}</ref>
