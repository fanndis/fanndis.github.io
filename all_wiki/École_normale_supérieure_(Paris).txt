The '''École normale supérieure''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔl nɔʁmal sypeʁjœʁ}}; also known as '''Normale sup'''', '''Ulm''', '''ENS Paris''', '''l'École''', and most often just as '''ENS''') is one of the most selective and prestigious<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/hedu_0221-6280_1983_num_18_1_1183 |title=''The Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Third Republic''|author=Robert J. Smith |publisher=Albany, State University of New York Press}}</ref> graduate schools in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is one of the [[France|French]] ''[[grandes écoles]]'' and a constituent member of [[PSL University]].

It was initially conceived during the [[French Revolution]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bretagne.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/l-ecole/histoire/les-ecoles-de-l-an-iii-106752.kjsp?RH=1189690570769 |title=ENS Cachan Bretagne – Les écoles de l'an III |publisher=Bretagne.ens-cachan.fr |accessdate=2014-05-15}}</ref> founded in 1794, and was intended to provide the [[First French Republic|Republic]] with a new body of [[professor]]s, trained in the critical spirit and secular values of [[the Enlightenment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/world-ranking/institution/ecole-normale-superieure |title=World University Rankings – University profiles |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2014-11-20}}</ref> The school was subsequently reestablished by [[Napoleon I]] as pensionnat normal from 1808 to 1822, before being recreated in 1826 and taking the name of École normale in 1830. When institutes for primary teachers training called écoles normales were created in 1845, the word supérieure (meaning upper) was added to form the current name. It has since developed into an institution which has become a platform for a select few of France's students to pursue careers in government and academia. ENS has two main sections (literary and scientific) and a highly competitive selection process consisting of written and oral examinations.<ref name="Conference on the history of ENS">{{cite web|url=http://www.diffusion.ens.fr/index.php?res=conf&idconf=250 |title=Conference on structure of ENS, Pierre Petitmengin, 17 October 2003 |publisher=ENS Savoirs |accessdate=2014-12-04}}</ref> During their studies, many ENS students hold the status of paid civil servants.<ref name="legifrance.gouv.fr">{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000503927&categorieLien=id |title=Law granting ENS students the status of civil servants |publisher=Légifrance (French government legal database) |accessdate=2014-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.fr/admission/entrer-a-l-ens/?lang=fr |title=ENS page presenting the status (in French) |publisher=ens.fr |accessdate=2014-11-22}}</ref>

The principal goal of ENS is the training of professors, researchers and public administrators. Its [[List of École Normale Supérieure people|alumni]] include 14 [[Nobel Prize]] laureates, of which 8 are in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]] (ENS has the highest proportion of Nobel laureates among its alumni of any institution worldwide<ref name="nature.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/where-nobel-winners-get-their-start-1.20757 |title=Hsu & Wai survey of universities worldwide ranked by ratio of Nobel laureates to alumni |publisher=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=2016-10-07 |accessdate=2016-10-10}}</ref>), 12 [[Fields medal|Fields Medalists]] ([[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation#Summary of Alumni Medalists|the most of any university in the world]]), more than half the recipients of the [[CNRS]]'s [[CNRS Gold medal|Gold Medal]] (France's highest scientific prize), several hundred members of the [[Institut de France]], and scores of politicians and statesmen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.fr/a-propos/l-ecole/Distinctions |title=ENS – distinctions page |publisher=ens.fr |accessdate=2014-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/ecole-normale-sup%C3%A9rieure-paris/undergrad |title=Top universities – University profiles |publisher=Top Universities |accessdate=2014-11-19}}</ref> A ranking of universities worldwide based on ratios of alumni to Nobel prize-winners published in 2016 by American scholars Stephen Hsu and Jonathan Wai placed ENS as the first university worldwide, far ahead of the universities ranked second and third, [[California Institute of Technology]] and [[Harvard University]] respectively.<ref name="nature.com" /> The school has achieved particular recognition in the fields of mathematics and physics as one of France's foremost scientific training grounds, along with notability in the human sciences as the spiritual birthplace of authors such as [[Julien Gracq]], [[Jean Giraudoux]], [[Assia Djebar]], and [[Charles Péguy]], philosophers such as [[Henri Bergson]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Simone Weil]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Alain Badiou]], social scientists such as [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Raymond Aron]], and [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Post-structuralism|"French theorists"]] such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/l-acteur_t-20041011-Z0PVFF.html |title=''Le Soir'' article about Jacques Derrida. |publisher=lesoir.be |accessdate=2014-11-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/most-cited-authors-of-books-in-the-humanities-2007/405956.article |title=''The Times'' article about most cited scholars (2007). |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2015-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZpvAAAAQBAJ&q=badiou+ecole+normale+superieure&pg=PT11 |title=''Badiou and Deleuze Read Literature'', Jean-Jacques Lecercle |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2010 |isbn=9780748655229 |accessdate=2014-11-22}}</ref> The school's students are often referred to as ''normaliens''.

The ENS is a ''[[grandes écoles|grande école]]'' and, as such, is not part of the mainstream university system, although it maintains extensive connections with it. The vast majority of the academic staff hosted at ENS belong to external academic institutions such as the [[CNRS]], the [[EHESS]] and the [[University of Paris]]. This mechanism for constant scientific turnover allows ENS to benefit from a continuous stream of researchers in all fields. ENS full professorships are rare and competitive. Generalistic in its recruitment and organisation, the ENS is the only ''grande école'' in France to have departments of research in all the natural, social, and human sciences. Its status as one of the foremost centres of French research has led to its model being replicated elsewhere, in France (at the ENSes of [[Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon|Lyon]], [[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay|Paris-Saclay]], and [[École normale supérieure de Rennes|Rennes]]), in Italy (at the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Scuola Normale Superiore]] in [[Pisa]]<ref name="Scuola Normale Superiore – history">{{cite web|url=http://www.sns.it/en/scuola/storia/ |title=Scuola Normale Superiore – history |publisher=sns.it |accessdate=2014-11-20}}</ref>), in Romania, in [[East China Normal University|China]] and in former French colonies such as Morocco, Mali, Mauritania, and Cameroon.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
[[File:École normale supérieure de Paris, 26 January 2013.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the historic building of the ENS, at 45, rue d'Ulm. The inscriptions on the pediment of the monumental doorway display the school's two dates of creation (the first, 9 [[brumaire]] an III (30 October 1794), in the oculus, under the [[National Convention]], the second, 17 March 1808), and the date of dedication of this building, 24 April 1841.]]

The current institution finds its roots in the creation of the Ecole normale de l'an III by the post-revolutionary [[National Convention]] led by [[Robespierre]] in 1794. The school was created based on a recommendation by [[Joseph Lakanal]] and [[Dominique-Joseph Garat]], who were part of the commission on public education. The Ecole normale was intended as the core of a planned centralised national education system. The project was also conceived as a way to reestablish trust between the Republic and the country's elites, which had been alienated to some degree by the [[Reign of Terror]]. The decree establishing the school, issued on 30 October 1794 (9 [[brumaire]] an III), states in its first article that "There will be established in Paris an Ecole normale (literally, a normal school), where, from all the parts of the Republic, citizens already educated in the useful sciences shall be called upon to learn, from the best professors in all the disciplines, the art of teaching."

The inaugural course was given on 20 January 1795 and the last on 19 May of the same year at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum of Natural History]]. The goal of these courses was to train a body of teachers for all the secondary schools in the country and thereby to ensure a homogenous education for all. These courses covered all the existing sciences and humanities and were given by scholars such as: scientists [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]], [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton|Daubenton]], [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Berthollet]] and philosophers [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre|Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] and [[Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney|Volney]] were some of the teachers. The school was closed as a result of the arrival of the Consulate but this Ecole normale was to serve as a basis when the school was founded for the second time by [[Napoleon I]] in 1808.

On 17 March 1808, Napoleon created by decree a ''pensionnat normal'' within the imperial [[University of France]] charged with "training in the art of teaching the sciences and the humanities".<ref>Law of 10 May 1806 relative to the creation of the Imperial University, article 118.</ref> The establishment was opened in 1810, its strict code including a mandatory uniform. By then a sister establishment had been created by Napoleon in [[Pisa]] under the name of [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa|Scuola normale superiore]], which continues to exist today and still has close ties to the Paris school. Up to 1818, the students are handpicked by the academy inspectors based on their results in the secondary school.  However, the "pensionnat" created by Napoleon came to be perceived under the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] as a nexus of liberal thought and was suppressed by then-minister of public instruction [[Denis-Luc Frayssinous]] in 1824.

=== Second founding ===

[[File:Façade de l'École normale supérieure.JPG|left|thumb|The main entrance to the ENS on Rue d'Ulm. The school moved into its current premises in 1847.]]

An ''École préparatoire'' was created on 9 March 1826 at the site of [[collège Louis-le-Grand]]. This date can be taken as the definitive date of creation of the current school. After the July Revolution, the school regained its original name of ''École normale'' and in 1845 was renamed ''École normale supérieure''. During the 1830s, under the direction of philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], the school enhanced its status as an institution to prepare the ''agrégation'' by expanding the duration of study to three years, and was divided into its present-day "Sciences" and "Letters" divisions.<ref name="lemonde.fr">{{cite web|url=https://www.eleves.ens.fr/pollens/seminaire/seances/fusion/Le%20projet%20de%20fusion%20Ulm-Cachan.doc |title=Historical article on ENS by Pollens |publisher=lemonde.fr |date=2005-03-24 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> In 1847 the school moved into its current quarters at the rue d'Ulm, next to the [[Panthéon]] in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.<ref>Serge Benoît, "La rue d'Ulm", ''in'' Christian Hottin (ed.), ''Universités et grandes écoles à Paris : les palais de la science'', Paris, ''Action artistique de la ville de Paris'', 1999), p. 177.</ref> This helped it gain some stability, which was further established under the direction of [[Louis Pasteur]].

Having been recognised as a success, a second school was created on its model at Sèvres for girls in 1881, followed by other schools at [[Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon|Fontenay]], [[Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon|Saint-Cloud]] (both of which later moved to [[Lyon]], and [[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay|Cachan]]). The school's status evolved further at the beginning of the twentieth century.

In 1903 it was integrated into the [[University of Paris]] as a separate college,<ref>Decree of 10 November 1903 ([http://books.openedition.org/editionsulm/1218?lang=en Pascale Hummel, ''Pour une histoire de l’École normale supérieure: Source d’archives 1794-1993'', Éditions Rue d'ULM via OpenEdition, 2013]).</ref> perhaps as a result of its exposition to national attention during the [[Dreyfus Affair]], in which its librarian [[Lucien Herr]] and his disciples, who included the socialist politician [[Jean Jaurès]] and the writers [[Charles Péguy]] and [[Romain Rolland]] spearheaded the campaign to overturn the wrongful conviction pronounced against Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]].<ref>Adolphus Ballard, James Tait. (2010.)

The ranks of the school were significantly reduced during the [[First World War]], but the 1920s marked a degree of expansion of the school, which had among its students at this time such figures as [[Raymond Aron]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Vladimir Jankélévitch]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].

=== Twentieth century ===

After the [[Second World War]], in which some of its students were players in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], the school became more visible and increasingly perceived as a bastion of the communist left. Many of its students belonged to the [[French Communist Party]]. This leftist tradition continued into the 1960s and 1970s during which an important fraction of French maoists came from ENS. In 1953 it was made autonomous from the [[University of Paris]],<ref>Decree of 3 February 1953 ([http://books.openedition.org/editionsulm/1218?lang=en Pascale Hummel, ''Pour une histoire de l’École normale supérieure: Source d’archives 1794-1993'', Éditions Rue d'ULM via OpenEdition, 2013]).</ref> but it was perceived ambivalently by the authorities as a nexus of protest, particularly due to the teachings delivered there by such controversial figures as political philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. As of now, by law, ENS comes under the direct authority of the [[French Ministry of Education|Minister for Higher Education and Research]].<ref>The decree of 26 August 1987 states that the Minister for Higher Education and Research has authority over ENS in the same way rectors have authority over universities, thus ensuring ENS's independence from the mainstream university system.</ref>

The fallout from the May 1968 protests caused President of the Republic [[Georges Pompidou]], himself a former student at the school, to require the resignation of its director, [[Robert Flacelière]] and to appoint his contemporary [[Jean Bousquet]] as his successor {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Both Flacelière and Bousquet were distinguished classicists.

The school continued to expand and include new subjects, seeking to cover all the disciplines of natural and social sciences. In this manner, a new ''concours'' was opened in the 1982 to reinforce the teaching of social sciences at the school.<ref name="lemonde.fr"/> The concours, called B/L (the A/L concours standing for the traditional letters and human sciences), greatly emphasises proficiency in mathematics and economics alongside training in philosophy and literature.

For a long time, most women were taught at a separate ENS, the [[École normale supérieure de jeunes filles]] at [[Sèvres]]. However, women were not explicitly barred entry until a law of 1940, and some women were students at Ulm before this date, such as philosopher [[Simone Weil]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedie-bourges.com/Weil1.html |title=Enclyclopedia of Bourges biography of Simone Weil |publisher=encyclopedie-bourges.com |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref> and classicist [[Jacqueline de Romilly]]. In 1985, after heated debates, the two were merged into a single entity with its main campus at the historic site at the rue d'Ulm in [[Paris]].<ref>Decree of 24 July 1985 relative to the creation of public establishments of a scientific nature (EPCSCP).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/12/23/lyon-fusionne-ses-deux-ecoles-normales-superieures_1284288_3224.html |title=Article on the fusion of ENS Lyon and ENS-LSH referencing the former merger of Ulm and Sèvres |publisher=lemonde.fr |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref>

== Organisation ==

=== Sites ===

[[File:ENS Ulm cour Ernests DSC00106.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the main ENS building on rue d'Ulm is known as the ''Cour aux Ernests'' – the Ernests being the goldfish in the pond.]]

The Ecole normale supérieure is one of a few schools that still occupy a campus in the heart of Paris{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. The historic Paris ENS campus is located around the rue d'Ulm, the main building being at 45 rue d'Ulm in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th ''arrondissement'' of Paris]], which was built by architect [[Alphonse de Gisors]] and given to ENS by law in 1841.<ref>Jean Leclant, "L'École normale supérieure et l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres : passé, présent et futur", ''Comptes-rendus des séances de l'Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres'', 1999, 138, no. 4.</ref> Above the entrance door are sculptures of two female figures who respectively represent letters and sciences. They are portrayed sitting on either side of a medallion of [[Minerva]], who represents wisdom. A formalised version of this frontal piece is used as the school's emblem.

The main site at 45 rue d'Ulm is organized around a central courtyard, the ''Cour aux Ernests''. Another courtyard south of this one, the ''Cour Pasteur'', separates the school from the apartment buildings of the ''rue Claude-Bernard''. This buildings house the administrative functions of the school, and some of its literary departments (philosophy, literature, classics and archeology), its mathematics and computer science departments, as well as its main human sciences library. The site's ''monument aux morts'', which was inaugurated in 1923 and stands as a reminder of the ''normaliens'' who lost their lives in the [[First World War]], is a work by [[Paul Landowski]].<ref>Serge Benoît, "La rue d'Ulm", p. 179.</ref>

Several auxiliary buildings surround this main campus in adjacent streets. The closest one, opposite the main entrance, at 46 rue d'Ulm, houses the school's biology department and laboratories as well as a part of its student residences. The seat of the school's physics and chemistry departments, inaugurated in 1936 by [[Léon Blum]] and [[Albert Lebrun]], lies North of the school on rue Lhomond, while further up the rue d'Ulm its number 29 houses secondary libraries and the school's department of cognitive sciences.

ENS has a second campus on Boulevard Jourdan (previously the women's college), in the 14th ''arrondissement'' of Paris, which is home to the school's research department of social sciences, law, economics and geography, as well as further student residences. The site has been undergoing major reconstruction since 2015. In 2017, President [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] inaugurated a new building on site, which is home to the ENS economics department, the school's social science library, and the [[Paris School of Economics]], an ENS project.

The school has a secondary site in the suburb of [[Montrouge]], which houses some of its laboratories alongside those of [[Paris Descartes University]]. It features green areas and sporting facilities as well as some 200 student rooms. A fourth site in the town of Foljuif, south of Paris, hosts some of the school's biology laboratories.

=== Recruitment ===

The school is very small in student numbers. Its core of students, who are called'' normaliens'', are selected via a competitive exam called a ''concours'' (baccalaureate + 2 years) after a preparatory class. Two hundred ''normaliens'' are thus recruited every year, half of them in the sciences and the same number in the humanities, and receive a monthly salary (around €1,350/month in 2018), and in exchange they sign a ten-year contract to work for the state. Although it is seldom applied in practice, this exclusivity clause is redeemable (often by the hiring firm).

Preparation for the ''concours'' takes place in [[preparatory classes]] which last two years (see [[grandes écoles]]). 
Other students can be selected but they are called "étudiants normaliens" and do not have their study paid and cannot be called "normaliens". They are selected with the preparation of a research project (baccalaureate +2–4 years). 
PhD students at ENS are either graduate students from the ENS doctoral school<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ed540.ens.fr/?lang=en |title=ENS Doctoral School}}</ref> or from another doctoral school co-accredited by ENS.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ens.fr/en/academics/academic-programs/phd-programs |title=ENS PhD programs}}</ref> Since 2016 Phd students preparing their doctoral research at ENS are awarded a PhD from PSL University.
ENS also welcomes selected foreign students (the "international selection"), participates in various graduate programs, and has extensive research laboratories. The foreign students selected often receive a scholarship which covers their expenses.

The students selected via the ''concours'' remain at the school for a length of time ranging from four to six years. ''Normaliens'' from [[France]] and other [[European Union]] countries are considered civil servants in training.<ref name="legifrance.gouv.fr" /> Many students devote at least one of those years to the [[agrégation]], which allows them to teach in high schools or universities. Faculty recruitment is selective, with between zero and one ENS professorship open per year{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. Faculty recruitments usually happen upon previous incumbent retirements. In informal ENS jargon, ENS full professors are popularly called PdPs ("''professeurs des professeurs'')" because traditionally ENS was created to educate future professors{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

=== Divisions ===

[[File:Cour aux Ernests sous la neige.jpg|left|thumb|The school's ''Cour aux Ernests'' under a coat of snow.]]

Founded to train high school teachers through the ''[[agrégation]]'', ENS is now an institution training researchers, professors, high-level civil servants, as well as business and political leaders. It focuses on the association of training and research, with an emphasis on freedom of curriculum. The school's resources are equally divided between its "Letters" (social and human sciences and literature) and its "Sciences" (natural sciences and mathematics) sections. The school's fifteen departments and its 35 units of research (''unités mixtes de recherches'' or ''UMR'' in French) work in close coordination with other public French research institutions such as the [[CNRS]].

The school has seven departments in its "Sciences" section: mathematics,<ref>[http://www.dma.ens.fr/ DMA – Department of Mathematics]</ref> physics,<ref>[http://fip.phys.ens.fr/ FIP – Department of Physics]</ref> computer science,<ref>[https://www.di.ens.fr/ DI – Department of Computer Science]</ref> chemistry,<ref>[http://www.chimie.ens.fr/ Department of Chemistry]</ref> biology,<ref>[http://www.biologie.ens.fr/depbio/ Department of Biology]</ref> geoscience<ref>[http://www.tao.ens.fr/ TAO – Department of Geoscience]</ref> and cognitive science.<ref>[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/ DEC – Department of Cognitive Science]</ref> It also has eight departments in its "Letters" section: philosophy,<ref>[http://www.philosophie.ens.fr/ Department of Philosophy]</ref> literature,<ref>[http://www.lila.ens.fr/ LILA – Department of Literature and Language]</ref> history,<ref>[http://www.histoire.ens.fr/ Department of History]</ref> classics,<ref>[http://www.antiquite.ens.fr/ CEA – Department of Classics]</ref> social science,<ref>[http://www.paris-jourdan.ens.fr/accuei/?%20DSS Jourdan – Department of Social Science]</ref> economics<ref>[http://economie.ens.fr/?lang=en/  Department of Economics]</ref> (this section is the base of [[Paris School of Economics]]),<ref>[http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/ Paris School of Economics]</ref> geography,<ref>[http://www.geographie.ens.fr/ Department of Geography]</ref> and art history and theory.<ref>[http://www.dhta.ens.fr/ Passerelle des arts – Department for the History and Theory of Art]</ref> In addition to these fifteen departments, a language laboratory<ref>[http://ecla.ens.fr/ ECLA - ENS Language Laboratory]</ref> for non-specialists offers courses in most major world languages to all the students. Additional centres of research and laboratories gravitate around the departments, which function as nodes of research.

The emphasis is placed squarely on interdisciplinarity and students who entered from a scientific ''concours'' (thus having mainly studied in their preparatory school maths, physics and chemistry or biology) are encouraged to attend courses in the literary departments. Conversely, maths and physics introductory courses are on offer for the students from the "literary" departments. The school's diploma, instituted in 2006, requires students to attend a certain number of courses not related to their major.<ref>[http://www.ens.fr/admission/diplome-de-l-ens/?lang=en The ENS diploma]</ref>

=== Libraries ===

The École normale supérieure has a network, known as ''Rubens'', of ten libraries shared out over its sites, which taken together make up the third largest library in France.<ref name="Article from the Nouvel obs">{{cite web|url=
http://bibliobs.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20111129.OBS5574/ens-une-ecole-au-bord-de-la-crise-de-nerfs.html |title=Article from the ''Nouvel obs''|publisher=bibliobs.nouvelobs.fr |accessdate=2014-11-22}}</ref> The catalogue is available for consultation online.<ref>[http://halley.ens.fr/ Halley integrated catalogue of the Rubens libraries]</ref> Entrance to the libraries is reserved to domestic and international researchers of doctoral level, as well as to the teachers at the school, ''normaliens'', other ENS students, and [[PSL Research University]] students. The main library, devoted to literature, classics, and human sciences, dates back to the nineteenth century when it was greatly expanded by its director, the famous [[dreyfusard]] [[Lucien Herr]]. Its main reading room is protected as a ''monument historique''.<ref>{{cite web|url=

A secondary library concerned with social science, economics, and law is located at the Jourdan campus for social science. This library has more than 150,000 books in the subjects it covers{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. The school also has specialised libraries in archeology, cognitive sciences, mathematics and computer science, theoretical physics. A recently unified natural sciences library was opened in 2013, aiming to bring together in a central place on rue d'Ulm the libraries of physics, chemistry, biology and geoscience.<ref>[http://www.bib.ens.fr/Sciences-experimenta.15.0.html ENS sciences expérimentales]</ref><ref>[http://www.enssib.fr/constructions-de-bibliotheques/132813-bibliotheque-des-sciences-experimentales ENSSIB – French record of new libraries]</ref> The school also features two specialised centres for documentation, the ''Bibliothèque des Archives [[Husserl]]'', and the ''Centre d'Archives de Philosophie, d'Histoire et d'Edition des Sciences.

== Domestic and foreign networks ==

=== Affiliations ===

Two other [[école normale supérieure|''écoles normales supérieures'']] were established in the 20th century: the [[École Normale Supérieure de Lyon]] (sciences and humanities); and the [[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay]] (pure and applied sciences, sociology, economics and management, English language). More recently, the fourth ''école normale supérieure'' was created on January 2014 under the name of École Normale Supérieure de Rennes (pure and applied sciences, economics and management, law school, sport) in [[Brittany]]. All four together form the informal ENS-group{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

The École normale supérieure is also an institution of [[PSL Research University]], a union of several higher education institutions, all located in Paris, which aims at achieving cooperation and developing synergies between its member institutions to promote French research abroad.<ref>[http://www.univ-psl.fr/default/EN/all/about_fr/historique_de_psl.htm Paris Sciences et Lettres – history]</ref> In addition to this, the École normale supérieure cooperates in [[Atomium Culture]], the first permanent platform for European excellence that brings together some of Europe's leading universities, newspapers and businesses.<ref>[http://atomiumculture.eu/node/33 Atomium culture – member universities]</ref> The school is a member of the Conference of University Presidents and of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles|Conference of Grandes Ecoles]].

=== Domestic partnerships ===

Its educational project being based on research, ENS seeks to train its students to become researchers. The main objective of the education given is getting a doctorate, and more than 85% of ''normaliens'' achieve this{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}. The students are free to choose their own course of study but must at least attain a master's degree in research. Since, traditionally, the institution does not have the powers to grand university degrees, this entails that students have to follow courses in other universities in Paris. To this end, ENS cultivates a large number of partnerships and conventions with other higher education institutions to create master's degrees which are co-presided by two institutions. ENS works closely with the [[Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS), the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]], the [[Panthéon-Sorbonne University]], [[HEC Paris]] and [[ESSEC]] Business School in particular to deliver joint diplomas to a certain number of students who have followed courses shared between the two institutions. It is also the main partner in the [[Paris School of Economics]] project which it has launched along with the [[EHESS]], the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique]] (ENSAE) and the [[École des Ponts]]. This project seeks to create a unified Master's-level economics school in Paris.<ref>[http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching-and-students/ PSE – master's page]</ref>

=== International partnerships ===

[[File:Palazzo Carovana Pisa.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Scuola Normale Superiore]] in [[Pisa]], [[Italy]], which was founded as a branch of ENS and retains very close links to it.]]

The [[Scuola Normale Superiore]] in [[Pisa]] was founded in 1810 as a branch of the École normale supérieure by Napoleon and later gained independence.<ref name="Scuola Normale Superiore – history" /> ENS and its Italian twin have retained very close links since this time and since 1988 a special partnership has 80 ''normaliens'' going to [[Pisa]] every year while half the class of the SNS spend a year at the Paris school. During its history and due to the far reach of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] during the colonial era, many schools have been created around the world based on the ENS model, from [[Haiti]] (in [[Port-au-Prince]]) to [[Vietnam]] (in Hanoi) to the Maghreb (in Tunis, Casablanca, Oran, and Rabat to name but a few) and Subsaharan Africa (in Nouakchott, Libreville, Yaoundé, Dakar, Niamey, Bangui for example). ENS maintains good relations and close links with these institutions. In 2005, ENS opened a branch at the [[East China Normal University]] (ECNU) in [[Shanghai]], whose French name was changed to ''École normale supérieure de l'Est de la Chine'' to reflect the agreement, and a joint doctoral program between the two institutions was launched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://french.peopledaily.com.cn/Sci-Edu/3487518.html |title=People's Daily Online - Article on ENS - East China Normal University partnership |publisher=peopledaily.com.cn |date=2005-06-22 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref>

ENS welcomes international researchers for one-year stays through the mediation of the Paris Institute of Advanced Research and the Villa Louis-Pasteur. The Blaise Pascal, Marie Curie, Condorcet and Lagrange research places (''chaires'') also allow researchers from abroad to stay for more than a year at ENS laboratories. ENS also is a member of the Franco-Chinese laboratory Saladyn since 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ambafrance-cn.org/IMG/pdf/newsletter_13_final_-_fr.pdf |title= The International CNRS Laboratory " SALADYN " |publisher=[http://www.ambafrance-cn.org/ ambafrance-cn.org] |accessdate=2014-11-21}}</ref> It has been hosting an antenna of [[New York University]]'s [[Erich Maria Remarque]] Institute since 2007.<ref>[http://remarque.as.nyu.edu/object/remarque.ens Remarque at ENS]</ref>

Furthermore, ENS has strong parternships for research at Master's and Doctorate levels, sending its students to universities around the world to complete their tuition. It also shares thesis habilitation with universities abroad, meaning that somes theses can be written with support from both the ENS and one of its partner institutions. It is also customary for students in the literary and linguistic subjects to go to teach for one year in universities abroad with the position of junior fellows. These exchange and cooperation programs link ENS with universities such as the [[University of Beijing]] in China, [[Freie Universität Berlin]] in Germany, the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in the United Kingdom, [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin, [[McGill University]] in Montréal, and the universities at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Cornell|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Stanford|Stanford]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.fr/IMG/file/internationale/2013/Liste%20des%20universit%C3%A9s%20partenaires_sejours%20professionnalisants.pdf |title=ENS – list of partnerships |publisher=.ens.fr |accessdate=2014-11-20}}</ref>

== Public face ==

=== Publishing ===

Since 2001, the Ecole normale supérieure's internet portal, called ''Diffusion des savoirs'' ("Spreading knowledge") has offered access to more than 2000 recordings of conferences and seminars that have taken place at the school, in all sciences natural and social.<ref>[http://savoirs.ens.fr/ Online "Savoirs" platform]</ref> The school also has launched its own short conference platform, ''Les Ernest'',<ref>[http://www.les-ernest.fr/ Online "Les Ernest" platform]</ref> which shows renowned specialists speaking for fifteen minutes on a given subject in a wide scope of disciplines.

In 1975 the school founded its university press, first called ''Presses de l'ENS'' then renamed in 1997 to ''Editions Rue d'Ulm''. This press, which operates on a small scale, publishes specialist academic books mainly in the spheres of literature and the social sciences. Some 300 works are available on line on in the press's bookshop, and about 25 new titles are published every year.<ref>http://www.presses.ens.fr/</ref>

=== Foundation ===

In 1986, an ENS foundation was created and recognised as a ''fondation d'utilité publique'' by law.<ref>[http://www.fondation.ens.fr/ Fondation ENS – accueil]</ref> It contributes to the development of the school, most notably by encouraging and facilitating the reception of foreign students and researchers. The Foundation, presided by Alain-Gérard Slama, manages some investments into financed positions for foreign researchers in ENS-associated laboratories. It has for example financed the Louis Pasteur villa, situated close by ENS, which welcomes foreign researchers for extended stays. It has also contributed to financing several positions for scientists in ENS laboratories, for instance in research on telecom network security with [[France Télécom]] and on "artificial vision" with the [[Airbus]] foundation.

=== Rankings and reputation ===
In France, ENS has been regarded since the late 19th century as one of foremost ''grandes écoles''. However, the ENS system is different from that of most higher education systems outside France, thus making it difficult to compare with foreign institutions; in particular, it is much smaller than a typical English collegiate university. It is ranked as the second "small university" worldwide behind [[California Institute of Technology]] by the 2016 Times Higher Education Smaller Universities Ranking (a ranking of institutions of less than 5000 students).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/worlds-best-small-universities-2016 |title=Times Higher Education Ranking of Small Universities |work=THE Times |date= 2016-01-25 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}</ref> It is generally regarded as the premier French institute for higher education and research, and it is currently ranked first among French universities by the ARWU and Times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-universities-france |title=Times Ranking of French Universities |work=THE Times |date= 2016-05-18 |accessdate=2016-10-15}}</ref>

== Notable alumni ==
{{Main|List of École Normale Supérieure people}}

[[File:Louis Pasteur, foto av Paul Nadar, Crisco edit.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] was a student at the school before directing it for many years.]]

Throughout its history, a sizeable number of ENS alumni, some of them known as ''normaliens'', have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise, ranging from [[Louis Pasteur]], the chemist and microbiologist famed for inventing [[pasteurisation]], to [[philologist]] [[Georges Dumézil]], novelist [[Julien Gracq]] and socialist Prime Minister [[Léon Blum]].

=== Mathematics and physics ===

[[Évariste Galois]], the founder of [[Galois theory]] and [[group theory]], was an early student at ENS, then still called ''École préparatoire'', in the 1820s, at the same time as fellow mathematician [[Augustin Cournot]]. Though mathematics continued to be taught at the school throughout the 19th century, its real dominance of the mathematic sphere would not emerge till after the First World War, with a young generation of mathematicians led by [[André Weil]], known for his foundational work in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] (also the brother of fellow student, philosopher [[Simone Weil]]). This rejuvenation continued into the 1930s, as exemplified by the 1935 launch of the influential [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] project, whose work permeated the field of mathematics throughout the 20th century. In 1940 former student [[Henri Cartan]] was appointed professor at the school like his father [[Élie Cartan]], carrying the school's importance in the field still further with his work in [[algebraic topology]]. His teaching, which continued till 1965, was vastly influential in shaping his students, who included [[Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat|Yvonne Bruhat]], [[Gustave Choquet]], [[Jacques Dixmier]], [[Roger Godement]], [[René Thom]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/hedu_0221-6280_1996_num_69_1_2809 |title=Article on the Bicentenary book directed by Jean-François Sirinelli |publisher=[[Histoire de l'éducation (journal)|Histoire de l'éducation]] |date=1996 |accessdate=2016-10-12}}</ref>

Since the 1936 establishment of the [[Fields Medal]], often called the "Nobel Prize for mathematics", ten ''normaliens'' have been recipients, contributing to ENS's reputation as one of the world's foremost training grounds for mathematicians: [[Laurent Schwartz]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (also a recipient of the inaugural [[Abel Prize]] in 2003), [[René Thom]], [[Alain Connes]], [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], [[Pierre-Louis Lions]], [[Laurent Lafforgue]], [[Wendelin Werner]], [[Cédric Villani]] and [[Ngô Bảo Châu]]. All French holders of the prize were educated at ENS. [[Alexander Grothendieck]], also a Fields medallist, though he was not a ''normalien'', received a substantial part of his training at the school. These eleven former students have made ENS [[Fields Medal#University ranking by alumni|the institution with the most Fields medallist alumni]] of any institution worldwide. Former student [[Yves Meyer]] was also awarded the Abel prize.

In addition, eight ''normaliens'' have gone on to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]: [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]], [[Albert Fert]], [[Alfred Kastler]], [[Gabriel Lippmann]], [[Louis Néel]], [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]] and [[Serge Haroche]], while other ENS physicists include such major figures as [[Paul Langevin]], famous for developing [[Langevin dynamics]] and the [[Langevin equation]]. Alumnus [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

=== Philosophy ===

Its position as a leading institution in the training of the critical spirit has made ENS into France's premier training ground for future philosophers and producers of what has been called by some "French theory". Its position as a philosophical birthplace can be traced back to its very beginnings, with [[Victor Cousin]] a student in the early 19th century. Two ENS philosophers won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for their writings, [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. [[Raymond Aron]], the founder of French anti-communist thought in the 1960s and Sartre's great adversary, was a student from the same year as Sartre, and they were both near contemporaries of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], musicologist [[Vladimir Jankélévitch]] and historian of philosophy [[Maurice de Gandillac]]. In [[Sèvres]], in the ENS for young women, philosopher and mystic [[Simone Weil]] was accomplishing her years of study at the same time. [[Jean Hyppolite]], the founder of [[Hegel]]ian studies in France, also studied at the school at this time and later influenced many of its students. [[Philosophy of science|Epistemologists]] [[Georges Canguilhem]] and [[Jean Cavaillès]], the latter also known as a [[Résistance]] hero, were educated at ENS as well.

[[File:Simone Weil 1921.jpg|right|thumb|[[Simone Weil]] attended the Ecole normale supérieure in the 1920s and beat classmate [[Simone de Beauvoir]] to first place in philosophy.]]

Later, [[Marxism|Marxist]] political thinker [[Louis Althusser]] was a student at ENS and taught there for many years, and many of his disciples later became known for their own thought: among them were [[Étienne Balibar]], philosopher [[Alain Badiou]], who still teaches at the school as an emeritus professor, and [[Jacques Rancière]]. Still later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the world-renowned thinker [[Michel Foucault]], founder of the history of systems of thought and future professor at the [[Collège de France]] was a student a few years ahead of the founder of [[deconstruction]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and the thinker of [[individuation]] [[Gilbert Simondon]]. The tradition continues today through such philosophers as [[Jacques Bouveresse]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Claudine Tiercelin]], [[Francis Wolff]] and [[Quentin Meillassoux]], and the school has also produced prominent public intellectuals like [[Stéphane Hessel]] and such [[New Philosophers]] as [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] and [[Benny Lévy]].

Contributing to ENS's role as the centre of the [[Structuralism|structuralist]] school of thought, alongside Althusser and Foucault, major [[psychoanalyst]] and [[psychiatrist]] [[Jacques Lacan]] taught there in the 1960s, notably giving his course, ''[[The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis]]'', in 1964. This period of his teaching is significant as it is the one in which it acquired "a much larger audience" than before and represented a "change of front" from his previous work.<ref>Lacan, Jacques. "Report on the 1964 Seminar". [[Hurly-Burly (journal)|''Hurly-Burly'']] '''5''', p. 17.</ref> During this time the school became a focal point of the [[École Freudienne de Paris|École freudienne de Paris]], and many of Lacan's disciples were educated there, including psychoanalysts [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] and [[Jean-Claude Milner]], the first president of the [[World Association of Psychoanalysis]].

=== History and literature ===

One of the school's foremost specialities has always been the teaching of history, and as such it has produced a large number of renowned historians who have been important in the development of their subject, starting with [[Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges]], [[Ernest Lavisse]] and [[Jérôme Carcopino]], all students of the school in the second half of the nineteenth century who later would come back to direct it. Around the turn of the century two men who would become the founders of the [[Annales School]], [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], studied at the school. [[Jacqueline de Romilly]] and [[Pierre Grimal]], respectively historians of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], were both students at the school starting in 1933. Sinologist [[Marcel Granet]], medievalist [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Egyptologist]] [[Gaston Maspero]], archeologist [[Paul Veyne]], ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' specialist [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pre-Columbian]] civilisation anthropologist [[Jacques Soustelle]] were all students at the school, as well as [[Georges Dumézil]], who revolutionised comparative [[philology]] and [[mythography]] with his analyses of sovereignty in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and formulated the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] of social class in ancient societies.

[[File:Jean-Paul Sartre FP.JPG|left|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] attended the school at the same time as his intellectual foe [[Raymond Aron]].]]

The school has a long-standing reputation as a training ground for men and women of letters, and its alumni include novelist and dramatist [[Jean Giraudoux]], many of whose plays among which ''[[The Trojan War Will Not Take Place]]'' and ''[[Amphitryon 38]]'' have become staple elements of the French theatrical repertory; and acclaimed novelist [[Julien Gracq]], whose 1951 novel ''[[The Opposing Shore]]'' is now considered a classic. Poet [[Paul Celan]] and [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] winner [[Samuel Beckett]] were both teachers at the school. [[Jules Romains]], the founder of [[Unanimism]], essayists [[Paul Nizan]] and [[Robert Brasillach]], novelist [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] winner [[Romain Rolland]] and poet [[Charles Péguy]] are a few other examples of major authors who were educated there. The school has also long been a centre for literary criticism and theory, from one-time director [[Gustave Lanson]] to major twentieth-century figures of the field such as [[Paul Bénichou]], [[Jean-Pierre Richard]] and [[Gérard Genette]]. The founder of the influential ''[[Négritude]]'' movement, [[Martinican]] poet [[Aimé Césaire]], prepared and passed the entrance exam from the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] where he was friends with future [[President of Senegal]] and fellow ''Négritude'' author [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who failed the entrance exam. Around this same period [[Algeria]]n novelist, essayist and filmmaker [[Assia Djebar]], who would become one of the most prominent voices of Arab [[feminism]], was a student at the school, as well as Belgian writer [[Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt]].

=== Social sciences and economics ===

There is a tradition of social sciences at the school, and [[Émile Durkheim]], regarded as one of the founders of the discipline of [[sociology]], was a student at the school in 1879, around the same time as [[Théodule Ribot]], a psychologist well known for developing [[Ribot's Law]]. [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who studied dynamics of power in society and its transmission over generations and became a vocal critic of the French system of ''grandes écoles'' and notably ENS as the standard-bearer of that system, studied at ENS in the early 1950s, at the same time as his later intellectual adversary, [[Methodological individualism|individualist]] [[Raymond Boudon]], both of them having taken and passed the ''agrégation'' in philosophy at the end of their studies at the school. Other major ENS sociologists and anthropologists include [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Alain Touraine]] and [[Philippe Descola]]. The school also has a tradition of geography, with the founder of modern French geography and of the French School of Geopolitics [[Paul Vidal de La Blache]] having been a student at the school starting in 1863.

As for economics, its history at the school is less long, as it was not among the subjects first taught at the school. However, [[Gérard Debreu]] won the 1983 [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]], and there is a growing output of economists from ENS, as evidenced by the young generation of French economists represented by [[Emmanuel Saez]], winner of the 2009 [[John Bates Clark Medal]], [[Esther Duflo]], who won the same medal in 2010 and the Nobel prize in 2019, and [[Thomas Piketty]], author of the 2013 bestseller ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]''. Since its creation in 2000, ten of the twenty recipients of the [[Prix du meilleur jeune économiste de France|Prize of the best young French economist]] have been ENS alumni, including [[Antoine Bozio]] (who now teaches at [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|EHESS]]), [[Camille Landais]] ([[London School of Economics|LSE]]), [[Emmanuel Farhi]] ([[Harvard University|Harvard]]), [[Pascaline Dupas]] ([[Stanford University|Stanford]]) and [[Xavier Gabaix]] (Harvard).

=== Government and politics ===

ENS has never had a public policy division, but some of its students have become leading statesmen and politicians. [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] Prime Ministers [[Jules Simon]], [[Léon Blum]], [[Édouard Herriot]] and [[Paul Painlevé]] as well as [[socialist]] leader [[Jean Jaurès]] were early examples of this trend. At this time, quite a few ENS former students and intellectuals were drawn to [[socialism]], such as [[Pierre Brossolette]] who became a [[Résistance]] hero and a major national leader during World War II. The institution has continued to be seen as a left-wing school since then. Later, as ENS came increasingly to be seen by some as an antechamber to the [[École nationale d'administration]], more young students drawn to politics and public policy began to be attracted to it, such as future President of the Republic [[Georges Pompidou]], Prime Ministers [[Alain Juppé]] and [[Laurent Fabius]], and ministers such as [[Bruno Le Maire]] and [[Michel Sapin]], respectively the current and former [[Minister of Finance (France)|Ministers of Finance]] of France.
