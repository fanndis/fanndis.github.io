'''Israel–Norway relations''' are the [[bilateral relations]] between [[Israel]] and [[Norway]]. Norway was one of the first countries to recognize Israel, doing so on 4 February 1949. On 11 May 1949, Norway was one of the U.N. members that voted in the General Assembly to admit Israel to the UN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/israel-inde.htm|title=Israeli War of Independence|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Neff, Donald|title=Third Time's a Charm: Israel Admitted as U.N.

Both countries established diplomatic relations later that year. Israel has an embassy in [[Oslo]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://embassies.gov.il/oslo/Pages/default.aspx|title=Israels ambassade i Norge |publisher=|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> which serves [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]. Norway has an embassy in [[Tel Aviv]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norway.org.il/|title=Norway – the official site in Israel |publisher= |accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> and two honorary consulates, one in [[Eilat]] and the other in [[Haifa]]. 

As at January 2009, 553 Israeli citizens lived in Norway and 260 Norwegians lived in Israel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/01/10/innvbef_en/arkiv/tab-2009-04-30-05-en.html |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20111112103850/http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/01/10/innvbef_en/arkiv/tab-2009-04-30-05-en.html|url-status=dead|title=Table 5 Persons with immigrant background by immigration category, co…|date=12 November 2011|archivedate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="Registered at embassy">Number of registered at the embassy.

Norway provided the facilities in 1993 to Israel and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] (PLO) that culminated in the [[Oslo Accords]].

In March 2007, the Norwegian government recognized the [[Hamas]]-led [[Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007|2007 Palestinian unity government]], and restoring full political and economic ties, but calling on the Palestinian authorities to renounce violence and recognize Israel's right to exist.<ref> [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-norway/norway-recognizes-palestinian-unity-government-idUSMOS75951420070317 Norway recognizes Palestinian unity government]</ref> The unity government failed to get international support because it did not meet the conditions set by the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]. Israel rejected the new Palestinian government and said it will not deal with it unless it recognised Israel, which it refused to do.

In 2010, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Foreign Ministry]] said "Norway considers the Israeli presence in East Jerusalem to be in violation of international law, as does the entire international community."<ref>{{cite web |title=Norway concerned over situation in East Jerusalem |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/ud/press/News/2010/east_jerusalem.html?id=591172 |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=18 January 2010 |website=regjeringen.no |accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>

In 1981, a group of labour union members founded the organization Friends of Israel in the Norwegian Labour Movement (Norwegian: Venner av Israel i Norsk Arbeiderbevegelse). The purpose was to strengthen relations between Norwegian and Israeli labor movement in an informal and personal way. This was done by sending delegations to Israel, and by receiving visitors from Israel.

Israel's ambassador to Oslo was an [[Israeli Druze]] poet and university lecturer, [[Naim Araidi]]. His deputy was George Deek, a Christian Arab from Jaffa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/156686#.T-xdwfXCLmM|title=Israel Appoints Two Arab Diplomats in Norway|publisher=}}</ref> [[George Deek]] became chargé d'affaires at the embassy until the new ambassador Rafael Schultz started his mission in the summer of 2014.<ref name="KeinonCountry">{{cite news |last1=Keinon |first1=Herb |title=Jewish state appoints Christian envoy to Muslim country |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Jewish-state-sends-Christian-envoy-to-Muslim-country-572001 |accessdate=20 November 2018 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=15 November 2018}}</ref>

The leader of the third largest political party in Norway, [[Siv Jensen]] is a staunch supporter of Israel, and claim to "not [be] afraid to defend Israel's right to defend itself." She visited the Israeli city of [[Sderot]] in the summer of 2008, and experienced the landing of a rocket from [[Hamas]] first hand, and said that she and others had to "run for the air-raid shelter". She strongly opposed the Norwegian government's decision to recognise Hamas as she holds that "you don't negotiate with terrorists, you just don't."<ref name=standp>{{cite news|url=http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/692/full|title=A Norwegian Thatcher?|work=Standpoint|date=December 2008|first=Bruce|last=Bawer|access-date=17 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828193846/http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/692/full|archive-date=28 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In January 2009, she appeared at a demonstration called "Let Israel live" in Oslo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/valg09/-israels-krigfoering-var-ogsaa-terror-2884507.html|title=- Israels krigføring var også terror|work=TV2|date=1 September 2009|first=Eivind|last=Fondenes}}</ref> The [[Norwegian Police Security Service]] feared that Jensen might be the target of an attack although Jensen herself was not concerned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=539656|title=Politiet frykter angrep på Siv Jensen |work=VG|date=8 January 2009}}</ref> While political scientists had speculated that the Progress Party would lose more voters than they would gain by this strong support for Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/01/08/nyheter/innenriks/politikk/valg/frp/4289846/|title=- Frps Israel-støtte gir velgertap|work=Dagbladet|date=8 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/article2496700.ece|title=- Siv spiller høyt|work=Nettavisen|date=9 January 2009|first=Heidi Schei|last=Lilleås|access-date=17 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008122322/http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/article2496700.ece|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> polls showed a slight increase in support for the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article2502767.ece|title=Dette kan Siv ha tjent på|work=Nettavisen|date=13 January 2009|first=Lars Joakim|last=Skarvøy|access-date=17 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008122450/http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article2502767.ece|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Military relations ==
According to the media there are a number of Norwegian soldiers in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. In 2007, 24 Norwegian Jews were registered as working for the Israeli military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fofo.no/Ja,%20vi%20elsker%20Israel.b7C_wZzWXh.ips|title=Forsvarets forum » Seksjoner » Aktuelt » Ja, vi elsker Israel|publisher=|access-date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919080040/http://www.fofo.no/Ja,%20vi%20elsker%20Israel.b7C_wZzWXh.ips|archive-date=19 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September 2010, after Germany began testing two new [[Dolphin class submarine]]s for the [[Israeli Navy]], Norway banned them from testing in its territorial waters, due to their possible future role in enforcing the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com|title=Ynetnews - Homepage|publisher=}}</ref>
