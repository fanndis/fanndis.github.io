==Early life and education==
Curran grew up and was educated in Dunedin; she attended [[Kavanagh College|Moreau College]] where she achieved [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]]. She has a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] double major in Anthropology and History from the [[University of Otago]], and BA Honours in Anthropology from [[Victoria University of Wellington]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarecurran.org.nz/home/|title=Clare Curran for Dunedin South – Home|website=www.clarecurran.org.nz|access-date=2018-11-24}}</ref>{{Better source|date=November 2018}}

During an interview with the [[University of Otago]]'s student magazine [[Critic (magazine)|''Critic Te Arohi'']] in early March 2020, Curran acknowledged that she had been charged with possession for [[marijuana]] during her youth, for which she paid a NZ$50 fine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Critic – Te Arohi was live |url=https://www.facebook.com/critictearohi/videos/217156826143563/?comment_id=217168452809067 |website=Facebook |publisher=[[Critic (magazine)|Critic Te Arohi]] |accessdate=4 March 2020 |date=2 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dunedin South MP Clare Curran admits cannabis fine |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119955220/dunedin-south-mp-clare-curran-admits-cannabis-conviction |accessdate=4 March 2020 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dunedin South MP Clare Curran admits cannabis arrest |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12313436 |accessdate=4 March 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=3 March 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
Curran worked in communications for Australian unions over a number of years before returning to New Zealand in 2002 with her young family. She continued to work in public relations in Dunedin.<ref name=":0" /><sup>[''[[Wikipedia:NOTRS|better source needed]]'']</sup>

Curran joined the New Zealand Labour Party in 2006. She quickly rose to prominence within the Otago-Southland hierarchy, becoming a member of the Council of the New Zealand Labour Party.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clare Curran Biography|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/4/2/4/50MP169711-Curran-Clare.htm|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2006 Curran presented a paper to the Otago-Southland region of the Labour Party on "capturing the language" on climate change policy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hosking|first=Rob|title=Labour Massages the Message|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/labour-massages-message|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=National Business Review|date=1 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722011006/http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/labour-massages-message|archive-date=22 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In May 2006 Curran was appointed to a contractual role within the [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]] following a recommendation from Environment Minister [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]]'s office to provide communications advice on the Government's climate change strategy. This appointment was the subject of an investigation by the [[State Services Commission]] into the appropriateness of Curran's engagement.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rennie|first=Iain|title=Investigation into the Engagement of Clare Curran|url=http://www.ssc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/report-to-commissioner-engagement-curran.pdf|publisher=State Services Commission|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> The report found that the Ministry had failed to adequately identify Curran's conflict of interest with respect to her relationship with Minister Parker.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ministry botched Curran hiring|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/49148/Setchell-found-other-public-jobs-closed-to-her|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Dominion Post|date=14 November 2007}}</ref> The report found that a staff member in Parker's office had described Curran as Parker's "right-hand woman" and in an email to Environment Ministry Chief Executive Hugh Logan, and recommended that Curran meet with Logan to discuss communications. Logan resigned as Chief Executive of the Ministry hours before the State Services Commission's report into the Curran affair was released.

She is currently a member of many unions and political groups. She is a member of the [[Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union]] and the [[Service & Food Workers Union]]. She is also a member of [[Greenpeace]]. She was also on the Council of the New Zealand Labour Party as Otago-Southland regional representative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.nz/labour_team/nz_council/index.html |title=New Zealand Council Members |accessdate=2017-02-10 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026130148/http://www.labour.org.nz/labour_team/nz_council/index.html |archivedate=26 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[File:New-govt-2017.jpg|alt=Clare Curran in a large group shot of the new members of the Coalition Government in 2017|left|thumb|Curran posing with the new Government in 2017]]
Curran was elected as a Cabinet Minister by the Labour Party caucus following Labour's formation of a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|coalition government]] with [[New Zealand First]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/342022/video-who-s-in-who-s-out|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Who's in?

In addition, Curran was also allocated the associate portfolios for the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]] and the [[State Services Commission]].<ref name="DPMC" />
[[File:Signing the Digital 7 Charter.jpg|thumb|Curran signing the Digital 7 Charter in February 2018]]
At the [[NetHui|2017 NetHui]], Curran publicly proposed as part of her 100-day plan the formation of a [[chief technology officer]] (CTO) role for [[Government of New Zealand]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cio.co.nz/article/629786/clare-curran-cto-proposal-government-100-day-fast-track/|title=Hon.

Curran commented that "after careful consideration she had decided not to make an appointment at this stage and the search for a suitable candidate would be widened."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/101378255/government-to-widen-search-for-chief-technology-officer-after-none-of-60-candidates-convinces|title=Government to 'widen' search for chief technology officer after none of 60 candidates convinces|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>

In late March 2018, Curran became the subject of media attention after it emerged that she had secretly met with [[Radio New Zealand]] broadcaster and senior manager [[Carol Hirschfeld]] on 5 December 2017 outside of parliamentary business. Curran initially claimed the meeting was coincidental but later admitted it had been pre-arranged. These revelations led to Hirschfeld's resignation from her position as senior manager at Radio NZ. The meeting was related to the Labour-led government's plans to expand public broadcasting through Radio New Zealand. Curran's actions drew criticism from the National Party's broadcasting spokesperson [[Melissa Lee]], who accused Curran of engaging in a cover-up.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walters|first1=Laura|last2=Cooke|first2=Henry|title=Curran's 'informal' meeting with Carol Hirschfeld planned for an hour|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/102619960/rnz-senior-manager-carol-hirschfeld-resigns-over-meeting-with-minister|accessdate=11 April 2018|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=27 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Carol Hirschfeld resigns over Clare Curran meeting|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/carol-hirschfeld-resigns-over-clare-curran-meeting|accessdate=11 April 2018|agency=[[New Zealand Media and Entertainment|NZME]]|newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]]|date=27 March 2018}}</ref>

On 24 August 2018, Prime Minister Ardern dismissed Curran from the [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]] after Curran acknowledged that she had kept a second meeting off the records. In February, Curran had met with tech entrepreneur [[Derek Handley]] at her [[Beehive (New Zealand)|Beehive]] office to discuss his interest in the vacant Chief Technology Officer role. Curran had failed to disclose the meeting in her ministerial diary and to inform staff or officials about it. Curran apologized to the Prime Minister for her actions and also resigned from her positions as Minister of Government Digital Services and Minister of Open Government. Curran kept her Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media and associate [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] portfolios.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacinda Ardern sacks Clare Curran from Cabinet, removes her from two portfolios after second failure to declare a meeting |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/jacinda-ardern-sacks-clare-curran-cabinet-removes-her-two-portfolios-after-second-failure-declare-meeting |accessdate=24 August 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hurley |first1=Emma |title=Prime Minister removes Clare Curran from Cabinet |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/08/prime-minister-removes-clare-curran-from-cabinet.html |accessdate=24 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=24 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Clare Curran sacked from Cabinet, PM Jacinda Ardern announces |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12112984 |accessdate=24 August 2018 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=24 August 2018}}</ref>

On 5 September 2018, Curran "appeared flustered" and "stumbled over her answers" when answering questions during question time from opposition National MP [[Melissa Lee]] regarding Curran's use of a personal [[Gmail]] account for Ministerial use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/106851077/embattled-minister-clare-curran-struggles-to-explain-using-personal-email-for-government-business|accessdate=5 September 2018|title=Embattled minister Clare Curran struggles to explain using personal email for Government business|date=5 September 2018|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]}}</ref> Two days later Curran resigned as a Minister of Broadcasting and Associate Minister of ACC, saying she could "no longer endure the relentless pressure I've been under".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/106908738/clare-curran-resigns-as-minister |title=Clare Curran resigns as minister, citing 'intolerable' pressure |first=Henry |last=Cooke |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=7 September 2018 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>

On 27 August 2019, Curran announced that she would be retiring from Parliament and not seek election at the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]].<ref name="NZH 27 Aug 2019" /><ref name="TVNZ 27 Aug 2019" /> As of late August 2019, Curran sits on Parliament's Justice and Electoral select committees.<ref name="Houlahan 31 Aug 2019">{{cite news |last1=Houlahan |first1=Mike |title=Curran's career in perspective |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/politics/currans-career-perspective |accessdate=31 August 2019 |newspaper=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=31 August 2019}}</ref> On 2 March 2020, former lawyer, journalist and director of the British Council New Zealand, [[Ingrid Leary]], was nominated as the Labour candidate for Dunedin South to succeed Curran.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Houlahan |first1=Mike |title=Labour picks Dunedin South seat candidate |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/labour-picks-dunedin-south-seat-candidate |accessdate=6 March 2020 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=2 March 2020}}</ref> 

Ahead of her retirement, Curran gave an exclusive interview to [[Donna Chisholm]]. In it she talked in detail about the "toxicity and bullying" she experienced in her political career, and in particular about the pressures she felt during her time as a minister, which culminated in her demotion and resignation. This led to her receiving months of treatment for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Curran made a number of allegations about parliamentary colleagues. She specifically alleged that in 2012 Dunedin-based National list MP [[Michael Woodhouse]] and other National MPs had taken part in an event where she was mocked with a toilet seat emblazoned with her photo. She supplied to Chisholm an image of Woodhouse with the seat. Curran also stated that in 2006, before she entered Parliament, National MP [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]] had compared her to [[Joseph Goebbels]], and that during their time in Parliament, [[Jacinda Ardern]] had been derided for her then childless status by National MPs [[Maggie Barry]] and [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]]. Barry's remarks in 2012 had received public attention.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Trevett |first1=Claire |title=Barry mocked for childless snipe |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10822482 |accessdate=5 July 2020 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=27 July 2012}}</ref>  In addition to naming National MPs who she alleged had engaged in bullying, Curran told Chisholm about an incident with a senior Labour colleague at the end of her first year in Parliament, who she did not name. This colleague she described as telling her that she was "a victim, a femme fatale, and that [she] used [her] sexuality as a weapon."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chisholm |first1=Donna |title=I physically felt like I was going to die’: Clare Curran opens up on politics, toxicity and trauma |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/04-07-2020/clare-curran-interview-donna-chisholm/ |website=The Spinoff |accessdate=4 July 2020}}</ref> When asked for comment on the toilet seat allegation by the ''New Zealand Herald'', Woodhouse responded "To be honest I cannot really remember it, and I don't think an eight-year-old photo is a burning issue of the day."<ref>{{cite news |title=Labour MP Clare Curran reveals 'traumatised' impact of 'dirty politics' campaign |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=12345480 |accessdate=4 July 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> The independent MP [[Jami-Lee Ross]], who left the National Party in a high-profile incident that included accusations of bullying against him, and who himself had dealt with mental health issues, apologised to Curran for the tactics of his former party.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manhire |first1=Toby |title=‘We wanted to break her’ – Jami-Lee Ross weighs in on Clare Curran story |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/04-07-2020/we-wanted-to-break-her-jami-lee-ross-weighs-in-on-clare-curran-story/ |website=The Spinoff |accessdate=4 July 2020}}</ref>
