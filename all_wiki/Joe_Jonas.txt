'''Joseph Adam Jonas''' (born August 15, 1989)<ref name=allmusic-bio>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-jonas-mn0002622976/biography | title= Joe Jonas Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic.com]] | access-date= December 2, 2013}}</ref> is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to fame as a member of the [[pop rock]] band the [[Jonas Brothers]], alongside his brothers [[Kevin Jonas|Kevin]] and [[Nick Jonas|Nick]]. The group released their debut studio album ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'' through the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label in 2006, which failed to achieve commercial success. After signing with [[Hollywood Records]], the group released their [[Jonas Brothers (album)|self-titled second studio album]] in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the [[Disney Channel]] during this time, gaining a large following through the network: they appeared in the widely successful musical television film ''[[Camp Rock]]'' (2008) and its sequel ''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]'' (2010) as well as two of their own series, ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'' (2008–2010) and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' (2009–2010).

The band's third studio album, ''[[A Little Bit Longer]]'' (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single "[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]" hit the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Their [[Lines, Vines and Trying Times|fourth studio album]], while still successful on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, saw a decline in record sales. After the group confirmed a hiatus, Joe released his debut solo studio album, ''[[Fastlife]]'' (2011), which saw moderate commercial success. After the Jonas Brothers officially parted ways due to creative differences, Jonas formed the [[funk|funk-pop]] band [[DNCE]] in 2015, serving as the lead vocalist. The group saw the significant commercial success of their debut single "[[Cake by the Ocean]]", which peaked at number 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States.
