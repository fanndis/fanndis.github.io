{{Danish Royal Family}}
'''Margrethe II''' ({{IPA-da|mɑˈkʁeˀtə|lang}}; born ''Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid''; 16 April 1940) is [[Queen of Denmark]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Danish Defence]]. Born into the [[House of Glücksburg]], a [[royal house]] with origins in [[northern Germany]], she was the eldest child of [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] and [[Ingrid of Sweden]]. She became [[heir presumptive]] to her father in 1953, when [[Danish Act of Succession|a constitutional amendment]] allowed women to inherit the throne.

Margrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]], ruler of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in 1375–1412 during the [[Kalmar Union]]. In 1967, she married [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], with whom she had two sons: [[Crown Prince Frederik]] and [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]].

==Early life==
[[File:Amalienborg cph.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg]], photographed in 2006]]
Princess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at [[Amalienborg]] in [[Copenhagen]] as the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later [[King Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid]]). Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning [[King Christian X]], while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]]). Her birth took place just one week after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940.<ref name=r1/>

She was [[baptism|baptised]] on 14 May in the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=r1/> The Princess's [[godparent]]s were: [[King Christian X]] (paternal grandfather); [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]] (paternal uncle); [[Prince Axel of Denmark|Prince Axel]] (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V of Sweden]] (maternal great-grandfather); [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (maternal grandfather); [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten]] (her maternal uncle); [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (maternal great-grandfather).

She was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the [[King of Iceland]], she was given the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name Þórhildur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Navnet til den ny prinsesse... | website = nfi.ku.dk | publisher = Nordisk Forskningsinstitut, [[University of Copenhagen]] | date = 18 May 2012 | url = http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | access-date = 23 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083411/http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | archive-date = 2 February 2017 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

When Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Princess Benedikte]] was born. Princess Benedikte later married [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Princess Anne-Marie]], was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].

Margrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gråsten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.

She is "known affectionately as Daisy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16537659|title=Denmark's Queen Margrethe marks 40 years|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=13 January 2012|website=BBC News}}</ref>

==Heir presumptive==
[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]
At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|Glücksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.

The process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>

On her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>

In 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Education===
Margrethe was educated at the private school [[N. Zahle's School]] in Copenhagen from which she graduated in 1959. She spent a year at [[North Foreland Lodge]], a [[boarding school]] for girls in [[Hampshire]], England,<ref name=ILN>{{cite news|work=The Illustrated London News|volume=227|issue=2 |year=1955|page=552|title=Princess Margrethe, who is fifteen and is heir presumptive to the Danish throne, is to study for a year in England at North Foreland Lodge, a girls' boarding school near Basingstoke, in Hampshire...}}</ref> and later studied [[prehistoric]] [[archaeology]] at [[Girton College, Cambridge]], during 1960–1961, [[political science]] at [[Aarhus University]] between 1961 and 1962, attended the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1963, and was at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1965.<ref name="Margrethe and Henrik Biography"/> She is a [[Fellow]] of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].<ref name=r1/>

Queen Margrethe is fluent in [[Danish language|Danish]], French, English, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and German, and has a limited knowledge of [[Faroese language|Faroese]].<ref name=r1/><ref name="Margrethe and Henrik Biography"/>

===Marriage and children===
[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg|left|thumb|Queen Margrethe II and her consort, Prince Henrik, in 2010.]]
Princess Margrethe married a French diplomat, [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], 10 June 1967, at the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]]. Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of "His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.

Margrethe gave birth to her first child on 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederik or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born on 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>

==Reign==
[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]]. Stamp FR 302 of [[Postverk Føroya]], [[Faroe Islands]], issued 14 January 1997.]]

===Succession===
Shortly after [[Frederick IX of Denmark|King Frederick IX]] delivered his New Year's Address to the Nation at the 1971/72 turn of the year, he fell ill. At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972 by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style "[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds Nåde Danmarks Dronning}}). The Queen chose the [[Royal mottos of Danish monarchs|motto]]: ''God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.''<ref name="Margrethe and Henrik Biography"/>

In her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said: {{quote|My beloved father, our King, is dead. The task that my father had carried for nearly 25 years is now resting on my shoulders. I pray to God to give me help and strength to carry the heavy heritage. May the trust that was given to my father also be granted to me.<ref name="radical royalist">{{cite journal|url=http://radicalroyalist.blogspot.com.br/2012_01_01_archive.html#post-body-3282259268133616607|publisher=Radical Royalist|title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark 40 years on the Throne|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>}}

===Constitutional role===
The Queen's main tasks are to represent the Kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. 

As an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>

The Queen holds a meeting with the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|prime minister]] and the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|foreign affairs minister]] every Wednesday, unless she or the prime minister is outside of the [[Kingdom of Denmark|kingdom]].

After an election where the incumbent prime minister does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a "Dronningerunde" (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Each party has the choice of selecting a royal investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent prime minister the mandate to continue his or her government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as royal investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one royal investigator is chosen plus the prime minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)

Once the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].

In addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[colonel-in-chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>

===Ruby Jubilee===
Queen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.

=== Immigration debate ===
In an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste rødder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of [[Culture of Denmark|Danish culture]] in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.<ref name="tv2_dk_23October2016">{{cite news|title=Historiker om Margrethes danskheds-udtalelse: - Hun har fulgt folkesjælens bekymringer|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2016-10-23-historiker-om-margrethes-danskheds-udtalelse-hun-har-fulgt-folkesjaelens|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)]]|date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref name="b_dk_22October2016">{{cite news|title=Dronning Margrethe om integration: "Det er ikke en naturlov, at man bliver dansker af at bo i Danmark"|url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/dronning-margrethe-om-integration-det-er-ikke-en-naturlov-at-man-bliver-dans|accessdate=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=22 October 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life and interests==

The official residences of the Queen are [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen and [[Fredensborg Palace]]. Her summer residence is [[Gråsten Palace]] near [[Sønderborg]], the former home of her mother, Queen Ingrid, who died in 2000.

Margrethe is an accomplished [[Painting|painter]], and has held many art shows over the years. Her illustrations—under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer—were used for Danish editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]] for the [[Folio Society]]'s English edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', first published in 1977 and reissued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's [[Cantabile (book)|poetry collection ''Cantabile'']]. She is also an accomplished [[Translation|translator]] and is said to have participated in the Danish translation of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name="Margrethe and Henrik Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.royalinsight.net/content/margrethe-henrik-biography |title=Margrethe and Henrik Biography |publisher=Royalinsight.net |date=16 April 1940 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030181923/http://www.royalinsight.net/content/margrethe-henrik-biography |archivedate=30 October 2011 }}</ref>  Another skill she possesses is costume designing, having designed the costumes for the [[Royal Danish Ballet]]'s production of ''[[A Folk Tale]]'' and for the 2009 [[Peter Flinth]] film, ''De vilde svaner'' (''The Wild Swans'').<ref name=r1>{{cite web|url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-royal-house/Regentparret/hm-the-queen|publisher=Kongehuset.dk| title=Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=Imdb>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1499643/|title=De vilde svaner (2009)| website=[[Internet Movie Database]]| accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices.
