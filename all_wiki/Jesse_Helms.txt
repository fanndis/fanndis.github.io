{{Jesse Helms series}}
'''Jesse Alexander Helms Jr.''' (October 18, 1921 – July 4, 2008) was an American journalist, media executive, and politician. A leader in the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] movement, he served as a senator from North Carolina from 1973 to 2003. As chairman of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] from 1995 to 2001 he had a major voice in foreign policy. Helms helped organize and fund the conservative resurgence in the 1970s, focusing on [[Ronald Reagan]]'s quest for the White House as well as helping many local and regional candidates.

Helms was the longest-serving popularly elected Senator in North Carolina's history. He was widely credited with shifting the one-party state into a competitive two-party state.  He advocated the movement of conservatives from the Democratic Party – which they deemed too liberal – to the Republican Party. The Helms-controlled [[National Congressional Club]]'s state-of-the-art [[direct mail]] operation raised millions of dollars for Helms and other conservative candidates, allowing Helms to outspend his opponents in most of his campaigns.<ref>William A. Link, ''Righteous Warrior: Jesse Helms and the Rise of Modern Conservatism'' (2008) p. 557</ref> Helms was the most stridently conservative politician of the post-1960s era,<ref>Bruce Frohnen, ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' (2006) p. 379</ref> especially in opposition to federal intervention into what he considered state affairs (including legislating [[racial integration|integration]] via the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and enforcing suffrage through the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]]).

As long-time chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he demanded a staunchly anti-communist foreign policy that would reward America's friends abroad, and punish its enemies. His relations with the State Department were often acrimonious, and he blocked numerous presidential appointees.

In domestic affairs, Helms promoted industrial development in the South, seeking low taxes and few labor unions so as to attract Northern and international corporations to relocate to North Carolina. On social issues, Helms was conservative. He was a master obstructionist who relished his nickname, "Senator No".<ref>Congressional Quarterly, ''Politics in America 1992: The 102 Congress'' (1991) p 927</ref>  He combined cultural, social and economic conservatism, which often helped his legislation win wide public  support. He fought what he considered to be liberalism by opposing [[civil rights]], [[disability rights]], [[second-wave feminism|feminism]], [[gay rights]], [[affirmative action]], access to [[abortion in the United States|abortions]], the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].<ref>Link (2008)</ref>  Helms brought an "aggressiveness"  to his conservatism, as in his rhetoric against [[homosexuality]].<ref name="Snider_Helms_Hunt_1985">{{cite book |author=William D.

==Childhood and education (1921–1940)==
[[File:Jesse Helms, Sr., quotation, Wingate, NC IMG 4260.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Advice from Jesse A. Helms, Sr., to his son; [[Jesse Helms Center]] in [[Wingate, North Carolina]]]]
Helms was born in 1921 in [[Monroe, North Carolina]], where his father, nicknamed "Big Jesse", served as both fire chief and chief of police; his mother, Ethel Mae Helms, was a homemaker. Helms was of English ancestry on both sides.<ref name="Link 2008 ch 1">Link (2008) ch 1</ref> Helms described Monroe as a community surrounded by farmland and with a population of about three thousand where "you knew just about everybody and just about everybody knew you."<ref name=Helms3>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|pages=3–5|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref> The Helms family was poor during the [[Great Depression]], resulting in each of the children working from an early age. Helms acquired his first job sweeping floors at ''The Monroe Enquirer'' at age 9.<ref name=Helms3 /> The family attended services each Sunday at First Baptist, Helms later saying he would never forget being served chickens raised in the family's backyard by his mother, following their weekly services. He recalled initially being bothered by their chickens becoming their food, but abandoned this view to allow himself to concentrate on his mother's cooking.<ref name=Helms3 /> Helms recalled that his family rarely spoke about politics, reasoning that the political climate did not call for discussions as most of the people the family were acquainted with were members of the [[Southern Democrats|Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|page=9|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref>

Link described Helms's father as having a domineering influence on the child's development, describing the pair as being similar in having the traits of being extrovert, effusive, and enjoying the company of others while both favored constancy, loyalty, and respect for order.<ref>Link, p. 23.</ref> The elder Helms asserted to Jesse that ambition was good and accomplishments and achievements would come his way through following a strict work ethic.<ref>Link, p. 20.</ref> Years later, Helms retained fond memories of his father's involvement with his youth: "I shall forever have wonderful memories of a caring, loving father who took the time to listen and to explain things to his wide-eyed son."<ref>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|page=10|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref>

Helms briefly attended Wingate Junior College, now [[Wingate University]], near Monroe, before leaving for [[Wake Forest College]]. He left Wingate after a year to begin a career as a [[journalist]], working for the next eleven years as a newspaper and radio reporter, first as a sportswriter and news reporter for Raleigh's ''[[The News & Observer]]'', and also as assistant city editor for ''[[The Raleigh Times]]''. Helms retained a positive view of Wingate into his later years, saying the school was filled with individuals that treated him with kindness and that he had made it an objective to repay the institution for what it had done for him.<ref>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|page=18|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref> While attending Wake Forest, Helms left work early and ran a few blocks to catch a train every morning to ensure he was on time to his classes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|pages=15–16|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref> Helms stated that his goal in attending was never to get a diploma but instead form the skills needed for forms of employment he was seeking at a time when he aspired to become a journalist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|page=17|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==
Helms met Dorothy "Dot" Coble, editor of the [[society page]] at ''The News & Observer'', and they married in 1942. Helms's first interest in politics came from conversations with his conservative father-in-law.<ref name="Link 2008 ch 1"/> In 1945, his and Dot's first child Jane was born.

==Early career (1940–1972)==
Helms's first full-time job after college was as a [[sports journalism|sports reporter]] with ''[[The Raleigh Times]]''.<ref name="times background">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/05/us/politics/00helms.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp|title=Jesse Helms, Conservative Force in the Senate, Dies at 86|last=Holmes|first=Steven A. |date=July 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> During [[World War II]], Helms served stateside as a recruiter in the [[United States Navy]].

After the war, he pursued his twin interests of journalism and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics. Helms became the city news editor of ''The Raleigh Times.'' He later became a radio and television newscaster and commentator for ''[[WRAL-TV]]'', where he hired [[Armistead Maupin]] as a reporter.<ref name="logicalfamily7682">{{cite book|last1=Maupin|first1=Armistead|title=Logical Family: A Memoir|date=2017|publisher=Penguin|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9780857523518|pages=76–82|title-link=Logical Family: A Memoir}}</ref>

===Entry into politics===

In 1950, Helms played a critical role as campaign publicity director for [[Willis Smith]] in the U.S. Senate campaign against a prominent [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[Frank Porter Graham]].<ref name="Borstelmann TCWA 65">{{cite book | last = Borstelmann | first =Thomas | title=The Cold War and the Color Line: American Race Relations in the Global Arena | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2003 | pages =65–66 | isbn =0-674-01238-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWqjxBEPPlEC&pg=PA65 | accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> Smith (a conservative Democratic lawyer and former president of the [[American Bar Association]]) portrayed Graham, who supported school [[desegregation]], as a "dupe of communists" and a proponent of the "[[miscegenation|mingling of the races]]".<ref name="Borstelmann TCWA 65"/> Smith's fliers said, "Wake Up, White People",<ref name="Borstelmann TCWA 65"/> in the campaign for the virtually all-[[white primary|white primaries]]. Blacks were still mostly [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] in the state, because its 1900 constitutional amendment had been passed by white Democrats with restrictive voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively and severely reduced their role in electoral politics.<ref name="Borstelmann TCWA 65"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Article VI. Suffrage and Eligibility to Office – Qualifications of an Elector.|url=http://core.ecu.edu/umc/Wilmington/scans/ticketThree/articleSix.pdf|publisher=[[East Carolina University]]|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>

Smith won and hired Helms as his administrative assistant in Washington. In 1952, Helms worked on the presidential [[1952 United States presidential election|campaign]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] After Russell dropped out of the presidential race, Helms returned to working for Smith. When Smith died in 1953, Helms returned to Raleigh.

From 1953 to 1960, Helms was executive director of the North Carolina Bankers Association. He and his wife set up their home on Caswell Street in the [[Hayes Barton Historic District]], where he lived the rest of his life.<ref name="Christensen TNO 4 Jy">{{cite web |last=Christensen |first=Rob |title=Jesse Helms dead at 86 |work=The News & Observer |location=Raleigh, NC |date=July 4, 2008 |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1130628.html |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713080158/http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1130628.html |archive-date=July 13, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1957, Helms as a Democrat won his first election for a [[Raleigh City Council]] seat. He served two terms and earned a reputation as a conservative gadfly who "fought against everything from putting a median strip on Downtown Boulevard to an [[urban renewal]] project".<ref name="Christensen TNO 4 Jy"/> Helms disliked his tenure on the council, feeling all the other members acted as a private club and that Mayor [[William G. Enloe]] was a "steamroller".{{sfn|Link|2008|p=60}} In 1960, Helms worked on the unsuccessful primary gubernatorial campaign of [[I.

Helms felt [[desegregation busing in the United States|forced busing]] and forced racial integration caused animosity on both sides and "proved to be unwise".<ref name="Drescher TOGW"/>

===Capitol Broadcasting Company===
In 1960, Helms joined the Raleigh-based [[Capitol Broadcasting Company]] (CBC) as the executive vice-president, vice chairman of the board, and assistant chief executive officer. His daily CBC editorials on [[WRAL-TV]], given at the end of each night's local news broadcast in Raleigh, made Helms famous as a conservative commentator throughout eastern North Carolina.

Helms's editorials featured folksy anecdotes interwoven with conservative views against "the civil rights movement, the liberal news media, and anti-war churches," among many targets.<ref name="Christensen TNO 4 Jy"/> He referred to ''[[The News and Observer]]'', his former employer, as the "Nuisance and Disturber" for its promotion of liberal views and support for African-American civil rights activities.<ref name="Christiansen TNO 10 Jy">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/politicians/helms/story/291092.html |title=Helms' long-held views on race muted in book |first=Rob |last=Christiansen |work=[[News & Observer]] |location=Raleigh, NC |date=June 10, 2005 |page=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606051301/http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/politicians/helms/story/291092.html |archive-date=June 6, 2009 }}</ref> The [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], which had a reputation for liberalism, was also a frequent target of Helms's criticism. He is said to have referred to the university as "The University of Negroes and Communists" despite a lack of evidence,<ref name="Batten 2012">{{cite news | url=http://obsdailyviews.blogspot.com/2012/12/jesse-helms-and-university-of-negroes.html| work=[[Charlotte Observer]]|location=Charlotte, NC| date=December 6, 2012 | title=Jesse Helms and the 'University of Negroes and Communists'| first=Taylor | last=Batten}}</ref> and suggested a wall be erected around the campus to prevent the university's liberal views from "infecting" the rest of the state. Helms said the civil rights movement was infested by [[Communists]] and "moral degenerates." He described the federal program of [[Medicaid]] as a "step over into the swampy field of socialized medicine".<ref name="Christensen TNO 4 Jy"/>

Commenting on the 1963 protests and [[March on Washington]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Helms stated, "The negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint that's thus far left him free to clog the streets, disrupt traffic, and interfere with other men's rights."<ref name="sack">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9A0CE6DB1031F935A1575BC0A9679C8B63&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title= Ideas & Trends; The Quotations of Chairman Helms: Race, God, AIDS and More|last=Kevin|first=Sack|date=August 26, 2001|work=New York Times|accessdate=August 29, 2008}}</ref> He later wrote, "Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are facts of life which must be faced."<ref name="thunder">{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B14FB385F0C7B8CDDAB0894D9484D81|title=Thunder from the Right|last=Range|first=Peter Ross|date=February 8, 1981|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}</ref>

He was at Capitol Broadcasting Company until he filed for the Senate race in 1972.

===Senate campaign of 1972===
{{Main|1972 United States Senate election in North Carolina}}

Helms announced his candidacy for a seat in the [[United States Senate]] in 1972. His Republican primary campaign was managed by [[Thomas F. Ellis]], who would later be instrumental in [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1976 campaign and also become the chair of the [[National Congressional Club]]. Helms took the Republican primary, winning 92,496 votes, or 60.1%, in a three-candidate field.<ref name="SouthNow 46">{{cite web|title=North Carolina DataNet #46 |url=http://southnow.org/southnow-publications/nc-datanet/DataNet%20April08.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181120/http://southnow.org/southnow-publications/nc-datanet/DataNet%20April08.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-27 |date=April 2008 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina]] |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}</ref> Meanwhile, Democrats retired the ailing Senator [[B. Everett Jordan]], who lost his primary to Congressman [[Nick Galifianakis (politician)|Nick Galifianakis]]. The latter represented the "new politics" of voters who included the young, African Americans voting since federal legislation removed discriminatory restrictions, and anti-establishment activists, who were based in and around the urban [[Research Triangle]] and [[Piedmont Triad]]. Although Galifianakis was a "liberal" by North Carolina standards, he opposed [[Desegregation busing in the United States|busing]] to achieve integration in schools.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marjorie |last=Hunter |title=Defeat of Jordan by Rep. Galifianakis In Carolina is Linked to 'New Politics{{'-}} |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 5, 1972 |page=26 }}</ref>

Polls put Galifianakis well ahead until late in the campaign, but Helms, facing all but certain defeat, hired a professional campaign manager, F. Clifton White, giving him dictatorial control over campaign strategy. While Galifianakis avoided mention of his party's presidential candidate, the liberal [[George McGovern]],<ref name="Major races in NC seem close">{{cite news |first=Marjorie |last=Hunter |title=Major Races in North Carolina Seem Close |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 28, 1972 |page=14 }}</ref> Helms employed the slogans "McGovernGalifianakis – one and the same", "Vote for Jesse.

In a taste of things to come, money poured into the race. Helms spent a record $654,000,<ref name="It'll be a yes">{{cite news |title=North Carolina; It'll be a yes for Senator No |work=[[The Economist]] |date=February 11, 1978 |page=42 }}</ref> much of it going toward carefully crafted television commercials portraying him as a soft-spoken mainstream conservative. In the final six weeks of the campaign, Helms outspent Galifianakis three-to-one.<ref name="Major races in NC seem close" /> Though the year was marked by Democratic gains in the Senate,<ref name="Democrats Gain 2 Seats" /> Helms won 54 percent of the vote to Galifianakis's 46 percent. He was elected as the first Republican senator from the state since 1903,  before senators were directly elected, and when the Republican Party stood for a different tradition.<ref name="Conservative Republican Victor">{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Charlton |title=Conservative Republican Victor in North Carolina Senate Race |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 8, 1972 |page=5 }}</ref> Helms was helped by [[Richard Nixon]]'s gigantic landslide victory in that year's presidential election;<ref name="Pundit to Pol">{{cite news|first=John |last=Gizzi |title=Jesse Helms: Pundit to Pol |url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=27366 |work=[[Human Events]] |date=July 5, 2008 |accessdate=July 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108083837/http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=27366 |archive-date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> Nixon carried North Carolina by 40 points.

Helms quickly became a "star" of the conservative movement,<ref>{{cite news |title=Conservatives; Third Men |work=[[The Economist]] |page=58 |date=February 22, 1975 }}</ref> and was particularly vociferous on the issue of [[abortion]]. In 1974, in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Roe v.

In May 1974, when the Senate approved the establishment of no‐fault automobile insurance plans in every state, it rejected an amendment by Helms exempting states that were opposed to no‐fault insurance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/02/archives/senate-53-to-42-supports-nofault-auto-insurance-advantages-cited.html|title=Senate, 53 to 42, Supports No‐Fault Auto Insurance|date=May 2, 1974|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
From the start, Helms identified as a prominent anti-communist. He proposed an act in 1974 that authorized the President to grant [[Honorary Citizen of the United States|honorary citizenship]] to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dissident [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Honorary Citizenship Voted for Solzhenitsyn |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 5, 1974 |page=19 }}</ref> He remained close to Solzhenitsyn's cause, and linked his fight to that of freedom throughout the world.<ref>{{cite news |first=Fred M. |last=Hechinger |title=Suspension of Reality |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 24, 1976 |page=29 }}</ref> In 1975, as [[North Vietnam]]ese forces [[Fall of Saigon|approached Saigon]], Helms was foremost among those urging the US to evacuate all Vietnamese demanding this, which he believed could be "two million or more within seven days".<ref>{{cite news |title=Seventh Fleet should rescue all who wish to leave, senator says |work=[[The Times]] |page=1 |date=April 4, 1975 }}</ref> When the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] voted to suppress a report critical of the US's strategic position in the [[arms race]], Helms read the entire report out, requiring it to be published in full in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Cosgrave |title=The arms report Congress tried to suppress |work=[[The Times]] |page=16 |date=June 21, 1978 }}</ref>

Helms was not at first a strong supporter of Israel; for instance, in 1973 he proposed a resolution demanding Israel return the [[West Bank]] to [[Jordan]], and, in 1975, demanding that the Palestinian Arabs receive a "just settlement of their grievances".<ref name="Link 318">Link (2007), p. 318</ref> In 1977, Helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting American companies from joining the [[Arab League boycott of Israel]],<ref>{{cite news |title=US Senate votes for anti-boycott Bill |work=[[The Times]] |page=4 |date=May 7, 1977 }}</ref> but that was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against Communist countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arab boycott; Morality with a loophole |work=[[The Economist]] |page=47 |date=May 14, 1977 }}</ref> In 1982, Helms called for the US to break diplomatic relations with Israel during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].<ref>{{cite news |title=It gets less easy to support Israel |work=[[The Economist]] |page=35 |date=August 14, 1982 }}</ref> He favored prohibiting foreign aid to countries that had recently detonated nuclear weapons: this was aimed squarely at India, but it also affected Israel should it conduct a [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear test]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Foreign aid; little largess |work=[[The Economist]] |page=70 |date=November 15, 1975 }}</ref> He worked to support the supply of arms to the United States' Arab allies under presidents Carter and Reagan, until his views on Israel shifted significantly in 1984.<ref name="Link 318" />

Helms and [[Bob Dole]] offered an amendment in 1973 that would have delayed cutting off funding for bombing in [[Cambodia]] if the President informed Congress that North Vietnam was not making an accounting "to the best of its ability" of US servicemen missing in [[Southeast Asia]]. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 56 to 25.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/01/archives/house-must-act-its-version-is-milderdelay-in-sending-bill-to-nixon.html|title=HOUSE MUST ACT|first=Richard L.|last=Madden|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

=== Nixon resignation ===
Helms delivered a Senate speech blaming liberal media for distorting Watergate and questioned if President Nixon had a constitutional right to be considered innocent until proven guilty following the April 1973 revelation of details relating to the scandal and Nixon administration aides resigning. He advocated against illegal activities being condoned with concurrent "half-truth and allegations" being reported by the media. Helms had four separate meetings with President Nixon in April and May 1973 where he attempted to cheer up the president and called for the White House to challenge its critics even as fellow Republicans from North Carolina criticized Nixon. Helms opposed the creation of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices in the summer of 1973, even as it was chaired by fellow North Carolina Senator [[Sam Ervin]], arguing that it was a ploy by Democrats to discredit and oust Nixon.<ref name=Link137>Link (2008), pp. 137–138</ref>

In August 1974, ''[[Newsweek]]'' published a list by the White House including Helms as one of thirty-six senators that the administration believed would support President Nixon in the event of his impeachment and being brought to trial by the Senate. The article stated that some supporters were not fully convinced and this would further peril the administration as 34 needed to prevent conviction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/05/archives/36-senators-seen-as-nixon-backers-magazine-says-7-democrats-may.html|title=36 SENATORS SEEN AS NIXON BACKERS|date=August 5, 1974|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> Nixon resigned days later and kept contact with Helms during his post-presidency,  calling Helms to either chat or offer advice.<ref name=Link137/>

===1976 presidential election===
{{Main|1976 United States presidential election}}

Helms supported [[Ronald Reagan]] for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976|presidential nomination in 1976]], even before Reagan had announced his candidacy.<ref>Shirley (2005), p. 23</ref> His contribution was crucial in the North Carolina primary victory that paved the way for Reagan's presidential election in 1980. The support of Helms, alongside Raleigh-based campaign operative [[Thomas F. Ellis]], was instrumental in Reagan's winning the North Carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]]. According to author [[Craig Shirley]], the two men deserve credit "for breathing life into the dying Reagan campaign".<ref>Shirley (2005), p. 160</ref> Going into the primary, Reagan had lost all the primaries, including in New Hampshire, where he had been favored, and was two million dollars in debt, with a growing number of Republican leaders calling for his exit.<ref name="Craig Shirley 176">Shirley (2005), p. 176</ref> The Ford campaign was predicting a victory in North Carolina, but assessed Reagan's strength in the state simply: Helms's support.<ref>Shirley (2005), p. 61</ref> While Ford had the backing of Governor [[James Holshouser]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Fred |last=Emery |title=Do-or-die for the two main challengers in fickle North Carolina |work=[[The Times]] |page=8 |date=March 14, 1976 }}</ref> the grassroots movement formed in North Carolina by Ellis and backed by Helms delivered an upset victory by 53% to 47%.<ref>Shirley (2005), p. 175</ref> The momentum generated in North Carolina carried Ronald Reagan to landslide primary wins in Texas, California, and other critical states, evening the contest between Reagan and Ford, and forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention.

Later, Helms was not pleased by the announcement that Reagan, if nominated, would ask the 1976 Republican National Convention to make moderate [[Pennsylvania]] Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] his running mate for the general election,<ref>{{cite news |first=Fred |last=Emery |title=Choice of liberal outrages some of Mr Reagan's supporters |work=[[The Times]] |page=6 |date=July 28, 1976 }}</ref> but kept his objections to himself at the time.<ref name="Craig Shirley 275">Shirley (2005), p. 275</ref> According to Helms, after Reagan told him of the decision, Helms noted the hour because, "I wanted to record for posterity the exact time I received the shock of my life."<ref name="Craig Shirley 275"/> Helms and [[Strom Thurmond]] tried to make Reagan drop Schweiker for a conservative, perhaps either James Buckley<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Wicker |author-link=Tom Wicker |title=The Paradox in Kansas City |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 13, 1976 |page=18 }}</ref> or his brother [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], and rumors surfaced that Helms might run for Vice President himself,<ref name="Craig Shirley 311">Shirley (2005), p. 311</ref> but Schweiker was kept. In the end, Reagan lost narrowly to Ford at the Convention, while Helms received only token support for the Vice Presidential nomination, albeit enough to place him second, far behind Ford's choice of [[Bob Dole]]. The Convention adopted a broadly conservative platform, and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners; except Jesse Helms.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anthony |last=Lewis |author-link=Anthony Lewis |title=Aground on a Rock |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 19, 1976 |page=35 }}</ref>

Helms vowed to campaign actively for Ford across the South, regarding the conservative platform adopted at the Convention to be a "mandate" on which Ford was pledging to run. However, he targeted [[Henry Kissinger]] after the latter issued a statement calling Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a "threat to world peace," and Helms demanded that Kissinger embrace the platform or resign immediately.<ref>{{cite news |title=Helms Calls for Kissinger to Back Platform or Quit |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/09/09/118457728.pdf |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 9, 1976 |page=32 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> Helms continued to back Reagan, and the two remained close friends and political allies throughout Reagan's political career, although sometimes critical of each other.<ref name="Holmes, NYT 5 Jy">{{cite news | last = Holmes | first =Steven A. | title=Jesse Helms Dies at 86; Conservative Force in the Senate | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 5, 2008 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/05/us/politics/00helms.html | accessdate=July 12, 2008}}</ref> Despite Reagan's defeat at the convention, the intervention of Helms and Ellis arguably led to the most important conservative primary victory in the history of the Republican Party. This victory enabled Reagan to contest the 1976 Republican Presidential nomination, and to win the next nomination at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] and ultimately the [[presidency of the United States]].

According to Craig Shirley,
<blockquote>Had Reagan lost North Carolina, despite his public pronouncements, his revolutionary challenge to Ford, along with his political career, would have ended unceremoniously. He would have made a gracious exit speech, cut a deal with the Ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt, made a minor speech at the Kansas City Convention later that year, and returned to his ranch in Santa Barbara. He would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and cut radio commercials to supplement his income. And Reagan would have faded into political oblivion.<ref name="Craig Shirley 176"/></blockquote>

===Torrijos–Carter treaties===
{{Main|Torrijos–Carter Treaties}}

Helms was a long-time opponent of transferring possession of the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Panama]], calling its construction an "historic American achievement."<ref name="Link 188">Link (2008), p. 188</ref> He warned that it would fall into the hands of [[Omar Torrijos]]'s "communist friends". The issue of transfer of the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race, wherein then-President Ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition. In 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] reopened negotiations, appointing [[Sol Linowitz]] as co-negotiator without Senate confirmation, and Helms and Strom Thurmond led the opposition to the transfer.<ref name="Carter, Panama, and China">{{cite news |first=James |last=Reston |author-link=James Reston |title=Carter, Panama, and China |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 24, 1977 |page=19 }}</ref> Helms claimed that Linowitz's involvement with [[Marine Midland]] constituted a conflict of interests, arguing that it constituted a [[bailout]] of American banking interests.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hastedt |first=Glenn P. |author2=Eksterowicz, Anthony J. |year=2001 |title=Perils of Presidential Transition |journal=Seton Hall Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations |volume=II |issue=1 |pages=67–85 |url=http://diplomacy.shu.edu/academics/journal/resources/journal_dip_pdfs/journal_of_diplomacy_vol2_no1/eksterowick.pdf |accessdate=July 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908070635/http://diplomacy.shu.edu/academics/journal/resources/journal_dip_pdfs/journal_of_diplomacy_vol2_no1/eksterowick.pdf |archive-date=September 8, 2008 }}</ref> He filed two federal suits, demanding prior congressional approval of any treaty and then consent by both houses of Congress. Helms also rallied Reagan, telling him that negotiation over Panama would be a "second Schweiker" as far as his conservative base was concerned.<ref name="Link 188" />

When Carter announced, on August 10, 1977, the conclusion of [[Torrijos–Carter Treaties|the treaties]], Helms declared it a [[constitutional crisis]], cited the need for the support of United States' allies in Latin America, accused the U.S. of submitting to Panamanian blackmail, and complained that the decision threatened national security in the event of war in Europe. Helms threatened to obstruct Senate business, proposing 200 amendments to the revision of the United States criminal code, knowing that most Americans opposed the treaties and would punish congressmen who voted for them if the ratification vote came in the run-up to the election. Helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78% public opposition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Hedrick |last=Smith |author-link=Hedrick Smith |title=White House Opens Drive to Win Senate Approval of Canal Accord |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1 }}</ref> However, Helms's and Thurmond's leadership of the opposition made it politically easier for Carter,<ref name="Carter, Panama, and China" /> causing them to be replaced by the soft-spoken [[Paul Laxalt]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Clymer |title=Moderation is the Message for New Right Campaigners |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 26, 1978 |page=E4 }}</ref>

===1978 re-election campaign===
{{Main|1978 United States Senate election in North Carolina}}

Helms began campaigning for re-election in February 1977, giving himself 15 months by the time of the primaries. While he faced no primary opponent, the Democrats nominated [[North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance|Commissioner of Insurance]] [[John Ingram (politician)|John Ingram]],<ref name="Hodges in Party">{{cite news |first=Wayne |last=King |title=Hodges in Party Runoff to Decide Rival for Helms in North Carolina |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 4, 1978 |page=18 }}</ref> who came from behind in the first round of the primary to win in the run-off.

In June 1978, along with [[Strom Thurmond]], Helms was one of two senators named by an environmental group as part of a congressional "Dirty Dozen" that the group believed should be defeated in their re-election efforts due to their stances on environmental issues; membership on the list was based "primarily on 14 Senate and 19 House votes, including amendments to air and water pollution control laws, strip‐mining controls, auto emissions and water projects."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/05/archives/environmentalists-urge-defeat-of-12-in-congress.html|title=ENVIRONMENTALISTS URGE DEFEAT OF 12 IN CONGRESS|date=June 5, 1978|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

Over the long campaign, Helms raised $7.5 million, more than twice as much as the second most-expensive nationwide ([[John Tower]]'s in Texas),<ref>{{cite news |first=Warren |last=Weaver |title=Special Interests Spend $60m |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 7, 1978 |page=27 }}</ref> thanks to [[Richard Viguerie]]'s and [[Alex Castellanos]]'s pioneering [[direct mail]] strategies.<ref>Link (2007), p. 193–4</ref> It was estimated that at least $3 million of Helms's contributions were spent on fund-raising.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Clymer |author-link=Adam Clymer |title=G.O.P.

==Second Senate term (1979–1985)==
===New Senate term===
On January 3, 1979, the first day of [[96th United States Congress|the new Congress]], Helms introduced a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion,<ref>{{cite news |first=Karen |last=De Witt |title=Abortion Foes March in Capital on Anniversary of Legalization |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 23, 1979 |page=C10 }}</ref> on which he led the conservative Senators.<ref name="New Right Causes Pressed">{{cite news |first=Steven V. |last=Robert |author-link=Steven V.

===Republicans take the Senate===
In the [[United States Senate election, 1980|1980 Senate election]], the Republicans unexpectedly won a majority,<ref name="Democrats aim to regain">{{cite news |first=Nicolas |last=Ashford |title=Democrats aim to regain lost ground |work=[[The Times]] |page=10 |date=February 10, 1984 }}</ref> their first in twenty-six years, including [[John Porter East]], a social conservative and a Helms protégé soon dubbed "Helms on Wheels",<ref>{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Rosellini |title=North Carolina Republican, Mark II |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=16 |date=February 16, 1982 }}</ref> winning the other North Carolina seat. [[Howard Baker]] was set to become [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Majority Leader]], but conservatives, angered by Baker's support for the Panama treaty, [[SALT II]], and the Equal Rights Amendment, had sought to replace him with Helms until Reagan gave Baker his backing.<ref name="Busy programme for President">{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Brogan |title=Busy programme for President and 'lame duck' Congress |work=[[The Times]] |page=5 |date=November 8, 1980 }}</ref> Although, it was thought they'd put Helms in charge of the Foreign Relations Committee instead of the liberal [[Charles H.

The first six months of 1981 were consumed by numerous Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings, which were held up by Helms, who believed many of the appointees too liberal or too tainted by association with Kissinger,<ref>{{cite news |title=Critics delay Reagan nominations |work=[[The Times]] |page=5 |date=April 24, 1981 }}</ref><ref name="White House unhappy at confirmation delays">{{cite news |first=David |last=Cross |title=Senate snub forces Reagan man to withdraw |work=[[The Times]] |page=7 |date=April 18, 1981 }}</ref> and not dedicated enough to his definition of the "Reagan program": support for South Africa, Taiwan, and Latin American right-wing regimes (as opposed to Black Africa and "Red" China).<ref>{{cite news |first=Juan |last=de Onis |title=3 Appointees, Opposed by Helms, Confirmed by Senate Committee |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=10 |date=April 29, 1981 }}</ref> These nominations included [[Alexander Haig]],<ref name="Reagan appointments bring trouble">{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Brogan |title=Reagan appointments bring trouble on far right |work=[[The Times]] |page=8 |date=February 13, 1981 }}</ref> [[Chester Crocker]],<ref name="White House unhappy at confirmation delays" /> [[John J.

===Food stamp program===
An opponent of the [[Food Stamp Program]], Helms had already voted to reduce its scope,<ref>{{cite news |title=Senate Approves Agriculture Funds |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 27, 1980 |page=18 }}</ref> and was determined to follow this through as Agriculture Committee chairman.<ref name="Thunder from the Right">{{cite news |first=Peter Ross |last=Range |title=Thunder from the Right |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 8, 1981 |page=SM6 }}</ref> At one point, he proposed a 40% cut in their funding.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jean |last=Mayer |author-link=Jean Mayer |author2=Schlossberg, Kenneth |title=Tighten Food Stamps, But Don't Deprive the Needy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/07/opinion/tighten-food-stamps-but-don-t-deprive-the-needy.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 7, 1981 |page=21 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref> Instead, Helms supported the replacement of food stamps with [[workfare]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Steven V. |last=Robert |author-link=Steven V. Roberts |title=Testing 'Workfare' in South Carolina: Food Stamp Users Find Mixed Results |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 20, 1981 |page=16 }}</ref> He then proposed that food stamp benefits be dropped by $11.50 per month per child for each youngster enrolled in the school lunch program. He maintained that "free lunches" duplicate food stamps. The outcry against his proposal was so strong that he was compelled to back down. Helms also challenged fraud in the food stamp program. He said that the public had "grown legitimately resentful about the abuses which they themselves have observed".<ref>Ernest B. Furgurson, ''Hard Right: The Rise of Jesse Helms'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1986), pp. 152–153</ref>

As a freshman lawmaker in 1973, Helms tried to reverse the 1968 congressional vote which had permitted workers on strike to qualify for food stamps. Though he failed to gain reversal, his position drew the support of future Minority and Majority Leader [[Howard Baker]] of [[Tennessee]] and twelve Senate Democrats. Helms's position was upheld in 1988, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] decreed 5–3 that a law denying food stamps to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for food stamps before going on strike. Justice [[Byron White]] said that the government must maintain neutrality in labor dispute and not subsidize strikers.<ref>''The New York Times'', March 24, 1988, p.1; ''Washington Post'', March 24, 1988, p. A16</ref>

As the Agriculture Committee chairman, Helms proposed repeal of the 1977 amendment which had deleted the purchase requirement for food stamps. With that position he ran afoul of fellow Republican [[Bob Dole]], who claimed that the purchase requirement had contributed to fraud and administrative difficulties in the program. Helms cited a Congressional Budget Office report which showed that 75 percent of the increase in stamp usage had occurred since the purchase requirement was dropped. When Helms's ally, [[Steve Symms]] of [[Idaho]], proposed to reinstitute the purchase requirement, the motion was defeated, 33–66.<ref>''Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report'', August 25, 1981, p. 726; June 13, 1981, p. 1033</ref>

The Helms bloc also failed to secure other limits to the program, including a motion to delete alcohol and drug residential treatment patients from benefits. House and Senate conferees dropped a Helms-backed provision requiring families disqualified from the program to repay double the amount of any benefits received improperly. House Democratic Whip [[Tom Foley]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] insisted that such a penalty would violate the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights to [[due process]]. Instead families repay the actual amount of improperly obtained benefits.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "The Iron Triangle in Action: The Federal Food Stamp Program", ''National Social Science Journal'', Vol 12, No. 2 (1999), p. 54</ref>

===Economic policies===
Helms supported the [[gold standard]] through his role as the Agriculture Committee chairman, which exercises wide powers over commodity markets.<ref name="Republican support for a new gold standard" /> During the budget crisis of 1981, Helms restored $200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid,<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Tolchin |title=$200 Million to Pay for School Lunches Restored by Senate |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 28, 1981 |page=1 }}</ref> and against increases in grain and milk price support,<ref>{{cite news |first=Seth S. |last=King |title=Senate Panel, Rebuffing Reagan, Approves Costlier Grain Support Plan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/us/senate-panel-rebuffing-reagan-approves-costlier-grain-support-plan.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 1, 1981 |page=18 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Seth S. |last=King |title=Milk Output Rises Despite a Price Support Freeze |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 27, 1981 |page=B19 }}</ref> despite the importance of the dairy industry to North Carolina.

Helms became interested in the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]], and in October 1990 his committee staff chief and longest-serving aide, [[James P.

Helms won the election with 1,087,331 votes (52.5 percent) to Gantt's 981,573 (47.4 percent).

[[File:Senator Jesse Helms holding a watermelon.jpg|thumb|right|Senator Helms holding a watermelon and standing between Miss North Carolina and Miss Watermelon in 1991]]
In the early 1990s, Helms was a vocal opponent of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).<ref>Reno, Robert (September 14, 1993) [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-09-14/news/1993257104_1_nafta-giant-sucking-ross-perot A Nation of Ninnies], ''[[Baltimore Sun]]''</ref>

=== National Endowment for the Arts ===
In 1989, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] awarded grants for a retrospective of [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] photographs, some of which containing homosexual themes, in addition to a museum in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] supporting an exhibition that featured an image by [[Andres Serrano]] of a crucifix suspended in urine.<ref name=NEA1991/> These images caused an uproar and marked the National Endowment for the Arts becoming "a favorite target for Mr. Helms and other conservative senators who have objected to the work of some of the artists who have received Government grants."<ref name=NEA1991>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/20/arts/senate-votes-to-limit-arts-grants.html|title=Senate Votes to Limit Arts Grants|date=September 20, 1991|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-18/entertainment/ca-2388_1_performance-art-category|title='NEA Four' Grant Denial Questioned : Arts: ACLU claims transcripts indicate grants were denied on political, not artistic, grounds.|first=Dennis|last=McDougal|date=September 18, 1991}}</ref> In September 1989, Helms met with [[John E.

===Remarks re Moseley Braun and Clinton===
In a widely publicized incident on July 22, 1993, [[Carol Moseley Braun]], the first black woman in the Senate and the only black Senator at the time, reported that Helms deliberately sought to offend her by singing "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" in her presence.<ref name="Helms Whistling Dix">{{cite news |title=Is Jesse Helms Whistling 'Dixie' Over Nomination? |author=Jessica Reaves |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 27, 1999 |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,33306,00.html }}</ref><ref name="fair1">{{cite web |publisher=FAIR |title=End of Racism? |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1346 |date=March 1, 1996}}</ref><ref name="Winston-Salem 5 Jy">{{cite web|title=Jesse Helms October 18, 1921 – July 4, 2008 |work=Winston-Salem Journal |date=July 5, 2008 |url=http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/jul/05/jesse-helms-oct-18-1921-july-4-2008/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20081006183516/http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/jul/05/jesse-helms-oct-18-1921-july-4-2008/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 6, 2008 |accessdate=July 8, 2008 }}</ref> After Moseley Braun persuaded the Senate to vote against Helms's amendment to extend the patent of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] insignia, which included the [[Confederate flag]], Mosely Braun claims that Helms ran into her in an elevator.<ref name="Helms Whistling Dix" /> Helms turned to [[Orrin Hatch|Senator Orrin Hatch]] and said, "Watch me make her cry.

In 1994, Helms created a sensation when he told broadcasters [[Rowland Evans]] and [[Robert Novak]] that Clinton was "not up" to the tasks of being commander-in-chief, and suggested two days later, on the anniversary of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination,  "Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down here. He'd better have a bodyguard."

===Republican majority===
Republicans regained control of Congress after the 1994 elections and Helms finally became the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was the first North Carolinian to chair the committee since [[Nathaniel Macon]], a descendant of [[Martha Washington]], in the first quarter of the 19th century. In that role, Helms pushed for reform of the UN and blocked payment of the United States' dues. Helms secured sufficient reforms that a colleague, future [[President of the United States|President]] [[Joe Biden]] of [[Delaware]] said that "As only Nixon could go to China, only Helms could fix the U.N."<ref>Poster at Jesse Helms Center, [[Wingate, North Carolina]]</ref>

Helms passed few laws of his own in part because of this bridge-burning style. [[Hedrick Smith]]'s ''The Power Game'' depicts several senators specifically blocking Helms's goals as a result of his intransigence,{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} but nonetheless portrays Helms as a "devastatingly effective power broker".<ref>{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Brinkley |author-link=Alan Brinkley |title=Where the Big Wheels Spin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/books/where-the-big-wheels-spin.html |series=[[New York Times Book Review]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 27, 1988 |accessdate=July 8, 2009}}</ref> Helms vehemently opposed granting [[most favored nation]] status to China, citing [[human rights]] concerns.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Helms tried to block the refunding of the Ryan White Care Act in 1995, saying that those with AIDS [[Victim blaming|were responsible for the disease]], because they had contracted it because of their "deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct", and that the reason AIDS existed in the first place was because it was "God's punishment for homosexuals".{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for quote that he believed AIDS was "God's punishment for homosexuals"|date=April 2020}} Helms also claimed that more federal dollars were spent on AIDS than heart disease or cancer, despite this not being borne out by the [[Public Health Service]] statistics.<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DA1230F936A35754C0A963958260 |title= Helms Puts the Brakes to a Bill Financing AIDS Treatment |date=July 5, 1995 |first=Katharine Q|last=Seelye}}</ref>

===Helms–Burton Act===
{{Main|Helms–Burton Act}}

Soon after becoming the chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], in February 1995, Helms announced that he wished to strengthen the spirit of the 1992 [[Torricelli Act]] with new legislation.<ref name="Roy 29">Roy (2000), p. 29</ref> Its companion sponsored through the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] by [[Dan Burton]] of [[Indiana]],<ref name="Roy 29" /> it would strengthen the [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]]: further codifying the [[embargo]], instructing United States diplomats to vote in favor of sanctions on Cuba, stripping the [[President of the United States|President]] of the option of ending the embargo by [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] until [[Fidel Castro|Fidel]] and [[Raúl Castro]] leave power and a prescribed course of transition is followed.<ref name="Congress and Cuba">{{cite journal |last=Lowenfeld |first=Andreas F. |date=July 1996 |title=Congress and Cuba: the Helms-Burton Act |journal=[[American Journal of International Law]] |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=419–34 |doi=10.2307/2204066 |publisher=American Society of International Law |jstor=2204066 }}</ref> The bill also, controversially explicitly overruling the [[Act of State Doctrine]],<ref name="Congress and Cuba" /> allowed foreign companies to be sued in American courts if, in dealings with the regime of [[Fidel Castro]], they acquired assets formerly owned by Americans.

Passing the House comfortably, the Senate was far more cautious, under pressure from the Clinton administration. The debate was [[filibuster]]ed, with a motion of [[cloture]] falling four votes short.<ref name="Congress and Cuba" /> Helms reintroduced the bill without Titles III and IV, which detailed the penalties on investors, and it passed by 74 to 24 on October 19, 1995.<ref>Roy (2000), p. 30</ref> A [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]] was scheduled to convene, but did not until February 28, 1996, by which time external events had taken over. On 24 February, Cuba shot down two small [[Brothers to the Rescue]] planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans. When the conference committee met, the tougher House version, with all four titles, won out on most substantive points.<ref name="Congress and Cuba" /> It was passed by the Senate 74–22 and the House 336–86, and President Clinton signed the [[Helms-Burton Act]] into law on March 12, 1996.<ref>Roy (2000), p. 31</ref> For years after its passing, Helms criticized the corporate interests that sought to lift the sanctions on Cuba, writing an article in 1999 for ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', at whose publisher, the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], also drew Helms's ire for its softer approach to Cuba.<ref>Roy (2000), p. 192</ref>

===1996 re-election campaign===
{{Main|1996 United States Senate election in North Carolina}}

In 1996, Helms drew 1,345,833 (52.6 percent) to Gantt's 1,173,875 (45.9 percent). Helms supported his former Senate colleague [[Bob Dole]] for president, while Gantt endorsed [[Bill Clinton]].  Although Helms is generally credited with being the most successful Republican politician in North Carolina history, his largest proportion of the vote in any of his five elections was 54.5 percent. In North Carolina, Helms was a polarizing figure, and he freely admitted that many people in the state strongly disliked him: "[The Democrats] could nominate [[Mortimer Snerd]] and he'd automatically get 45 percent of the vote." Helms was particularly popular among older, conservative constituents, and was considered one of the last "[[Old South]]" politicians to have served in the Senate. However, he also considered himself a voice of conservative youth, whom he hailed in the dedication of his autobiography.

In January 1998, Helms endorsed a legislative proposal by the Cuban-American National Foundation to provide 100 million worth of food and medicine so long as Havana could promise the assistance would not be allocated to government stores or officials of the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/31/world/food-aid-for-cubans-backed-by-helms.html|title=Food Aid for Cubans Backed by Helms|date=January 31, 1998|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> In the same statement, Helms said Pope [[John Paul II|John Paul II's]] visit to Cuba had "created a historic opportunity for bold action" in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/02/01/helms-backs-aid-to-cuba-proposed-by-exile-group/becccb36-8b65-40fb-9184-91c544dd25d0/|title=Helms backs aid to cuba proposed by exile group|date=February 1, 1998|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> On May 15, Helms announced a proposal of 100 million aid package for Cuba that would provide food and medical assistance to the Cuban people by the Roman Catholic Church and politically independent relief organizations.

Helms saw the Bush administration as "understanding of the nature" of Castro and his crimes and stated his hope that an American president would eventually be able to visit Cuba at a time when the latter country and the United States could welcome each other as friends and trading partners.<ref name=Helms265 />
In May 2001, Helms cosponsored legislation with Connecticut Democrat [[Joe Lieberman]] granting 100 million in aid to both government critics and independent workers in Cuba during the period of the following four years and said the aim of the bill was to provide financial assistance to domestic opponents of the Cuban government so that they could continue their work.<ref name=CubaMay2001 /> The legislation was "the first major legislative proposal by hard-line critics" since the Helms-Burton Act and Helms promoted its enactment in a statement by saying it would see the United States government "move beyond merely isolating the Castro regime" which could be undermined "by finding bold, proactive and creative programs to help those working for change on the island."<ref name=CubaMay2001>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/world/helms-and-lieberman-seek-to-aid-dissidents-in-cuba.html|title=Helms and Lieberman Seek to Aid Dissidents in Cuba|first=Christopher|last=Marquis|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 16, 2001}}</ref> In July, President Bush announced his intent to waive a portion of the Helms-Burton Act authorizing lawsuits against businesses operating in Cuba for six months in the national interest of the US and to aid administration efforts to "expedite the transition to democracy in Cuba."

In January 1997, during the confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee [[Madeleine Albright]], Helms stated President Clinton's first term had left adversaries of the United States in doubt of their resolve and that "a lot of Americans" were praying she would issue in a change during her tenure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/01/09/at-albrights-confirmation-hearing-differences-are-smoothed-over/1c515f9e-86d5-4005-b1cc-ba5d217acdce/|title=AT ALBRIGHT'S CONFIRMATION HEARING, DIFFERENCES ARE SMOOTHED OVER|first=Thomas W.|last=Lippman|date=January 9, 1997|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Two months later, after being confirmed, Albright traveled with Helms to his boyhood home and the Jesse Helms Center for discussions on the treaty to ban chemical arms, Helms afterward saying the pair would not have any issues if they continued being able to cooperate but stressed that the treaty would not assist with protecting Americans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-26/news/9703260027_1_helms-albright-albright-and-helms-state-madeleine-albright|title=Albright Peace Mission Takes Her To Helms' Turf|first=David S.|last=Cloud|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> In a March 1998 letter to Albright, Helms stated his opposition "to the creation of a permanent U.N. criminal court" and the United Nations becoming "a sovereign entity", Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen confirming concerns of the senator "that a permanent tribunal will turn into a petty claims court that will spend its time taking up complaints about the United States" and thereby serve the function of the General Assembly.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/27/world/helms-vows-to-make-war-on-un-court.html|title=Helms Vows To Make War On U.N.

In September 1997, amid the Senate voting to repeal a 50 billion tax break for the tobacco industry, Helms joined [[Mitch McConnell]] and [[Lauch Faircloth]] in being one of three senators to vote against the amendment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/11/us/senate-repeals-tax-break-for-the-tobacco-industry.html|title=Senate Repeals Tax Break For the Tobacco Industry|first=Lizette|last=Alvarez|date=September 11, 1997|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

In January 1998, President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky became public. Helms found the revelation "damning", having little patience for sexual transgressions and said anyone that would advocate President Clinton's "should be excused, already announced their total lack of character."<ref name=Link443>{{cite book|title=Righteous Warrior: Jesse Helms and the Rise of Modern Conservatism|first=William A.|last=Link|page=[https://archive.org/details/righteouswarrior00link_0/page/443 443]|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312356002|date=2008-02-05|url=https://archive.org/details/righteouswarrior00link_0/page/443}}</ref> In remarks the following month, Helms stated the scandal had left him saddened for the United States and President Clinton's daughter [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]]. Helms exercised caution on the impeachment issue, refraining from announcing his vote until right before Clinton's Senate trial in January of the following year.<ref name=Link443 /> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted Helms as the only one of the nine senators who had by then served a quarter century to vote in favor of Lewinsky making an appearance before the chamber.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/journal020599.htm|title=Thurmond Leads in a Resounding 'No'|first=David Von|last=Drehle|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> In his memoir, Helms stated that his vote against Clinton was not personal and that he understood "the fallibility of every human, and the power of Grace", but that he was unwilling to deny the Constitution not allowing "gradients of wrongdoing" since Clinton was proven to have lied under oath.<ref name=Helms197>{{cite book|title=Here's where I Stand: A Memoir|pages=197–198|first=Jesse|last=Helms|year=2005|isbn=978-0375508844|publisher=Random House}}</ref>

In March 1998, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Helms predicted the resolution would pass overwhelmingly in the full chamber and said the vote was a testament to "confidence in the democracies of Eastern Europe."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/04/world/key-senate-panel-passes-resolution-to-expand-nato.html|title=KEY SENATE PANEL PASSES RESOLUTION TO EXPAND NATO|first=Steven|last=Erlanger|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

In May 1998, while delivering remarks to Therma, Inc. employees, President Clinton listed Helms as one of the senators who had aided the intent of [[Partnership for Peace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1998-book1/html/PPP-1998-book1-doc-pg653-2.htm|title=Remarks at a Roundtable Discussion With Employees of Therma, Inc., in San Jose, California|date=May 1, 1998|first=Bill|last=Clinton|author-link=Bill Clinton|publisher=Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States}}</ref>

While the United States cast one of four votes against the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], adopted by a 120 to 4 vote in July 1998, President Clinton signed the Statute for the United States. However, Helms was strident in his opposition and let it be known that any attempt to have the Senate ratify the Statute would be "dead on arrival" at the Foreign Relations Committee. He also introduced the [[American Service-Members' Protection Act]], adopted by Congress in 2002 "to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party".

In June 1999, after President Clinton nominated [[Richard Holbrooke]] for [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], the Clinton administration expressed concerns with Helms's silence on whether he would allow a vote on Holbrooke's nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/17/world/helms-has-white-house-worried-about-its-un-nomination.html|title=Helms Has White House Worried About Its U.N. Nomination|first=Philip|last=Shenon|date=June 17, 1999|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> In a June 5 statement, Helms announced the date of the four hearings and that Holbrooke would be questioned regarding his career, specifically his mediating role in negotiations of the Bosnia accords with [[President of Yugoslavia]] [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Helms added that he could not "recall another Cabinet-level nomination sent to this committee with so much ethical baggage attached to it."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/05/world/crisis-balkans-senate-helms-start-four-hearings-holbrooke-june-17.html|title=CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE SENATE; Helms to Start Four Hearings On Holbrooke On June 17|date=June 5, 1999|first=Philip|last=Shenon|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> During the confirmation hearings, Helms stated that Holbrooke had violated the law repeatedly. In response, Holbrooke apologized and admitted to his "misconceptions" regarding ethics, Helms afterward expressing optimism toward the nomination as a result of Holbrooke's remorse.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/18/world/helms-prods-holbrooke-and-receives-a-concession.html|title=Helms Prods Holbrooke And Receives A Concession|first=Philip|last=Shenon|date=June 18, 1999|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> Three months later, after President Clinton nominating former Senator [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] for [[United States Ambassador to New Zealand]], Helms released a statement saying the "nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun" and questioned if her record had even been examined by the Clinton administration. An article published around the same time as the statement by ''[[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]]'' indicated Helms would prevent the nomination unless Moseley-Braun "amends for past slights" such as her opposition to the renewal of the emblem for the Daughters of the Confederacy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-10-18/news/9910210290_1_first-african-american-female-senator-sen-helms-jesse-helms|title=Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms...|date=October 18, 1999|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Helms subsequently demanded documents relating to Moseley-Braun's ethical charges and delayed confirmation hearings until receiving them. On November 9, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to endorse Moseley-Braun 17 to 1, Helms being the lone vote against the nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/09/world/senate-panel-clears-moseley-braun-appointment-as-ambassador.html|title=Senate Panel Clears Moseley-Braun Appointment as Ambassador|date=November 9, 1999|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> When the Senate voted to confirm Moseley-Braun, Helms was joined by [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]], who defeated Moseley-Braun in her re-election bid, in being the only two senators to vote against her.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-11/news/9911110117_1_carol-moseley-braun-ethical-cloud-sen-peter-fitzgerald|title=Senate Oks New Title For Former Colleague|date=November 11, 1999|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|first=Mike|last=Dorning}}</ref>

In 2000, [[Bono]] sought out Jesse Helms to discuss increasing American aid to Africa. In Africa, AIDS is a disease that is primarily transmitted heterosexually, and Helms sympathized with Bono's description of "the pain it is bringing to infants and children and their families".<ref>{{cite news |work=Time |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187308,00.html |title= Bono |date=April 30, 2006 |first=Jesse|last=Helms}}</ref> Helms insisted that Bono involve the international community and private sector, so that relief efforts would not be paid for by "just Americans".<ref>{{cite news|work= [[The Charlotte Observer]]|first= Charles|last= Hurt|title= Helms Brings Hollywood to the Hill|url= http://bellsouthpwp.net/w/a/watts4u2/bono_and_jesse_helms.htm|date= March 14, 2002|accessdate= August 29, 2008|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906203351/http://bellsouthpwp.net/w/a/watts4u2/bono_and_jesse_helms.htm|archive-date= September 6, 2008}}</ref> Helms coauthored a bill authorizing $600 million for international AIDS relief efforts. In 2002, Helms announced that he was ashamed to have done so little during his Senate career to fight the worldwide spread of AIDS, and pledged to do more during his last few months in the Senate. Helms spoke with special appreciation of the efforts of [[Janet Museveni]], first lady of [[Uganda]], for her efforts to stop the spread of AIDS through a campaign based on "biblical values and sexual purity".<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Wagner |title=Helms admits 'shame' over inaction on AIDS |url=http://bellsouthpwp.net/w/a/watts4u2/bono_and_jesse_helms.htm |work=The News & Observer |location=Raleigh, NC |date=February 21, 2002 |accessdate=August 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906203351/http://bellsouthpwp.net/w/a/watts4u2/bono_and_jesse_helms.htm |archive-date=September 6, 2008 }}</ref> Helms also was a proponent in trying to dissolve the United States Agency for International Development.<ref>Brainard, et al, 20023, The Other War: Global Poverty and the Millennium Challenge Account, Washington DC: Brooklings Institution and Center for Global Development, p.187</ref>

In January 2001, Helms stated he would support an increase in international assistance on the condition that all future aid from the United States be provided to the needy by private charities and religious groups as opposed to a government agency, and endorsed abolishing the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and concurrently transferring its 7 billion in annual aid to another foundation which would give grants to private relief groups.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/11/politics/helms-wants-religious-groups-to-funnel-foreign-aid.html|title=Helms Wants Religious Groups to Funnel Foreign Aid|first=Eric|last=Schmitt|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

In March 2002, Helms and Democrat [[Joe Biden]], in their positions as the ranking members of their parties on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, submitted a letter to the Bush administration demanding the Senate receive any nuclear arms reductions with Russia as a formal treaty.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/world/senators-insist-on-role-in-nuclear-arms-deals.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&gwh=7DB969DD2F0B8CA1FA53D7463FE1DDA9&gwt=pay|title=Senators Insist on Role in Nuclear Arms Deals|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 2002}}</ref>

===Retirement===
Because of recurring health problems, including bone disorders, prostate cancer and heart disease, Helms did not seek re-election in 2002. His Senate seat was won by Republican  [[Elizabeth Dole]].

==Post-Senate life (2003–2008)==
[[File:Jesse Helms and Patrick McHenry.png|thumb|right|Helms with [[Patrick McHenry]] in 2005]]
In 2004, he spoke out for the election of Republican U.S. Representative [[Richard Burr]], who, like Elizabeth Dole two years earlier, defeated Democrat [[Erskine Bowles]] to win the other North Carolina Senate seat. In September 2005, [[Random House]] published his memoir ''Here's Where I Stand''. In his memoirs, he likened [[abortion]] to the [[Holocaust]] and the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] stating, "I will never be silent about the death of those who cannot speak for themselves." Helms had also been recruited by pop star [[Bono]] for charity work.

In 1994, after turning down requests for his papers to be left to an [[Ivy League]] university, he designated [[Wingate University]] as the repository of the official papers and historical items from his Senate career, where the [[Jesse Helms Center]] is based to promote his legacy.<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=St. Onge|author2=Torralba, Mike|title=Small-town upbringing shaped a senator|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/politicians/helms/story/1132244.html|work=[[The News & Observer]]|location=Raleigh, NC|date=July 6, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 2005, [[Liberty University]] opened the [[Jesse Helms School of Government]] with Helms present at the dedication.

===Death===
Helms's health remained poor after he retired from the Senate in 2003. In April 2006, news reports disclosed that Helms had [[multi-infarct dementia]], which leads to failing memory and diminished [[cognitive function]], as well as a number of physical difficulties.

==Social and political views==
===Views on race===
Jesse Helms was accused of racism throughout his career. Upon Helms's retirement from the Senate in 2001, David Broder of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote a column headlined "Jesse Helms, White Racist," analyzing Helms's public record on race, a record he felt many other reporters were side-stepping. He highlighted Helms's willingness to inflame racial resentment against [[African-Americans]] for political gain, dubbing Helms "the last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country".<ref name=broder>{{cite news|last=Broder|first=David S.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/06/AR2008070602321.html|title=Jesse Helms, White Racist|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=July 7, 2008|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref>

Early in his career, as news director for WRAL radio, Helms supported [[Willis Smith]] in the 1950 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, against [[Frank Porter Graham]], in a campaign that used racial issues in a divisive way, in order to draw conservative white voters to the polls.<ref name="LATimes-obit">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-helms5-2008jul05-story.html#page=1 |title=Former Sen.

In 1996, the Department of Justice admonished Helms's 1990 campaign for mailing 125,000 postcards to households in predominantly African-American precincts warning them (incorrectly) that they could go to jail if they had not updated their addresses on the electoral register since moving.<ref>Link (2007), p. 379–80</ref>

Besides opposing civil rights and affirmative action legislation, Helms, for ideological reasons, blocked many black judges from being considered for the federal bench, and black appointees to positions of prominence in the Federal Government.

In 1993, when he voted against confirming [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], he cited her support for the "homosexual agenda" as one of his reasons for doing so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-08-04/news/9301270900_1_judge-ginsburg-high-court-appointment-senate-judiciary-committee|title=Ginsburg To Join High Court|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=August 4, 1993|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref>

===Religious views===
{{quote|Atheism and socialism – or liberalism, which tends in the same direction – are inseparable entities: when you have men who no longer believe that God is in charge of human affairs, you have men attempting to take the place of God by means of the superstate.

Helms was close to fellow North Carolinian [[Billy Graham]] (whom he considered a personal hero),<ref>{{cite news |first=Marjorie |last=Hunter |title=Not So Vital Statistics on Mr. Helms |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 6, 1982 |page=16 }}</ref> as well as [[Charles Stanley]], [[Pat Robertson]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Religious Right: a Reference Handbook |last=Utter |first=Glenn H. |author2=Storey, John Woodrow |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-Clio |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-57607-212-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/religiousrightre00utte_0/page/16 16] |url=https://archive.org/details/religiousrightre00utte_0/page/16 }}</ref> and [[Jerry Falwell]], whose [[Liberty University]] dedicated its Jesse Helms School of Government to Helms.

Equating [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] and [[atheism]], Helms argued that the downfall of the U.S. was due to loss of Christian faith,<ref name="Telegraph July 6, 2008" /> and often stated, "I think God is giving this country one more chance to save itself".<ref name="The Right Hand of God" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Welch |title=Former Sen.
