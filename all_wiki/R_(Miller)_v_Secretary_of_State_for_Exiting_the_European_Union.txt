The government's appeal was against the High Court order dated 7 November 2016 that formally declared: "The Secretary of State does not have power under the Crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union." The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] heard the appeal from 5 December 2016 to 8 December 2016, and, by a majority of 8–3, upheld the High Court ruling, finding that authorisation by Parliament was required for the invocation of Article 50.<ref name="BBCSC">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38720320 |title=Brexit: Supreme Court says Parliament must give Article 50 go-ahead |publisher=BBC News |date=24 January 2017 |accessdate=24 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124040801/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38720320 |archive-date=24 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The case was [[Intervention (law)|intervened]] by the [[Lord Advocate]] and the [[Counsel General for Wales]] for the [[Scottish Government|Scottish]] and [[Welsh Government|Welsh]] governments (respectively as ''the Scottish'' and ''Welsh Ministers''), and applicants for judicial review in [[Northern Ireland]] also had their three separate applications considered together with this case, all of whom argued that the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] all had to consent to the invocation of Article 50. In each case this was unanimously rejected by the court.<ref name="BBCSC" />

==Facts==
Following a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum held on 23 June 2016]], in which 51.9% of votes cast were in favour of leaving the EU, the UK government stated its intention to invoke [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] (the formal procedure for withdrawing) on 29 March 2017. On the Monday following the referendum, three academics (Nick Barber, Dr Tom Hickman and Professor Jeff King) published a blog which argued that an Act of Parliament would be necessary before the Government could give notice to leave the EU.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/06/27/nick-barber-tom-hickman-and-jeff-king-pulling-the-article-50-trigger-parliaments-indispensable-role/|title=Nick Barber, Tom Hickman and Jeff King: Pulling the Article 50 'Trigger': Parliament's Indispensable Role|date=2016-06-27|website=UK Constitutional Law Association|language=en|access-date=2019-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310032716/https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/06/27/nick-barber-tom-hickman-and-jeff-king-pulling-the-article-50-trigger-parliaments-indispensable-role/|archive-date=10 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> A few days later [[David Pannick, Baron Pannick|David, Lord Pannick QC]], a columnist for ''[[The Times]]'', asked whether an Act of Parliament was needed before notification could lawfully be given of the UK's intention to leave, and cited the arguments of Barber, Hickman and King in agreeing with them that an Act of Parliament was required.<ref>{{cite news |author=David Pannick, QC |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/c8985886-3df9-11e6-a28b-4ed6c4bdada3 |title=Why giving notice of withdrawal from the EU requires act of parliament |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=24 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110091540/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/c8985886-3df9-11e6-a28b-4ed6c4bdada3 |archive-date=10 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The government argued that the use of prerogative powers to enact the referendum result was constitutionally proper and consistent with domestic law whereas the opposing view was that the exercise of prerogative powers would undermine the European Communities Act 1972 and would set aside rights previously established by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f43e102f-ea09-4449-b781-a35ecfe628fe |title=Judicial review litigation over the correct constitutional process for triggering Article 50 TEU |publisher=Lexology |date=13 October 2016 |accessdate=18 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221102256/http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f43e102f-ea09-4449-b781-a35ecfe628fe |archive-date=21 December 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Gina Miller]] and other claimants had sought permission to bring an action in the High Court for [[judicial review]] on whether the UK government was entitled to notify an intention to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as amended (the [[Treaty of Maastricht|Maastricht]] and [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon]] Treaties), without a vote or deliberative debate in Parliament.

[[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], the [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]], argued that the possibility to trigger Article 50 was based on the royal prerogative and so any consultation of elected members of parliament was unnecessary.<ref name="SCReuters" /> Miller contended that, if notification under Article 50 were to be invoked to leave the European Union, it would effectively nullify a series of Acts of Parliament.<ref name="SCReuters" /> It was a constitutional principle that Acts of Parliament could not be changed without the consent of Parliament.<ref name="SCJudgement">{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0196-judgment.pdf|title=R (on the application of Miller and another) (Respondents) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Appellant)|publisher=UK Supreme Court|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310032903/https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0196-judgment.pdf|archive-date=10 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

== High Court judgment ==

=== Background ===
There was dispute over whether the decision to invoke Article 50 was the prerogative of the government, as the [[second Cameron ministry|Cameron government]] argued,<ref name=letwin>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/05/brexit-live-tory-leadership-tom-watson-unions-jeremy-corbyn?page=with:block-577ba75be4b0b14d7ed7dc0b#block-577ba75be4b0b14d7ed7dc0b |title=Letwin says government can invoke article 50 without a vote in parliament |date=5 July 2016 |accessdate=5 July 2016 |author=Claire Phipps and Andrew Sparrow |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> or whether it required parliamentary approval.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |title=Leaving the EU: Parliament's Role in the Process |url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2016-0034 |publisher=House of Lords Library |accessdate=1 July 2016 |date=30 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701083605/http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/LLN-2016-0034 |archive-date=1 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web |url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/06/27/nick-barber-tom-hickman-and-jeff-king-pulling-the-article-50-trigger-parliaments-indispensable-role/ |title=Nick Barber, Tom Hickman and Jeff King: Pulling the Article 50 'Trigger': Parliament's Indispensable Role |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628000610/https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2016/06/27/nick-barber-tom-hickman-and-jeff-king-pulling-the-article-50-trigger-parliaments-indispensable-role/ |archive-date=28 June 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Article 50 states that "Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements".

As Professor Kenneth Armstrong (Professor of EU law at Cambridge University) points out<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2017/06/14/kenneth-armstrong-has-article-50-really-been-triggered/ |title=Kenneth Armstrong: Has Article 50 Really Been Triggered? |date=2017-06-14 |access-date=27 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107073554/https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2017/06/14/kenneth-armstrong-has-article-50-really-been-triggered/ |archive-date=7 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> this is a decision solely for domestic law: whether constitutional requirements have been met is a matter solely for the domestic law of member states. The UK's constitutional requirements for the valid invocation of Article 50 was the entire basis of this litigation, even though this was undertaken without explicit reference to that phrase as in Art 50(1) in the judgments. As will be seen below, it was held that the UK constitutional requirements were that an Act of Parliament need be passed in order to bestow the power on the Secretary of State to invoke Article 50, as the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] had displaced the Royal prerogative to take the UK outside of the EU treaties.

The first of the parties to lodge a complaint in the proceedings against the government's intention to [[UK invocation of Article 50|trigger Article 50]] without a parliamentary vote was Deir Dos Santos, who launched his action four days after the referendum of 23 June.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/hairdresser-behind-brexit-challenge-now-in-hiding-after-vile-hate-mail-a3387411.html |title=Hairdresser behind Brexit challenge now in hiding after vile hate mail |date=4 November 2016 |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331103959/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/hairdresser-behind-brexit-challenge-now-in-hiding-after-vile-hate-mail-a3387411.html |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Miller's claim form was served on 29 July 2016.<ref name="mishcon.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mishcon.com/contact|title=Contact Us|website=Mishcon de Reya|access-date=25 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729231703/https://www.mishcon.com/contact|archive-date=29 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The law firm [[Mishcon de Reya]] announced that it had been retained by a group of clients to challenge the constitutionality of invoking Article 50 without Parliament debating it.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news |last1=Mance |first1=Henry |title=Businesses prepare legal challenge over Brexit negotiations |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/83db8e6a-4124-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=3 July 2016 |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908032353/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/83db8e6a-4124-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html |archive-date=8 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web |title=Article 50 process on Brexit faces legal challenge to ensure parliamentary involvement |url=http://www.mishcon.com/news/firm_news/article_50_process_on_brexit_faces_legal_challenge_to_ensure_parliamentary_involvement_07_2016 |publisher=Mishcon de Reya |accessdate=3 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703192314/http://www.mishcon.com/news/firm_news/article_50_process_on_brexit_faces_legal_challenge_to_ensure_parliamentary_involvement_07_2016 |archive-date=3 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the proceedings, all parties accepted that withdrawal from the [[European Union]] would have profound consequences in terms of changing domestic law in each of the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom.<ref>[2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin). para.4

At the full hearing in October, before three judges sitting as a [[Divisional court (England and Wales)|divisional court]] ([[John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd|the Lord Chief Justice]], [[Terence Etherton|the Master of the Rolls]] and [[Philip Sales|Lord Justice Sales]]), it was argued for the lead claimant (Miller) that notification under Article 50 would commit the UK to the removal of rights existing under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] and later ratification acts, and that it is not open to the government, without Parliament's approval, to use the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative power]] to take action affecting rights which Parliament had recognised in that way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161013-all-day.pdf|title=Transcript, 13 October 2016, p.109-115|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020035545/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161013-all-day.pdf|archive-date=20 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> An argument put for the "[[Expatriate|expat]]" Interveners at the hearing was that by the 1972 Act, Parliament had conferred a legislative competence on the EU institutions, and in that way had changed the constitutional settlement in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf|title=-: Transcript, 18 October 2016, p.31|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019080518/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Responding in the opening submissions for the government, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] ([[Jeremy Wright]]) outlined how the decision had been reached. In support of the contention that when passing the 2015 Act Parliament well knew of the Article 50 procedure for leaving the European Union if that was voted for in the referendum, he said that Parliament had previously dealt with it when the Lisbon Treaty was included in [[Municipal law|domestic law]] by the 2008 Act, and he took the court through the legislation dealing with the European Union and its predecessor, namely:

In further submissions for the government, the lead claimant's primary argument was said by [[Devilling#Treasury Devil|Treasury Counsel]] ([[James Eadie (barrister)|James Eadie]]) to be that it is not open to the executive to use the [[Royal prerogative|prerogative power]] in such a way as to affect or change current economic law, principally statute law;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161017-all-day.pdf|title=-: Transcript, 17 October 2016, p.108|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019143505/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161017-all-day.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> but the government contended that [[Lists of landmark court decisions|the leading]] case ''[[A-G v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd|Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel]]'' meant that the question about the use of the royal prerogative depended on Parliament's legislative intention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161017-all-day.pdf|title=-: Transcript, 17 October 2016, p. 123|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019143505/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161017-all-day.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The treaty ratification provisions of the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] were in force from 11 November 2010,<ref>The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2010.[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2703/article/2/made#article-2-a] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214013454/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2703/article/2/made#article-2-a |date=14 December 2016 }}</ref> that is, after the [[Ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], including Article 50, was ratified for UK on 16 July 2008,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7511281.stm |title=UK – UK Politics – UK ratifies the EU Lisbon Treaty |date=2008-07-17 |access-date=4 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827014600/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7511281.stm |archive-date=27 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and had come into force on 1 December 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6901353.stm |title=Q&A: The Lisbon Treaty |date=2011-01-17 |access-date=4 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315232516/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6901353.stm |archive-date=15 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the Act describes "treaty" as an agreement between states, or between states and [[List of intergovernmental organizations#Regional organizations|international organisations]], which is binding under international law, including amendments to a treaty, and defines "ratification" as including acts (such as notification that domestic procedures have been completed) which establish as a matter of international law the United Kingdom's consent to be bound by the treaty, ratification of an amendment to a European Union treaty may involve compliance with the [[European Union (Amendment) Act 2008]], and there are further provisions under the European Union Act 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/notes/division/6/20 |title=Explanatory Notes to Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 |first1=Ministry of |last1=Justice |first2=Cabinet |last2=Office |first3=Foreign and Commonwealth |last3=Office |first4=HM |last4=Treasury |access-date=4 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829041837/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/notes/division/6/20 |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Lord Chief Justice described the statutory procedure as "of critical importance".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf|title=-: Transcript, 18 October 2016, p. 5|access-date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019080518/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Judgment ===
The court's unanimous judgment was delivered and published on 3 November. The decision was against the government's contention that the Crown's prerogative allowed giving Article 50 notice, and the court would later decide on the form of declaration it would make. The court described the passing of the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] as the major step of "switching on the direct effect of [[European Union law|EU law]] in the national legal systems", and reasoned that it is implausible that Parliament's intention was that the Crown should be able to switch it off unilaterally by exercise of its prerogative powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-european-union/|title=R (Miller) -v- Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|website=www.judiciary.uk|access-date=25 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810175102/https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-european-union/|archive-date=10 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The judgment stated that the question for the court's decision involved the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional law of the United Kingdom]]: it was whether the Crown's executive government is entitled to use the Crown's prerogative powers to give notice under Article 50 for the United Kingdom to cease to be a member of the European Union.<ref>[2016] EWHC 2768 (Admin). [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2768.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20161127212133/http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2016/2768.html |date=27 November 2016 }}</ref> The court held that the Government had no power to trigger notification under article 50 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU), because it would remove a series of rights created by Acts of Parliament. The principle of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] required that only Parliament could take away those rights. This is expressed in the ''[[Case of Proclamations]]'' (1608), the [[Bill of Rights 1688]] section 1, and continually confirmed since in cases including ''[[Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate]]'',<ref>[1965] AC 75</ref> and ''[[R (Jackson) v Attorney General]]''.<ref>[2005] UKHL 56, [9]</ref> The Crown may not alter the domestic law of the UK or modify rights conferred by Parliament.<ref>[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109054412/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf |date=9 November 2016 }}, [86]-[88]</ref>

Three categories of rights were
:(i) rights that could be replicated by UK law (e.g. 28 days paid holidays under the [[Working Time Directive 2003]]), 
:(ii) rights of UK citizens in other EU member states (e.g. the right to work abroad, or set up a business, under [[TFEU]] articles 45 and 49) and 
:(iii) rights that could not be replicated in UK law (e.g. the right to vote in the [[EU Parliament]] or petition the [[EU Commission]] to enforce [[competition law]] or [[environmental law]] standards in the UK).<ref>[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109054412/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf |date=9 November 2016 }}, [58]-[61]</ref>

While the Secretary of State accepted that category (iii) rights would be nullified, the High Court also ruled that all rights in categories (i) and (ii) would also be jeopardised in their effectiveness.<ref>[2016] [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf EWHC 2768] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109054412/https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/judgment-r-miller-v-secretary-of-state-for-exiting-the-eu-20161103.pdf |date=9 November 2016 }}, [63]-[66]</ref>

===In advance of appeal hearing===
For the Scottish government, Scotland's First Minister, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], told the [[Lord Advocate]] to apply to join the case. Sturgeon maintained it "simply cannot be right" for EU rights to be "removed by the UK Government on the say-so of a Prime Minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent". She argued further that "legislation should be required at Westminster and the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] should be sought before Article 50 is triggered".<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-theresa-may-legal-challenge-supreme-court-appeal-case-a7404591.html Nicola Sturgeon launches plan to stop Theresa May overturning Brexit legal challenge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111192721/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-theresa-may-legal-challenge-supreme-court-appeal-case-a7404591.html |date=11 November 2017 }} {{snd}} ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 November 2016'</ref> On 18 November the Supreme Court announced that the [[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]] had made a reference to the court regarding devolution issues relating to that jurisdiction and that the court had granted the applications of four interveners to take part in the appeal, namely:

Speaking on 9 November, [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], [[Deputy President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|deputy president of the Supreme Court]], stated that the issue in the case to be heard on appeal by the Court in December was whether giving Article 50 notification was within the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|Crown's prerogative powers]] for the conduct of foreign relations or whether the prerogative cannot be used in a way that undermines an act of the United Kingdom Parliament.<ref>''The Supreme Court: Guardian of the Constitution?''

In the appeal the government argued that, while Parliament's enactment of the European Communities Act 1972 was necessary to prevent the UK breaching the EEC treaties when they came into force on 1 January 1973, the 1972 act was a legal precondition neither for the signature nor for the ratification of the Treaty of Accession, nor for the treaty coming into force in respect of the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/570778/Supreme_Court_Printed_Case_of_the_Secretary_of_State_for_Exiting_the_European_Union.PDF|title=Appellant's Case, para. 19|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120200924/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/570778/Supreme_Court_Printed_Case_of_the_Secretary_of_State_for_Exiting_the_European_Union.PDF|archive-date=20 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===The hearing===
Before calling on the Attorney General to open the case for the government as Appellant, the Supreme Court President stated the justices were aware of the strong feelings associated with the many wider political questions surrounding the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, but the appeal was concerned with the legal issues, and their duty was to consider those issues impartially and decide according to the law. He mentioned that all the parties involved in the proceedings had been asked whether they wished any of the justices to stand down, and each of them had stated that they had no objection to any of the eleven sitting on the appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-monday-161205.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 5 December 2016, p. 3-4|access-date=5 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205223835/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-monday-161205.pdf|archive-date=5 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the start of the government's oral submissions, the Attorney-General said the claimants had brought High Court proceedings perfectly properly and it was now perfectly proper for the Supreme Court to decide the appeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-monday-161205-am.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 5 December 2016, p. 5|access-date=5 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205144251/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-monday-161205-am.pdf|archive-date=5 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Appellant's submissions, apart from devolution issues to be addressed later by the Advocate General for Scotland,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 6 December 2016, from p.74|access-date=6 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173559/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> were summed up on the morning of the second day in a series of points:
*As Parliament knows today and knew in 1972, the Crown prerogative to make and unmake or withdraw from treaties exists as a key part of the UK constitution.
*Parliament has deliberately regulated some parts of those prerogative powers, expressly and in detail, but it has not touched the power to give Article 50 notice.
*There is no basis for imposing a hidden legislative presumption on Parliament's intention: the rights in question in this case are created on the international plane, and then recognised by UK law; EU rights on that plane are altered and removed through the Crown's prerogative powers, and that is a "significant step along the road to finding the intention in relation to withdrawal".
*The courts should be wary of going over the line between interpretation of legislation and judicial legislation, in a way which would impose "a new control of a most serious kind in a highly controversial and, by Parliament, carefully considered area".
*The 2015 Act and the referendum emphatically undermine a suggestion that giving Article 50 notice by use of the prerogative power could be other than consistent with the will of Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 6 December 2016, p.72-74 (Eadie)|access-date=6 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173559/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
Following on, the Advocate General for Scotland ended his oral submissions for the Appellant by saying that if an exercise of the royal prerogative to take the UK out of the EU were seen as an abuse of power after the 1972 Act, there could be no such abuse after the Referendum Act 2015 and the result of the referendum was known: "It is simply a question of whether it would be proper and appropriate for the executive to exercise the prerogative in particular circumstances, and the circumstances that we have to address are those which exist today in light of the 2015 Act, which is of considerable constitutional importance and the decision made in the referendum, knowing that if Parliament wanted to intervene and limit the exercise of that prerogative right, it is free to do so and has chosen to remain silent."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 6 December 2016, p.116|access-date=6 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173559/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-tuesday-161206.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

For the Respondent Miller it was argued that the Court should not accept that the legal limits on ministers' powers are to be left to or influenced by political control, or parliamentary control, short of an act of Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-wednesday-161207.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 7 December 2016, p.51(Pannick)|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173712/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-wednesday-161207.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> For the Respondent Dos Santos it was submitted that the legislature could easily have said what effect the 2015 referendum was if it wanted to tell us, but it has not told us, and the courts should not try and guess what the legislature intended, but instead leave it to the legislature to decide; and that, as there is no parliamentary authorisation for the loss of rights resulting from withdrawal from the EU, whether under the 2015 Act, or any other legislation which has been passed by Parliament, the government's appeal should be dismissed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-wednesday-161207.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 7 December 2016, p.110-111 (Chambers)|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173712/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-wednesday-161207.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
The Welsh Government submitted that the UK Government's proposed Article 50 notification would be an unlawful dispensation by the Crown of the provisions establishing the competence of the Welsh Assembly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gov.wales/docs/dfm/minutes/cabinet/161125counselgeneralforwalesprintedcaseen.pdf|title=Case of Counsel General for Wales, para. 20|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927030119/http://gov.wales/docs/dfm/minutes/cabinet/161125counselgeneralforwalesprintedcaseen.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In response to submissions of parties opposing the appeal and questions put by the Justices, it was said for the government that the question before the court was about "the present state of the division of responsibility between our pillars of state, legislative, executive, and indeed judicial, and that demands a current answer and not a historic one"; and that parliament's legislation was to implement UK treaty obligations, not to control the government's exercise of the royal prerogative on the international plane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 8 December 2016, p.172-176 (Eadie)|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173941/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Closing the hearing, the Court President said that the appeal raised important constitutional issues, and the Justices would take time to give full consideration to the many arguments presented to them, orally and in writing, and they would do their best to resolve the case as quickly as possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf|title=SC Transcript, 8 December 2016, p.204|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211173941/https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/draft-transcript-thursday-161208-four-page.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Judgment===
The Supreme Court held by eight judges to three that only Parliament could authorise a notification under [[Treaty on European Union|TEU]] Article 50 to be given to the [[European Commission]], upholding the decision of the High Court.<ref>See in the media, {{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/21/four-versions-brexit-law-prepared-ministers-braced-court-defeat/ |title=Four versions of Brexit law prepared as Government braced for Supreme Court defeat in Article 50 case |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=2017-01-21 |last1=Riley-Smith |first1=Ben |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180324190139/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/21/four-versions-brexit-law-prepared-ministers-braced-court-defeat/ |archive-date=24 March 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, all judges found unanimously that neither the [[Sewel Convention]], nor the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] and the [[Good Friday Agreement]], legally required the consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]] or the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to trigger article 50.{{NoteTag|This rejected the arguments of the [[Lord Advocate]] (also known in the [[Courts of Scotland|Scottish courts]] as ''Her Majesty's Advocate'' or ''HM Advocate'', for the [[Scottish Government]], as ''the Scottish Ministers''), the [[Counsel General for Wales]] (for the [[Welsh Government]], as ''the Welsh Ministers'') and the Northern Ireland applicants for judicial review (in Northern Ireland) (Agnew and others (Stephen Agnew, Colum Eastwood, David Ford, John O'Dowd, Dessie Donnelly, Dawn Purvis, Monica Wilson, The Committee on the Administration of Justice, The Human Rights Consortium), and Raymond McCord.}}

The majority judgment said the following.

{{Cquote|[[File:Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, delivered the majority judgment for Lady Hale, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge. Lord Reed, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes dissented.]]
51. ... ministers cannot frustrate the purpose of a statute or a statutory provision, for example by emptying it of content or preventing its effectual operation. Thus, ministers could not exercise prerogative powers at the international level to revoke the designation of Laker Airways under an aviation treaty as that would have rendered a licence granted under a statute useless: ''Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade '' [1977] QB 643 - see especially at pp 718-719 and 728 per Roskill LJ and Lawton LJ respectively. And in ''Fire Brigades Union'' cited above, at pp 551-552, Lord Browne-Wilkinson concluded that ministers could not exercise the prerogative power to set up a scheme of compensation for criminal injuries in such a way as to make a statutory scheme redundant, even though the statute in question was not yet in force. And, as already mentioned in para 35 above, he also stated that it was inappropriate for ministers to base their actions (or to invite the court to make any decision) on the basis of an anticipated repeal of a statutory provision as that would involve ministers (or the court) pre-empting Parliament’s decision whether to enact that repeal.

86. .. the EU Treaties not only concern the international relations of the United Kingdom, they are a source of domestic law, and they are a source of domestic legal rights many of which are inextricably linked with domestic law from other sources. Accordingly, the Royal prerogative to make and unmake treaties, which operates wholly on the international plane, cannot be exercised in relation to the EU Treaties, at least in the absence of domestic sanction in appropriate statutory form. It follows that, rather than the Secretary of State being able to rely on the absence in the 1972 Act of any exclusion of the prerogative power to withdraw from the EU Treaties, the proper analysis is that, unless that Act positively created such a power in relation to those Treaties, it does not exist. And, once one rejects the contention that section 2 accommodates a ministerial power to withdraw from the EU Treaties (as to which see paras 79 and 84 above), it is plain that the 1972 Act did not create such a power of withdrawal, as the Secretary of State properly accepts.

87. We accept, of course, that it would have been open to Parliament to provide expressly that the constitutional arrangements and the EU rights introduced by the 1972 Act should themselves only prevail from time to time and for so long as the UK government did not decide otherwise, and in particular did not decide to withdraw from the EU Treaties. But we cannot accept that the 1972 Act did so provide. As Lord Hoffmann explained in ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms]]'' [2000] 2 AC 115, 131, "the principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost", and so "[f]undamental rights cannot be overridden by general … words" in a statute, "because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process". Had the Bill which became the 1972 Act spelled out that ministers would be free to withdraw the United Kingdom from the EU Treaties, the implications of what Parliament was being asked to endorse would have been clear, and the courts would have so decided. But we must take the legislation as it is, and we cannot accept that, in Part I of the 1972 Act, Parliament "squarely confront[ed]" the notion that it was clothing ministers with the far-reaching and anomalous right to use a treaty-making power to remove an important source of domestic law and important domestic rights.

89. For these reasons, we disagree with Lloyd LJ’s conclusion in Rees-Mogg in so far as he held that ministers could exercise prerogative powers to withdraw from the EU Treaties....

90. The EU Treaties as implemented pursuant to the 1972 Act were and are unique in their legislative and constitutional implications. In 1972, for the first time in the history of the United Kingdom, a dynamic, international source of law was grafted onto, and above, the well-established existing sources of domestic law: Parliament and the courts. And, as explained in paras 13–15 above, before (i) signing and (ii) ratifying the 1972 Accession Treaty, ministers, acting internationally, waited for Parliament, acting domestically, (i) to give clear, if not legally binding, approval in the form of resolutions, and (ii) to enable the Treaty to be effective by passing the 1972 Act. Bearing in mind this unique history and the constitutional principle of Parliamentary sovereignty, it seems most improbable that those two parties had the intention or expectation that ministers, constitutionally the junior partner in that exercise, could subsequently remove the graft without formal appropriate sanction from the constitutionally senior partner in that exercise, Parliament.

121. Where, as in this case, implementation of a referendum result requires a change in the law of the land, and statute has not provided for that change, the change in the law must be made in the only way in which the UK constitution permits, namely through Parliamentary legislation.

122. What form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for Parliament. But, in the light of a point made in oral argument, it is right to add that the fact that Parliament may decide to content itself with a very brief statute is nothing to the point. There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. A notice under article 50(2) could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance. The essential point is that, if, as we consider, what would otherwise be a prerogative act would result in a change in domestic law, the act can only lawfully be carried out with the sanction of primary legislation enacted by the Queen in Parliament.}}

==Significance==
After the government's appeal was dismissed, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU formally introduced in Parliament, on 26 January 2017, a bill that, on 16 March, was enacted without amendment as the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]]. The act's [[long title]] is ''To Confer power on the Prime Minister to notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the EU''. The act's two sections are to confer on the Prime Minister the power of giving the notice that the Treaty requires to be given when a member state decides to withdraw.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0132/en/17132en02.htm|title=House of Commons: European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=10 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202075901/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2016-2017/0132/en/17132en02.htm|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
