== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Édouard Stern was born in 1954 to one of France's wealthiest families, the owners of the private investment house [[Banque Stern]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2009-06/07/content_8257092.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620070328/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2009-06/07/content_8257092.htm |archive-date=20 June 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His father, Antoine Jean Stern is a descendant of a notable [[Stern family|family of bankers]], going back to 19th-century [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], and his mother was Christiane Laroche, former wife of French journalist and politician [[Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Trajectoire d'une comète|url = http://www.lesechos.fr/08/06/2009/LesEchos/20439-039-ECH_trajectoire-d-une-comete.htm|website = lesechos.fr|accessdate = 18 December 2015}}</ref> He is the great grandson of {{Interlanguage link multi|Edgard Stern|fr}}.

Keen to follow in his father's footsteps, Stern graduated from the [[ESSEC Business School|Ecole Supérieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales]] (ESSEC Business School) in Paris with a degree in finance before joining the family's private investment house in 1977.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Edouard Stern|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1484959/Edouard-Stern.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 18 December 2015}}</ref>

=== Career ===
Aged 22, Stern took the reins of Banque Stern with a clear mandate to revitalize the nearly bankrupt institution. During the 1980s, Stern revamped the bank, expanding its activity in financial markets, as well as in mergers and acquisitions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Edouard Stern,Ex-Lazard Banker, Dies in Geneva at 50 (Correct) - Bloomberg|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=anMDueXhYdxE|website = www.bloomberg.com|accessdate = 18 December 2015}}</ref> In 1985, Stern sold the bank for 300 million francs<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title = How Banker's Life, Full of Intrigue,Ended in Murder|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111343050917906363|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 18 December 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = John|last = Carreyrou|first2 = Jo Wrighton in|last2 = Paris|first3 = Alessandra Galloni in Geneva Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET|last3 = JOURNAL}}</ref> ($60 million in 2005 dollars) to Lebanese investors. Thanks to a clause attached to the contract, Stern got to keep the copyright over his last name. Immediately after the sale went through, Stern started a new bank,<ref>{{Cite news|title = How Banker's Life, Full of Intrigue, Ended in Murder|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111343050917906363|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 18 December 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = John|last = Carreyrou|first2 = Jo Wrighton in|last2 = Paris|first3 = Alessandra Galloni in Geneva Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET|last3 = JOURNAL}}</ref> with a similar name and business profile, drawing in many of his former clients. He sold this second institution for an estimated 1.75 billion francs<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.lesechos.fr/08/06/2009/LesEchos/20439-038-ECH_l-affaire-stern---epilogue-d-un-itineraire-tourmente.htm|title = L'affaire Stern : épilogue d'un itinéraire tourmenté|date = 8 June 2006|accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = Les Echos|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> in 1988 to the [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBS, which will later merge with UBS to form UBS S.A.). As a result of these transactions, Stern shot up the ranks of the richest families in France, occupying the 38th spot, according to [[Forbes]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=17 June 2009|title=French woman found guilty of Stern murder|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-stern-idUSTRE55G4U820090617|access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref>

In 1992, he joined [[Lazard Frères]] as managing partner and quickly became one of the firm's star bankers and heir-apparent.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/08/business/lazard-banker-to-join-pritzker-concern.html|title = Lazard Banker to Join Pritzker Concern|date = 8 January 1998|accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = New York Times|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> He tried to reduce overhead<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2000-11-26/lazard-and-mediobanca-shocks-to-the-system-intl-edition|title = Lazard And Mediobanca: Shocks To The System|date = 27 November 2000|accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = Bloomberg|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and bring in younger partners but clashed with [[Michel David-Weill]], the bank's head and his father-in-law. He quit Lazard Frères in 1997 and set up his own investment fund, Investment Real Returns (IRR). He owned half and the remainder was held by Eurazeo, a Lazard holding company and Mainz Holdings Ltd., a U.S. Virgin Islands firm that Stern wholly owned.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=anMDueXhYdxE|title = Edouard Stern, Ex-Lazard Banker, Dies in Geneva at 50 (Correct)|date = 3 March 2015|accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = Bloomberg|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> He maintained cordial relations with David-Weill, who invested $300 million in IRR.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111343050917906363|title = How Banker's Life, Full of Intrigue, Ended in Murder|date = 14 April 2005|accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Wall Street Journal|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

In 2000, Stern bought shares in the London-based [[Delta PLC]], an international engineering group that was revising its corporate strategy. His stake eventually increased to 26%<ref name=":1" /> and after applying considerable pressure, he was named non-executive chairman on 31 December 2003. In October 2003, Stern sued [[Rhodia (company)|Rhodia]], alleging false accounting and insider dealing.<ref>[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11296013?f=singlepage] Report on Stock Market Malpractice</ref>After Stern's death, Delta was taken over by the US company, [[Valmont Industries|Valmont]].<ref name=":1" /> 

During his almost three decade long career, Stern amassed a fortune of more than a $1 billion through a series of "often brilliant business deals".<ref name=":0" /> His banking style was considered revolutionary for France's so-called "cozy capitalism", as Stern honed his skill at engineering hostile takeovers.<ref name=":0" />

=== Death ===
On 28 February 2005, Stern was found dead in his apartment in [[Geneva]], his body riddled with bullets. He was found in the bedroom, in a flesh-coloured head-to-toe latex suit. Swiss authorities arrested his long-time lover, Cécile Brossard, over the killing. Brossard, 40, was convicted and on 18 June 2009 was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison.<ref>[http://genevalunch.com/2009/06/09/stern-murder-cecile-brossard-trial-will-be-the-talk-of-geneva/ Stern murder, Cécile Brossard trial will be the talk of Geneva], GenevaLunch, 9 June 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front.html?siteSect=109&ty=st&sid=10802406&front=br Sex, power, money and blood: the Stern trial], Swissinfo.ch, 10 June 2009</ref> In addition, the Swiss court ordered Brossard to pay Stern's children one Swiss franc for "moral damage". ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' has reported that "Stern's family hopes people will stop talking about the case".<ref name="online.wsj.com">[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124536704545629299], Wall Street Journal</ref>

Cécile Brossard was freed on parole in November 2010, after spending five years in detention (including four years while awaiting trial.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millionaire-murdered-during-sm-sex-game/], CBS News</ref> In 2013, Cécile Brossard talked about the murder for the first time since the trial, confessing that she "eternally regrets" her actions and she misses her lover, who had "a lovely and luminous personality".<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-12/cecile-brossard-edouard-stern-murder-tv/5151942|title = Cecile Brossard, who killed French banker Edouard Stern during S&M session, 'eternally' regrets his death|last = |first = |date = 12 December 2013|work = |access-date = 18 December 2015|via = }}</ref><ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a3syEGz2VSTU Stern’s Mistress Gets 8 Years, 6 Months for Killing Financier], 18 June 2009, [[Bloomberg L.P.]]</ref>

The French film ''"Une Histoire d'Amour<nowiki>''</nowiki>''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2256741/ Imdb.com entry]</ref> (titled in English 'Tied') is a direct telling of the story, although the ending there could imply death by dehydration during the mistress' long plane flight rather than by (a blank) gunshot.
The story of Édouard Stern is cited as the inspiration for [[Olivier Assayas]]' 2008 film ''[[Boarding Gate]]''.<ref>[http://www.memento-films.com/www/docs_films/boardingGate/DP%20Bording%20Gate%20BD.pdf Memento Films press release]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for the film ''Boarding Gate''. retrieved 25 May 2008</ref>
The death of Édouard Stern was directly parodied on the FX animated series ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' in the third season episode "Lo Scandalo".<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/lo-scandalo,69355/], Avclub</ref>
