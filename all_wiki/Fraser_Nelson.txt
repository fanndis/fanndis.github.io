==Journalism career==
Nelson began his journalistic career as a business reporter with ''[[The Times]]'' in 1997, followed by a short spell as Scottish political correspondent.<ref name=Sabbagh /> At a party he met [[Andrew Neil]], then editor of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' who recruited him as its political editor in 2001.<ref name=Sabbagh /> In 2003 he moved to ''[[The Business (magazine)|The Business]]'', a sister title of ''The Scotsman'' in the [[Barclay brothers]]' [[Press Holdings]] group.

In July 2004 the brothers bought The Telegraph Group, which included ''The Spectator'' and in December 2005 they sold The Scotsman Publications Ltd. Neil had been appointed Chief Executive of ''The Spectator'' after the Barclays bought it, and in 2006 he brought in Nelson as associate editor and then political editor of the magazine.<ref name=Sabbagh /> He replaced [[Matthew d'Ancona]] as editor of ''The Spectator'' when the latter left in August 2009.<ref name="Guardian 2009-08-28">{{cite news |last=Brook |first=Stephen |date=28 August 2009 |title=Fraser Nelson to replace Matthew d'Ancona as ''Spectator'' editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/28/spectator-matthew-dancona-fraser-nelson |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> Under his editorship, the magazine has reached a record high in print circulation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Nelson |date=15 February 2018 |title=The Spectator's print sales hit a 190-year high – thanks to digital |url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/02/the-spectators-print-sales-hit-a-190-year-high-thanks-to-digital/ |newspaper=The Spectator |access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref>

In addition to his role as editor of ''The Spectator'', Nelson was a political columnist for the ''[[News of the World]]'' from 2006<ref name=Sabbagh /> and a board director with the [[Centre for Policy Studies]] [[think tank]].<ref name="Guardian 2009-08-28"/><ref name="CPS biog">[http://www.cps.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=cpsarticle&id=113&Itemid=20 Fraser Nelson profile] [[Centre for Policy Studies]]</ref> He was named Political Columnist of the Year in the 2009 Comment Awards.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commentawards.com/winners2009.htm | title=Comment Awards - Previous Winners 2009 | publisher=Editorial Intelligence | date=2012 | access-date=18 February 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142637/http://www.commentawards.com/winners2009.htm | archive-date=2 April 2015 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2013, the ''Evening Standard'' named Nelson as one of the most influential journalists working in London.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/the-power-1000-londons-most-influential-people-2013-thinkfluentials-news-junkies-8826344.html |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |title=The Power 1000 - London's most influential people 2013: Thinkfluentials, News junkies |date=20 September 2013 |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> The ''British Society of Magazine Editors'' awarded Nelson the ''2013 Editors' Editor of the Year''.<ref>{{cite press release |title=BSME Awards 2013 Winners |publisher=British Society of Magazine Editors |date=11 November 2013 |url=http://www.bsme.com/bsme-awards-2013-winners/ |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref> In the same year he won the [[British Press Awards|British Press Award]] as Political journalist of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=winners-2013 |title=Winners for 2013 |publisher=[[The Press Awards]] |access-date=15 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606155205/http://www.pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=winners-2013 |archive-date=6 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Style and beliefs==
Nelson is a supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He describes ''The Spectator'' magazine under his editorship as "[[Centre-right politics|right of centre]], but not strongly right of centre".<ref name=Sabbagh /> He on occasion criticised [[David Cameron]]'s leadership but was generally supportive, and has also been known to praise Cameron's Liberal Democrat coalition partner from 2010 to 2015, [[Nick Clegg]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Fraser |date=19 September 2010 |title=How I learned to stop worrying and rate Nick Clegg |url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2010/09/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-rate-nick-clegg/ |newspaper=The Spectator |accessdate=1 May 2018}}</ref> 

In May 2018 he was heavily criticised for publishing a defense of German troops by [[Taki Theodoracopulos|Taki]] titled "In praise of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''" which said readers should feel sorry for Wehrmacht soldiers at Normandy.<ref>https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/spectator-editor-fraser-nelson-claims-power-of-editors-comically-overstated-in-500th-issue-under-his-editorship/</ref><ref>https://www.timesofisrael.com/respected-british-magazine-publishes-defense-of-nazi-german-troops/</ref><ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2019/11/rod-liddles-latest-column-shows-just-how-low-spectator-will-go-attention</ref>

===Immigration===
Nelson has stated that he is a supporter of immigration.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Fraser |date=27 March 2014 |title=Only one person is laughing at the Farage-Clegg EU pantomime |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/10727368/Only-one-person-is-laughing-at-the-Farage-Clegg-EU-pantomime.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

On 4 April 2014, Nelson published a piece in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' entitled "The British Muslim is truly one among us – and proud to be so", which praised the integration of mainstream Islam in the UK and described it as one "of our great success stories".<ref>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Fraser |date=5 April 2014 |title=The British Muslim is truly one among us – and proud to be so |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10742683/The-British-Muslim-is-truly-one-among-us-and-proud-to-be-so.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> He returned to the theme in May 2015, with an article entitled "The unsayable truth about immigration: it's been a stunning success for Britain".<ref>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Fraser |date=21 May 2015 |title=The unsayable truth about immigration: it's been a stunning success for Britain |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11622192/The-unsayable-truth-about-immigration-its-been-a-stunning-success-for-Britain.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

* "The irony is that Britain does not need legislation to make it more liberal. It can already claim to be one of the most tolerant places on earth. The 2011 census showed how we have absorbed the unprecedented rates of immigration over the past decade without anything like the far-Right backlash seen on the Continent."<ref name=dec13/>

===Gay marriage===
* "If the Unitarian Church and certain strands of Judaism want to marry gay couples on their premises, then why should government stand in their way? For the record, I quite agree. Religious freedom in Britain ought to be universal, extended to the handful of churches or synagogues who want same-sex marriage."<ref name=dec13>{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Fraser |date=13 December 2012 |title=Britain is getting a glimpse of the crazy world of culture wars |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9743058/Gay-marriage-Britain-is-getting-a-glimpse-of-the-crazy-world-of-culture-wars.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

===The nuclear family===
* David Cameron is the "Prime Minister of a country where 48 percent of children will see their parents split up. Strip out immigrants (who flatter most social statistics) and only a minority of British babies are born to married parents. By the age of 16, a British child is considerably more likely to have a television in the bedroom than a father in the house."<ref name=dec13/>

===Charlie Hebdo===
Nelson wrote two days after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] a reflective piece in which he compared that massacre to the [[Deal barracks bombing]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]:<ref name=charlie/>

{{quote|What does a massacre in Paris have to do with [Muslims]? To denounce this would accept the premise that, as a Muslim, you are somehow caught up in all of this. The difference, of course, is that the IRA murdered in the name of Irish republicanism, not Catholicism. Few people in Britain thought that the former was an extension of the latter. Any priest who voiced support for terrorism, anywhere, would be excommunicated – so no one could credibly claim any overlap.  Islam is not so lucky. It has no effective means of banning hate preachers, and now has a new breed of fanatics happy to murder in its name... Overall, British Muslims have been poorly served by their leadership.}}

Nelson also noted that the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] released an unequivocal statement condemning the Paris massacre, while the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]] had released nothing to that date.
