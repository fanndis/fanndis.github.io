==Reasons for crisis==
Analysts say the reasons for the crises are slumping steel prices, local banking problems and [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|the cutting of Russian gas supply of January 2009]].<ref name="Unian">[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-291102.html Trade in Ukraine hryvnia drying up amid crisis], [[UNIAN]] (December 19, 2008)</ref><ref name="James" /> This made key industries such as metallurgy and machine building lay off workers, and real wages started to fall for the first time in a decade.

According to David Heslam of [[Fitch ratings]] "At the root of the problem is Ukraine’s inconsistent [[macroeconomic]] policy framework, as the authorities are aiming to defend the [[exchange rate]] while avoiding necessary [[Fiscal policy|fiscal tightening]] in the absence of adequate sources of [[Monetary policy|non-monetary financing]]".<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&sid=a5t8mso.EYlU Ukraine GDP Fell 15.9% Last Quarter, Extending Slump (Update3) ], [[Bloomberg L.P.]] (November 16, 2009)</ref>
