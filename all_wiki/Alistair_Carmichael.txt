====Campaign memo, and Election petition====

On 4 April 2015, during the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election campaign]] Carmichael was involved in the [[news leak|leaking]] of a memo from the [[Scotland Office]] about comments allegedly made by the French ambassador [[Sylvie Bermann]] about [[Nicola Sturgeon]], claiming that Sturgeon had privately stated she would "rather see [[David Cameron]] remain as PM", in contrast to her publicly stated opposition to a Conservative government.<ref>{{cite news|last1=John|first1=Simon|title=Nicola Sturgeon secretly backs David Cameron|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/SNP/11514933/Nicola-Sturgeon-secretly-backs-David-Cameron.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=26 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104508/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/SNP/11514933/Nicola-Sturgeon-secretly-backs-David-Cameron.html|archive-date=21 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The veracity of the memo was quickly denied by the French ambassador, French Consul General and Sturgeon herself.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Settle|first1=Michael|title=Carmichael caught in his own tangled web of deceit|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/wider-political-news/carmichael-caught-in-his-own-tangled-web-of-deceit.126958092|website=HeraldScotland.com|accessdate=23 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526012230/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/wider-political-news/carmichael-caught-in-his-own-tangled-web-of-deceit.126958092|archive-date=26 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the time of the leak, Carmichael denied all knowledge of the leaking of the memo in a television interview with [[Channel 4 News]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.channel4.com/election2015/04/05/update-931/ |title=Video of Alistair Carmichael interview by Channel 4 |access-date=23 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523132015/http://news.channel4.com/election2015/04/05/update-931/ |archive-date=23 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> After the election, Carmichael accepted the contents of the memo were incorrect, and admitted that he had lied, and that he had authorised the leaking of the inaccurate memo to the media. This was after a [[Cabinet Office]] enquiry identified Carmichael's role in the leak. The enquiry found phone records that proved Euan Roddin, Carmichael's Special Adviser, contacted the ''Telegraph ''on 1 April, two days before the story appeared.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/carmichael-faces-ethics-inquiry-as-demands-grow-for-him-to-quit-as-mp.126979265 |title="Carmichael faces ethics inquiry as demands grow for him to quit as MP", Herald Scotland, 24 May 2015 |access-date=24 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602001841/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/carmichael-faces-ethics-inquiry-as-demands-grow-for-him-to-quit-as-mp.126979265 |archive-date=2 June 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Carmichael apologised and accepted that had he still been a government minister, this was a matter that would have "required [his] resignation".<ref name=bbc-20150522>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32849065 |title=Alistair Carmichael admits Nicola Sturgeon memo leak |author=Tim Reid |publisher=BBC |date=22 May 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525040118/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32849065 |archive-date=25 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>
