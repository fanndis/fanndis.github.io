'''Lawrence Fobes King''', also known as '''Latisha King'''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bb84DwAAQBAJ&q=%22Latisha%22&pg=PP1|title=The Life and Death of Latisha King: A Critical Phenomenology of Transphobia (Sexual Cultures) Paperback|last=Salamon|first=Gayle|publisher=NYU Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1479892525|pages=7}}</ref>{{efn|Some sources use the spelling Leticia.{{r|NYT 2016/03/27}} }} (January 13, 1993 – February 13, 2008) was a 15-year-old student at [[E.O. Green Junior High School]] in [[Oxnard, California]], who was shot twice by a fellow student, 14-year-old Brandon McInerney, and kept on life support until two days later.

''[[Newsweek]]'' described the shooting as "the most prominent gay-bias crime since the 1998 murder of [[Matthew Shepard]]", bringing attention to issues of [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] as well as [[gender identity|gender expression]] and [[adolescent sexuality|sexual identity of teenagers]].<ref name="Newsweek"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=Youth Now|series=In The Life|series-link=In The Life|airdate=June 2009|number=6|season=17}}</ref>

Following many delays and a change of venue, McInerney's first trial began on July 5, 2011, in the [[Los Angeles]] district of [[Chatsworth, California|Chatsworth]]. That trial ended on September 1, 2011, when Judge Charles Campbell declared a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Prosecutors decided to try McInerney again, but dropped the hate crime charge. On November 21, 2011, McInerney avoided the scheduled retrial by pleading guilty to second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm. His plea resulted in a sentence of 21 years behind bars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/11/22/calif_teen_faces_21_years_after_guilty_plea/|title=Calif. teen faces 21 years after guilty plea|last=Risling|first=Greg|date=2011-11-22|work=Boston.com|access-date=2018-06-24}}</ref>

==Involved parties==
===Lawrence King===
Lawrence Fobes King was born on January 13, 1993<ref name="latimes3/8/2008">Pringle, Paul, Salliant, Catherine (March 8, 2008). [http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-oxnard8mar08,1,4939222.story?page=2 "A deadly clash of emotions before Oxnard shooting."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pg.

King was half African-American.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Corbett |first1=Ken |title=A murder over a girl : justice, gender, junior high |date=March 14, 2017 |isbn=978-1250118158 |pages=19}}</ref>  She was unable to care for King and resorted to [[prostitution]] to support her children and her drug habit. Two years later, King and his brother, who was a newborn, were adopted by Gregory and Dawn King.<ref name="A murder over a girl : justice, gen">{{cite book |last1=Corbett |first1=Ken |title=A murder over a girl : justice, gender, junior high |date=March 14, 2017 |isbn=978-1250118158 |pages=29–35}}</ref> His biological father had abandoned his wife, and his mother was a drug addict who failed to care for her son properly.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

King was prescribed medication for [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and, according to Gregory King, had been diagnosed with [[reactive attachment disorder]], a condition in which a child fails to develop relationships with his or her caregivers. He was also forced to repeat the first grade. By the third grade, King began to be [[bullying|bullied]] by his fellow students due to his [[effeminacy]] and openness about being gay, having [[coming out|come out]] at ten years old.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

At the age of twelve, King was placed on [[probation]] for [[theft]] and [[vandalism]], after taking food from refrigerator in the home where he was living.<ref name="A murder over a girl : justice, gen"/> In November 2007, he was removed from his adoptive home and placed in a [[group home]] and treatment center named Casa Pacifica<ref name="NYTkilling">{{cite news|last=Cathcart|first=Rebecca|date=February 23, 2008|title=Boy's Killing, Labeled a Hate Crime, Stuns a Town|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 14, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/us/23oxnard.html}}</ref> after he alleged that his adoptive father was [[Physical abuse|physically abusing]] him, a charge Gregory King denied.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

King found a marginally more accepting environment at E.O. Green Junior High School in the seventh grade. He hung out with a group of girls who didn't judge him.{{r|Newsweek}} However, he was ridiculed by boys in his gym class. Boys openly bullied him when he began attending school [[cross-dressing|wearing women's accessories and clothing]], [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] and [[Cosmetics|makeup]] in January 2008. King's younger brother Rocky also suffered bullying because of his relationship to Larry.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

Some teachers believed King's manner of dress to be distracting, and therefore a violation of school dress code. California anti-discrimination law prevents discrimination based on gender, including gender expression, so he was not prevented from dressing to his preference.<ref name="Newsweek" /> In addition to dressing in feminine clothing, Larry had begun to ask to be called Latisha in the week and a half prior to the shooting.{{r|NYT 2016/03/27}}

The school issued a formal notice via email to every teacher on January 29, 2008. Written by eighth-grade assistant principal Sue Parsons, it said, in part:{{quote|We have a student on campus who has chosen to express his [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] by wearing make-up. It is his right to do so. Some kids are finding it amusing, others are bothered by it. As long as it does not cause classroom disruptions he is within his rights. We are asking that you talk to your students about being civil and non-judgmental. They don't have to like it but they need to give him his space. We are also asking you to watch for possible problems. If you wish to talk further about it please see me or Joy Epstein.<ref name="Newsweek"/>}}

In the months before the shooting, King began to respond in kind to sustained harassment from his peers.<ref name="latimes20090212">{{cite news|last=Saillant|first=Catherine|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/12/local/me-king-mcinerney12|title=Details in gay student's slaying revealed The youth accused of shooting classmate had experience with guns and|date=February 12, 2009|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref> He would tell boys who harassed him in the [[locker room]] that they looked attractive, or ask if he could sit at their table in the cafeteria.<ref name="Newsweek" /> Some boys reported to their teachers that he would tell them, "I know you want me," in the halls between classes.<ref name="Newsweek" /> In court documents, prosecutors described these behaviors as a response to increasing aggression from other boys, particularly McInerney, with whom King had had a number of "acrimonious" verbal disputes in the weeks prior to the shooting.<ref name="latimes20090212" />

Several teachers and King's father accused Joy Epstein, one of the school's assistant principals, of encouraging Larry's flamboyance as part of a perceived "political agenda."<ref name="Newsweek" />

===Brandon McInerney===
Brandon David McInerney was born on January 24, 1994 in [[Ventura, California]]. His mother, Kendra, had a criminal history and was addicted to [[methamphetamine]].<ref name="Newsweek"/><ref name="latimes3/8/2008"/> In 1993, Kendra accused her husband William of shooting her in the arm with a [[.45 ACP|.45-caliber]] pistol.<ref name="Newsweek"/> In another incident, William McInerney choked his wife almost to unconsciousness after she accused him of stealing [[ADHD medications#Pharmacological treatment|ADHD medication]] from her older son.<ref name=latimes20080214/> He pleaded no contest and served ten days in jail and 36 months probation on a charge of domestic violence. Between August 2000 and February 2001, William McInerney had contacted [[Child Protective Services]] at least five times to express concern about his son living with his mother.<ref name="latimes3/8/2008"/> In 2001, he filed a [[restraining order]] against Kendra, and in 2004, Brandon was placed in the custody of his father, as his mother had entered a [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehabilitation program]].<ref name="Newsweek"/>

==The shooting==
In July 2008, ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that a day or two before the shooting, King walked onto the basketball court in the middle of a game and asked McInerney to be his [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] in front of the team members who then made fun of McInerney.<ref name="Newsweek"/> Just after lunchtime on February 11, King passed McInerney in a corridor and called out, "Love you, baby." Later that day King was seen "parading" back and forth in high-heeled boots and makeup in front of McInerney. According to a teacher, a group of boys were laughing at McInerney who was getting visibly upset and assistant principal Joy Epstein, noticing McInerney's reaction, wagged her finger at him.<ref name="behaviour"/> When McInerney endured teasing because of the incident, he attempted to recruit other students to assault King but no one expressed interest. He then told one of King's friends to say goodbye to him "because she would never see him [King] again".<ref name=latimes20090212/>

On the morning of February 12, 2008, McInerney was witnessed repeatedly looking at King during a class in a [[computer laboratory]]. At approximately 8:15&nbsp;a.m. local time, McInerney drew from his backpack a [[.22 Long Rifle|.22-caliber]] [[revolver]] belonging to relatives and shot King twice in the back of the head.<ref name=latimes20090212/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2008/02/gaysoflacom-rem.html|title=GaySoFla.com remembers Lawrence "Larry" King – A Young Hero|work=[[Miami Herald]]|date=February 19, 2008|accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref><ref name=CNN_plea>{{cite news|title=California teen admits killing gay student, to serve 25 years|work=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/21/justice/california-gay-student-killing/index.html|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}</ref> Following the shooting, McInerney tossed the handgun on the floor and walked from the classroom.

King was transported to [[St. John's Regional Medical Center (California)|St. John's Regional Medical Center]] where he was listed in serious condition.

Vigils and marches were organized across the United States following King's death.<ref name="latimes2/17/08">{{cite news|last=Saillant|first=Catherine|date=February 17, 2008 |title=1,000 gather in tribute to slain Oxnard teen| work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Condolences were expressed by, among many others, [[Judy Shepard]],<ref>Wilson, Craig (March 11, 2008).

A new diversity education bill was introduced on behalf of King by California Assemblyperson [[Mike Eng]], saying, "We need to teach young people that there's a curriculum called tolerance education that should be in every school. We should teach young people that diversity is not something to be assaulted, but diversity is something that needs to be embraced because diversity makes California the great state that it is."  The bill would require mandatory classes on diversity and tolerance in California school districts.<ref>[http://medianewsgroup.a.mms.mavenapps.net/mms/rt/1/site/medianewsgroup-lang-sangabriel-pub01-live/current/launch.html?maven_playerId=videos&maven_referralObject=13a7db9f-9daa-46a8-9faf-01a14ba07a9c "Mike Eng announces tolerance-promoting Bill"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228033820/http://medianewsgroup.a.mms.mavenapps.net/mms/rt/1/site/medianewsgroup-lang-sangabriel-pub01-live/current/launch.html?maven_playerId=videos&maven_referralObject=13a7db9f-9daa-46a8-9faf-01a14ba07a9c |date=February 28, 2008 }} (streaming video)</ref>

Greg believes that Larry was [[sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] McInerney, and has expressed concern that Larry is being made a [[poster child]] for gay rights issues.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

Teachers also showed some sympathy for McInerney, stating, "We failed Brandon ... We didn't know the bullying was coming from the other side—Larry was pushing as hard as he could, because he liked the attention". Hundreds of children from the school have signed a petition requesting that McInerney be tried as a juvenile.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

==Criticism of the school==
In August 2008, King's family filed a claim against E.O. Green Junior High School at Ventura County Superior Court, alleging that the school's allowing King to wear makeup and feminine clothing was a factor leading to his death.<ref name="PinkNews">{{cite web|last=Charman|first=Rachel|title=Family of Lawrence King blame death on school dress code|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8705.html|publisher=PinkNews.co.uk|date=August 15, 2008|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}</ref> According to the California Attorney General's Office, however, the school could not legally have stopped King from wearing girls' clothes because  state law prevents gender discrimination.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

According to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article published on July 19, 2008, some teachers at E.O. Green alleged that assistant principal Joy Epstein was "encouraging King's flamboyance to help further an '[[gay agenda|agenda]]'&nbsp;".<ref name="Newsweek"/> When Epstein was later promoted to principal at another local public school, King's father described it as a "slap in the face of my family". The superintendent, Jerry Dannenberg, stated that Epstein received the promotion because "she was the most qualified person for the new principal job".<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite magazine|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=Young, Gay and Murdered|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/147790&GT1=43002|magazine=Newsweek|date=July 19, 2008|accessdate=July 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722131056/http://www.newsweek.com/id/147790%26GT1%3D43002|archive-date=July 22, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Pretrial legal proceedings==
In February 2008, McInerney's lawyer, William Quest, was considering asking for a [[change of venue]].<ref>Ventura County Star – [http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/feb/29/change "Change of venue in shooting considered"], venturacountystar.com; accessed January 11, 2018.</ref> On July 24, 2008, Judge Douglas Daily of Ventura County Superior Court ruled that McInerney would stand [[trial as an adult]],<ref name="VenturaStar0725">{{cite news|url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/jul/25/judge-oks-adult-trial-for-teen-suspect|title=Judge OKs adult trial for teen suspect|first=Raul|last=Hernandez|newspaper=Ventura County Star|accessdate=July 26, 2008|date=July 25, 2008}}</ref> with the decision being appealed.<ref name="VenturaStar0808">{{cite news|url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/aug/08/mcinerney-pleads-not-guilty|title=McInerney pleads not guilty, lawyer calls charges 'death sentence'|first=Kathleen|last=Wilson|work=Ventura County Star|accessdate=August 12, 2008|date=August 8, 2008}}</ref> On August 7, 2008, in the same court, McInerney pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder and a hate crime.

On September 23, 2008, the court appointed Willard Wiksell, a lawyer from Ventura, [[guardian ad litem]] for McInerney. Previously, McInerney's family took steps to fire his lawyer, William Quest, of the Public Defenders Office and hire the United Defense Group, a criminal defense law firm from [[Los Angeles]]. However, the Public Defenders Office filed a petition stating that the United Defense Group might not have McInerney's best interests in mind.<ref name="VenturaStar0924"/>

On October 14, 2008, after the court received a report from the appointed guardian ad litem and determined that the defendant had not been [[coercion|coerced]] into changing representation and knew what he was doing, the Ventura County Superior Court allowed McInerney to fire his Public Defender, William Quest, and the Public Defenders Office, and hire the United Defense Group together with attorney Robyn Bramson as his attorneys.<ref name="VenturaStar1015">{{cite news|url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/oct/15/judge-rules-teen-accused-of-murder-may-switch|title=Judge rules teen accused of murder may switch lawyers|first=Raul|last=Hernandez|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=October 16, 2008}}</ref><ref name="pinknews1016">{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9313.html|title=Lawrence King murder suspect fires public defenders|first=Rachel|last=Charman|newspaper=Pink News|accessdate=October 16, 2008 |date= October 16, 2008}}</ref> The court also denied a motion to gag the defendant's former representatives from the Public Defenders Office from speaking about the case, especially to the media.<ref name="VenturaStar1015"/>

On December 8, 2008, Ventura County Superior Court ruled that McInerney, after being evaluated by a psychiatrist and a psychologist, was competent to stand trial. That same day, Scott S. Wippert, of the United Defense Group, filed a legal [[motion (legal)|motion for discovery]], asking the court to order the district attorney to provide documents to uncover whether prosecutors exercised discretion in sending McInerney's case to the adult court system.<ref name="VenturaStar1209">Hernandez, Raul.

On August 27, 2009, at his arraignment in Ventura County Superior Court, McInerney pleaded not guilty to all charges.

On September 1, 2009, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kevin DeNoce ruled that the addition of a lying-in-wait allegation to the list of charges was acceptable. The addition of this allegation would automatically mean that the case must be heard in an adult court. The addition was petitioned, and in November the Ventura 2nd District Appellate Court denied the request to overturn the earlier ruling, finding that the District Attorney's Office did not act vindictively in adding the lying-in-wait allegation to the murder charge.<ref name="Hernandez">{{cite news|title=State Supreme Court rejects McInerney appeal to be tried in juvenile court|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2010/jan/21/state-supreme-court-rejects-mcinerney-appeal-to|first=Raul|last=Hernandez|work =Ventura County Star|date=January 21, 2010|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref>

==Trial==
===First trial===
On the first day of trial, James Bing, McInerney's half-brother, was admonished by Judge Campbell because it was overheard that Bing went to the jury outside of the courtroom and addressed them. He said: "The fate of my brother is in your hands." Bing was then banned from the courtroom unless he was summoned to testify.<ref name=Barlow070511>{{cite news|last=Barlow|first=Zeke|title=Attorneys argue over who was the aggressor in Brandon McInerney trial|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/jul/05/lawyers-give-opening-statements-in-brandon-case/?partner=RSS|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>  The prosecutor depicted McInerney as a popular teenager, who was skilled in martial arts and firing guns as well as being a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]].  She went on to describe King as a small guy who had often been picked on, saying that King wore high-heeled boots, makeup and jewelry along with his school uniform to school.<ref name=Saillant070611>{{cite news|last=Saillant|first=Catherine|title=Slaying trial first focuses on the victim|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/06/local/la-me-0706-gay-shooting-20110706|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> Scott Wippert, McInerney's attorney, described King as the aggressor, saying he often was sexually aggressive and often made inappropriate remarks, provoking McInerney.<ref name=Barlow070511/>

Witnesses who were students and classmates of McInerney testified on July 7, 2011. One witness said that King told her he had changed his name to Leticia. Another witness said many students made fun of King and called him offensive names behind his back when he came to school wearing makeup and jewelry. A few of the witnesses said that they never noticed King making sexual advances toward other students but that sexual comments he made were "just messing" with McInerney.<ref name=Barlow070611>{{cite news|last=Barlow|first=Zeke|title=Emotional day as students testify in Brandon McInerney murder trial|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/jul/06/first-student-testifies-in-brandon-mcinerney/?print=1|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

The former vice principal of E.O. Green School, Joy Epstein testified on July 11, 2011.  She said she had discussed King's behavior with other school officials of the school district and they decided it was, according to the constitutional rights of California, legitimate for King to wear what he wanted unless it violated the school dress code. Joy Epstein said high-heeled boots, makeup and jewelry were all allowed according to the [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] school dress policy. She said another administrator within the district said that the school must protect the students' civil and equal rights.<ref name=Saillant071211>{{cite news|last=Saillant|first=Catherine|title=Oxnard teen, slain in shooting, was allowed to wear women's accessories to school, official testified|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/12/local/la-me-gay-shooting-20110712|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Another teacher testified that pupils had told her King would seek them out and follow them into the bathroom, behavior she considered to be sexual harassment.

On July 22, 2011, the jury was shown footage of a video in which McInerney was fighting in the [[Ventura County]] Juvenile hall, where he currently lives. One of the corrections officers, testified that the defendant was a "good kid" in the honors program for good behavior and had relationships with people of different backgrounds and origins.  He said that within the juvenile hall environment fighting was a routine occurrence and that McInerney was not prone to violence as the prosecution alleged.<ref name=Barlow072211>{{cite news|last=Barlow|first=Zeke|title=McInerney was not involved in gangs or supremacy groups in juvenile hall, officers testified|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/jul/22/juvenile-hall-supervisor-said-mcinerney-was-in/|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

Dawn Boldrin, an English teacher, had testified and said she counseled King and told him he should not wear attention-getting clothing if he did not want to receive negative attention.  She also gave the teen, who was exploring his sexual and/or gender identity, a strapless, green, chiffon gown.  She meant for him to wear it outside school.  A photo was shown of Larry King holding up the dress and many people in the courtroom were crying.  Greg King, Larry's father became upset and gathered his family to leave, but before doing so, Dawn King, Larry's mother, swore at Boldrin's 13-year-old daughter and a relative.  The judge later barred Dawn King from the remainder of the trial.  Because the school administrators were allowing King to wear whatever he wanted as long as it did not violate the dress code, the defense was arguing that this allowed King to sexually harass McInerney.<ref name=Saillant073011>{{cite news|last=Saillant|first=Catherine|title=Trial of teen charged with killing gay classmate grows heated|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/30/local/la-me-gay-slaying-20110730|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 30, 2011}}</ref>

The trial ended without a verdict and was declared a mistrial by the judge, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles Campbell, on Thursday, September 1, 2011, after the jury reported that they were hopelessly deadlocked and unable to reach a unanimous verdict. There were eight weeks of testimony with almost 100 witnesses, and the jury had been deliberating since August 26, 2011. The jury had taken four votes and the last vote was split between seven jurors voting for voluntary manslaughter and five jurors voting for either first-degree or second-degree murder.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mistrial declared in CA gay student killing trial|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/sep/01/jury-stuck-in-calif-gay-student-killing-trial|agency=Associated Press|date=September 1, 2011|newspaper=Ventura County Star|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mistrial declared in killing of gay California student|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/09/01/california.gay.student.murder|date=September 2, 2011|author=Staff|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref> Later analysis showed defense attorneys had chosen to pursue the [[gay panic defense]] strategy, with several jurors later stating on the television program [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|''20/20'']] that King had been bullying McInerney, leaving McInerney with "no way out".<ref name="NYT 2016/03/27">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/books/review/a-murder-over-a-girl-by-ken-corbett.html|title=Book Review: 'A Murder Over a Girl'|author=Kolker, Robert|date=March 21, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 15, 2017|quote=Larry, Corbett writes, had recently asked a few students to call him Leticia and had, on a few occasions, worn makeup and women’s accessories to school.
