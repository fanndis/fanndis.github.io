{{Culture of the United Kingdom|People}}
The '''Scottish people''' ({{lang-sco|Scots Fowk}}; {{lang-gd|Albannaich}}, {{lang-ang|Scottas}}) or '''Scots''' are a nation and [[ethnic group]] native to [[Scotland]]. Historically, they emerged from an amalgamation of two [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]-speaking peoples, the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels]], who founded the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (or ''[[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]]'') in the 9th century. Later, the neighbouring Celtic-speaking [[Britons (historical)|Cumbrians]], as well as [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]], were incorporated into the Scottish nation.

In modern usage, "Scottish people" or "Scots" refers to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland. The [[Latin]] word ''[[Scoti]]''<ref>Bede used a Latin form of the word Scots as the name of the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]].{{Cite book

People of Scottish descent live in many countries. Emigration, influenced by factors such as the [[Highland Clearances|Highland]] and [[Lowland Clearances]], Scottish emigration to various locales throughout the [[British Empire]], and latterly [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and unemployment, have resulted in Scottish people being found throughout the world. Scottish emigrants took with them their [[Scottish languages]] and [[Scottish culture|culture]]. Large populations of Scottish people settled the New-World lands of [[North America|North]] and South America, Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Canada has the highest level of Scottish descendants per capita in the world and the second-largest population of Scottish descendants, after the United States.<ref>

Scotland has seen migration and settlement of many peoples at different periods in [[History of Scotland|its history]]. [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples, such as the Anglo-Saxons, arrived beginning in the 7th century, while the Norse settled parts of Scotland from the 8th century onwards. In the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], from the reign of [[David I of Scotland]], there was some emigration from France, England and the [[Low Countries]] to Scotland. Some famous Scottish family names, including those bearing names which became [[Bruce]], [[House of Balliol|Balliol]], [[Murray (surname)|Murray]] and [[Stewart (name)|Stewart]], came to Scotland at this time. Today, Scotland is the second-largest and second most-populous [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and the majority of people living there are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].

The highest concentrations of people of Scottish descent in the world outside of Scotland are in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada, [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] in New Zealand, the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Northern Ireland]] in the United Kingdom.

==Ethnic groups of Scotland==
{{Further|Genetic history of the British Isles|Prehistoric Scotland|Scandinavian Scotland}}
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Scotland saw several ethnic or cultural groups mentioned in contemporary sources, namely the [[Picts]], the [[Gaels]], the [[Brythons|Britons]], and the [[Angles]], with the last of these settling in the southeast of the country. Culturally, these peoples are grouped according to language. Most of Scotland until the 13th century spoke [[Celtic languages]], and these included, at least initially, the [[Brythons|Britons]], as well as the [[Gaels]] and the [[Picts]].<ref>Jackson, "The Language of the Picts", discussed by Forsyth, ''Language in Pictland''.</ref> [[Germanic peoples]] included the Angles of [[Northumbria]], who settled in south-eastern Scotland in the region between the [[Firth of Forth]] to the north and the [[River Tweed]] to the south. They also occupied the south-west of Scotland up to and including the Plain of [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]]. Their language, [[Old English]], was the earliest form of the language which eventually became known as [[Scots language|Scots]].

Use of the Gaelic language spread throughout nearly the whole of Scotland by the 9th century,<ref name="bord-na-gaidhlig1">{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Thomas Owen|author-link=Thomas Owen Clancy|url=http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|title=Gaelic Scotland: a brief history|publisher=bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=21 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911232223/http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|archivedate=11 September 2007}}</ref> reaching a peak in the 11th to 13th centuries, but was never the language of the south-east of the country.<ref name="bord-na-gaidhlig1" /> [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] divided the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] between Scotland and England; at least, most medieval historians now accept the 'gift' by Edgar. In any case, after the later [[Battle of Carham]] the Scottish kingdom encompassed many English people, with even more quite possibly arriving after the [[Norman invasion of England]] in 1066. South-east of the [[Firth of Forth]], then in [[Lothian]] and the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] ([[Old English language|OE:]] ''Loðene''), a northern variety of [[Old English language|Old English]], also known as [[Early Scots]], was spoken.

[[File:St-Kildans.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Kilda, Scotland|St. Kildans]] sitting on the village street, 1886]]
As a result of [[David I of Scotland|David I, King of Scots']] return from exile in England in 1113, ultimately to assume the throne in 1124 with the help of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] military force, David invited Anglo-Norman families from France and England to settle in lands he granted them to spread a ruling class loyal to him.<ref>Barrow, "The Balance of New and Old", p. 13.</ref> This [[Davidian Revolution]], as many historians call it, brought a European style of [[feudalism]] to Scotland along with an influx of people of French descent – by invitation, unlike [[Norman conquest of England|England]] where it was by conquest. To this day, many of the [[Scottish surnames|common family names of Scotland]] can trace ancestry to Normans from this period, such as the [[Stewart (name)|Stewarts]], the [[Bruce]]s, the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamiltons]], the [[Clan Wallace#Origins of the clan|Wallaces]] and the [[Melville (name)|Melvilles]].

The [[Northern Isles]] and some parts of [[Caithness]] were [[Norn language|Norn]]-speaking (the west of Caithness was Gaelic-speaking into the 20th century, as were some small communities in parts of the Central Highlands). From 1200 to 1500 the [[Early Scots]] language spread across the lowland parts of Scotland between [[Galloway]] and the Highland line, being used by [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]] in his historical epic ''[[The Brus]]'' in the late 14th century in Aberdeen.

From 1500 on, Scotland was commonly divided by language into two groups of people, [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic-speaking]] "[[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]]s" (the language formerly called Scottis by English speakers and known by many Lowlanders in the 18th century as "Irish") and the [[Early Scots|Inglis]]-speaking "[[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlander]]s" (a language later to be called [[Scots language|Scots]]). Today, immigrants have brought other languages, but almost every adult throughout Scotland is fluent in the English language.

The majority of Scotch-Irish originally came from Lowland Scotland and Northern England before migrating to the province of [[Ulster]] in Ireland (see ''[[Plantation of Ulster]]'') and thence, beginning about five [[generation]]s later, to North America in large numbers during the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

{{main|Scottish Canadians}}
As the third-largest [[ethnic group]] in Canada and amongst the first Europeans to settle in the country, Scottish people have made a large impact on [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] since colonial times. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Canada]], the number of Canadians claiming full or partial Scottish descent is 4,714,970,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000#archived|title=Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data|work=Statistics Canada|date=6 October 2010|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref> or 15.10% of the nation's total population.

Many respondents may have misunderstood the question and the numerous responses for "Canadian" does not give an accurate figure for numerous groups, particularly those of British Isles origins. Scottish-Canadians are the 3rd biggest ethnic group in Canada. Scottish culture has particularly thrived in the Canadian province of [[Nova Scotia]] ([[Latin]] for "New Scotland"). There, in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], where both lowland and highland Scots settled in large numbers, [[Canadian Gaelic]] is still spoken by a small number of residents. Cape Breton is the home of the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]]. [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]] in present-day [[Eastern Ontario]] is a historic county that was set up as a settlement for [[Scottish Highlands|Highland Scots]], where many from the Highlands settled to preserve their culture in result of the Highland Clearances. Gaelic was the native language of the community since its settlement in the 18th century although the number of speakers decreased since as a result of English migration{{clarify|date=December 2016}}. As of the modern 21st century, there are still a few Gaelic speakers in the community.

[[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in his book ''The Scotch'' (Toronto: MacMillan, 1964) documents the descendants of 19th-century Scottish pioneers who settled in [[Southwestern Ontario]] and affectionately referred to themselves as 'Scotch'. He states the book was meant to give a true picture of life in the community in the early decades of the 20th century.

===Australia===
{{main|Scottish Australians}}
[[File:Thomasbrisbane.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|The Australian city of [[Brisbane]] is named after Scotsman [[Thomas Brisbane]].]]
By 1830, 15.11% of the colonies' total non-Aboriginal population were Scots, which increased by the middle of the century to 25,000, or 20–25% of the non-Aboriginal population. The [[Australian Gold Rush]] of the 1850s provided a further impetus for Scottish migration: in the 1850s 90,000 Scots immigrated to Australia, far more than other British or Irish populations at the time.<ref name="The Australian People 2001 p650">The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins. (2001) James Jupp p650 Cambridge University Press.</ref> Literacy rates of the Scottish immigrants ran at 90–95%. By 1860, Scots made up 50% of the ethnic composition of [[Western Victoria]], [[Adelaide]], [[Penola, South Australia|Penola]] and [[Naracoorte, South Australia|Naracoorte]]. Other settlements in [[New South Wales]] included [[New England (Australia)|New England]], the [[Hunter Region|Hunter Valley]] and the [[Illawarra]].

Much settlement followed the [[Highland Potato Famine]], [[Highland Clearances]] and the [[Lowland Clearances]] of the mid-19th century.
In the 1840s, Scots-born immigrants constituted 12% of the non-Aboriginal population. Out of the 1.3&nbsp;million migrants from Britain to Australia in the period from 1861 to 1914, 13.5% were Scots. Just 5.3% of the convicts transported to Eastern Australia between 1789 and 1852 were Scots.<ref>{{cite web|first=Angus|last=Innes|author-link=Angus Innes|url=http://www.qldmigrationheritage.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Scots1.pdf|title=Scots|publisher=Multicultural Queensland 2001; Queensland Migration Heritage Hub|year=2001|url-status=unfit|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GMIBhzDD?url=http://www.qldmigrationheritage.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Scots1.pdf|archivedate=4 May 2013}}</ref>

A steady rate of Scottish immigration continued into the 20th century and substantial numbers of Scots continued to arrive after 1945.<ref name="Australia 2008">The Scots in Australia (2008) M. Prentis UNSW Press.</ref> From 1900 until the 1950s, Scots favoured New South Wales, as well as Western Australia and Southern Australia.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A strong cultural Scottish presence is evident in the [[Highland Games]], dance, [[Tartan Day]] celebrations, clan and Gaelic-speaking societies found throughout modern Australia.

According to the 2011 Australian census, 130,204 Australian residents were born in [[Scotland]],<ref name="ABS Country of Birth">{{cite web| url = http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&documentproductno=0&documenttype=Details&order=1&tabname=Details&areacode=0&issue=2006&producttype=Census%20Tables&javascript=true&textversion=false&navmapdisplayed=true&breadcrumb=POLTD&&collection=Census&period=2006&productlabel=Country%20of%20Birth%20of%20Person%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&producttype=Census%20Tables&method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&topic=Birthplace& |title = 20680-Country of Birth of Person (full classification list) by Sex&nbsp;– Australia|format = Microsoft Excel download | work = 2006 Census|publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |accessdate = 2 November 2008}}</ref> while 1,792,600 claimed Scottish ancestry, either alone or in combination with another ancestry.<ref name="abs.gov.au" /> This is the fourth most commonly nominated ancestry and represents over 8.9% of the total population of Australia.

===New Zealand===
{{main|Scottish New Zealanders}}
[[File:William Allsworth - The emigrants - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Scottish Highland family migrating to [[New Zealand]] in 1844]]
Significant numbers of Scottish people also settled in New Zealand. Approximately 20 percent of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland, and Scottish influence is still visible around the country.<ref>Linguistic Archaeology: The Scottish Input to New Zealand English Phonology
Trudgill et al. Journal of English Linguistics.2003; 31: 103–124</ref> The [[South Island]] city of [[Dunedin]], in particular, is known for its Scottish heritage and was named as a tribute to [[Edinburgh]] by the city's Scottish founders.

Scottish migration to New Zealand dates back to the earliest period of European colonisation, with a large proportion of [[Pākehā]] New Zealanders being of Scottish descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturemagics.com/world-guide/new-zealand.shtm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129131155/http://www.naturemagics.com/world-guide/new-zealand.shtm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-29|title=New Zealand|publisher=Naturemagics.com}}</ref> However, identification as "British" or "European" New Zealanders can sometimes obscure their origin. Many Scottish New Zealanders also have [[Māori people|Māori]] or other non-European ancestry.

The majority of Scottish immigrants settled in the South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many [[Caledonia]]n societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The Games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the Games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.<ref>Tanja Bueltmann, "'No Colonists are more Imbued with their National Sympathies than Scotchmen,'" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (2009) 43#2 pp 169–181 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1771&action=null online]</ref> In the 1961 [[New Zealand census|census]] there were 47,078 people living in New Zealand who were born in Scotland; in the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]] there were 25,953 in this category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/birthplace.aspx |title=2013 Census QuickStats about culture and identity: Birthplace and people born overseas |website=Stats.govt.nz |accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>

Many people of Scottish descent live in other parts of the United Kingdom. In [[Ulster]] particularly the colonial policies of [[James VI and I|James VI]], known as the [[plantation of Ulster]], resulted in a Presbyterian and Scottish society, which formed the [[Ulster-Scots]] community.<ref>{{cite book|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_qADAAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|title=Anti-Catholicism in Northern Ireland: The Mote and the Beam| author1=J.

===Rest of Europe===
Other European countries have had their share of Scots immigrants.

==Scots in mainland Europe==

===Netherlands===
It is said{{by whom|date=September 2013}} that the first people from the [[Low Countries]] to settle in Scotland came in the wake of [[Maud, Countess of Huntingdon|Maud's]] marriage to the Scottish king, [[David I of Scotland|David I]], during the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. {{when|date=December 2016}} Craftsmen and tradesmen followed courtiers and in later centuries a brisk trade grew up between the two nations: Scotland's primary goods (wool, hides, salmon and then coal) in exchange for the luxuries obtainable in the Netherlands, one of the major hubs of European trade.

By 1600, trading colonies had grown up on either side of the well-travelled shipping routes: the Dutch settled along the eastern seaboard of Scotland; the Scots congregating first in [[Campvere]]—where they were allowed to land their goods duty-free and run their own affairs—and then in [[Rotterdam]], where Scottish and Dutch [[Calvinism]] coexisted comfortably. Besides the thousands (or, according to one estimate, over 1&nbsp;million){{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of local descendants with Scots ancestry, both ports still show signs of these early alliances. Now a museum, 'The Scots House' in the town of [[Veere]] was the only place outwith Scotland where [[Scots Law]] was practised. In Rotterdam, meanwhile, the doors of the [[Scots International Church]] have remained open since 1643.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/netherlands.html |title=Scotland and The Netherlands, Trade, Business & Economy – Official Online Gateway to Scotland |publisher=Scotland.org |accessdate=19 March 2009}}</ref>

===Russia===
{{main|Scottish Russians}}[[File:FotoGordon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Patrick Gordon]] was a Russian General originally from Scotland and a friend of [[Peter the Great]].]]
The first Scots to be mentioned in Russia's history were the Scottish soldiers in [[Muscovy]] referred to as early as in the 14th century.<ref>[[Paul Dukes (historian)|Paul Dukes]], Scottish soldiers in Moscovy in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987</ref> Among the 'soldiers of fortune' was the ancestor to famous Russian poet [[Mikhail Lermontov]], called George Learmonth. A number of Scots gained wealth and fame in the times of [[Peter the Great]] and [[Catherine the Great]].<ref>A.G. Cross, Scoto-Russian contacts in the reign of Catherine the great (1762–1796), in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987</ref> These include Admiral [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]], Commander-in-Chief of [[Kronstadt]], [[Patrick Gordon]], [[Paul Menzies]], [[Samuel Greig]], [[Charles Baird (engineer)|Charles Baird]], [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]], [[Adam Menelaws]] and [[William Heste|William Hastie]]. Several doctors to the Russian court were from Scotland,<ref>John H. Appleby, Through the looking-glass: Scottish doctors in Russia (1704–1854), in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987</ref> the best known being [[Sir James Wylie, 1st Baronet|James Wylie]].

The next wave of migration established commercial links with Russia.<ref>John R. Bowles, From the banks of the Neva to the shores of Lake Baikal: some enterprising Scots in Russia, in The Caledonian Phalanx, 1987</ref>

The 19th century witnessed the immense literary cross-references between Scotland and Russia.{{clarify|date=December 2012}}

A Russian scholar, Maria Koroleva, distinguishes between 'the Russian Scots' (properly assimilated) and 'Scots in Russia', who remained thoroughly Scottish.<ref>M.V. Koroleva, A.L. Sinitsa. Gelskoe naselenie Shotlandii, ot istokov k sovremennosti, in Demographic studies, Moscow, 2010, pp. 163–191.</ref>

There are several societies in contemporary Russia to unite{{clarify|date=December 2012}} the Scots. The Russian census lists does not distinguish Scots from other British people, so it is hard to establish reliable figures for the number of Scots living and working in modern Russia.

===Poland===
From as far back as the mid-16th century there were Scots trading and settling in [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/scotland-and-poland-a-500-year-relationship-1-4081795 |title=Scotland and Poland – a 500-year relationship |work=The Scotsman |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref> A "Scotch Pedlar's Pack in Poland" became a proverbial expression. It usually consisted of cloths, woollen goods and linen kerchiefs (head coverings). Itinerants also sold tin utensils and ironware such as scissors and knives. Along with the protection offered by [[Stephen Báthory|King Stephen]] in the Royal Grant of 1576, a district in [[Kraków]] was assigned to Scottish immigrants.

Records from 1592 mention Scots settlers granted citizenship of Kraków, and give their employment as trader or merchant. Fees for citizenship ranged from 12 Polish florins to a musket and gunpowder, or an undertaking to marry within a year and a day of acquiring a holding.

By the 17th century, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Scots lived in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name=diaspora>Eric Richards (2004).

Settlers from [[Aberdeenshire]] were mainly Episcopalians or Catholics, but there were also large numbers of Calvinists. As well as Scottish traders, there were also many Scottish soldiers in Poland. In 1656, a number of [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish highlanders]] seeking opportunities abroad, emigrated to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to enlist in the [[Swedish Army]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] in his [[Deluge (history)#Swedish invasion|war against it]].

A series of four Polish novels include him as ''Captain Mora'' or ''Flying Scotsman''. The writer Jerzy Bogdan Rychliński was supported by navy historian Jerzy Pertek.<ref>https://repozytorium.ukw.edu.pl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/item/4443/Pertek%20wobec%20powiesci%20historycznych%20Rychlinskiego%20w%20swietle%20korespondencji%20pisarzy.pdf</ref>{{Request quotation|date=October 2019}}

The Scots integrated well and many acquired great wealth. They contributed to many charitable institutions in the host country, but did not forget their homeland; for example, in 1701 when collections were made for the restoration fund of the [[Marischal College]], Aberdeen, Scottish settlers in Poland gave generously.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Many royal grants and privileges were granted to Scottish merchants until the 18th century, at which time the settlers began to merge more and more into the native population. [[Charles Edward Stuart|"Bonnie Prince Charlie"]] was half Polish, since he was the son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the "Old Pretender", and [[Maria Clementina Sobieska|Clementina Sobieska]], granddaughter of [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]], King of Poland.<ref>

By 1592, the Scottish community in Rome was big enough to merit the building of [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] (St Andrew of the Scots). It was constructed for the Scottish expatriate community in Rome, especially for those intended for priesthood. The adjoining hospice was a shelter for Catholic Scots who fled their country because of religious persecution. In 1615, [[Pope Paul V]] gave the hospice and the nearby Scottish Seminar to the [[Jesuits]]. It was rebuilt in 1645. The church and facilities became more important when [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Old Pretender, set up residence in Rome in 1717, but were abandoned during the French occupation of Rome in the late 18th century. In 1820, although religious activity was resumed, it was no longer led by the Jesuits. [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] was reconstructed in 1869 by [[Luigi Poletti (architect)|Luigi Poletti]]. The church was deconsecrated in 1962 and incorporated into a bank (Cassa di Risparmio delle Province Lombarde). The Scottish Seminar also moved away. The [[St. Andrew's Day|Feast of St Andrew]] is still celebrated there on 30 November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/11/29/saint_andrew,_apostle_and_patron_of_scotland/1275597 |title=Saint Andrew, Apostle and Patron of Scotland |publisher=Vatican Radio |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>

===Language===
{{See also|Languages of Scotland}}

Historically, Scottish people have spoken many different languages and dialects. The Pictish language, Norse, Norman-French and Brythonic languages have been spoken by forebears of Scottish people. However, none of these are in use today. The remaining three major languages of the Scottish people are English, [[Scots Language|Scots]] (various dialects) and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. Of these three, English is the most common form as a first language. There are some other minority languages of the Scottish people, such as Spanish, used by the population of Scots in [[Argentina]].

The [[Norn language]] was spoken in the [[Northern Isles]] into the early modern period – the current [[Shetland dialect|Shetland]] and [[Orcadian dialect|Orcadian]] dialects are heavily influenced by it to this day.

There is still debate whether Scots is a dialect or a language in its own right, as there is no clear line to define the two. Scots is usually regarded as a midway between the two, as it is highly mutually intelligible with English, particularly the dialects spoken in the North of England as well as those spoken in Scotland, but is treated as a language in some laws.

====Scottish English====
{{Main|Scottish English}}
After the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603, the Scottish Court moved with [[James I of England|James VI & I]] to London and English vocabulary began to be used by the Scottish upper classes.<ref name=Crystal /> With the introduction of the [[printing press]], spellings became standardised. [[Scottish English]], a Scottish variation of southern [[English English]], began to replace the Scots language. Scottish English soon became the dominant language. By the end of the 17th century, Scots had practically ceased to exist, at least in literary form.<ref>{{Cite book

Lowland Scots, also known as [[Lallans]] or [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]], is a language of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin. It has its roots in Northern [[Middle English]]. After the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|wars of independence]], the English used by Lowland Scots speakers evolved in a different direction from that of Modern [[English language in England|English]].

====Scottish Gaelic====
{{Main|Scottish Gaelic}}
{{See also|Canadian Gaelic}}
[[Scottish Gaelic]] is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] with similarities to Irish. [[Scottish Gaelic]] comes from [[Old Irish]]. It was originally spoken by the [[Gaels]] of [[Dál Riata]] and the [[Rhinns of Galloway]], later being adopted by the [[Pictish]] people of central and eastern Scotland. Gaelic (''lingua Scottica'', ''Scottis'') became the ''de facto'' language of the whole [[Kingdom of Alba]], giving its name to the country (''Scotia'', "Scotland"). Meanwhile, Gaelic independently spread from [[Galloway]] into [[Dumfriesshire]]. It is unclear if the Gaelic of 12th-century [[Clydesdale]] and [[Selkirkshire]] came from Galloway or other parts of Scotland. The predominance of Gaelic began to decline in the 13th century, and by the end of the Middle Ages, Scotland was divided into two linguistic zones, the English/Scots-speaking Lowlands and the Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Galloway. Gaelic continued to be spoken widely throughout the Highlands until the 19th century. The [[Highland clearances]] actively discouraged the use of Gaelic, and caused the numbers of Gaelic speakers to fall.<ref>{{Cite book

Communities where the language is still spoken natively are restricted to the west coast of Scotland; and especially the [[Hebrides]]. However, some Gaelic speakers also live in the cities of [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. A report in 2005 by the Registrar General for Scotland based on the [[2001 UK Census]] showed about 92,400 people or 1.9% of the population can speak Gaelic, while the number of people able to read and write it rose by 7.5% and 10% respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/4326424.stm |title=UK &#124; Mixed report on Gaelic language |work=BBC News|date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> Outwith Scotland, there are communities of Scottish Gaelic speakers such as the [[Canadian Gaelic]] community; though their numbers have also been declining rapidly. Gaelic language is recognised as a minority language by the [[European Union]]. The [[Scottish parliament]] is also seeking to increase the use of Gaelic in Scotland through the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]]. Gaelic is now used as a first language in some schools and is prominently seen in use on [[Gaelic road signs in Scotland|dual language road signs]] throughout the Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland. It is recognised as an official language of Scotland with "equal respect" to English.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===Religion===
{{See also|Religion in Scotland}}
The modern people of Scotland remain a mix of different religions and no religion. Christianity is the largest faith in Scotland. In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], 53.8% of the Scottish population identified as [[Christians|Christian]].<ref name="2011census">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35953639|title=BBC Report – Most People in Scotland 'Not Religious'|date=3 April 2016|work=BBC News |accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> The Protestant and Catholic divisions still remain in the society.

==Anglicisation==
{{Main|Anglicisation}}
{{Original research|section|date=June 2010}}
Many [[Scottish surnames]] have become [[anglicised]] over the centuries. This reflected the gradual spread of English, initially in the form of [[Early Scots]], from around the 13th century onwards, through Scotland beyond its traditional area in the Lothians. It also reflected some deliberate political attempts{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} to promote the English language in the outlying regions of Scotland, including following the Union of the Crowns under King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] in 1603, and then the [[Acts of Union of 1707]] and the subsequent defeat of rebellions.{{who|date=December 2016}}

However, many Scottish surnames have remained predominantly [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] albeit written according to English [[orthography|orthographic]] practice (as with Irish surnames). Thus ''MacAoidh'' in Gaelic is ''Mackay'' in English, and ''MacGill-Eain'' in Gaelic is ''MacLean'' and so on. ''Mac'' (sometimes ''Mc'') is common as, effectively, it means "son of". ''MacDonald'', ''MacDougal'', ''MacAulay'', ''Gilmore'', ''Gilmour'', ''MacKinley'', ''Macintosh'', ''MacKenzie'', ''MacNeill'', ''MacPherson'', ''MacLear'', ''MacAra'', ''Bruce'', ''Campbell'', ''Fraser'', ''Oliver'', ''Craig'', ''Lauder'', ''Menzies'', ''Stewart'', ''Galloway'' and ''Duncan'' are just a few of many examples of traditional Scottish surnames. There are, of course, also the many surnames, like ''Wallace'' and ''Morton'', stemming from parts of Scotland which were settled by peoples other than the [[Scoti|(Gaelic) Scots]]. The most common surnames in Scotland are ''Smith'' and ''Brown'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/births/popular-names/archive/100-most-common-surnames|title=100 Most Common Surnames|work=National Records of Scotland|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> which each come from more than one origin: e.g. Smith might be a translation of Mac a' Ghobhainn (thence also e.g. MacGowan), and Brown can refer to the colour, or be akin to MacBrayne.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Anglicisation is not restricted to language. In his ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, future British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] wrote: "The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past, and, being
deprived of the inspiration of its nationality, is also deprived of its communal sense."<ref name="MacDonald1921">{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|authorlink=Ramsay MacDonald|title=Socialism: Critical and Constructive|chapter-url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/download/SocialismCriticalandConstructive_10094299.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2016|year=1921|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|page=249|chapter=CHAPTER VI Political Construction: The Democratic State}}</ref>

</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} [[Bede|The Venerable Bede]] (c. 672 or 673 – 27 May, 735) uses the word ''Scottorum'' for the nation from Ireland who settled part of the [[Pictish]] lands: "''Scottorum nationem in Pictorum parte recipit''."  This we can infer to mean the arrival of the people, also known as the [[Gaels]], in the Kingdom of Dál Riata, in the western edge of Scotland. It is of note that Bede used the word ''natio'' (nation) for the Scots, where he often refers to other peoples, such as the Picts, with the word ''gens'' (race).<ref name="Harris 72">{{Cite book

In modern times the words ''Scot'' and ''Scottish'' are applied mainly to inhabitants of Scotland. The possible ancient Irish connotations are largely forgotten. The language known as ''[[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]]'', spoken in parts of northeastern Ireland, is the result of 17th- and 18th-century immigration to Ireland from Scotland.

In the English language, the word ''[[Scotch (adjective)|Scotch]]'' is a term to describe a thing from Scotland, such as ''Scotch whisky''. However, when referring to people, the preferred term is ''Scots''. Many Scottish people find the term ''Scotch'' to be offensive when applied to people.<ref name="Scotch_Off">[http://www.bartleby.com/61/8/S0160800.html The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language] Scotch usage note, [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/scotch.html Encarta Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420062343/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/scotch.html |date=20 April 2006 }} usage note.</ref> The Oxford Dictionary describes ''Scotch'' as an old-fashioned term for "Scottish".<ref name="OED_Scotch">{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/scotch?view=uk |title=Definition of scotch |publisher=Askoxford.com |date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>
