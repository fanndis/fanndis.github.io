The [[Global Terrorism Database]], maintained by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Global Terrorism Index 2015 |url=http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf |publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace |page=33}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word terror is derived from the [[Latin]] verb ''Tersere'', which later becomes ''Terrere''. The latter form appears in European languages as early as the 12th century; its first known use in French is the word ''terrible'' in 1160. By 1356 the word ''terreur'' is in use. ''Terreur'' is the origin of the [[Middle English]] term ''terrour'', which later becomes the modern word "terror".<ref name=jf/>

The term ''terroriste'', meaning "terrorist", is first used in 1794 by the French philosopher [[François-Noël Babeuf]], who denounces [[Maximilien Robespierre]]{{'}}s [[Jacobin]] regime as a dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher=Princeton University Press |last=Palmer |first=R.R. |title=The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760–1800 |journal=The Age of the Democratic Revolution |pages=544–567 |chapter=The French Directory Between Extremes |date=2014 |jstor=j.ctt5hhrg5.29|isbn=9780691161280 }}</ref><ref name=kellner>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/17405900410001674515 |issn=1740-5904 |eissn=1740-5912 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=41–64 |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=9/11, spectacles of terror, and media manipulation: A critique of Jihadist and Bush media politics |journal=Critical Discourse Studies |date=April 2004 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In the years leading up to what became known as the Reign of Terror, the [[Brunswick Manifesto]] threatened Paris with an "exemplary, never to be forgotten vengeance: the city would be subjected to military punishment and total destruction" if the royal family was harmed, but this only increased the Revolution's will to abolish the monarchy.<ref name=duncan/> Some writers attitudes about [[French Revolution]] grew less favorable after the French monarchy was abolished in 1792. During the [[Reign of Terror]], which began in July 1793 and lasted thirteen months, Paris was governed by the Committee of Public safety who oversaw a regime of mass executions and public purges.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4725-0912-3 |last=Crawford |first=Joseph |title=Gothic Fiction and the Invention of Terrorism: The Politics and Aesthetics of Fear in the Age of the Reign of Terror |date=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

Prior to the French Revolution, ancient philosophers wrote about [[tyrannicide]], as tyranny was seen as the greatest political threat to Greco-Roman civilization. [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval philosophers]] were similarly occupied with the concept of tyranny, though the analysis of some theologians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] drew a distinction between usurpers, who could be killed by anyone, and legitimate rulers who abused their power—the latter, in Aquinas' view, could only be punished by a public authority. [[John of Salisbury]] was the first medieval Christian scholar to defend tyrannicide.<ref name=jf>{{Cite journal |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=271–288 |last=Fine |first=Jonathan |title=Political and Philological Origins of the Term 'Terrorism' from the Ancient Near East to Our Times |journal=Middle Eastern Studies |year=2010 |jstor=20720662|doi=10.1080/00263201003619927 |s2cid=143268246 }}</ref>

Most scholars today trace the origins of the modern tactic of terrorism to the Jewish [[Sicarii Zealots]] who attacked Romans and Jews in 1st-century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. They follow its development from the Persian [[Order of Assassins]] through to 19th-century anarchists. The "Reign of Terror" is usually regarded as an issue of etymology.

In December 1795, [[Edmund Burke]] used the word "Terrorists" in a description of the new [[French Directory|French government called 'Directory']]:<ref>[[Edmund Burke]] – To The Earl Fitzwilliam (Christmas, 1795.) In: Edmund Burke, ''Select Works of Edmund Burke, vol. 3 (Letters on a Regicide Peace)'' (1795).<br/>This Internet version contains two, mingled, indications of page numbers: one with single brackets like [260], one with double brackets like [ [309] ]. Burke lengthily introduces his view on 'this present [[French Directory|Directory government]]', and then writes on page [359]: "Those who arbitrarily erected the new building out of the old materials of their own [[National Convention|Convention]], were obliged to send for an Army to support their work. (...) At length, after a terrible struggle, the Troops prevailed over the Citizens. (...) This power is to last as long as the Parisians think proper. (...)

Experts disagree about "whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether or not states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of ''terror'' for a definition of ''terrorism''."<ref name=teichman/>

===State terrorism===
{{Main|State terrorism}}
State terrorism refers to acts of terrorism conducted by a [[State (polity)|state]] against its own citizens or against another state.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aust, Anthony|title=Handbook of International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-521-13349-4|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74Zmct-7hGIC&pg=PA265}}</ref>

===United Nations===
In November 2004, a [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] report described terrorism as any act "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act".<!-- ''(Note that this report does not constitute [[international law]])'' --><ref>{{cite web |title=UN Reform |publisher=United Nations |date=March 21, 2005 |url=https://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427012107/http://www.un.org/unifeed/script.asp?scriptId=73 |archive-date=April 27, 2007 |access-date=July 11, 2008 |quote=The second part of the report, entitled "Freedom from Fear backs the definition of terrorism–an issue so divisive agreement on it has long eluded the world community – as any action "intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act"}}</ref> The [[international community]] has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term "terrorism" is politically and emotionally charged.<ref name="Hoffman-1998-p32">Hoffman (1998), p. 32, See review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html Inside Terrorism].</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ |title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review |date=March 27, 2013 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref> In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,
<blockquote>The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.<ref name=Martyn>Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September], Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, February 12, 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216134913/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref></blockquote>

These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a [[Definition of terrorism#Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism|Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.<ref>Diaz-Paniagua (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&lpg=PR4 ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997–2005''], p. 47.</ref> The international community has adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.

Since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
<blockquote>Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.<ref>1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60, "Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm UN Doc. A/Res/60/49].</ref></blockquote>

===U.S. law===
Various legal systems and government agencies use different [[Anti-terrorism legislation|definitions of terrorism in their national legislation]].

U.S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:
"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f |title=22 U.S. Code §&nbsp;2656f – Annual country reports on terrorism |website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

18 U.S.C. §&nbsp;2331 defines "international terrorism" and "domestic terrorism" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled "Terrorism":

"International terrorism" means activities with the following three characteristics:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331|title=18 U.S. Code § 2331 - Definitions|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization.

=== Pejorative use ===
{{See also|Controversies about labeling terrorism}}
Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state groups.<ref name=Walzer/><ref name=Sinclair/><ref name=JR.White/><ref name=Heryant/><ref name=Ruthven/>

Those labeled "terrorists" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as [[separatist]], [[freedom fighter]], liberator, [[revolutionary]], [[vigilante]], [[Insurgent|militant]], paramilitary, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]], [[rebellion|rebel]], patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. [[Jihad]]i, [[mujaheddin]], and [[fedayeen]] are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.<ref name=tws11janbcvc>{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title=UN staggers on road to reform |quote=This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter&nbsp;... |work=BBC News |date=September 14, 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|access-date= January 11, 2010}}</ref>

On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, [[utilitarian]] philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the "harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism".<ref name="Robin">Rodin, David (2006). "Terrorism". In E. Craig (Ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge.</ref> Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, [[Michael Walzer]] argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when "a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so".<ref name="Robin"/><ref name=tws11jannmllk>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Steinfels |title=Beliefs; The just-war tradition, its last-resort criterion and the debate on an invasion of Iraq |quote=For those like Professor Walzer who value the just-war tradition as a disciplined way to think about the morality of war&nbsp;... |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 1, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/us/beliefs-just-war-tradition-its-last-resort-criterion-debate-invasion-iraq.html?pagewanted=1|access-date= January 11, 2010}}</ref>

In his book ''Inside Terrorism'' [[Bruce Hoffman]] offered an explanation of why the term ''terrorism'' becomes distorted:
{{quote|On one point, at least, everyone agrees: ''terrorism'' is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label ''terrorist'' to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization ''terrorist'' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.<ref name=tws11jant5r4>{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Hoffman |author-link=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |quote=Google cached copy |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-11468-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/insideterrorism00hoff/page/32 32] |year=1998 |url=https://archive.org/details/insideterrorism00hoff/page/32 |access-date=2010-01-11 }}</ref><ref name=tws11jant5r555>{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Hoffman |author-link=Bruce Hoffman |title=Inside Terrorism |newspaper=The New York Times |year=1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html|access-date= January 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=tws11jangbbjj>{{cite news |first=Raymond |last=Bonner |title=Getting Attention: A scholar's historical and political survey of terrorism finds that it works |quote=''Inside Terrorism'' falls into the category of 'must read,' at least for anyone who wants to understand how we can respond to international acts of terror. |newspaper=The New York Times: Books |date=November 1, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01bonnert.html|access-date= January 11, 2010}}</ref>}}

Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists.

The term "terrorism" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the [[Jacobin Club]] during the "[[Reign of Terror]]" in the [[French Revolution]].

In early 1975, the [[National Institute of Justice|Law Enforcement Assistant Administration]] in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled ''Disorders and Terrorism'', produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff.

The Task Force defines terrorism as "a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes". It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/39469NCJRS.pdf |title=Disorders and Terrorism |website=National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals |year=1976 |pages=3–6}}</ref><!--[[File:US Army Humvee attacked.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Humvee destroyed by a [[car bomb]], Baghdad, [[Iraq]] in 2006.]]-->
* '''Civil disorder''' – A form of collective violence interfering with the [[peace]], security, and normal functioning of the community.
* '''Political terrorism''' – [[Violence|Violent]] criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate [[fear]] in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes.
* '''Non-Political terrorism''' – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits "conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for [[coercion|coercive]] purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective".
* '''Quasi-terrorism''' – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quasi-terrorism |url=https://mukkulreddy.wordpress.com/types-of-terrorism/quasi-terrorism/ |website=Mukkulreddy.wordpress.com|access-date= July 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Types of Terrorism |url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/types-of-terrorism/ |publisher=Crime Museum|access-date= July 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=TERRORISM |url=http://www.earthdash.org/more_info/terrorism.html |publisher=Earth Dashboard|access-date= July 13, 2016}}</ref> For example, the fleeing [[felony|felon]] who takes [[hostage]]s is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different.
* '''Limited political terrorism''' – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a [[revolutionary]] approach; limited political terrorism refers to "acts of terrorism which are committed for [[ideology|ideological]] or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the [[Sovereign state|state]]".
* '''Official or state terrorism''' – "referring to nations whose rule is based upon [[fear]] and [[oppression]] that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions". It may be referred to as '''Structural Terrorism''' defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy.

Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into '''domestic terrorism''' and '''international terrorism''', or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism.<ref>{{cite book |title=Terrorism and homeland security: an introduction with applications |first=Philip P. |last=Purpura |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-7506-7843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ItzwLVo8DwC&pg=PA17 |pages=16–19}}</ref> One way the typology of terrorism may be defined:<ref>Hudson, Rex A.

== Causes and motivations ==

===Choice of terrorism as a tactic===
Individuals and groups choose terrorism as a tactic because it can:
* Act as a form of [[asymmetric warfare]] in order to directly force a government to agree to demands
* Intimidate a group of people into capitulating to the demands in order to avoid future injury
* Get attention and thus political support for a cause
* Directly inspire more people to the cause (such as revolutionary acts) – [[propaganda of the deed]]
* Indirectly inspire more people to the cause by provoking a hostile response or over-reaction from enemies to the cause<ref name="Think">[https://think.kera.org/2016/04/05/the-meaning-behind-extremism/ The Psychology Of Terrorism], audio interview summarizing [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/special-report-the-psychology-of-terrorism/ Special Report: The Psychology of Terrorism]</ref>

Attacks on "collaborators" are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in [[Kenya]], in [[Algeria]] and in [[Cyprus]] during their independence struggles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtRBDwAAQBAJ&q=Attacks+on+'collaborators'+are+used+to+intimidate+people+from+cooperating+with+the+state+in+order+to+undermine+state+control.+This+strategy+was+used+in+Ireland,+in+Kenya,+in+Algeria+and+in+Cyprus+during+their+independence+struggles&pg=PT247|title=Handbook of Emergency Management Concepts: A Step-by-Step Approach|last=Madigan|first=Michael L.|date=December 6, 2017|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781351337472|language=en}}</ref>

Stated [[motives for the September 11 attacks]] included inspiring more fighters to join the cause of repelling the United States from Muslim countries with a successful high-profile attack. The attacks prompted some criticism from domestic and international observers regarding perceived injustices in U.S. foreign policy that provoked the attacks, but the larger practical effect was that the United States government declared a [[War on Terror]] that resulted in substantial military engagements in several Muslim-majority countries. Various commentators have inferred that [[al-Qaeda]] expected a military response, and welcomed it as a provocation that would result in more Muslims fight the United States. Some commentators believe that the resulting anger and suspicion directed toward innocent Muslims living in Western countries and the indignities inflicted upon them by security forces and the general public also contributes to radicalization of new recruits.<ref name="Think"/> Despite criticism that the Iraqi government had no involvement with the September 11 attacks, Bush declared the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to be part of the War on Terror. The resulting backlash and instability enabled the rise of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] and the temporary creation of an Islamic caliphate holding territory in Iraq and Syria, until ISIL lost its territory through military defeats.

Attacks used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported have included the [[Dawson's Field hijackings|Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970]] and the [[1975 Dutch train hostage crisis]].

===Causes motivating terrorism===
Specific political or social causes have included:
* Independence or [[separatist]] movements
* [[Irredentist]] movements
* Adoption of a particular political philosophy, such as [[socialism]] ([[left-wing terrorism]]), [[anarchism]], or [[fascism]] (possibly through a [[coup]] or as an ideology of an independence or separatist movement)
* Environmental protection ([[ecoterrorism]])
* [[Supremacism]] of a particular group
** Preventing a rival group from sharing or occupying a particular territory (such as by discouraging immigration or encouraging flight)
** Subjugation of a particular population (such as [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of African Americans]])
* Spread or dominance of a particular religion – [[religious terrorism]]
* Ending perceived government [[oppression]]
* Responding to a violent act (for example, tit-for-tat attacks in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], in [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, or [[Timothy McVeigh]]'s revenge for the [[Waco siege]] and [[Ruby Ridge]] incident)

Causes for [[right-wing terrorism]] have included [[white nationalism]], [[ethnonationalism]], fascism, anti-socialism, the [[anti-abortion movement]], and [[tax resistance]].

Sometimes terrorists on the same side fight for different reasons. For example, in the [[Chechen–Russian conflict]] secular Chechens using terrorist tactics fighting for national independence are allied with radical Islamist terrorists who have arrived from other countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Janeczko |first1=Matthew |title='Faced with death, even a mouse bites': Social and religious motivations behind terrorism in Chechnya |date=June 19, 2014 |pages=428–456 }}</ref>

===Personal and social factors===
{{main|Radicalization}}
Various personal and social factors may influence the personal choice of whether or not to join a terrorist group or attempt an act of terror, including:
* [[Identity (social science)|Identity]], including affiliation with a particular culture, ethnicity, or religion
* Previous exposure to violence
* Financial reward (for example, the [[Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund]])
* [[Mental health disorder]]
* Social isolation
* Perception that the cause responds to a profound injustice or indignity

* 43% were motivated by religious beliefs
* 32% had pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have mental health problems upon arrest
* At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases
* 40% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event
* 19% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others
* 14% percent experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault

Ariel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides' families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Merari |first1=Ariel |title="Psychological Aspects of Suicide Terrorism," in Bruce Bongar et al., Psychology of Terrorism. |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}</ref> In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes—such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations—or suicidal symptoms. By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Atran |first1=Scott |title=Mishandling Suicide Terrorism |journal=The Washington Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=67–90 |doi=10.1162/016366004323090269|s2cid=155714216 }}</ref>

While a democratic nation espousing [[civil liberties]] may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties.<ref name=tws11janetrr>{{cite news |first=Rick |last=Young |title=PBS Frontline: 'Spying on the Home Front' |quote=...&nbsp;we and Frontline felt that it was important to look more comprehensively at the post-9/11 shift to prevention and the dilemma we all now face in balancing security and privacy. |publisher=PBS: Frontline |date=May 16, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/05/03/DI2007050301142.html|access-date= January 11, 2010}}</ref> For this reason, [[homegrown terrorism]] has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden.<ref name="Hayden">{{cite news |first=Jordy |last=Yager |title=Former intel chief: Homegrown terrorism is a devil of a problem |newspaper=thehill.com |date=July 25, 2010 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/110759-former-intel-chief-homegrown-terrorism-is-a-devil-of-a-problem}}</ref> This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.<ref>shabad, goldie and francisco jose llera ramo.

According to the [[Global Terrorism Index]] by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[religious extremism]] has overtaken [[Separatism|national separatism]] and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Syria]] is the main driver behind these trends.<ref name=arnett>{{cite news |first=George |last=Arnett |title=Religious extremism main cause of terrorism, according to report |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 19, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/nov/18/religious-extremism-main-cause-of-terrorism-according-to-report|access-date= March 22, 2017}}</ref>

Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are [[Boko Haram]], [[Al Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].

The [[perpetrator]]s of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. The most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive [[Covert cell|cells]], highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London underground bombing]], [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] and the [[2002 Bali bombing]] were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient [[telecommunications]] to succeed where others had failed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sageman |first=Mark |title=Understanding Terror Networks |journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health |publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press |year=2004 |volume=7 |issue=1 |location=Philadelphia |pages=[https://archive.org/details/understandingter00sage/page/166 166–167] |pmid=15869076 |isbn=978-0-8122-3808-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/understandingter00sage/page/166 }}</ref>

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of [[Political Science]] Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]], the [[Allied of World War II|Allied]] [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], and the U.S. [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. He argues that "the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents." He cites the [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] option as an example of the "terror of coercive diplomacy" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using [[nuclear weapon]]s in "crisis management" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of [[foreign policy]] was shaped by the presence and use of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state.<ref name="tws11jangbhh">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Stohl |title=The Superpowers and International Terror |publisher=International Studies Association, Atlanta |date=April 1, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Stohl |title=Terrible beyond Endurance?

Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, usually using [[explosives]] or [[poison]].<ref>Suicide bombings are the most effective terrorist act in this regard. See the following works:

Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through [[organized crime]]. Communications occur through modern [[telecommunications]], or through old-fashioned methods such as [[courier]]s. There is concern about terrorist attacks employing [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Some academics have argued that while it is often assumed terrorism is intended to spread fear, this is not necessarily true, with fear instead being a by-product of the terrorist's actions, while their intentions may be to avenge fallen comrades or destroy their perceived enemies.<ref>Kurtulus, Ersun N. "Terrorism and fear: do terrorists really want to scare?." Critical Studies on Terrorism 10, no. 3 (2017): 501-522.</ref>

Terrorism is a form of [[asymmetric warfare]], and is more common when direct [[conventional warfare]] will not be effective because opposing forces vary greatly in power.<ref name=tws11jan1q21q>{{cite news |title=Hackers warn high street chains |quote=That's the beauty of asymmetric warfare. You don't need a lot of money, or an army of people. |work=BBC News |date=April 25, 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7366995.stm|access-date= January 11, 2010}}</ref> Yuval Harari argues that the peacefulness of modern states makes them paradoxically more vulnerable to terrorism than pre-modern states. Harari argues that because modern states have committed themselves to reducing political violence to almost zero, terrorists can, by creating political violence, threaten the very foundations of the legitimacy of the modern state. This is in contrast to pre-modern states, where violence was a routine and recognised aspect of politics at all levels, making political violence unremarkable. Terrorism thus shocks the population of a modern state far more than a pre-modern one and consequently the state is forced to overreact in an excessive, costly and spectacular manner, which is often what the terrorists desire.<ref>Harari, Yuval Noah. Homo Deus: A brief history of tomorrow. Random House, 2016, pp.103-106</ref>

The type of people terrorists will target is dependent upon the ideology of the terrorists. A terrorist's ideology will create a class of "legitimate targets" who are deemed as its enemies and who are permitted to be targeted. This ideology will also allow the terrorists to place the blame on the victim, who is viewed as being responsible for the violence in the first place.<ref>Drake, Charles JM. "The role of ideology in terrorists’ target selection." Terrorism and Political Violence 10, no. 2 (1998): 53-85.</ref><ref>Hoffman, Bruce. "The contrasting ethical foundations of terrorism in the 1980s." Terrorism and Political Violence 1, no. 3 (1989): 361-377, p.8</ref>

The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:
* [[Secession]] of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state
* Dominance of territory or resources by various [[ethnic groups]]
* Imposition of a particular form of government
* Economic deprivation of a population
* Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army
* Religious fanaticism

== Responses ==
[[File:1080 Poisoning Scare At New World in Wellington.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism]]
Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the [[political spectrum]] and reassessments of [[value system|fundamental values]].

Specific types of responses include:
* [[Anti-terrorism legislation|Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers]]
* [[Target hardening]], such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
* Preemptive or reactive military action
* Increased intelligence and surveillance activities
* Preemptive humanitarian activities
* More permissive interrogation and detention policies

The term "[[counter-terrorism]]" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors.

According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in [[The Washington Post]], "Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/ |title=A hidden world, growing beyond control |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 19, 2010 |first1=Dana |last1=Priest |first2=William |last2=Arkin}}</ref>

America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home.<ref name=ankony1>Ankony, Robert C., "A New Strategy for America's War on Terrorism", ''Patrolling'' magazine, 75th Ranger Regiment Association, Winter 2011, 56–57.</ref> In the introduction of the ''U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Sarah Sewall states the need for "U.S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants—and erode support of the host nation." Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: "Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction."<ref>Sewall, Sarah, introduction to ''The U.S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, (2007).</ref> This strategy, often termed "courageous restraint", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield. However, it does not address the fact that terrorists are mostly homegrown.<ref name=ankony1/>

=== Terrorism research ===
Terrorism research, called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], the [[Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies]], and the [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism]] (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tinnes |first1=J |year=2013 |title=100 Core and Periphery Journals for Terrorism Research |url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/258 |journal=Perspectives on Terrorism |volume=7 |issue=2}}</ref>

=== International agreements ===
One of the agreements that promote the international legal anti-terror framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018. The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counter terrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045. The Code was signed by more than 70 countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=70 countries sign Counter-Terrorism Code initiated by Kazakhstan |url=https://www.inform.kz/en/70-countries-sign-counter-terrorism-code-initiated-by-kazakhstan-says-president_a3450890 |website=inform.kz}}</ref>

== Mass media ==

[[File:Plakat La Terroriste.jpg|thumb|''La Terroriste'', a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]] throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car.|left]]
Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.<ref>The Media and Terrorism: A Reassessment [[Paul Wilkinson (professor)|Paul Wilkinson]]. ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Summer 1997), pp. 51–64 Published by Frank Cass, London.</ref>

The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://icct.nl/publication/responding-to-cyber-jihad-towards-an-effective-counter-narrative/ |title=Responding to Cyber Jihad: Towards an Effective Counter Narrative |date=March 31, 2015 |author=Dr. Bibi van Ginkel |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT) | access-date=September 7, 2016}}</ref> This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |access-date=June 17, 2009}}</ref>

The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. This may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely [[James F. Pastor]] explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other.<ref>{{cite book |title=Terrorism & Public Safety Policing: Implications of the Obama Presidency |author=Pastor, James F. |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4398-1580-9 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |location=New York}}</ref>

== Outcome of terrorist groups ==

[[File:RANDterroristGpsEnd2006.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|How terrorist groups end (n = 268): The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations (43 percent), with most of the rest terminated by routine policing (40 percent). Groups that were ended by military force constituted only 7 percent.<ref>The researchers found 648 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006.  Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006 (Jones and Libicki, 2008, p. 19)</ref>]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006. They found 648. Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006.<ref>Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 19)</ref> Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the [[Good Friday Agreement|Irish Republican Army]] in Northern Ireland. Law enforcement took out 40 percent. Ten percent won. Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were destroyed by military force.

Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006. Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors. Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement. Twenty-six percent won. Twenty-one percent succumbed to military force.<ref>Jones and Libicki (2008, p. 101, Table 5.4)</ref> Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists. To avoid that, the [[rules of engagement]] must be conscious of [[collateral damage]] and work to minimize it.

Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cronin |first1=Audrey Kurth |title=How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns |date=2009 |publisher=Princeton U. Press |isbn=978-0-691-13948-7}}</ref>
# Capture or killing of a group's leader. (Decapitation).
# Entry of the group into a legitimate political process. (Negotiation).
# Achievement of group aims. (Success).
# Group implosion or loss of public support. (Failure).
# Defeat and elimination through brute force. (Repression).
# Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence. (Reorientation).

== Databases ==
The following terrorism databases are or were made publicly available for research purposes, and track specific acts of terrorism:
* [[Global Terrorism Database]], an open-source database by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2017 with more than 150,000 cases.
* [[MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]]
* [[Worldwide Incidents Tracking System]]
* [[Tocsearch]] (dynamic database)
The following public report and index provides a summary of key global trends and patterns in terrorism around the world
* [[Global Terrorism Index]], produced annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]]
The following publicly available resources index electronic and bibliographic resources on the subject of terrorism
* [[Human Security Gateway]]

The following terrorism databases are maintained in secrecy by the United States Government for intelligence and counter-terrorism purposes:
* [[Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment]]
* [[Terrorist Screening Database]]

Jones and Libicki (2008) includes a table of 268 terrorist groups active between 1968 and 2006 with their status as of 2006: still active, splintered, converted to nonviolence, removed by law enforcement or military, or won. (These data are not in a convenient machine-readable format but are available.)
