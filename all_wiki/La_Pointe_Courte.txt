'''''La Pointe Courte''''' {{IPA-fr|la pwɛ̃t kuʁt|}} is a 1955 French [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Agnès Varda]]. This feature film was Varda's debut. It has been cited by many critics as a forerunner of the [[French New Wave]], with the historian [[Georges Sadoul]] calling it "truly the first film of the nouvelle vague".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/497-la-pointe-courte-how-agn-s-varda-invented-the-new-wave|title=La Pointe Courte: How Agnès Varda "Invented" the New Wave|last=Vincendeau|first=Ginette|website=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref> The film takes place in [[Sète]] in the south of France. The Pointe Courte ("short point") is a tiny quarter of the town known as the fisherman's village.

==Plot==
A young man ([[Philippe Noiret]]) arrives at a train station to see his wife. After four years of marriage, the couple is having problems of a somewhat existential nature—the wife loves her husband, but is thinking of leaving him (he had an affair some time back, but her problem is not jealousy so much as questioning the very nature of love). The couple discuss their lives and become resigned to the fact that they belong together, even if their love has changed. They return to Paris, the wife now better understanding her husband's nature because she's seen his hometown. As this drama unfolds, we see the lives of the poor but proud people living there: fishermen wanting to harvest shellfish from a small lagoon they have been forbidden to use because of an alleged problem with bacteria; a small child dies of an unknown illness; a young man wins the right to court the 16-year-old daughter of a neighbor after proving himself in a local aquatic jousting tournament.

==Production==
Varda originally visited La Pointe Courte to take pictures for a friend who could no longer visit her home. After seeing the footage she took there, she rented a camera to shoot a film about a couple from Paris who were visiting La Pointe Courte, the husband's home town. Varda set up her own co-op and began production. The budget for the film was $14,000; roughly one quarter the budget of other feature films of the era including ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' and ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]''. No members of the cast or crew were paid during the production.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of the French new wave cinema|last=Neupert, Richard John.|date=2007|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299217037|edition= 2nd|location=Madison, Wis.|pages=57|oclc=538539415}}</ref>

==Themes==
In a 1962 interview, Varda spoke of two present themes in the film with "the first being a couple reconsidering their relationship and a village that is trying to resolve several collective problems of survival".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A history of the French new wave cinema|last=Neupert, Richard John.|date=2007|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299217037|edition= 2nd|location=Madison, Wis.|pages=60|oclc=538539415}}</ref> In her movie ''[[The Beaches of Agnès|Les plages d'Agnès]]'' (''The Beaches of Agnès''), Varda says her film was inspired by [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem|The Wild Palms]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bampfa.org/event/la-pointe-courte-4|title=La Pointe Courte |website=BAMPFA|accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref>

==Release==
The film was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1955. Its premiere in Paris was in 1956 at the Studio Parnasse. It played with [[Jean Vigo]]'s documentary film ''[[À propos de Nice]]'' (1930).<ref name=":0" /> The [[Criterion Collection]] has released the film in a four-DVD [[DVD region code|Region 1]] box-set.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Andrew|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-criterion-collection-419-la-pointe-courte/|title=Agnès Varda's La Pointe Courte on Criterion|work=Slant|date=24 January 2008|accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref>
