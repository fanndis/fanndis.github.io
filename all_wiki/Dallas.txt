Dallas and nearby [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] were initially developed due to the construction of major railroad lines through the area allowing access to [[cotton]], [[cattle]] and later [[Petroleum|oil]] in [[North Texas|North]] and [[East Texas]]. The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] reinforced Dallas's prominence as a transportation hub, with four major interstate highways converging in the city and a fifth interstate loop around it. Dallas then developed as a strong industrial and financial center and a major [[inland port]], due to the convergence of major railroad lines, interstate highways and the construction of [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], one of the largest and [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|busiest airports]] in the world.<ref name="handbook_dallas">{{Handbook of Texas |id=hdd01 |name=DALLAS, TX |author=Jackie McElhaney and Michael V.

==History==
{{Main|History of Dallas}}
{{See also|Timeline of Dallas}}Preceded by thousands of years of varying [[cultures]], the [[Caddo]] [[Native Americans of the United States|people]] inhabited the Dallas area before Spanish colonists claimed the territory of Texas in the 18th century as a part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. Later, France also [[French colonial empires|claimed the area]] but never established much settlement. In all, six flags have flown over the area preceding and during the city's history: those of France, Spain, and Mexico, the flag of the Republic of Texas, the Confederate flag, and the flag of the United States of America.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alvarado|first=Catherine|title=A brief history of the six flags over Texas — including the Confederate flag|url=https://www.statesman.com/news/20161012/a-brief-history-of-the-six-flags-over-texas--including-the-confederate-flag|access-date=August 14, 2020|website=Austin American-Statesman|language=en}}</ref>

In 1819, the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] between the United States and Spain defined the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] as the northern boundary of New Spain, officially placing the future location of Dallas well within Spanish territory.<ref name="bolton">{{cite book |last = Bolton |first = Herbert E. |authorlink = Herbert Eugene Bolton |title = Athanase de Mezieres and the Louisiana-Texas Frontier 1768–1780 |url = https://archive.org/details/athanasedemzire01mzgoog |publisher=Arthur H Clark Company |year = 1914 |location = Cleveland}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2020}} The area remained under Spanish rule until 1821, when [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico declared independence from Spain]], and the area was considered part of the Mexican state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]].

With the construction of railroads, Dallas became a business and trading center and was booming by the end of the 19th century. It became an industrial city, attracting workers from [[Texas]], the South, and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The [[Praetorian Building]] in Dallas of 15 stories, built in 1909, was the first [[skyscraper]] west of [[Mississippi River|the Mississippi]] and the tallest building in Texas for some time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dallas' Tallest|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1996/october/dallas-tallest/|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=D Magazine|language=en}}</ref> It marked the prominence of Dallas as a city. A racetrack for [[thoroughbred]]s was built and their owners established the Dallas Jockey Club. Trotters raced at a track in Fort Worth, where a similar drivers club was based. The rapid expansion of population increased competition for jobs and housing.

=== Topography ===
{{Main|Geology of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex}}
[[File:Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden September 2017 04 (A Woman's Garden Pool).jpg|thumb|Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden]]Dallas and its surrounding area are mostly flat. The city lies at elevations ranging from {{convert|450|to|550|ft|m|0}} above sea level. The western edge of the Austin Chalk Formation, a [[limestone]] [[escarpment]] (also known as the "White Rock Escarpment"), rises {{convert|230|ft|m|0}} and runs roughly north–south through Dallas County. South of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], the uplift is particularly noticeable in the neighborhoods of Oak Cliff and the adjacent cities of Cockrell Hill, [[Cedar Hill, Texas|Cedar Hill]], [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]], and [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. Marked variations in terrain are also found in cities immediately to the west in [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]] surrounding Fort Worth, as well as along Turtle Creek north of Downtown.

Dallas, like many other cities, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a "white rock crossing" of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The Trinity River, though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] parallels its path through Dallas along the [[Stemmons Corridor]], then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past South Dallas and Pleasant Grove, where the river is paralleled by [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|Interstate 45]] until it exits the city and heads southeast towards [[Houston]]. The river is flanked on both sides by {{convert|50|ft|m|0}} tall earthen [[levee]]s to protect the city from frequent floods.<ref>{{cite web|author=John N.

Since it was rerouted in the late 1920s, the river has been little more than a drainage ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below Downtown, with a more normal course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the [[Trinity River Project]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Discover The Trinity-Dallas |work=Discover The Trinity |publisher=Discoverthetrinity.org |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |url=http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925092304/http://www.discoverthetrinity.org/ |archive-date=September 25, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> which was begun in the early 2000s.

[[White Rock Lake]], a reservoir built at the beginning of the 20th century, is Dallas's other significant water feature. The lake and surrounding park is a popular destination for boaters, rowers, joggers, and bikers, as well as visitors seeking peaceful respite from the city at the {{convert|66|acre|m2|-3|adj=on}} [[Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden]], on the lake's eastern shore. [[White Rock Creek]] feeds into White Rock Lake, and then exits on to the Trinity River southeast of Downtown Dallas. Trails along White Rock Creek are part of the extensive Dallas County Trails System.

[[Bachman Lake]], just northwest of [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field Airport]], is a smaller lake also popularly used for recreation. Northeast of the city is [[Lake Ray Hubbard]], a vast {{convert|22745|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} reservoir in an extension of Dallas surrounded by the suburbs of [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]], [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]], and [[Sunnyvale, Texas|Sunnyvale]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bobby Farquhar and Mark McDonald |title = Lake Ray Hubbard |url = http://www.rtis.com/reg/lakes/rayhubba.htm |work=Set the Hook Guide to Lone Star Lakes and Lunkers |accessdate =August 5, 2009}}</ref> To the west of the city is [[Mountain Creek Lake]], once home to the [[Naval Air Station Dallas]] ([[Hensley Field]]) and a number of defense aircraft manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |title = NAS Dallas / Hensley Field |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/dallas.htm |accessdate =August 5, 2009 |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref> [[North Lake (Dallas County, Texas)|North Lake]], a small body of water in an extension of the city limits surrounded by Irving and [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], initially served as a water source for a nearby power plant but is now being targeted for redevelopment as a recreational lake due to its proximity to [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], a plan the lake's neighboring cities oppose.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Aasen |first=Eric |date=May 18, 2005 |title=Foes say North Lake development a threat to lifestyle |newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |place=Coppell }}</ref>

The weather in Dallas is also generally pleasant from late September to early December and on many winter days. Autumn often brings more storms and tornado threats, but they are usually fewer and less severe than in spring.

Each spring, cold fronts moving south from the North collide with warm, humid air streaming in from the [[Gulf Coast]], leading to severe [[thunderstorm]]s with [[lightning]], torrents of rain, [[hail]], and occasionally, [[tornado]]es. Over time, tornadoes have probably been the most significant natural threat to the city, as it is near the heart of [[Tornado Alley]].

A few times each winter in Dallas, warm and humid air from the south will override cold, dry air, resulting in [[freezing rain]] or ice and causing disruptions in the city if the roads and highways become slick.

In its beginnings, Dallas relied on farming, neighboring [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]'s [[Fort Worth Stockyards|Stockyards]], and its prime location on Native American trade routes to sustain itself. Dallas' key to growth came in 1873 with the construction of multiple [[Rail road|rail]] lines through the city. As Dallas grew and technology developed, cotton became its boon and by 1900, Dallas was the largest inland cotton market in the world, becoming a leader in [[cotton gin]] machinery manufacturing.

By the early 1900s, Dallas was a hub for economic activity all over the Southern United States and was selected in 1914 as the seat of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Eleventh Federal Reserve District]]. By 1925, Texas churned out more than ⅓ of the nation's cotton crop, with 31% of Texas cotton produced within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} [[radius]] of Dallas. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered east of Dallas, near [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]]. Dallas' proximity to the discovery put it immediately at the center of the nation's petroleum market. Petroleum discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], and [[Oklahoma]] in the following years further solidified Dallas' position as the hub of the market.<ref name="paynechapV">{{cite book|last=Payne |first=Darwin |title= Dallas, an illustrated history |year=1982 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=Woodland Hills, California |isbn= 0-89781-034-1 |pages=189–221 |chapter= Chapter VII: The Emergence of "Big D"}}</ref>

The end of [[World War II]] left Dallas seeded with a nexus of communications, engineering, and production talent by companies such as Collins Radio Corporation. Decades later, the telecommunications and information revolutions still drive a large portion of the local economy. The city is sometimes referred to as the heart of "[[Silicon Prairie]]" because of a high concentration of telecommunications companies in the region, the epicenter of which lies along the [[Telecom Corridor]] in [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], a northern suburb of Dallas. The Corridor is home to more than 5,700 companies including [[Texas Instruments]] (headquartered in Dallas), [[Nortel Networks]], [[Alcatel Lucent]], [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]], [[Ericsson]], [[Fujitsu]], [[Nokia]], [[Rockwell Collins]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[Verizon Communications]], [[XO Communications]] and [[CompUSA]] (which is now headquartered in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]).<ref>[http://www.telecomcorridor.com/ Telecom Corridor website].

In the 1980s Dallas was a real estate hotbed, with the increasing metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of [[Downtown Dallas]]' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and an oil bust brought the 1980s building boom to an end for Dallas as well as its sister city Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in Downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses, as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of [[Klyde Warren Park]], built across [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District, so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.

The residential real estate market in the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]] has not only been resilient but has once again returned to a boom status. Dallas and the greater metro area have been leading the nation in apartment construction and net leasing, with rents reaching all-time highs. Single family home sales, whether pre-owned or new construction, along with home price appreciation, were leading the nation since 2015.<ref name="Economic Snapshot">{{cite news|title=DFW Apartment Boom Hits Region|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2015/07/01/dfw-apartment-boom-hits-region-with-all-time.html|newspaper=Dallas Business Journal|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Dallas Residential Real Estate">{{cite news | title = Dallas Area Home Price Growth Dwarfs National Gains | url = https://www.dallasnews.com/business/residential-real-estate/20150630-dallas-area-home-price-growth-dwarfs-national-gains.ece | first = Steve | last = Brown | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = June 30, 2015 | access-date = June 30, 2015}}</ref>

A sudden drop in the price of oil, starting in mid-2014 and accelerating throughout 2015, has not significantly affected Dallas and its greater metro area due to the highly diversified nature of its economy. Dallas, and the DFW metro, continue to see strong demand for housing, apartment and office leasing, shopping center space, warehouse and industrial space with overall job growth remaining very robust. Oil-dependent cities and regions have felt significant effects from the downturn, but Dallas's growth has continued unabated, strengthening in 2015. Significant national headquarters relocations to the area (as exemplified by Toyota's decision to leave [[California]] and establish its new North American headquarters in the Dallas area) coupled with significant expansions of regional offices for a variety of corporations and along with company relocations to Downtown Dallas helped drive the boom in the Dallas economy. Dallas led Texas's largest cities in ''Forbes'' magazine's 2015 ranking of "The Best Place for Business and Careers".<ref name="Business">{{cite news|title=Forbes Reveals Best Places in America for Business and Careers|url=http://www.chron.com/business/article/Forbes-reveals-the-best-places-in-America-for-6415930.php#photo-2194273|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>

== Transportation ==
{{Main|Transportation in Dallas}}

Like many other major cities in the United States, the automobile is the primary mode of local transportation, though efforts have been made to increase the availability of alternative modes of transportation, including the construction of light rail lines, biking and walking paths, wide sidewalks, a trolley system, and buses. [[Walk Score]] ranked Dallas the twenty-third most walkable of fifty largest cities in the United States in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

In 2009, 78.5% of Dallas (city) commuters drive to work alone. The 2009 [[modal share|mode share]] for Dallas (city) commuters are 10.7% for carpooling, 3.9% for transit, 1.9% for walking, and .1% for cycling.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yonah Freemark|url=https://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2010/10/13/transit-mode-share-trends-looking-steady-rail-appears-to-encourage-non-automobile-commutes/|access-date=October 31, 2017|date= October 13, 2010|title=Transit Mode Share Trends Looking Steady; Rail Appears to Encourage Non-Automobile Commutes|website=Transport Politic}}</ref> In 2015, the American Community Survey estimated modal shares for Dallas (city) commuters of 75.4% for driving alone, 12.8% for carpooling, 3.5% for riding transit, 1.9% for walking, and .2% for cycling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|series=American Fact Finder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=October 31, 2017|title=2015 American Community Survey, 1-year estimates: Commuting Characteristics by Sex}}</ref> The city of Dallas has a higher than average percentage of households without a car.

===Highways===

[[File:High Five.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=High Five Interchange in Dallas|The [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] and I-635 interchange, commonly known as the [[High Five Interchange]]]]

Dallas is at the confluence of four major [[interstate highway system|interstate highways]]—Interstates [[Interstate 20 (Texas)|20]], [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|30]], [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|35E]], and [[Interstate 45 (Texas)|45]]. The Dallas area freeway system is set up in the popular [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] system, shaped much like a wagon wheel. Starting from the center of the city, a small freeway loop surrounds Downtown, followed by the [[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]] loop about {{convert|10|mi|0}} outside Downtown, and ultimately the tolled [[President George Bush Turnpike]]. Inside these freeway loops are other [[boulevard]]- and [[parkway]]-style loops, including [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Loop 12]] and [[Belt Line Road (Texas)|Belt Line Road]]. Another beltway around the city upwards of {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} from Downtown is under plan in Collin County.

Radiating out of Downtown Dallas's freeway loop are the spokes of the area's highway system—Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, [[U.S. Highway 75 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 75]], [[U.S. Highway 175 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 175]], [[Texas State Highway Spur 366|State Spur 366]], the [[Dallas North Tollway]], [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Texas|U.S. Highway 80]], and [[U.S. Highway 67 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 67]]. Other major highways around the city include [[Texas State Highway 183|State Highway 183]] and [[Texas State Highway Spur 408|State Spur 408]].

The recently completed interchange at the intersection of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ([[Interstate 635 (Texas)|Interstate 635]]) and [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]] (U.S. Highway 75) has five stacks and is aptly called the [[High Five Interchange]]. It is one of the few five-level interchanges in Dallas and is one of the largest freeway interchanges in the United States.

The following is a list of the freeways and tollways in the Dallas and Fort Worth area:

===Airports===
[[File:DFWAirportOverview.jpg|thumb|In 2015, the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|DFW International Airport]] was the 10th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.]]
Two commercial airports serve Dallas: [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] and [[Dallas Love Field]]. In addition, [[Dallas Executive Airport]] (formerly Redbird Airport), serves as a [[general aviation]] airport for the city, and [[Addison Airport]] functions similarly just outside the city limits in the suburb of Addison. Two more general aviation airports are about {{convert|35|mi|0}} north of Dallas in [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], and another two are in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], on the west side of the Metroplex. [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport|Alliance Airport]], in far North Fort Worth, is a cargo reliever airport to DFW and general aviation facility.

DFW International Airport is in the suburbs slightly north of and equidistant to Downtown Fort Worth and Downtown Dallas. In terms of size, DFW International is the largest airport in the state, the 2nd largest in the United States, and 9th largest in the world; DFW International Airport is larger than the island of [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=DIA is the second biggest airport in the world, and that means it's bigger than Manhattan|url=https://www.9news.com/article/travel/denver-international-airport/how-big-is-dia-denver-airport/73-01b2cee0-03c4-4317-9e55-dd0537cf2239|access-date=June 29, 2020|website=KUSA.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

In terms of traffic, DFW International is the busiest airport in the state, 4th busiest in the United States, and 11th busiest in the world. The headquarters of [[American Airlines]], the largest air carrier in the world ahead of [[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]], is less than a mile from DFW International within Fort Worth's city limits. Similarly, Love Field is within Dallas's city limits, about {{convert|6|mi|0}} northwest of Downtown, and is headquarters to [[Southwest Airlines]], the largest domestic airline in the United States.

===Transit systems===
[[File:Mockingbird Station 3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An escalator descends from the street to an island platform station with a white and yellow train present along a landscaped track.|A northbound train at [[SMU/Mockingbird station]]]]
[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) is the Dallas-area public transportation authority that provides rail, buses and [[HOV]] lanes to commuters. DART began operating the first [[light rail]] system in Texas in 1996, and it is now the largest operator of light rail in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |title=DART becomes nation's largest light rail system today &#124; Irving Blog |publisher=Irvingblog.dallasnews.com |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323110609/http://irvingblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2010/12/dart-becomes-nations-largest-l.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Today, the system is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|seventh-busiest]] light rail system in the country with approximately 55 stations on 72 miles of light rail, and 10 stations on 35 miles of commuter rail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dart.org/about/expansion/otherprojects.asp|title=DART.org – Expansion Information|website=dart.org|accessdate=August 27, 2017}}</ref> It includes four light rail lines and a commuter line: the {{DART R}}, the {{DART B}}, the {{DART G}}, the {{DART O}}, and the {{DART TRE}}.

The {{DART R}} travels through [[Oak Cliff]], [[South Dallas]], [[downtown Dallas|Downtown]], [[Uptown Dallas|Uptown]], [[North Dallas]], [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]] and [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], while the {{DART B}} goes through Oak Cliff, Downtown, Uptown, [[East Dallas]], [[Lake Highlands]], and [[Garland, Texas|Garland]]. The {{DART R|style=nl}} and {{DART B|style=nl}} lines are conjoined between [[8th & Corinth Station]] in Oak Cliff through [[Mockingbird Station]] in [[North Dallas]]. The two lines service [[Cityplace Station]]. The Green Line serves [[Carrollton, Texas|Carrollton]], [[Farmers Branch, Texas|Farmers Branch]], [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field Airport]], [[Stemmons Corridor, Dallas, Texas|Stemmons Corridor]], [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]], Downtown, [[Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas|Deep Ellum]], [[Fair Park]], South Dallas, and [[Pleasant Grove, Dallas|Pleasant Grove]].

The Orange Line initially operated as a peak-service line providing extra capacity on portions of the Green and Red Lines ([[Bachman Station]] on the Green Line, through the Downtown transit mall, to [[Parker Road Station]] on the Red Line making a "U"-shape). However, the first stage of the Orange Line opened on December 6, 2010, extending its west end from Bachman to [[Belt Line Station]] in Irving. The second and final phase opened in August 2014 and provided [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]] with rail service. [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Station|DFW Airport Station]] is the terminus for the Orange Line and connects [[DFW Skylink|Skylink]].<ref name="dart.org">{{cite web|url=http://dart.org/about/expansion/orangeline.asp |title=Orange Line Expansion Information |publisher=DART.org |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref> This provides passengers the convenience of disembarking the DART rail, proceeding to security check-in and immediately boarding [[DFW Skylink|Skylink]] to be quickly transported to their desired terminal. The Blue Line has also been extended by 4.5 miles to serve [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]] at the [[Rowlett Park & Ride]] facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dart.org/about/expansion/blueline.asp |title=Blue Line Expansion Information |publisher=DART.org |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

In August 2009, the Regional Transportation Council agreed to seek $96&nbsp;million in federal stimulus dollars for a trolley project in Dallas and Fort Worth. The Oak Cliff Transit Authority took the lead with leaders envisioning a streetcar line that would link [[Dallas Union Station|Union Station]] and the [[Dallas Convention Center]] in Downtown to Oak Cliff, Methodist Medical Center, and the [[Bishop Arts District]] via the Houston Street Viaduct.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://oakcliffblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/08/proposed-streetcar-route-for-o.html | title = Proposed streetcar route for Oak Cliff scaled back | first = Roy | last = Appleton | date = August 17, 2009 | newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | via = oakcliffblog.dallasnews.com | access-date = September 27, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110114202204/http://oakcliffblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/08/proposed-streetcar-route-for-o.html | archive-date = January 14, 2011}}</ref> Dallas was awarded a $23&nbsp;million TIGER grant towards the $58&nbsp;million Dallas Streetcar Project in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilonsky |first=Robert |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2010/02/owntown_dallas_streetcar_proje.php |title=Downtown Dallas Streetcar Project Takes the TIGER By the Tail to Tune of $23 Million – Dallas – News – Unfair Park |publisher=Blogs.dallasobserver.com |date=February 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref>

In addition to light rail, [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' also serves Union Station, providing daily service east to [[Chicago]] and west to [[San Antonio station (Texas)|San Antonio]], and thrice-weekly service west to [[Los Angeles]]. The Trinity Rail Express terminates at Union Station and [[T&P Station]].
