The '''Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies''' ('''RUSI'''), sometimes still referred to by its pre-2004 name, the '''Royal United Service Institution''', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] defence and security [[think tank]]. It was founded in 1831 by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington, Sir Arthur Wellesley]].<ref name = "Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details)_2018">{{ cite web | title = Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details) | url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=174682 | publisher = The British Museum, UK | language = en | accessdate = 2018-07-23 }}</ref>

The current President of RUSI is the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] and its Director is [[Karin von Hippel]].

== History ==
RUSI was founded in 1831&nbsp;– making it the oldest defence and security think tank in the world&nbsp;– at the initiative of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Its original mission was to study naval and military science.

The Duke of Wellington spearheaded the establishment of RUSI in a letter to ''Colbourn's United Service Journal'' arguing that "a United Service Museum" should be formed, managed entirely by naval and military officers, and under patronage of the monarch, then [[King George IV]], and the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces. Such an institution would prove that the two professions have entered the lists of science, and are ready to contend for honours ''tam Artibus quam Armis'' – 'as much through the arts as through weapons'.<ref name = "Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details)_2018" />

Subsequently, Commander Henry Downes, Royal Navy, assembled a group with a view to forming a committee for action, to which King George's First ADC was commanded to convey "His Majesty's gracious and high approbation of the undertaking and of the principles on which it is proposed to conduct it", which were stated to be suitable for "a strictly scientific and professional society, and not a club". The death of the King delayed matters, but the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] expressed his readiness to become a patron so, encouraged by the powerful support of the Duke of Wellington, the First [[Aide-de-camp]], [[Herbert Taylor (Major General)|Sir Herbert Taylor]], re-submitted the project to [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (the former Duke of Clarence), and was able to assure the committee that "it could proceed under his Majesty's gracious auspices".

On 25 June 1831 the committee met. The chair was taken by [[Howard Douglas|Major General Sir Howard Douglas]], in his person a symbol of the "United Service": a soldier who was the leading expert on naval gunnery. The resolution that the institution be established was put by the future Field Marshal [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Viscount Hardinge]] and seconded by the future [[Francis Beaufort|Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort]], the famous hydrographer. The first name adopted was the '''Naval and Military Museum''': this was altered in 1839 to the '''United Service Institution''', and in 1860 to the '''Royal United Service Institution''' by a [[royal charter|royal charter of incorporation]]. In 2004 the name was changed to the '''Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies'''. Fellows of RUSI may use the five-letter post-nominal abbreviation, '''FRUSI'''.

===Premises===
Prior to moving into its current purpose-built headquarters in 1895, RUSI began its existence in Whitehall Court, then moved to a house in what was then known as Middle [[Great Scotland Yard (street)|Scotland Yard]] in 1832. Queen Victoria granted RUSI the use of the [[Banqueting House]]. It finally moved to its current location next door to the Banqueting House in 1895.<ref name = "Royal United Services Institute (Biographical details)_2018" />

== Activities ==
RUSI is a British institution; however, it operates with an international perspective. It promotes the study and discussion of developments in military doctrine, defence management and defence procurement. In recent years RUSI has broadened its remit to include all issues of defence and security, including financial and organised crime, terrorism and the ideologies which foster it and the challenges from other man-made or man-assisted threats and from natural disasters.
