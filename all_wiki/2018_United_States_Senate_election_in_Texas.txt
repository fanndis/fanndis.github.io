==Background==
{{Main|Politics of Texas}}
In 2012, after a stunning upset victory in the Republican primary, then-Solicitor General of Texas [[Ted Cruz]] defeated former member of the Texas House of Representatives [[Paul Sadler]] by a 16-point margin (56%–40%). Texas has not elected a Democratic senator since 1988. As conservatives began turning to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in once strongly Democratic areas, Democratic voters became concentrated in Southern Texas (which hold [[majority minority]] counties) and large metropolitan cities, such as [[Houston]], [[Austin]], [[San Antonio]], and [[Dallas]], as well as the far western majority-minority city of [[El Paso]], which O'Rourke represented in the U.S. House.

Since 1990, Texas has voted for Republican statewide candidates in all elections, whether it be presidential, gubernatorial, or senatorial, often by large margins. In 1998, Governor [[George W. Bush]] won re-election by 37 points over his Democratic challenger, [[Garry Mauro]]. In 2000, Governor Bush won Texas by 21 points over Vice President [[Al Gore]]. In 2004, President Bush won Texas over Senator [[John Kerry]] by 23 points, winning rural areas by landslide margins and capturing urban zones. Democrat [[Barack Obama]] was defeated by margins of 12 points in 2008, against [[John McCain]], and 16 points in 2012, against [[Mitt Romney]], respectively. However, in 2016, [[Donald Trump]] defeated Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]] by only a 9-point margin, demonstrating a possible shift away from the Safe Republican status it had held for over a decade. This has led Democrats to begin targeting Texas as a potential future swing state. It should also be noted that Ted Cruz defeated Donald Trump in the Texas Republican primary for U.S. President in 2016.

As of June 2018, Senator Cruz held a 49%–44% approval rating among Texans in a state Donald Trump won by 9 points against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Among groups that tend to affiliate themselves more with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Senator Cruz held a 29% approval rating among Hispanics, 37% among females, and 42% among college-educated voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://morningconsult.com/2018/04/12/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators/|title=America's Most and Least Popular Senators|work=[[Morning Consult]]|last=Easley|first=Cameron|date=April 12, 2018|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>

== Results ==
On November 6, 2018, Ted Cruz defeated Beto O'Rourke. However, O'Rourke gave Democrats their best performance in a Texas statewide election since [[Ann Richards]] was elected governor in [[1990 Texas gubernatorial election|1990]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ted-cruz-thwarts-challenge-democratic-insurgent-beto-orourke/story?id=58854838|title=Ted Cruz thwarts challenge from Democratic insurgent Beto O'Rourke in tight Senate race, ABC News projects|work=ABC News|date=November 7, 2018|access-date=November 7, 2018}}</ref> In addition, O'Rourke flipped several counties in Texas that Donald Trump carried in 2016, including [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson]] (includes [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]] and [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]]), historically conservative [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] (includes [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] and suburbs within the [[DFW metroplex]]), [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson]] (includes [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]] and [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]]), [[Nueces County, Texas|Nueces]] (includes [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]), sparsely populated [[Brewster County, Texas|Brewster]] (includes [[Big Bend National Park]]), and [[Hays County, Texas|Hays]] (includes [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]]). Cruz only flipped one county that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, sparsely populated [[Kenedy County, Texas|Kenedy]] (coastal region south of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]).
