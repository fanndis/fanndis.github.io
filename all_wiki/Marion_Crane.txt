==Fictional character biography==
In the film Marion lives in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] as a secretary and is unhappy in her relationship with Sam Loomis ([[John Gavin]]), a [[divorcé]] who is in too much debt to marry her. Marion rejects his idea to take the afternoon off and rushes back to her storefront real estate office. Her boss of ten years, George Lowery ([[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]]), arrives shortly afterward with Tom Cassidy ([[Frank Albertson]]), a wealthy customer who is buying the Harris Street Property, one of Lowery's houses on the market for $40,000 as a wedding present for his daughter, making cash payment in full, which causes mild alarm to Lowery. However, instead of depositing Cassidy's money in the bank, Marion, wanting to pay Sam's debts in order to marry him, impulsively goes on the run with the money. She drives to the (fictional) small town of Fairvale, California, where Sam lives, and pays California Charlie ([[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]]), a used car salesman, to trade her car for a new one after a highway patrol officer ([[Mort Mills]]) checks her license plate. She turns off the main road without realizing it, and arrives at the Bates Motel. She checks in with the proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who shyly invites her to have dinner with him. After wrapping the remaining money inside a newspaper, Marion overhears a heated argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about letting Marion into the house.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Haggstrom|first1=Jason|title=Marion, Norman, and the Collision of Narratives in Psycho|url=http://reel3.com/marion-norman-and-the-collision-of-narratives-in-psycho/|website=Reel 3|publisher=reel3.com|accessdate=15 January 2016|date=June 16, 2010}}</ref>

During dinner, Marion has a conversation with Norman, who says that he is trapped by his obligation to his [[mental illness|mentally ill]] mother. She realizes that she, too, is stuck in a "private trap", and can only escape it by taking responsibility for stealing the money. She gently suggests to Norman that he put his mother in a [[mental hospital]], which he heatedly refuses to do. She bids him goodnight, and returns to her room. There, she undresses while Norman watches through a peephole hidden in the wall of his office. Resolving to make amends to her employer, Marion makes a few calculations based on how much the escapade has cost her. She then takes a shower. Suddenly, a mysterious figure enters the bathroom — shadowy through the shower curtain — and stabs Marion to death. Believing his mother has committed the murder, Norman puts the naked corpse and shower curtain — and, unknowingly, the money — in the trunk of Marion's car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.

The climax of the novel and film reveals that Norman murdered Marion while under the control of an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]]—one taking the form of his mother, whom he had murdered ten years before. The psychiatrist who examines Norman explains that, when Norman felt attracted to Marion, the "Mother" personality became jealous and killed her. In the final scene, Norman — now completely controlled by the "Mother" personality — is institutionalized for killing Marion.

===Differences between the film and novel===
In the novel, she is named '''Mary Crane''', originates from [[Dallas, Texas]], and dies after Norman decapitates her; in the film, "Mother" stabs her repeatedly. Her name was changed to '''Marion''' in the film because of a then real life Mary Crane residing in Phoenix, Arizona. In the novel, she is Norman's first victim; in the film, Norman had murdered two young girls prior.

==Appearances and references in the rest of the series==
''Psycho'''s first sequel, 1983's ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', starts off with a flashback to the shower scene. Marion's sister, [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]), now Lila Loomis, is on a crusade to keep Norman locked up. The film introduces Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), Lila's daughter with Sam and Marion's niece. Both are killed in the film; Lila is stabbed by a woman who looks like him in his "Mother" guise (later revealed to be [[Emma Spool]], portrayed by [[Claudia Bryar]]), and Mary is shot by police when she attempts to kill Norman.

In the second sequel, 1986's ''[[Psycho III]]'', the shower scene appears again in a flashback, this time when Norman sees Maureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]) who reminds him of Marion. "Mother" tries to kill Maureen in exactly the same room and bathroom of the Bates Motel where Marion died, only to find that Maureen slit her wrists in a bathtub filled with water in an attempted suicide. Later, after being rescued by Norman, "Mother" kills Maureen by pushing her down the same stairs of the Bates house where private investigator Milton Arbogast died.

Marion makes no appearance in the final sequel, 1990's ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. She is merely referred to a few times as "the girl [Norman] killed in the shower".

==Comic books==
Marion appears in the 1992 three-issue [[comic book]] adaptation of the 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', released by [[Innovation Publishing]].
