{{Christian denominations in the English-speaking world}}
The '''Southern Baptist Convention''' ('''SBC''') is a [[Christian denomination]] based in the [[United States]]. It is the world's largest [[Baptists|Baptist]] denomination, the [[Protestantism in the United States|largest]] [[Protestant]]<ref name=":0" />{{Sfn| Johnson | 2010 | p=349}} and the [[Christianity in the United States|second-largest]] Christian denomination in the United States, smaller only than the [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic Church]] according to self-reported membership statistics.

The word ''Southern'' in Southern Baptist Convention stems from it having been organized in 1845 at [[Augusta, Georgia]], by Baptists in the [[Southern United States]] who split with [[American Baptist Churches USA|northern Baptists]] over the issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], with Southern Baptists strongly opposed to [[abolitionism in the United States|its abolition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Racism-and-the-Legacy-of-Slavery-Report-v4.pdf#page=6|title=Report on Slavery and Racism in the History of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|publisher=Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|date=December 2018|accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref> After the [[American Civil War]], another split occurred when most [[freedmen]] set up independent [[Black church|black congregations]], regional associations, and state and national conventions, such as the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]], which became the second-largest Baptist convention by the end of the 19th century.

Since the 1940s, the Southern Baptist Convention has shifted from some of its regional and historical identification.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Encyclopedia | url = http://encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-SouthernBaptistConvention.html | contribution = Southern Baptist Convention | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions}}.</ref> Especially since the late 20th century, the SBC has sought new members among minority groups and to become much more diverse.

==History==
{{Further |Baptists in the United States}}

===Colonial era===
[[File:First Baptist 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[First Baptist Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|First Baptist Church]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]]]
Most early Baptists in the British colonies came from England in the 17th century, after the established [[Church of England]] persecuted them for their dissenting religious views.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Origins of the Particular Baptists|url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/origins-of-the-particular-baptists/|access-date=2020-07-21|website=The Gospel Coalition|language=en-US}}</ref> The oldest Baptist church in the South, [[First Baptist Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|First Baptist Church]] of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], was organized in 1682 under the leadership of [[William Screven]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Baptist Pioneers in America | publisher = Mainstream Baptists | url = http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mbn/pioneers.htm | accessdate = 3 Feb 2013}}.</ref> A Baptist church was formed in [[Virginia]] in 1715 through the preaching of [[Robert Norden]] and another in [[North Carolina]] in 1727 through the ministry of [[Paul Palmer (minister)|Paul Palmer]].

The Baptists adhered to a [[congregationalist polity]] and operated independently of the state-established [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches in the South, at a time when non-Anglicans were prohibited from holding political office. By 1740, about eight Baptist churches existed in the colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, with an estimated 300 to 400 members.<ref name="Southern Baptist Beginnings">{{cite web|url= http://www.baptisthistory.org/sbaptistbeginnings.htm|title= Southern Baptist Beginnings|first= Robert A|last= Baker|publisher= Baptist History & Heritage Society|year= 1979|accessdate= 2012-10-28|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121018074627/http://www.baptisthistory.org/sbaptistbeginnings.htm|archivedate= October 18, 2012|df= mdy-all}}</ref> New members, both black and white, were converted chiefly by Baptist preachers who traveled throughout the South during the 18th and 19th centuries, in the eras of the [[First Great Awakening]] and [[Second Great Awakening]].{{sfn|Taylor|1859|pp=57, 60, 71, 83}}

Baptists welcomed African Americans, both slave and free, allowing them to have more active roles in ministry than did other denominations by licensing them as preachers, and in some cases, allowing them to be treated as equals to white members.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Church in the Southern Black Community: Introduction|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/church/intro.html|access-date=2020-07-21|website=docsouth.unc.edu}}</ref> As a result, black congregations and churches were founded in Virginia, South Carolina, and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] before the [[American Revolution]]. Some black congregations kept their independence even after whites tried to exercise more authority after the [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion of 1831.{{Sfn | Raboteau | 2004 |p=178-79}}

===American Revolution period===
Before the Revolution, Baptist and [[Methodist]] evangelicals in the South had promoted the view of the common man's equality before God, which embraced slaves and free blacks. They challenged the hierarchies of class and race and urged planters to abolish slavery. They welcomed slaves as Baptists and accepted them as preachers.{{sfn|Miller|Smith|1997}}

Isaac (1974) analyzes the rise of the Baptist Church in Virginia, with emphasis on evangelicalism and social life. A sharp division existed between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists, attracted initially from yeomen and common planters, and the opulence of the Anglican planters, the slaveholding elite who controlled local and colonial government in what had become a slave society by the late 18th century.{{sfn|Kolchin|1993}} The gentry interpreted Baptist church discipline as political radicalism, but it served to ameliorate disorder. The Baptists intensely monitored each other's moral conduct, watching especially for sexual transgressions, cursing, and excessive drinking; they expelled members who would not reform.{{sfn|Isaac|1974}}

In Virginia and in most southern colonies before the Revolution, the [[Church of England]] was the [[established church]] and supported by general taxes, as it was in England. It opposed the rapid spread of Baptists in the South. Particularly in Virginia, many Baptist preachers were prosecuted for "disturbing the peace" by preaching without licenses from the Anglican church. Both [[Patrick Henry]] and the young attorney [[James Madison]] defended Baptist preachers prior to the American Revolution in cases considered significant to the history of religious freedom.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ketcham | first = Ralph L | title = James Madison: A Biography | place = Charlottesville, VA | publisher = University of Virginia Press | origyear = 1971 | format = paperback | year = 1990 | page = [https://archive.org/details/jamesmadisonbiog00ketc/page/57 57] | isbn = 978-0-8139-1265-3 | url = https://archive.org/details/jamesmadisonbiog00ketc/page/57 }}.</ref> In 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], enacted in 1786 by the Virginia General Assembly. Madison later applied his own ideas and those of the Virginia document related to religious freedom during the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], when he ensured that they were incorporated into the [[United States Constitution|national constitution]].

The struggle for religious toleration erupted and was played out during the American Revolution, as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican church in the South. Beeman (1978) explores the conflict in one Virginia locality, showing that as its population became more dense, the county court and the Anglican Church were able to increase their authority. The Baptists protested vigorously; the resulting social disorder resulted chiefly from the ruling gentry's disregard for public need. The vitality of the religious opposition made the conflict between 'evangelical' and 'gentry' styles a bitter one.{{sfn|Beeman|1978}} Kroll-Smith (1984) suggests that the strength of the evangelical movement's organization determined its ability to mobilize power outside the conventional authority structure.{{sfn|Kroll-Smith|1984}}

===National unification and regional division===
{{Main |Triennial Convention}}
In 1814, leaders such as [[Luther Rice]] were able to help Baptists unify nationally under what became known informally as the [[Triennial Convention]] (because it met every three years) based in [[Philadelphia]]. It allowed them to join their resources to support [[mission (Christian)|missions]] abroad. The [[American Baptist Home Mission Society|Home Mission Society]], affiliated with the Triennial Convention, was established in 1832 to support missions in frontier territories of the United States. By the mid-19th century, numerous social, cultural, economic, and political differences existed among business owners of the North, farmers of the West, and [[Planter (American South)|planters]] of the South. The most divisive conflict was primarily over the issue of slavery and secondarily over missions.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/baptistsinameric00arms/page/187|title=The Baptists in America|last=1893-1987.|first=Armstrong, O.

====Divisions over slavery====
{{see also|Christian views on slavery}}
Slavery in the 19th century became the most critical moral issue dividing Baptists in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Baptists in America: A History {{!}} Reviews in History|url=https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/1940|access-date=2020-07-21|website=reviews.history.ac.uk|language=en}}</ref> Struggling to gain a foothold in the South, after the American Revolution, the next generation of Southern Baptist preachers accommodated themselves to the leadership of Southern society. Rather than challenging the gentry on slavery and urging [[manumission]] (as did the [[Quakers]] and [[Methodists]]), they began to interpret the Bible as supporting the practice of slavery and encouraged good paternalistic practices by slaveholders. They preached to slaves to accept their places and obey their masters. In the two decades after the Revolution during the [[Second Great Awakening]], Baptist preachers abandoned their pleas that slaves be manumitted.{{Sfn | Heyrman | 1998 | pp = 10â€“18, 155}}

After first attracting [[yeomen]] farmers and common planters, in the 19th century, the Baptists began to attract major planters among the elite.{{Sfn | Heyrman | 1998 | pp = 10â€“18, 155}} While the Baptists welcomed slaves and free blacks as members, whites controlled leadership of the churches, their preaching supported slavery, and blacks were usually segregated in seating.{{Sfn | Heyrman | 1998 | pp = 10â€“18, 155}}

Black congregations were sometimes the largest of their regions. For instance, by 1821, Gillfield Baptist in [[Petersburg, Virginia]], had the largest congregation within the Portsmouth Association. At 441 members, it was more than twice as large as the next ranking church. Before the [[Nat Turner]] slave rebellion of 1831, Gillfield had a black preacher. Afterward, the state legislature insisted that black congregations be overseen by white men. Gillfield could not call a black preacher until after the [[American Civil War]] and emancipation.{{Sfn | Raboteau | 2004 | p = 188}} After Turner's slave rebellion, whites worked to exert more control over black congregations and passed laws requiring white ministers to lead or be present at religious meetings (many slaves evaded these restrictions).

In addition, from the early decades of the 19th century, many Baptist preachers in the South argued in favor of preserving the right of ministers to be slaveholders (which they had earlier prohibited), a class that included prominent Baptist Southerners and planters.<ref name= historiographicalstudy>{{Cite journal| last = Shurden | first = Walter B. | title = The origins of the Southern Baptist Convention: a historiographical study | journal = Baptist History and Heritage | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | date = January 1, 2002 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-94160891.html}}</ref>

The Triennial Convention and the Home Mission Society adopted a kind of neutrality concerning slavery, neither condoning nor condemning it. During the "Georgia Test Case" of 1844, the Georgia State Convention proposed that the slaveholder [[Elder (Christianity)|Elder]] James E. Reeve be appointed as a [[missionary]]. The [[International Mission Board|Foreign Mission Board]] refused to approve his appointment, recognizing the case as a challenge and not wanting to overturn their policy of neutrality on the slavery issue. They stated that slavery should not be introduced as a factor into deliberations about missionary appointments.{{sfn|Early|2008|pp=100â€“101}}

In 1844, [[Basil Manly Sr.]], president of the [[University of Alabama]], a prominent preacher and a major planter who owned 40 slaves, drafted the "Alabama Resolutions" and presented them to the Triennial Convention. These included the demand that slaveholders be eligible for denominational offices to which the Southern associations contributed financially. These resolutions failed to be adopted. Georgia Baptists decided to test the claimed neutrality by recommending a slaveholder to the Home Mission Society as a missionary. The Home Mission Society's board refused to appoint him, noting that missionaries were not allowed to take servants with them (so he clearly could not take slaves) and that they would not make a decision that appeared to endorse slavery. Southern Baptists considered this an infringement of their right to determine their own candidates.<ref name=Cathcart>{{Citation | url = http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/staughton/triennial.htm | title = The Baptist Encyclopedia | editor-first = William | editor-last = Cathcart | edition = rev | place = Philadelphia | year = 1883 | publisher = William Carey University | accessdate = April 25, 2007 | page = 1077}}.</ref> From the Southern perspective, the Northern position that "slaveholding brethren were less than followers of Jesus" effectively obliged slaveholding Southerners to leave the fellowship.<ref>{{cite news |first = Dayne |last = Sherman |date = 2012-06-24 |title = Southern Baptist Convention in black, white |url = http://hammondstar.com/articles/2012/06/26/opinion/columnists/8231.txt |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130125090835/http://hammondstar.com/articles/2012/06/26/opinion/columnists/8231.txt |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2013-01-25 |newspaper = Sunday Star |location = Hammond, [[Louisiana|LA]] |pages = 4A, 5A |accessdate = 2012-06-24 }}</ref>

====Missions and organization====
[[File:Augusta Georgia First Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|Original location of [[First Baptist Church (Augusta, Georgia)|First Baptist Church]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]]]]
A secondary issue that disturbed the Southerners was the perception that the American Baptist Home Mission Society did not appoint a proportionate number of missionaries to the southern region of the United States. This was likely a result of the society's not appointing slave owners as missionaries.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Walter B | last1 = Shurden | first2 = Lori Redwine | last2 = Varnadoe | title = The origins of the Southern Baptist Convention: A historiographical study | journal = Baptist History and Heritage | year = 2002 | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 71â€“96}}.</ref> Baptists in the North preferred a loosely structured society composed of individuals who paid annual dues, with each society usually focused on a single ministry.{{Sfn | McBeth | 1987}}{{Page needed | date = December 2013}}

Baptists in Southern churches preferred a more centralized organization of congregations composed of churches patterned after their associations, with a variety of ministries brought under the direction of one denominational organization.{{Sfn | McBeth | 1987 | p = 505}} The increasing tensions and the discontent of Baptists from the South regarding national criticism of slavery and issues over missions led to their withdrawal from the national Baptist organizations.<ref name="Southern Baptist Beginnings" />

The Southern Baptists met at the [[First Baptist Church of Augusta]] in May 1845.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.christianindex.org/1128.article | title = First Baptist Church building landmark restoration | publisher = Christian index | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131211171614/http://www.christianindex.org/1128.article | archivedate = December 11, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref> At this meeting, they created a new convention, naming it the Southern Baptist Convention. They elected [[William Bullein Johnson]] (1782â€“1862) as the new convention's first president. He had served as president of the Triennial Convention in 1841.

Generally, whites in the South required that black churches have white ministers and trustees. In churches with mixed congregations, blacks were made to sit in segregated seating, often a balcony. White preaching often emphasized Biblical stipulations that slaves should accept their places and try to behave well toward their masters.

After the Civil War and emancipation, blacks wanted to practice Christianity independently of white supervision.{{sfnm |1a1=Brooks |1y=1922 |2a1=Raboteau |2y=2004}} They had interpreted the Bible as offering hope for deliverance, and saw their own exodus out of slavery as comparable to [[the Exodus]],{{sfn|Raboteau|2004}} and abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] as their [[Moses]].<ref>{{cite book

Free blacks in the North had founded churches and denominations in the early 19th century that were independent of white-dominated organizations. In the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction Era]], missionaries both black and white from several northern denominations worked in the South; they quickly attracted tens and hundreds of thousands of new members from among the millions of [[freedmen]]. The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] attracted the most new members of any denomination.<ref name="docsouth.unc.edu">[http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/intro.html "The Church in the Southern Black Community"], ''Documenting the South'', University of North Carolina, 2004, retrieved Jan 15, 2009</ref> White Southern Baptist churches lost black members to the new denominations, as well as to independent congregations organized by freedmen.

===Historical internal controversies===
During its history, the Southern Baptist Convention has had several periods of major internal controversy.

====Landmark controversy====
In the 1850sâ€“1860s, a group of young activists called for a return to certain early practices, or what they called [[Landmark Baptist Church|Landmarkism]]. Other leaders disagreed with their assertions, and the Baptist congregations became split on the issues. Eventually, the disagreements led to the formation of Gospel Missions and the [[American Baptist Association]] (1924), as well as many unaffiliated independent churches. One historian called the related James Robinson Gravesâ€”Robert Boyte Crawford Howell controversy (1858â€“60) the greatest to affect the denomination before that of the late 20th century involving the fundamentalist-moderate break.{{sfn|Tull|2000|p=85}}

====Whitsitt controversy====
In the Whitsitt controversy of 1896â€“99,{{Sfn | McBeth | 1987 | pp = 446â€“58}} [[William Heth Whitsitt|William H. Whitsitt]], a professor at [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], suggested that, contrary to earlier thought, English Baptists did not begin to baptize by [[Baptism by immersion|immersion]] until 1641, when some [[Anabaptist]]s, as they were then called, began to practice immersion. This overturned the idea of immersion as the practice of the earliest Baptists as some of the Landmarkists contended.

====Moderatesâ€“Conservatives controversy====
[[File:BH Carroll Memorial Building Rotunda (Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, TX).JPG|thumb|B.H. Carroll Memorial Building, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary's main administrative building]]
The [[Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence]] ({{circa|1970â€“2000}}) was an intense struggle for control of the SBC's resources and ideological direction. The major internal disagreement captured national attention.{{Sfn | McBeth | 1987 | pp = 681ff}} Its initiators called it a "Conservative Resurgence",{{sfn|Hefley|1991}} while its detractors have labeled it a "Fundamentalist Takeover".{{sfn|James|Jackson|Shepherd|Showalter|2006}} [[Russell H. Dilday]], president of the [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]] from 1978 to 1994,{{sfn|McBeth|1987}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Steinfels |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Steinfels |date=March 11, 1994 |title=Baptists Dismiss Seminary Head In Surprise Move |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/11/us/baptists-dismiss-seminary-head-in-surprise-move.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref> described the resurgence as having fragmented Southern Baptist fellowship and as being "far more serious than [a controversy]".{{sfn|Dilday|2007|p=2}} Dilday described it as being "a self-destructive, contentious, one-sided feud that at times took on combative characteristics".{{sfn|Dilday|2007|p=2}} Since 1979, Southern Baptists had become polarized into two major groups: moderates and conservatives. Reflecting the conservative majority votes of delegates at the 1979 annual meeting of the SBC, the new national organization officers replaced all leaders of Southern Baptist agencies with presumably more conservative people (often dubbed "fundamentalist" by dissenters).{{efn|The era of conservative resurgence was accompanied by the erosion of more-liberal members (see, e.g., [[G. Avery Lee]]).}}{{sfn|Humphreys|2002}}

Among historical elements illustrating this trend, the organization's position on abortion rights within a decade had shifted radically from a position that supported them to a position that strongly opposes them, as in 1971, (two years before ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''), the SBC passed a resolution supporting abortion, not only in cases of rape or incestâ€”positions which even some Southern Baptist conservatives would supportâ€”but also as "clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/13|title=Southern Baptist Convention > Resolution On Abortion|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention}}</ref>â€”positions not supported by the conservative wing. Also, in 1974, (the year after ''Roe v.

In 1995, the convention voted to adopt a resolution in which it renounced its [[racism|racist]] roots and apologized for its past defense of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and [[white supremacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/899|title= Resolution on racial reconciliation on the 150th anniversary of the Southern Baptist Convention |publisher=SBC |accessdate=April 8, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140408064550/http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/899 |archive-date= April 8, 2014 }}</ref>{{sfnm |1a1=Priest |1a2=Priest |1y=2007 |1p=275 |2a1=Priest |2a2=Nieves |2y=2007 |2p=339}} This marked the denomination's first formal acknowledgment that racism had played a profound role in both its early and modern history.

By the early 21st century, numbers of ethnically diverse congregations were increasing within the convention. In 2008, almost 20% were estimated to be majority African American, Asian, or Hispanic. The SBC had an estimated one million African-American members.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/15/AR2008021503772.html | last = Salmon | first = Jacqueline L | title = Southern Baptists Diversifying to Survive: Minority Outreach Seen as Key to Crisis | newspaper = The [[Washington Post]] | date = Feb 15, 2008}}.</ref> The convention has passed a series of resolutions recommending the inclusion of more black members and appointing more African-American leaders.<ref name="The Southern Baptists 2012" /> In the 2012 annual meeting, the Southern Baptist Convention elected [[Fred Luter]] Jr. as its first African-American president.

The increasingly national scope of the convention has inspired some members to suggest a name change. In 2005, proposals were made at the SBC Annual Meeting to change the name from the regional-sounding Southern Baptist Convention to a more national-sounding "North American Baptist Convention" or "Scriptural Baptist Convention" (to retain the SBC initials). These initial proposals were defeated.<ref>{{Citation | title = Annual meeting | url = http://www.sbcannualmeeting.net/sbc99/min615ev.htm | publisher = Southern Baptist Convention | contribution = Tuesday Evening | date = June 15, 1999}}.</ref>

The messengers of the 2012 annual meeting in New Orleans voted to adopt the descriptor "Great Commission Baptists". The legal name of the convention remains "Southern Baptist Convention", but churches and convention entities can voluntarily use the descriptor.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=38113 | last = Foust | first = Michael | newspaper = News | title = Wrap-up: Historic meeting sees messengers elect 1st black president, approve descriptor | publisher = [[Baptist Press]] | date = June 21, 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120627032721/http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=38113 | archivedate = June 27, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref>

Moore|Russell Moore]] of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission quickly responded to a pastor who asked why a Southern Baptist should support the right of Muslims living in the United States to build mosques. Moore responded, "Sometimes we have to deal with questions that are really complicated... this isn't one of them." Moore states that religious freedom must be for all religions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482268688/southern-baptists-split-with-trump-on-refugee-resettlement|title=Southern Baptists Split With Donald Trump On Refugee Resettlement}}</ref>

On 12 June 2019, during their annual meeting, SBC delegates, who assembled that year in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], approved a resolution condemning sex abuse and establishing a special committee to investigate sex abuse, which will make it easier for SBC churches to be expelled from the Convention.<ref name="nprsexabuse">{{Cite web|title=Southern Baptists Vote To Hold Churches More Accountable For Mishandling Abuse Claims|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/06/12/731919189/southern-baptists-vote-to-hold-churches-more-accountable-for-mishandling-abuse-c|access-date=2020-07-21|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Burgess|first=Holly Meyer and Katherine|title=Southern Baptists gathered in Alabama amid a reckoning over sexual abuse.

==Theology and practice==
The general theological perspective of the churches of the Southern Baptist Convention is represented in the [[Baptist Faith and Message]] (BF&M).<ref name=BFM2000>{{Citation | publisher = SBC | url = https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/| title = Comparison of 1925, 1963, 2000 versions}}.</ref> The BF&M was first drafted in 1925 as a revision of the 1833 [[New Hampshire Confession of Faith]]. It was revised significantly in 1963, amended in 1998 with the addition of one new section on the family, and revised again in 2000, with the 1998 and 2000 changes being the subject of much controversy, particularly in regards to the role of women in the church.<ref name=FeedbackResponse>{{cite web| authorlink = | title = Committee Response to Initial Feedback | publisher = Baptist Faith and Message Study Committee | date = May 26, 2000 | url = http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfmfeedback.asp | accessdate = August 2, 2015}}</ref>

The BF&M is not considered to be a [[creed]], such as the [[Nicene Creed]]. Members are not required to adhere to it, and churches and state conventions belonging to the SBC are not required to use it as their statement of faith or doctrine, though many do in lieu of creating their own statement.{{Sfn | Hankins | 2002 | pp = 223, 225}} Despite the fact that the BF&M is not a creed, key leaders, faculty in SBC-owned seminaries, and missionaries who apply to serve through the various SBC missionary agencies must affirm that their practices, doctrine, and preaching are consistent with the BF&M.<ref name=PresMissionaries>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://imb.org/updates/storyview.aspx?StoryID=755 | title = imbConnecting: President asks missionaries to sign BF&M affirmation | contribution = imbConnecting | publisher = SBC | type = position paper| accessdate = August 7, 2015 }}.</ref><ref name="Missionaries Must Decide">{{Citation | contribution-url =http://imb.org/updates/storyview.aspx?StoryID=880 | title = imbConnecting: IMB asking missionaries to decide about BF&M request | contribution = imbConnecting | publisher = SBC | type = position paper| accessdate = August 7, 2015 }}.</ref>

In 2012, a [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]] survey of SBC pastors found that 30% of congregations identified with the labels [[Reformed Baptists|Calvinist or Reformed]], while 30% identified with the labels [[Arminianism|Arminian]] or [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]]. [[Ed Stetzer]], president of LifeWay Research, explained, "historically, many Baptists have considered themselves neither Calvinist nor Arminian, but holding a unique theological approach not framed well by either category". Nevertheless, the survey also found that 60% of SBC pastors were concerned about Calvinism's impact within the convention.<ref name=CalvinismPoll>{{cite press release| title = SBC Pastors Polled on Calvinism and Its Effect | publisher = LifeWay Research | date = June 19, 2012 | url = http://www.lifewayresearch.com/2012/06/19/sbc-pastors-polled-on-calvinism-and-its-effect/ | accessdate = August 2, 2015}}</ref> Nathan Finn notes that the debate over Calvinism has "periodically reignited with increasing intensity", and that non-Calvinists "seem to be especially concerned with the influence of [[Founders Ministries]]," while Calvinists "seem to be particularly concerned with the influence of [[Christian revival|revivalism]] and [[Higher Life movement|Keswick theology]]."{{sfn|Finn|2010|p=73}}

Historically, the SBC has not considered [[glossolalia]] or other [[Spiritual gift|Charismatic beliefs]] to be in accordance with Scriptural teaching, though the subject is not even mentioned in the BF&M. While officially few SBC churches are openly Charismatic, at least one Independent Baptist author believes the practice to be far greater than officially discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wayoflife.org/database/charismatic_southern_baptists.html|title=Charismatic Southern Baptists|website=Way of Life Literature|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>Two persons mentioned in Cloud's reportâ€”[[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]] and [[Pat Robertson]]â€”though at one time were Southern Baptist, have since left the denomination.</ref>

===Position statements===
In addition to the BF&M, the SBC has also issued the following position statements:
* Autonomy of local church â€” Affirms the autonomy of the local church.<ref name=autonomy>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/positionstatements.asp | title = About us | contribution = Autonomy of local church | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
* Cooperationâ€” Identifies the Cooperative Program of missions as integral to the Southern Baptist Convention.<ref name=coop>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pscooperation.asp | title = About us | contribution = Cooperation | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
* Creeds and confessions â€” Statements of belief are revisable in light of Scripture. [[The Bible is the final word]].<ref name=creed>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pscreeds.asp | title = About us | contribution = Creeds | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
* [[Christian missions|Missions]] â€” Honors the indigenous principle in missions. The SBC does not, however, compromise doctrine or its identity for missional opportunities.<ref name=missions>{{Citation | title = About us | contribution-url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/psmissions.asp | contribution = Missions | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
* [[Priesthood of all believers]] â€” Laypersons have the same right as ordained ministers to communicate with God, interpret Scripture, and minister in Christ's name.<ref name=priesthood>{{Citation | url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pspriesthood.asp | title = Priesthood of all believers | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
* [[Sanctity of life]] â€” "At the moment of conception, a new being enters the universe, a human being, a being created in God's image"; as such, it should be protected regardless of the circumstances underlying the conception.<ref name=sanctity>{{Citation|url=http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pssanctity.asp |title=Sanctity of life |publisher=SBC |type=position paper |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025102901/http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pssanctity.asp |archivedate=October 25, 2006 }}</ref> As such, the SBC opposes abortion and any form of birth control which acts as an abortifacient.
* [[Christianity and sexuality|Sexuality]] â€” They affirm God's plan for marriage and sexual intimacy as a lifetime relationship of one man and one woman. Explicitly, they do not consider homosexuality to be a "valid alternative lifestyle". They understand the Bible to forbid any form of extra-marital sexual relations.<ref name=sexuality>{{Citation | url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/positionstatements.asp | title = Sexuality | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
*Soul competency â€” Affirms the accountability of each person before God.<ref name=soulcomp>{{Citation | url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pssoul.asp | title = Soul Competency | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>
* [[Ordination of women]] â€” Women are of equal value to men and participate on Southern Baptist boards, faculties, mission teams, writer pools, and professional staffs. However, women are not eligible to serve as pastors.<ref name=women>{{Citation | url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pswomen.asp | title = Women in ministry | publisher = SBC | type = position paper }}.</ref>

===Ordinances===
Southern Baptists observe two [[Baptist ordinance|ordinances]]: the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] and [[believer's baptism]] (also known as ''credo''-baptism, from the [[Latin]] for "I believe").<ref name="Reuters1" /><ref name="BFM2000" /> Furthermore, they hold the historic Baptist belief that [[Immersion baptism|immersion]] is the only valid mode of baptism.<ref name="Reuters1" /> The Baptist Faith and Message describes baptism as a symbolic act of obedience and a testimony of the believer's faith in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] to other people. The BF&M also notes that baptism is a precondition to congregational church membership.<ref name="BFM2000" />  

The BF&M holds to [[memorialism]],<ref name="memorial">{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp |title=Basic Beliefs: Baptism & the Lord's Supper|year=2018|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention|accessdate=9 August 2019|quote=The Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members [...] memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His Second Coming.}}</ref> which is the belief that the Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience in which believers commemorate the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Christ]] and look forward to his [[Second Coming]].<ref name="BFM2000"/><ref name="memorial"/> Although individual Southern Baptist churches are free to practice either [[open communion|open]] or [[closed communion]] (due to the convention's belief in congregational polity and the autonomy of the local church), most Southern Baptist churches practice open communion. For the same reason, the frequency of observance of the Lord's Supper varies from church to church. It is commonly observed quarterly, though some churches offer it monthly and a small minority offers it weekly.<ref name=Communionsurvey>{{cite press release| title = LifeWay Surveys Lord's Supper Practices of SBC Churches | publisher = LifeWay Research | date = September 17, 2012 | url = http://www.lifewayresearch.com/2012/09/17/lifeway-surveys-lords-supper-practices-of-sbc-churches/ | accessdate = August 2, 2015}}</ref>  Because Southern Baptists traditionally have opposed alcoholic beverage consumption by members, [[grape juice]] is used instead of wine (and is usually called "the cup" as a result).{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

===Gender-based roles===
The Southern Baptist Church subscribes to the [[complementarianism|complementarian]] view of [[gender role]]s.{{sfn|Finn|2010|pp=68â€“69}} Beginning in the early 1970s, as a reaction to their perceptions of various "women's liberation movements",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=1090 |title= Resolution on the Place of Women in Christian Service |publisher= SBC | accessdate= December 10, 2011}}</ref> the SBC, along with several other historically conservative Baptist groups,<ref>See {{harvnb|Morris|Lee|2005|pp=355â€“363}}, for a discussion of attitudes regarding gender and their relationship to ministry.</ref> began as a body to assert its view of the propriety and primacy of what it deemed "traditional gender roles". In 1973, at the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, delegates passed a resolution that read in part: "Man was not made for woman, but the woman for the man. Woman is the glory of man. Woman would not have existed without man."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1973a.html|title=The Feminist Chronicles, 1953-1993 - 1973 - Feminist Majority Foundation}}</ref> In 1998, the SBC appended a male leadership understanding of marriage to the 1963 version of the ''Baptist Faith and Message'', with an official amendment: Article XVIII, "The Family". In 2000, it revised the document to reflect support for a male-only pastorate with no mention of the office of deacon.<ref name=women/><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.baptist2baptist.net/b2barticle.asp?ID=228 | first = Tammi Reed | last = Ledbetter | title = SBC and Women Pastors, Comprehensive Report Does Not Sustain Inflated Statistics |date=October 2000 | newspaper = Baptist 2 Baptist | accessdate = July 19, 2007}}.</ref>

====In the pastorate====
{{See also|Ordination of women in Protestant churches}}
By explicitly defining the pastoral office as the exclusive domain of males, the 2000 BF&M provision becomes the SBC's first-ever official position against women pastors.<ref>"Comparison of 1925, 1963 and 2000 Baptist Faith and Message". Online: http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/bfmcomparison.asp. Accessed: 7 Aug 2015</ref>

As individual churches affiliated with the SBC are autonomous, local congregations cannot be compelled to adopt a male-only pastorate.<ref name= autonomy /> Though neither the BF&M nor the SBC constitution and bylaws provide any mechanism to trigger automatic removal ("disfellowshipment") of congregations that adopt practices or theology contrary to the BF&M,<ref name=autonomy/> some SBC churches that have installed women as their pastors have been disfellowshipped from membership in their local SBC associations; a smaller number have been disfellowshipped from their SBC state conventions.<ref>{{Citation | first = Kristen | last = Campbell | title = Baptist Church Ousted for Hiring Woman Pastor | newspaper = Religion News Service | url = http://www.beliefnet.com/story/202/story_20231_1.html | accessdate = 2007-09-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107170239/http://www.beliefnet.com/story/202/story_20231_1.html | archivedate = November 7, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref>

The crystallization of SBC positions on gender roles and restrictions of women's participation in the pastorate contributed to the decision by members now belonging to the [[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]] to break from the SBC in 1991.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Eileen R | last1 = Campbell-Reed | first2 = Pamela R | last2 = Durso | url = http://www.cbeinternational.org/files/u1/resources/14-Campbell-pdf.pdf | title = Assessing Attitudes About Women in Baptist Life | year = 2006 | publisher = CBE international | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229121648/http://www.cbeinternational.org/files/u1/resources/14-Campbell-pdf.pdf | archivedate = December 29, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref>

====In marriage====
The 2000 BF&M now prescribes a husband-headship authority structure, closely following the [[Paul the Apostle|apostle Paul]]'s exhortations in {{Bibleref2 |Ephesians|5:21â€“33}}:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/bfm2000/articleXVIII.asp|title=Southern Baptist Convention > Commentary on Article XVIII â€“ The Family|website=www.sbc.net|access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>

{{quote|'''Article XVIII. The Family.''' The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to his people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead ''his'' family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation.}}

===Worship services===
Most Southern Baptists observe a [[low church]] form of [[Christian worship|worship]], which is less formal and uses no stated [[liturgy]]. The form of the worship services generally depend on whether the congregation uses a traditional service or a contemporary one, or a mix of bothâ€”the main differences being with regards to music and the response to the sermon.

In both types of services, there will be a prayer at the opening of the service, before the sermon, and at closing. Offerings are taken, which may be around the middle of the service or at the end (with the increased popularity of electronic financial systems, some churches operate kiosks allowing givers the opportunity to do so online, or through a phone app or website link). Responsive Scripture readings are not common, but may be done on a special occasion.

In a traditional service, the music generally features hymns, accompanied by a piano or organ (the latter has been generally phased out due to fewer people playing that instrument) and sometimes with a special featured soloist or choir. Smaller churches generally let anyone participate in the choir regardless of actual singing ability; larger churches will limit participation to those who have successfully tried out for a role. After the sermon, an invitation to respond (sometimes termed an [[altar call]]) might be given; people may respond during the invitation by receiving [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as Lord and Savior and beginning Christian discipleship, seeking baptism or requesting to join the congregation, or entering into vocational ministry or making some other publicly stated decision.<ref>McClelland, Mark. ''The Baptist Messenger''. April 4, 2011. [http://baptistmessenger.com/a-theological-perspective-on-the-%E2%80%98invitationaltar-call%E2%80%99/ A theological perspective on the 'invitation/altar call']</ref> Baptisms may be scheduled on specific weekends, or (especially in buildings with built-in baptisteries) be readily available for anyone desiring baptism.

In a contemporary service, the music generally features modern songs led by a praise team or similarly named group with featured singers. Choirs are not as common. An altar call may or may not be given at the end; if it is not, interested persons are directed to seek out people in the lobby who can address any questions. Baptismal services are usually scheduled as specific and special events. Also, church membership is usually done on a periodic basis by attending specific classes about the church's history, beliefs, what it seeks to accomplish, and what is expected of a prospective member. Controversially, a member may be asked to sign a "membership covenant", a document that has the prospective member promise to perform certain tasks (regular church attendance both at main services and small groups, regular givingâ€”sometimes even requiring tithing, and service within the church). Such covenants are highly controversial: among other things, such a covenant may not permit a member to voluntarily withdraw from membership to avoid church discipline or, in some cases, the member cannot leave at all (even when not under discipline) without the approval of church leadership.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Church Membership Covenants â€“ Legal Contracts that are NOT Biblical! {{!}} The Wartburg Watch 2020|url=http://thewartburgwatch.com/permpage-church-membership-covenants-legal-contracts-that-are-not-biblical/|access-date=2020-07-22|website=thewartburgwatch.com|language=en-US}}</ref> A Dallas-Fort Worth church was forced to apologize to a member who attempted to do so for failing to request permission to annul her marriage after her husband admitted to viewing child pornography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/may-web-only/matt-chandler-apologizes-for-village-churchs-decision-to-di.html|title=Former Member Accepts Acts 29 Megachurch Apology in Church Discipline Case|first=Sarah Eekhoff Zylstra, Morgan Lee, and Bob|last=Smietana|website=ChristianityToday.com|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>

According to a denomination census released in 2020, it has 47,530 churches and 14,525,579 members.  <ref> Southern Baptist Convention, [https://www.sbc.net/about/what-we-do/fast-facts/ Fast Facts About the SBC], sbc.net, Ã‰tats-Unis, retrieved September 19, 2020 </ref>

The SBC has 1,161 local associations and 42 state conventions, and fellowships covering all fifty states and territories of the United States. The five states with the highest rates of membership in the SBC are Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee. Texas has the largest number of members with an estimated 2.75 million.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://lwnewsroom.s3.amazonaws.com/newsroom/files/2014/05/ACP2013-states.jpg | title = SBC Statistics By State Convention - 2013 | publisher = Lifeway | accessdate = 2014-08-28}}.</ref>

Through their Cooperative Program, Southern Baptists support thousands of missionaries in the United States and worldwide.

===Trends===
Data from church sources and independent surveys indicate that since 1990 membership of SBC churches has declined as a proportion of the American population.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Namb | url = http://www.namb.net/atf/cf/{CDA250E8â€“8866â€“4236â€“9A0C-C646DE153446}/RCS_Comparison_1990_2000.pdf | title = RCS comparison 1990â€“2000 }}.</ref> Historically, the convention grew throughout its history until 2007, when membership decreased by a net figure of nearly 40,000 members.<ref>{{Citation|date=2008-04-30 |title=Baptists 4 ethics |url=http://www.baptists4ethics.com/BB_PDFS/BB_apr30_2008.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202326/http://www.baptists4ethics.com/BB_PDFS/BB_apr30_2008.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2008 }}</ref> The total membership, of about 16.2 million, was flat over the same period, falling by 38,482 or 0.2%.

The decline in membership of the SBC was an issue discussed during the June 2008 Annual Convention.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relSBC_07met.ART.West.Edition1.467b548.html |title=Dallas news |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828103024/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relSBC_07met.ART.West.Edition1.467b548.html |archivedate=August 28, 2010 }}</ref> Curt Watke, a former researcher for the SBC, noted four reasons for the decline of the SBC based on his research: the increase in immigration by non-European groups, decline in growth among predominantly European American (white) churches, the aging of the current membership, and a decrease in the percentage of younger generations participating in any church life.<ref name="Ref-1" /> Some believe that the Baptists have not worked sufficiently to attract minorities.<ref name="LovanDylan">{{Citation | last = Lovan | first = Dylan T | title = Southern Baptists to gather in Kentucky | publisher = The Associated Press | date = June 19, 2009}}.</ref>

On the other hand, the state conventions of [[Mississippi]] and [[Texas]] report an increasing portion of minority members.<ref name="LovanDylan" /> In 1990, five percent of SBC congregations were non-white. In 2012, the proportion of SBC congregations that were of other ethnic groups (African American, Latino, and Asian) had increased to twenty percent.<ref name="The Southern Baptists 2012" /> Sixty percent of the minority congregations were found in Texas, particularly in the suburbs of [[Houston]] and [[Dallas]].<ref name="The Southern Baptists 2012" />

The decline in SBC membership may be more pronounced than these statistics indicate because Baptist churches are not required to remove inactive members from their rolls, likely leading to greatly inflated membership numbers. In addition, hundreds of large moderate congregations have shifted their primary allegiance to other Baptist groups such as the [[American Baptist Churches USA]], the [[Alliance of Baptists]] or the [[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]] but have continued to remain nominally on the books of the convention. Their members are thus counted in the SBC's totals although these churches no longer participate in the annual SBC meetings or make more than the minimum financial contributions.<ref name=fewerbaptists>{{Cite news| last = McMullen | first =Cary | title =Any way you count it, fewer Southern Baptists | newspaper = Palatka Daily News | date = June 17, 1999 | url = http://www.adherents.com/largecom/baptist_fewerSBC.html| accessdate = August 31, 2009}}</ref>

In some cases, groups have withdrawn from the SBC because of its conservative trends. On November 6, 2000, The Baptist General Convention of Texas voted to cut its contributions to SBC seminaries and reallocate more than five million dollars in funds to three theological seminaries in the state which members believe were more moderate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.baptiststandard.com/archived/2000/11_6/pages/funding.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120451/http://assets.baptiststandard.com/archived/2000/11_6/pages/funding.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-08-26|title=Texas Baptists affirm change in funding SBC}}</ref> These include the Hispanic Baptist Theological School in San Antonio, Baylor University's [[George W. Truett Theological Seminary]] in Waco, and [[Hardinâ€“Simmons University]]'s Logsdon School of Theology in Abilene. Since the controversies of the 1980s, more than twenty theological or divinity programs directed toward moderate and progressive Baptists have been established in the Southeast. In addition to Texas, schools in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina and Alabama were established in the 1990s. These include the Baptist Theological Seminary in Richmond, McAfee School of Theology of Mercer University in Atlanta, [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]], Gardner Webb and Campbell Divinity schools in North Carolina and Beeson Divinity School at [[Samford University]], to name a few. These schools contributed to the flat and declining enrollment at Southern Baptist seminaries operating in the same region of the United States. Texas and Virginia have the largest state conventions identified as moderate in theological approach.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/religion/203483_baptists_31met.html | first = Jeffrey | last = Weiss | title = Moderate Baptists cut conservative seminaries' funds; Action signals their continued discontent with leadership of the nation's largest Protestant denomination | newspaper = Dallas Morning News | date = 31 October 2000 | accessdate = 25 June 2012}}.</ref>

On June 4, 2020, the Southern Baptist Convention reported a drop in its membership - the 13th consecutive year that membership has declined.  "Total membership in the Southern Baptist Convention fell almost 2 percent to 14,525,579 from 2018 to 2019.

==Organization==
[[File:First Brazilian Baptist Church (Charlestown).jpg|thumb|right|The First Brazilian Baptist Church in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown, Massachusetts]]]]
There are four levels of SBC organization: the local congregation, the local association, the state convention, and the national convention. There are 41 affiliated state conventions or fellowships.<ref name="aboutus">{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/ | title=About Us: Meet the Southern Baptists|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}</ref>

{{Main |List of state and other conventions associated with the Southern Baptist Convention}}

The national and state conventions and local associations are conceived as a cooperative association by which churches can voluntarily pool resources<ref>SBC membership does not prohibit a church from also supporting missionaries directly or also supporting other [[parachurch organization]]s such as [[Wycliffe USA|Wycliffe Bible Translators]].</ref> to support missionary and other work undertaken by them. Because of the basic Baptist principle of the autonomy of the local church<ref name=autonomy/> and the [[congregationalist polity|congregationalist]] polity of the SBC, neither the national convention nor the state conventions or local associations has any administrative or ecclesiastical control over local churches; although such a group may disfellowship a local congregation over an issue, they may not terminate its leadership or members or force its closure. Nor does the national convention have any authority over state conventions or local associations, nor do state conventions have authority over local associations. Furthermore, no individual congregation has any authority over any other individual congregation, except that a church may oversee another congregation voluntarily as a mission work, but that other congregation has the right to become an independent congregation at any time.

{{quote|'''Article IV. Authority:''' While independent and sovereign in its own sphere, the Convention does not claim and will never attempt to exercise any authority over any other Baptist body, whether church, auxiliary organizations, associations, or convention.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/legal/constitution.asp | title = About Us | publisher = SBC | contribution = Constitution}}.</ref>}}

The SBC maintains a central administrative organization in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The SBC's Executive Committee exercises authority and control over seminaries and other institutions owned by the Southern Baptist Convention.

The Southern Baptist Convention has around 10,000 ethnic congregations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Sheila|title=Ethnic churches: Japanese church members live out faith, change lives|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=29587|accessdate=November 12, 2011|newspaper=[[Baptist Press]]|date=December 31, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510234908/http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=29587|archivedate=May 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
Commitment to the autonomy<ref name=autonomy /> of local congregations was the primary force behind the Executive Committee's rejection of a proposal to create a convention-wide database of SBC clergy accused of sexual crimes against congregants or other minors<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1861760_1862212,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything of 2008 | date = November 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> in order to stop the "recurring tide"<ref>{{cite news| last = Ulrich |first = Elizabeth | date = 2008-06-19 | url= http://www.nashvillescene.com/2008-06-19/news/save-yourselves/ | title= Save Yourselves | type = feature | newspaper= Nashville Scene | accessdate= December 10, 2011}}</ref> of clergy sexual abuse within SBC congregations. A 2009 study by Lifeway Christian Resources, the convention's research and publishing arm, revealed that one in eight background checks for potential volunteers or workers in SBC churches revealed a history of crime that could have prevented them from working.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lifeway.com/article/?id=169449 |title=Background checks help churches protect children | publisher =Lifeway |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>

The convention's statement of faith, the ''Baptist Faith and Message'',<ref name="BFM2000" /> is not binding on churches or members due to the autonomy<ref name=autonomy/> of the local church (though SBC employees and missionaries must agree to its views as a condition of employment or missionary support). Politically and culturally, Southern Baptists tend to be conservative. Most oppose homosexual activity, and abortion with few exceptions.<ref name="Reuters1" />

===Pastor and deacon===
Generally, Baptists recognize only two scriptural offices: pastor-teacher and [[deacon]]. The Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution in the early 1980s recognizing that offices requiring ordination are restricted to men. According to the ''Baptist Faith and Message'', the office of ''pastor'' is limited to men based on certain [[New Testament]] scriptures. However, there is no prohibition in the ''Baptist Faith and Message'' against women serving as deacons.<ref name=aboutus-faq9>{{Citation | contribution = Can women be pastors or deacons in the SBC? | title = FAQs â€“ Frequently Asked Questions | url = http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/faqs.asp#9 | publisher = SBC}}.</ref> Neither the BF&M or resolutions are binding upon local churches. Each church is responsible to search the Scriptures and establish its own policies based on how they decide to interpret the scripture.

The Southern Baptist Convention Annual Meeting (held in June, over a two-day period) consists of delegates (called "messengers") from cooperating churches. The messengers confer and determine the programs, policies, and budget of the SBC and elect the officers and committees. Each cooperating church is allowed up to two messengers regardless of the amount given to SBC entities, and may have more depending on the amount of giving (either in terms of dollars or percent of the church's budget), but the maximum number of messengers permitted from any church is 12.

==Missions and affiliated organizations==

===Cooperative Program===
The Cooperative Program (CP) is the SBC's unified funds collection and distribution program for the support of regional, national and international ministries.<ref name="CP1">{{cite web | url= http://www.cpmissions.net/2003/what%20is%20cp.asp |title = What is the Cooperative Program? | publisher=Southern Baptist Convention | accessdate =March 21, 2010}}</ref> The CP is funded by contributions from SBC congregations.<ref name="CP1" />

===Missions agencies===
[[File:FEMA - 39208 - Southern Baptist Convention volunteers prepare food in Texas.jpg|thumb|Southern Baptist Convention Disaster Relief volunteers prepare food in Galveston, Texas, October 10, 2008]]

The Southern Baptist Convention was organized in 1845 primarily for the purpose of creating a mission board to support the sending of Baptist missionaries. The [[North American Mission Board]], or NAMB, (founded as the Domestic Mission Board, and later the Home Mission Board) in [[Alpharetta, Georgia]] serves missionaries involved in [[evangelism]] and [[church planting]] in the U.S. and Canada, while the [[International Mission Board]], or IMB, (originally the Foreign Mission Board) in [[Richmond, Virginia]], sponsors missionaries to the rest of the world.

Among the more visible organizations within the North American Mission Board is Southern Baptist Disaster Relief. In 1967, a small group of Texas Southern Baptist volunteers helped victims of [[Hurricane Beulah]] by serving hot food cooked on small "buddy burners." In 2005, volunteers responded to 166 named disasters, prepared 17,124,738 meals, repaired 7,246 homes, and removed debris from 13,986 yards.<ref>{{Citation | title = CBADR | url = http://cbadr.net/index.cfm/pageid/NewsE68324/articleaction/view/articleid/NAMBF58765/ | accessdate = 2010-03-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105130803/http://cbadr.net/index.cfm/pageid/NewsE68324/articleaction/view/articleid/NAMBF58765/ | archivedate = November 5, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}.</ref> Southern Baptist Disaster Relief provides many different types: food, water, child care, communication, showers, laundry, repairs, rebuilding, or other essential tangible items that contribute to the resumption of life following the crisisâ€”and the message of the Gospel. All assistance is provided to individuals and communities free of charge. SBC DR volunteer kitchens prepare much of the food distributed by the Red Cross in major disasters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf | publisher = Red cross | title = Katrina One Year Report | accessdate = December 10, 2011 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120121200321/http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf | archivedate = January 21, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Baptist Men is the mission organization for men in Southern Baptist Churches, and is under the North American Mission Board.

The [[Woman's Missionary Union]], founded in 1888, is an auxiliary to the Southern Baptist Convention, which helps facilitate two large annual missions offerings: the Annie Armstrong Easter Offering (for North American missions) and the Lottie Moon Christmas Offering (for International missions).

* [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]], [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (1908, originally part of Baylor University in Waco, Texas).
* [[New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary]], [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] (1916, originally New Orleans Baptist Bible Institute)

===Other organizations===
* [[Baptist Press]], the largest Christian news service in the country, was established by the SBC in 1946.
* GuideStone Financial Resources (formerly called the Annuity Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, and founded in 1918 as the Relief Board of the Southern Baptist Convention) exists to provide insurance, retirement, and investment services to churches and to ministers and employees of Southern Baptist churches and agencies. Like many financial institutions during that time period, it underwent a severe financial crisis in the 1930s.
* [[LifeWay Christian Resources]], founded as the Baptist Sunday School Board in 1891, which is one of the largest Christian publishing houses in America.  It previously operated the "LifeWay Christian Stores" (formerly "Baptist Book Stores") chain of bookstores, until closing all stores in 2019 (but still operates an online service).
* [[Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission]] (formerly known as the Christian Life Commission of the SBC) is an entity of the Southern Baptist Convention that is dedicated to addressing social and moral concerns and their implications on public policy issues from City Hall to Congress and the courts (among other things it files ''amici'' briefs on various cases where religious liberty is potentially threatened). Its mission is "To awaken, inform, energize, equip, and mobilize Christians to be the catalysts for the Biblically-based transformation of their families, churches, communities, and the nation."
* The Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives, in Nashville, Tennessee, serves as the official depository for the archives of the Southern Baptist Convention and a research center for the study of Baptists worldwide. The website for the SBHLA includes digital resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbhla.org/|title=Southern Baptist Historical Library & Archive - Baptist history, Baptist Archives, church records, church history|website=www.sbhla.org|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref>
