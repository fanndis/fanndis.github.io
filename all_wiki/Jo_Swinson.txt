==Early career==
After graduating from the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]], Swinson moved to [[Yorkshire]] and worked for Ace Visual and Sound Systems in [[Thorne, South Yorkshire|Thorne]], before becoming a [[marketing]] and [[public relations]] manager for [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]-based commercial radio station [[Viking FM]] from December 2000,<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7788472.stm|title=Being the UK's youngest MP|date=2009|access-date=7 April 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showmagic.com/ |title=Home |publisher=ShowMagic |accessdate=12 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210150547/http://www.showmagic.com/ |archive-date=10 February 2012 }}</ref> and media company Space and People.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jo Swinson Biography |url=https://oeb.global/programme/speakers/oeb-15/jo-swinson |website=OEB |accessdate=27 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727184918/https://oeb.global/programme/speakers/oeb-15/jo-swinson |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

At the age of 21, Swinson stood unsuccessfully in the [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston upon Hull East]] constituency in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], but gained a 6% [[Swing (politics)|swing]] from [[John Prescott]], then the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. In 2003, she unsuccessfully contested [[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden]] seat in the [[Scottish Parliament Election, 2003|Scottish Parliament election]], finishing third with 14% of the vote.<ref name=":1" />

==Member of Parliament 2005-2015==
Swinson was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as the MP for [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Dunbartonshire]] at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. She defeated [[John Lyons (UK politician)|John Lyons]] of [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] by 4,061 votes, and was the first ever Member of Parliament born in the 1980s.<ref name="shackle1"/> As the youngest MP she replaced fellow Lib Dem MP [[Sarah Teather]] as the "[[Baby of the House]]". This lasted until 2009, when [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Chloe Smith]] was elected at the [[2009 Norwich North by-election|Norwich North by-election]].<ref name="shackle1"/>

Swinson was vocal in her [[opposition to the Iraq War]] and the Labour government's proposals for [[National identity cards in the United Kingdom|national identity cards]]. She has supported measures both by individuals and government to tackle [[climate change]] such as [[conserving energy]] in the home and the Liberal Democrat policy of introducing [[green taxes]] while reducing [[income tax]] to offset the burden. She supports reducing the [[voting age]] to 16 as one way of engaging young people in politics. She believes more women should be involved in politics but that encouragement is better than affirmative action in achieving this. She opposes [[positive discrimination]] to address gender imbalance, and led the argument against positive discrimination to select her party's candidates at their national [[party conference]] in 2002, wearing a pink T-shirt inscribed with the slogan, "I am not a token woman".<ref name=":1" />

Swinson has also called for a "wellbeing index" to be introduced, to be compared against [[GDP]], and tabled an [[early day motion]] on the issue in 2008, gaining 50 signatures. She found support from MPs such as [[Vince Cable]] and [[Angela Eagle]]. Swinson cited the fact that although [[standard of living]] had increased, people's level of wellbeing had been virtually static for some time, according to polls.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wheeler |first=Brian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7657465.stm |title=UK &#124; UK Politics &#124; Crunch time for happy talk |work=BBC News |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012114436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7657465.stm |archive-date=12 October 2008 }}</ref>

Swinson believed that new [[prisons]] ought not to be built and had campaigned vocally, but without success, against the rebuilding of a prison at [[Bishopbriggs]] within the constituency. She had said that if a prison was built it must not be built cheaply,<ref>{{cite news|author=Ewan Fergus |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2480087.0.0.php |title=Bid chaos over plan to build prison |newspaper=Evening Times |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> and that it must not be named after the town in which is to be sited.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ewan Fergus |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2479768.0.well_keep_up_fight_against_naming_jail_after_our_town.php |title=We'll keep up fight against naming jail after our town |newspaper=Evening Times |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> The campaign to give the prison its original name was ultimately successful,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8053648.stm |title=UK &#124; Scotland &#124; Glasgow, Lanarkshire and West &#124; Jail name row ends with old title |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519212924/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8053648.stm |archive-date=19 May 2009 }}</ref> as the replacement prison will retain its original name, [[Lowmoss Prison]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ewan Fergus |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/12827907.Town_apos_s_joy_at_jail_bosses_apos__U-turn_on_prison_name/ |title=Town's joy at jail bosses' U-turn on prison name |work=Evening Times |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522185519/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2509060.0.towns_joy_at_jail_bosses_uturn_on_prison_name.php |archive-date=22 May 2009 }}</ref>

She is an active campaigner against excessive packaging of [[chocolate]] [[Easter eggs]]. Each year from 2007 saw Swinson attack [[confectionery]] manufacturers for wasteful use of non-recyclable materials in packaging of the seasonal goods. She has named [[Guylian]] as the worst offender, followed by [[Lindt]], [[Baileys Irish Cream|Baileys]] and [[Cadbury UK|Cadbury]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Martin Williams |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/mp-resurrects-row-over-easter-egg-packaging-1.1016418 |title=MP resurrects row over Easter egg packaging |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003040050/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/mp-resurrects-row-over-easter-egg-packaging-1.1016418 |archive-date=3 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/28/easter-eggs-still-use-too-much-packaging_n_1386224.html?ref=uk |title=Easter Eggs 'Still Use Too Much Packaging', Claims Report |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111059/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/03/28/easter-eggs-still-use-too-much-packaging_n_1386224.html?ref=uk |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref>

Swinson initially focused efforts on scrapping the 1871 Pedlars Act, which prevents [[Peddler|pedlars]] (travelling salesmen) and [[Hawker (trade)|street traders]] from trading without first acquiring a certificate from the police. In November 2012, Swinson said that the proposed deregulation would help "eliminate barriers to street traders and pedlars by making it easier to trade, boosting retail and helping small traders – including many young entrepreneurs – to expand and grow”.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9699590/Jo-Swinson-says-pedlars-should-be-given-new-freedom-to-trade.html |title=Jo Swinson says pedlars should be given new freedom to trade |last=Ross |first=Tim |date=23 November 2012 |access-date=13 January 2018 |work=The Telegraph |location= London |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160718012257/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9699590/Jo-Swinson-says-pedlars-should-be-given-new-freedom-to-trade.html |archive-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> The proposal was criticised by the [[Local Government Association]], which claimed that it would lead to a 'free for all' of pedlars targeting vulnerable people.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-free-for-all-for-door-to-door-selling-8347582.html |title=New free-for-all for door-to-door selling |date=23 November 2012 |work=The Independent |access-date=13 January 2018 |location= London |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160919082804/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-free-for-all-for-door-to-door-selling-8347582.html |archive-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> By 2014, however, Swinson announced she would seek to amend rather than repeal the laws.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29651934 |title='Archaic' trading rules will remain |date=16 October 2014 |work=BBC News |access-date=13 January 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150728115552/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29651934 |archive-date= 28 July 2015}}</ref>

In October 2013, controversy emerged after MPs in the House of Commons allowed Swinson, then pregnant, to stand for 20 minutes without offering her a seat.

At the Liberal Democrat autumn conference of 2017, Swinson drew media attention for using the phrase "Faragey, Trumpy, angry, arsey, shouty slogans" in criticising populism.

On 22 July 2019, Swinson was [[2019 Liberal Democrats leadership election|elected]] the first-ever female leader of the Liberal Democrats, with 47,997 (62.8%) votes, gaining a clear victory over Sir [[Ed Davey]], with 28,021 votes.

In her first Leader's Speech to the [[Liberal Democrat Federal Conference]], on 17 September 2019, Swinson said that Boris Johnson "claims he can negotiate a Brexit deal in a month.

===2019 election campaign===
Swinson campaigned on a platform of [[Withdrawal from the European Union#Procedure#Re-entry or unilateral revocation|revoking]] [[Article 50]] if the Liberal Democrats formed the government. Swinson launched her campaign by declaring that she was "a candidate to be prime minister", and suggesting her party could win a majority.<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=6 November 2019 |title=I can be next PM, says Jo Swinson at launch of election campaign |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/i-can-be-next-pm-says-jo-swinson-as-she-launches-election-campaign |work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref> However, poll ratings for the party were poor and Swinson's personal ratings declined throughout the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/voters-dislike-jo-swinson-the-more-they-see-her-poll-finds-ffjdlvc8k |title=Voters dislike Jo Swinson the more they see her, poll finds |work=The Times |date=2019-11-19 |accessdate=2020-05-18}}</ref>

During the campaign, Swinson clashed with [[Nicola Sturgeon]], the [[First Minister of Scotland]] on the subject of nuclear weapons. Asked if she would be prepared to use nuclear weapons, Swinson replied simply "yes". Sturgeon commented that "It's sickening to hear this question asked and answered as if it's some kind of virility test and without any context... Using nuclear weapons would mean killing millions of people."<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrick |first=Rob |date=20 November 2019 |title='Sickening': Jo Swinson condemned for unhesitatingly saying she would use nuclear weapons |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jo-swinson-nuclear-weapon-button-war-lib-dems-election-debate-a9210456.html |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref> Additionally, Swinson was forced to deny allegations of animal abuse, after rumours spread on Twitter that she had been filmed murdering squirrels.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golby |first1=Joel |title=This week's biggest Twitter controversy?

Swinson ceased to be leader on 13 December 2019, when in the general election she lost her own seat in parliament to the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]'s [[Amy Callaghan]]. The party's rules disqualified her from continuing as its leader. She had led the party for 144 days. As well as losing seats, the Liberal Democrats failed to make predicted gains.<ref name=":5" /> An internal party review said that their election campaign was worsened by "an inexperienced inner circle" around Swinson. It said that voters who were neither fervently leave or remain were "effectively ignored" by her promise to revoke Article 50.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/15/lib-dem-election-campaign-a-car-crash-says-partys-review?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard|title=Lib Dem election campaign a 'car crash', says party's review|work=The Guardian|last=Walker|first=Peter|date=15 May 2020|access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref> On 27 August 2020, [[Ed Davey]] [[2020 Liberal Democrats leadership election|won]] the leadership election to succeed her.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Ed Davey wins Liberal Democrat leadership race |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-53933470 |accessdate=27 August 2020 |agency=BBC |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>
