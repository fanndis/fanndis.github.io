'''Associate professor''' (frequently capitalized as '''Associate Professor''') is an [[academic]] title with two principal meanings.

In the ''[[North America]]n system'', used in the [[United States]] and many other countries, it is a position between [[assistant professor]] and a [[full professorship]]. In this system an associate professorship is typically the first promotion obtained after gaining a faculty position, and in the United States it is usually connected to [[tenure]].

In the ''[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] system'', the title associate professor is traditionally used in place of [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in certain countries. Like the reader title it ranks above senior lecturer – which corresponds to associate professor in the North American system – and is broadly equivalent to a North American full professor, as the full professor title is held by far fewer people in the Commonwealth system. In this system an associate professorship is typically the second or third promotion obtained after gaining an academic position, and someone promoted to associate professor has usually been a permanent employee already in their two previous ranks as lecturer and senior lecturer. Traditionally British universities have used the title reader, while associate professor ''in place of reader'' is traditionally used in [[Academic ranks (Australia and New Zealand)|Australia and New Zealand]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|title=Australia, Academic Career Structure|website=eui.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628005947/http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Australia.aspx|archivedate=28 June 2017}}</ref> [[Academic ranks in South Africa|South Africa]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Ireland]] within an otherwise British system of ranks.

==Overview==

===Comparison===

<!-- DO&nbsp;NOT add university-specific material relating to recent adoption of American titles by specific Commonwealth universities to this table. This table is a broad overview of the TRADITIAL main systems. If a university in the Commonwealth is using the titles assistant prof, associate prof, prof, it is using the North American system, not the Commonwealth system as described to the right in this table -->

The table presents a broad overview of the traditional main systems, but there are universities which use a combination of those systems or other titles. Some universities in Commonwealth countries have also entirely adopted the North American system in place of the Commonwealth system.
