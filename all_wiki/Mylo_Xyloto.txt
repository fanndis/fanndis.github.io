'''''Mylo Xyloto''''' (pronounced "Mylou Zyletou") is the fifth studio album by British [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Coldplay]], released in late October 2011. The band worked closely with producer [[Brian Eno]] following their successful collaboration on ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', the band's previous album.

''Mylo Xyloto'' is a [[concept album]] and a thematic [[rock opera]].<ref name="concept">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/coldplay/59807 |title=Coldplay: '&#39;Mylo Xyloto' is a concept album about love conquering all' |website= nme.com |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> The album tells the story of a war against sound and colour by a supremacist government, set in the world of Silencia, an [[Orwellian]] society. Silencia has been overtaken by a government led by Major Minus, who controls the population through media and [[propaganda]]. His aim is to take sound and colour off the streets in hope to draw away "feeders", creatures that use such energy to hunt its prey. The album follows Mylo Xyloto, a "silencer", a soldier in an army tasked to hunt and track down "sparkers", people who harness light and energy and use it to create sparks, comparable to [[graffiti]] in real life. He encounters Fly, the sparker most wanted by Major Minus. Through Fly, Mylo discovers his sparker abilities and his affiliation with the Car Kids, a major sparker faction founded by Mylo's parents, Aiko and Lela.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Drummer [[Will Champion]] has noted that the album is a story of the characters "falling in love and trying to escape together", with a general theme of "love conquering all".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}. In interviews the band have said that the album follows a love story between Mylo and Xyloto, with them being separate characters .<ref>https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-269-1268194</ref> In the comics based on album however, Mylo Xyloto is the main protagonist and Fly is the sparker girl he encounters.<ref>https://timeline.coldplay.com/article/interview-mark-osborne-on-the-mylo-xyloto-comic/</ref>

''Mylo Xyloto'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its uplifting tone and new [[Electronic music|electronic]] sound; however, some found the album's material overproduced. "[[Paradise (Coldplay song)|Paradise]]" and "[[Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall]]" received a total of three [[Grammy Award]] [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|nominations in 2012]], while the album and "Charlie Brown" received two further [[55th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy nominations in 2013]]. Internationally, ''Mylo Xyloto'' charted at number one in 34 countries.<ref name= launch>{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/11/coldplay-mylo-xyloto-comic-books |title= Coldplay to launch Mylo Xyloto comics| first= Sean| last= Michaels| work= The Guardian| date= 11 July 2012| access-date= 20 July 2012}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, ''Mylo Xyloto'' became Coldplay's fifth album to debut at number one, selling 208,000 units in its first week, and setting a one-week digital sales record with 83,000 copies sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whathifi.com/news/coldplay-sets-digital-sales-record-after-snubbing-spotify |title=Coldplay sets digital sales record after snubbing Spotify |website= Whathifi.com |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> ''Mylo Xyloto'' broke an [[iTunes]] record for digital downloads sales by selling over 500,000 digital copies in a week.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/coldplay-breaks-itunes-record-by-257231 |title=Coldplay breaks iTunes record by Selling 500,000 Digital Albums in a Week |work= The Hollywood Reporter |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=4 March 2014 |first=Shirley |last=Halperin}}</ref> ([[Adele]]'s ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]'' album topped this record in 2015.)

==Background==
In November 2008, in an interview with [[All Headline News]], Coldplay lead singer [[Chris Martin]] stated that "...I don't think bands should keep going past [the age of] 33",<ref>{{cite news| first =Sean |last=Michaels|title=Coldplay to call it quits in 2009?| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/20/chris-martin-coldplay-quit|work= The Guardian |accessdate= 5 October 2011| location= London|date=20 November 2011}}</ref> but later rephrased this to say that what he meant was that they must proceed "as if it's our last, because that's the only way to proceed" in December 2008, adding that he thought the band would never split.<ref name= guard2008>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/03/chris-martin-coldplay-split-denial |title= Coldplay will never split up|accessdate=12 August 2009|date=3 December 2008|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first= Sean | last= Michaels}}</ref> Bass guitarist [[Guy Berryman]], who earlier wrote that the band will "just have to start work and see how it shapes up",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.stv.tv/entertainment/68399-coldplay-to-begin-recording-follow-up-to-viva-la-vida/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711063745/http://news.stv.tv/entertainment/68399-coldplay-to-begin-recording-follow-up-to-viva-la-vida/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 July 2012 |title=Coldplay to begin recording follow-up to Viva la Vida |publisher=STV Entertainment |website=STV.tv |date=6 January 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2011 }}</ref> reported that the band would return to the studio:

<blockquote>We've already got lists of song ideas. We never stop writing. We go into the studio with all the best laid plans then what we end up with is not what we intended. It's just exciting to wonder what will come out the speakers in a year's time. We have very exciting things lined up. It's time to take our music down different directions and really explore other avenues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coldplaying.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=6631 |title=Coldplay's next album set to reflect the band's close bond |website= Coldplaying.com |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

In one interview, Martin predicted the style of the incoming album as being less dominated by [[fanfare]], and featuring a more "stripped-down" sound.<ref name="DeLuca Comedy">{{cite news| first= Dan| last=  DeLuca| work= [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date= 24 May 2009| url= http://articles.philly.com/2009-05-24/entertainment/25273523_1_guy-berryman-jonny-buckland-cat-stevens | title= Comedy, confidence, and Coldplay}}</ref>

===Studios===
In November 2008, Coldplay established a recording HQ at a disused bakery in Primrose Hill, North London, where they recorded a big part of ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Coldplay move into London bakery|url= http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/12239-coldplay-move-into-london-bakery|website= tourdates.co.uk|accessdate= 5 October 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091122213455/http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/12239-coldplay-move-into-london-bakery|archive-date= 22 November 2009|url-status= dead}}</ref> Part of Mylo Xyloto was also recorded on the same place, however this time they used a new studio, near the original, called The Beehive. While a few overdubs and a lot of comping were recorded at The Bakery, a lot of live recording and live takes were done on the new studio.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.uaudio.com/blog/artist-interview-rik-simpson/ |title=Rik Simpson on Producing Coldplay's Mylo Xyloto – Blog |website=Uaudio.com |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> The Beehive was described by Rik Simpson, one of the producers, as a "large room". One of the band's roadies blogged about the studio, describing it as having a "gorgeous reverb".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=571&page=0 |title= Roadie #42 – Blog #110 |website= Coldplay.com |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> Still about the studio he said:

<blockquote>Everywhere you go there's light streaming in. Even on a relatively gloomy British afternoon, it's noticeably bright inside. I can only imagine that this will be reflected in the new material.</blockquote>

==Style and concept==
''Mylo Xyloto'' is  a [[concept album]], according to Martin, "based on a love story with a happy ending." Two protagonists living in an oppressive, dystopian, urban environment, meet one another through a gang and fall in love. Lyrically, the album is inspired by "old school American [[graffiti]]" and "the [[White Rose]] Movement." Martin also said that the album was influenced by [[HBO]] TV series ''[[The Wire]]''.<ref name="DeLuca Comedy" />
[[File:Heavily tagged subway car in NY.jpg|left|thumb|Subway car in [[New York City]]. The 1970s graffiti of the city inspired the album.]]

Coldplay had stated on several occasions, long before the release, that they wanted the album to be "more acoustic" and "more intimate" than its predecessor, 2008's ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]''. The band later said they got to a point where they were trying to make two records, a stripped-down album, that started to be recorded first, along with an electric one that was already being called ''Mylo Xyloto'' by the band. However they later decided to combine both albums. Drummer Will Champion explained that the band realized they couldn't focus on more than one thing at once, and songs like "[[Paradise (Coldplay song)|Paradise]]" couldn't be played in an acoustic style.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1673060/coldplay-mylo-xyloto-schizophrenic.jhtml |title= Coldplay Call Mylo Xyloto A 'Schizophrenic Album' |website= MTV.com |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> Martin pointed another song as a reason too: 
<blockquote>We have a song called Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an accordion and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion – that has to go in with the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.</blockquote>

In the end some songs composed for the acoustic album such as "Us Against the World" and "U.F.O" maintained the "stripped" approach, while others such as "Charlie Brown" changed into a new form. Songs from both records ended up on the final album, [[worldbeat]] elements from the predecessor ''Viva La Vida'' are present but the overall production of it became electronic influenced. The electro rock sound can be heard through the whole album, beginning with opening song "Hurts Like Heaven" which has synthesised sounds and vocals predominantly on [[vocoder]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.theupcoming.co.uk/2011/10/17/album-review-coldplay-mylo-xyloto/ |url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111121153754/http://www.theupcoming.co.uk/2011/10/17/album-review-coldplay-mylo-xyloto| archivedate= 21 November 2011 |author= The Editor |title= Album review: Coldplay – Mylo Xyloto | work= The Upcoming| date= 17 October 2011| access-date= 3 January 2017}}</ref> The next track, "Paradise", also shows the band stepping outside of their comfort zone and going into the new electronic territory.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.contactmusic.com/album-review/coldplay-mylo-xyloto | title= Coldplay – Mylo Xyloto Album Review| first= Alister| last= Roberts| date= 14 November 2011 | website= Contactmusic.com| access-date= 3 January 2017 }}</ref> Additionally, this song has an R&B beat style, which is also featured on "Princess Of China". This track opens with an anxious blend of synths and guitars and then goes into an R&B type beat. The album has three short instrumentals which are included as noodling experimental electronic interjections on the record.

The album's artworks were revealed on 12 August 2011,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=771&page= |title=New album, Mylo Xyloto, out on October 24 |website= Coldplay.com |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2012 }}</ref> inspired on graffiti the band worked again with longtime collaborators [[Tappin Gofton]] and, this time, also with British street artist, Paris. The band had already started to research and work with graffiti on their home studios, The Bakery and The Beehive, when designer Misty Buckley introduced Paris to them, as they were looking for a graffiti artist to teach them the techniques to do it. Although initially he was supposed to be just a "teacher", Paris stayed on the project until the end, producing part of the final work along with the band.<ref name= Paris>{{cite web| url= http://www.coldplay.com/newsdetail.php?id=927 |title=Interview: Paris, Coldplay's artist in residence (pt 1) |website= Coldplay.com |date=1 April 2012 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref>

Coldplay wanted it to be an explosion of vivid colours as a counterpoint to the subdued colour palette of ''Viva La Vida'', and at the same time there were many lyrics and codes they wished to add. Researches and development into street art started six months before the work had begun.<ref>[http://www.tappingofton.com/index_scaled.html#/Recent/Coldplay/Mylo%20Xyloto%20album%20and%20singles Tappin Gofton<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Then a graffiti wall was painted by the band itself and Paris, formed by nine parts.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.coldplay.com/oracledetail_pop.php?id=2351&page=&iframe=true |title=Oracle – Hey Oracle, is there any possibility to download the whole graffiti wall of the new album as wallpaper or something like this ? |website= Coldplay.com|date=2 November 2011 |accessdate= 12 July 2012}}</ref> Tappin Gofton wanted the whole evolution of the wall, so at the end of every day loads of super detailed photos would be taken from it.<ref name= Paris /> In the end a picture including three parts of the wall was featured on the front cover, while the whole wall is featured on the center of the CD's booklet.

The final versions of the covers have a picture of the wall, half of the CD's were packed with the booklet flipped, showing the silver initials "M X" via a die-cut sheet placed over the photo on the front, while the other half was packed with the full picture and the full name of the album written over it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467954/coldplay-reveals-mylo-xyloto-album-art-release-date |title=Coldplay Reveals 'Mylo Xyloto' Album Art, Release Date |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> Both covers use an original typeface created for this work; the new font is used in most of the album's graphic promotion.

Martin also said it was reference to the album's characters, the boy (Mylo) and the girl (Xyloto) respectively.<ref name="concept"/> Another meaning suggested by the frontman was that the name was supposed to be a graffiti tag for the band, relating "[[xylophone]]" to the word "xyloto".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-UtV7u7bls |title=[2011.11.09&#93; Howard – Chris Martin of Coldplay (5 of 7) |website= YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> Much of the art was done by Paris 1974.<ref name= Paris />

The album was set to be released in December 2010 as a "decade-ender", but was postponed to 2011 since the album was far from finished as Coldplay concluded their [[Viva la Vida Tour]]. Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland mentioned that the album would be released in the latter year.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

''Mylo Xyloto'' received generally positive reviews from critics, receiving a score of 65 out of 100 from review aggregator [[Metacritic]] based on 39 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews."<ref name="mc">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/mylo-xyloto/coldplay|title=Reviews for Mylo Xyloto by Coldplay|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> In a five-star review, Simon Goddard of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' wrote that ''Mylo Xyloto'' "will, at the bare minimum, safely sustain their imperial position for a long time to come", singling out Martin and Buckland's musical contributions and Eno and Dravs' production for praise.<ref name="q"/> Mikael Wood of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' wrote that like ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', ''Mylo Xyloto'' "draws from an expansive palette that makes Coldplay's first three albums sound even quainter" and that "where ''Viva La Vida'' showcased Coldplay's sense of adventure, this [album] feels more eager to please".<ref name="spin"/> Citing the album the band's most ambitious effort, Josh Eells of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that "the choruses are bigger, the textures grander, the optimism more optimistic" and described it as a "bear-hug record for a bear-market world".<ref name="rs"/> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s [[Neil McCormick]] called the record "irresistible", noting its "adventurous" mood and "luxuriously colourful" sound.<ref name="telegraph"/> Ian Cohen of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that the album sees the band "successfully continuing to explore the tension of wanting to be one of the best bands in the world and having to settle for being one of the biggest."<ref name="pitchfork1"/>

In a mixed review, [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' judged ''Mylo Xyloto''{{'}}s storyline as incoherent and expressed skepticism toward the album's purported pop influences, feeling that much of the album "just sounds like standard-issue Coldplay, replete with echoing guitars, woah-oh choruses and vocals that signify high drama by slipping into falsetto", apart from electronic music flourishes that "genuinely [add] a bit of freshness to a formulaic sound".<ref name="guardian"/> In a review for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Melissa Maerz interpreted the album as an attempt by the group to sound less like themselves in order to reconcile their commercial success with the supposed stigma of being "as hated as a band can be".<ref name="ew"/> Randall Roberts of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was critical of Martin's lyrics, stating that "every touch of lyrical bitterness is followed by enough sugar to mask the taste, which might be good in the short term but isn't a recipe for long-term health."<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/10/album-review-coldplays-mylo-xyloto.html|title=Album review: Coldplay's 'Mylo Xyloto'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=25 October 2011|last=Roberts|first=Randall}}</ref>

[[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that ''Mylo Xyloto'' "has a leg up other Coldplay records for this simple reason: they're no longer attempting to mimic U2's portentous piety. They've embraced their schoolboy selves and are simply singing songs of love and good cheer, albeit on a grand scale that somehow seems smaller due to the group's insuppressible niceness."<ref name="allmusic"/> ''[[Melodic (magazine)|Melodic]]'' magazine's critic Johan Wippsson cited "Paradise" and "Charlie Brown" as examples of the band sounding "really on their 'own'", compared to past efforts where the band has "taken ideas from others and sometimes a little too clearly".<ref name="melodic">{{cite journal|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=review&id=10231|title=Coldplay: Mylo Xyloto|work=[[Melodic (magazine)|Melodic]]|accessdate=25 October 2011|last=Wippsson|first=Johan}}</ref> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' ranked the album as the 5th best of 2011.<ref>[https://stereogum.com/891091/qs-50-best-albums-of-2011/list/ "Q’s 50 Best Albums Of 2011"] Retrieved 22 January 2016.</ref>
