==Playing style==
Šafářová plays left-handed with a two-handed backhand<ref name=wtaprofile>{{cite web|title=Lucie Safarova|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9869|website=wtatennis.com|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> and possesses a high topspin forehand. Her timing off the ground allows her to project groundstrokes with power, and she is quick to spot opportunities to take the initiative. Šafářová is notorious for having a volatile return that is capable of hitting clean winners, as well as unforced errors. Her preferred surface is [[Clay court|clay]].<ref name=wtaprofile/> She was coached by Rob Steckley until September 2016 when she split with him, ending a coaching relationship of more than three and a half years, and hired [[František Čermák]]. In December 2017, Safarova announced that she is reuniting with Rob Steckley for the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Kane |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/safarova-reunites-coach-steckley-resumes-practice-antics-youtube |title=Safarova reunites with coach Steckley, resumes practice antics on YouTube |publisher=WTA Tennis |date=16 December 2017 |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsmplug.com/tennis/lucie-safarova-splits-with-rob-steckley-hires-new-coach/ |title=Lucie Safarova Splits With Rob Steckley, Hires New Coach |work=Tsm Plug |date=27 September 2016 |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=tennis20150301>{{cite web|author1=Matt Cronin|title=Safarova credits improvement to consistency, maturity|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/03/lucie-safarova-credits-improvement-consistency-maturity/54207/#.VXLx-9KqpBc|publisher=Tennis.com|date=1 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Stephanie Myles|title=Canadian Rob Steckley coaches Lucie Safarova to the Australian Open women's doubles title|url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/canadian-rob-steckley-coaches-lucie-safarova-to-the-australian-open-women-s-doubles-title-121423932.html|publisher=Yahoo Canada|date=30 January 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
===2005–2006===
Šafářová won her first WTA Tour event in May 2005 at the [[2005 Estoril Open|Estoril Open]] in Portugal, where she defeated fourth-seeded [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]] in a three-sets final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qualifier Safarova lands Estoril title|url=http://www.eurosport.com/tennis/wta-estoril/2005/czech-wins-estoril-title_sto713886/story.shtml|publisher=Eurosport|date=1 May 2005}}</ref> In June she lost the final of the [[2005 Ordina Open|Rosmalen grass court tournament]] to fellow Czech [[Klára Koukalová]] in three sets. She won her second tournament at the [[2005 Forest Hills Tennis Classic|Forest Hills Tennis Classic]] in August, which was played at the historic [[West Side Tennis Club]], after a victory in the final against [[Sania Mirza]].

Šafářová started off 2006 by upsetting world No. 6 [[Patty Schnyder]] in the semifinals of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] tournament and then winning in the final with a straight-set victory. Also in 2006, she made her first Tier II semifinal at [[Amelia Island]], where she upset [[Nicole Vaidišová]] in the round of 16. She later lost to eventual champion [[Nadia Petrova]]. She then made another semifinal at the Tier-IV tournament at [[Palermo]], where she was defeated by [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]].

===2007: First Grand Slam quarterfinal===
At the start of 2007, Šafářová elected to represent the Czech Republic in the [[2007 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]] instead of defending her Gold Coast title. Due to not defending the points at that tournament, she came into the first Grand Slam of the year ranked No. 70 and unseeded. Yet she made headlines at the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], when she stunned the defending champion and No. 2 seed [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the fourth round. She then lost to fellow Czech Nicole Vaidišová in the quarterfinals. After the Australian Open, her ranking rose from No. 70 to 31.

Šafářová continued her good start to 2007 at the [[2007 Open Gaz de France|Open Gaz de France]] in Paris. She reached the final by defeating [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] in three sets and Nicole Vaidišová, [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]], and [[Justine Henin]], all in straight sets. However, she lost the final against Nadia Petrova in three sets. She pulled out of her next event in [[2007 Proximus Diamond Games|Antwerp]] due to a shoulder injury.

Šafářová lost in round three of both [[2007 Pacific Life Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]] and [[2007 Sony Ericsson Open – Women's Singles|Miami]] to [[Shahar Pe'er]] and [[Serena Williams]], respectively. She defeated [[Daniela Hantuchová]] in the Czech Republic vs. Slovak Republic [[2007 Fed Cup World Group II|Fed Cup]] encounter. She then lost in the semifinals of the Tier IV Estoril tournament to [[Victoria Azarenka]].

At [[French Open (tennis)|Roland Garros]], Šafářová defeated Mauresmo in the third round in straight sets. It was the second time in a row that she had beaten Mauresmo in a Grand Slam after winning their only previous encounter in January at the Australian Open. In the next round, she lost in three sets to [[Anna Chakvetadze]]. As the 25th seed at [[2007 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], she defeated [[Zuzana Ondrášková]] followed by a win over [[Eleni Daniilidou]] in three sets. However, in the third round, she lost to world No. 3 [[Jelena Janković]] in three sets after coming within two points of another Grand Slam upset. The match was described as the best WTA match of 2007 up to that point and the best women's Wimbledon match in many years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Šafářová entered the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the 20th seed. She defeated [[Jessica Moore (tennis player)|Jessica Moore]] in the first round and [[Andrea Petkovic]] in the second round. She fell to Marion Bartoli in the third round. In 2007, she advanced to the third round or better in all four Grand Slams including the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, which was the best Grand Slam result at that point of her career.

===2008===
At the beginning of 2008, Šafářová again decided to enter the [[2008 Hopman Cup|Hopman Cup]] in Perth. She was ranked No. 23 and took on world No. 56 [[Alicia Molik]] of Australia. She lost the match followed by a loss with her partner on and off the court, [[Tomáš Berdych]], in [[Mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]]. Against the United States, she lost to Serena Williams in three sets. Šafářová and Berdych lost the first set of the mixed doubles and then retired from the match due to Berdych's health concerns. The Czechs closed the Cup by defeating India 2-1. Šafářová won her singles match against Sania Mirza in three sets. After Berdych also won his singles match and clinched the victory, Šafářová and Berdych lost the mixed-doubles match.

Šafářová's second competition of the year was the [[2008 Medibank International – Women's Singles|Sydney Medibank International]]. In the first round, she faced Alicia Molik. Šafářová won in two tiebreaks. Both players had set points and match points throughout the tiebreaker, but Šafářová was able to come out on top. She subsequently pulled out of the second round against world No. 1, Justine Henin.

Šafářová entered the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] as the 22nd seed. In the first round, she faced [[Catalina Castaño]] of [[Colombia]] and lost in 71 minutes. Later, it was revealed that a gluteal strain was plaguing her during the match. She sustained the injury during her first round encounter against Molik at the Medibank International. Competing at the [[Pacific Life Open]] in the United States, Šafářová, seeded 26th, lost in three sets in the second round to [[Ashley Harkleroad]]. Following that, Šafářová played the [[Sony Ericcson Open]], where she lost to fourth seed Jelena Janković.

===2009===
Šafářová began the year with a quarterfinal showing at the international hard court event in [[2009 Brisbane International – Women's Singles|Brisbane]]. She defeated the Australians [[Isabella Holland]] and [[Samantha Stosur]] before being defeated by second-seeded Victoria Azarenka of Belarus. After failing to qualify for the premier event in [[2009 Medibank International Sydney – Women's Singles|Sydney]], she reached the third round of the [[2009 Australian Open|Australian Open]] by defeating Sybille Bammer and [[Marina Erakovic]] before losing to Marion Bartoli in three sets.

===2011===
