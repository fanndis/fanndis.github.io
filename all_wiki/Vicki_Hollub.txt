In May 2015, Occidental's board of directors selected Hollub to succeed retiring [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) [[Stephen Chazen]], basing their decision on Hollub's "strong track record of successfully growing [Occidental's] domestic oil and gas business profitably and efficiently."<ref name="globeandmail1"/><ref name="alabama1"/> During a subsequent transition period<ref name="globeandmail1"/> she was responsible for operations in the [[Middle East]], [[Latin America]] and the United States.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="alabama1"/> In May 2015,<ref name="bloomberg2"/> she was named senior executive vice president of Occidental and president of Oxy Oil and Gas.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="alabama1"/><ref name="ogfj1"/> Later that year, in December 2015<ref name="bloomberg2"/> Hollub was appointed the global president<ref name="jwn1"/> and [[chief operating officer]] (COO) of Occidental,<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name="ogfj1"/> with oversight for the company's midstream, chemical, and oil and gas operations.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In March 2020 amid a major [[black Monday (2020)|stock market crash]] and an international oil crisis that saw the company's stock price plummet dramatically, a group of activist investors led by [[Carl Icahn]] have stated their desire to replace the entire Occidental board of directors, including Hollub.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-occidental-icahn-idUSKBN20Z30V|title=Activist investor Icahn raises stake in Occidental to nearly 10%|date=March 12, 2020|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref> Icahn wrote an open letter stating his view that Hollub and the board bought Anadarko to save their own jobs, and failed to protect shareholders' capital when they heavily indebted Occidental by borrowing over $40 billion in order to purchase Anadarko at a "massive" 65% premium.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garber |first1=Jonathan |title=Icahn says Occidental’s $38B Anadarko deal done to save jobs of top brass |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/carl-icahn-say-occidental-execs-did-anadarko-deal-to-save-their-own-jobs |accessdate=7 May 2020 |agency=Fox Business |date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Icahn |first1=Carl |title=Open Letter to Occidental Petroleum Stockholders |url=https://carlicahn.com/open-letter-to-occidental-petroleum-stockholders-5/ |website=Carl's views on markets, stocks and politics |accessdate=7 May 2020 |date=12 February 2020}}</ref>
