A '''hardcourt''' (or '''hard court''') is a surface or floor on which a [[sport]] is played, most usually in reference to [[tennis court]]s. They are typically made of rigid materials such as [[asphalt]] or [[concrete]], and covered with [[acrylic resin]]s to seal the surface and mark the playing lines, while providing some cushioning.<ref name=ByAPT>{{cite web |url=http://sportsbyapt.com/types-tennis-courts/ |title=Types of Tennis Courts  |publisher=Advanced Polymer Technology |date=October 22, 2012 |website=SportsByAPT |access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref><ref name=ertheo>{{cite web |url=https://www.ertheo.com/blog/en/type-tennis-courts/ |title=What type of tennis courts are there and how do they influence the tennis playerâ€™s game? |publisher=Ertheo |date=July 17, 2017 |website=ertheo.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="...about cushioning..."}}</ref> Historically, hardwood surfaces were also in use in indoor settings, similar to an indoor [[basketball court]], but these surfaces are rare now.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/09/18/wta-finals-singapore-courts |title=WTA Finals in Singapore are played on unique wooden hard court surface |last=Newcomb |first=Tim |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=September 18, 2015 |website=si.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote=Possible wood comeback?}}</ref>

==Tennis==
Tennis hard courts are made of synthetic/acrylic layers on top of a concrete or asphalt foundation and can vary in color. These courts tend to play medium-fast to fast because there is little energy absorption by the court, like in [[grass court]]s.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |last=Murray |first=Judy |title=Hard courts take centre stage at the Australian Open and the US Open. |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/skills/5274588.stm |website=news.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC Sports |access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref> The ball tends to bounce high and players are able to apply many types of spin during play. Flat balls are favored on hard courts because of the extremely quick play style. Speed of rebound after tennis balls bounce on hard courts is determined by how much sand is in the synthetic/acrylic layer placed on top of the asphalt foundation. More sand will result in a slower bounce due to more friction.<ref name=CoachUp>{{cite web |url=https://www.coachup.com/nation/articles/different-types-of-tennis-courts |title=Different Types of Tennis Courts |publisher=CoachUp, Inc. |date=August 1, 2016 |website=CoachUp.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="about sand in court to slow it down"}}</ref><ref name=SI>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/tennis/2015/08/21/how-us-open-makes-courts-colors-science |title=The science behind creating the U.S. Open courts and signature colors |last=Newcomb |first=Tim |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=August 21, 2015 |website=si.com |access-date=March 2, 2018|quote="...layered...cushioned..."}}</ref>

===Maintenance===
There are numerous hardcourt maintenance methods which are commonly used to keep these facilities in top condition. Some of these include brushing, pressure washing with a cleaning solution and applying chemical treatments to prevent the growth of moss and algae. Anti-slip paint is also applied to hardcourts to give better playing qualities which enhance player safety and performance.<ref name=10s>{{cite web |url=http://www.10-s.com/Your-New-Court/Choosing-a-Tennis-Surface |title=Choosing a Tennis Surface |publisher=10-S Tennis Supply |website=10-s.com |access-date=March 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508132942/http://www.10-s.com/Your-New-Court/Choosing-a-Tennis-Surface |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
