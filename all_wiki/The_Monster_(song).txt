"'''The Monster'''" is a song from American rapper [[Eminem]]'s album ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'' (2013) featuring a guest appearance from Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. The song was written by [[Bebe Rexha]], [[Jon Bellion]], and AKS from Prosper, with production handled by [[Frequency (record producer)|Frequency]]. "The Monster" marks the fourth collaboration between Eminem and Rihanna, following "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" (2010), its sequel "[[Love the Way You Lie (Part II)]]" (2010), and "[[Numb (Rihanna song)|Numb]]" (2012). "The Monster" was released on October 29, 2013, as the fourth single from the album. The lyrics describe Rihanna coming to grips with her inner demons while Eminem ponders the negative effects of his [[Celebrity|fame]].

Upon release, the song was met with positive reviews from [[music critics]], who compared the song to "Love the Way You Lie". "The Monster" has successfully charted worldwide, topping the charts in twelve countries including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also marks Eminem's first number one on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart and has reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Italy and Spain.

The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by the American filmmaker [[Rich Lee]]. The video depicts Rihanna as Eminem's [[therapist]] in a session, as previous videos from his career are shown and referenced including  "[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]", "[[My Name Is]]", "[[Lose Yourself]]", "[[3 a.m. (Eminem song)|3 a.m.]]", "[[The Way I Am (Eminem song)|The Way I Am]]" and the [[2001 Grammy Awards]] performance of "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" with [[Elton John]]. The video was well received and was nominated for several awards. Eminem and Rihanna performed the song live at the [[2014 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1725645/eminem-rihanna-performing-monster-mtv-movie-awards-2014.jhtml |title=Eminem And Rihanna To Perform 'Monster' At 2014 MTV Movie Awards |publisher=MTV |date=2014-04-08 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref>

==Background and production==
[[File:Bebe Rexha by rufusowliebat.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|The song, "Monster Under My Bed," written by [[Bebe Rexha]], was originally intended to be used on her own debut album. The chorus was later used for "The Monster"]]

In 2010, Eminem and Rihanna released their first official collaboration titled "[[Love the Way You Lie]]". The song received both critical and commercial success and topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for seven consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/951892/rihanna-and-eminems-love-the-way-you-lie-part-ii-sequel-leaks |first=Monica |last=Herrera |title=Rihanna and Eminem's 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' Sequel Leaks |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705063941/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/951892/rihanna-and-eminems-love-the-way-you-lie-part-ii-sequel-leaks |archive-date=July 5, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> By the end of the year, 854,000&nbsp;copies of the song were sold in the UK, making "Love the Way You Lie" the [[List of best-selling singles by year in the United Kingdom|country's biggest-selling song of 2010]].<ref name="official charts end of 2010">{{cite web|title=Eminem/Rihanna & Take That scoop 2010 crowns |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/cardle-at-no-1-again-eminemrihanna-take-that-scoop-2010-crowns/ |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |date=January 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026060230/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/chart-news/cardle-at-no-1-again-eminemrihanna-take-that-scoop-2010-crowns/ |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The same year, a sequel to the single, titled "[[Love the Way You Lie (Part II)]]" was released as part of Rihanna's fifth studio album ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]''; it mainly views matters from the female protagonist perspective.<ref name="latimesmag">{{cite news|first=Gerrick D. |last=Kennedy |title=Hooked |url=http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/06/hooked.html |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704171751/http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/06/hooked.html |archive-date=July 4, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In November 2012, Eminem and Rihanna collaborated again on "[[Numb (Rihanna song)|Numb]]", which was included on Rihanna's seventh album ''[[Unapologetic]]''.<ref name="Notes">{{cite AV media notes|others=Rihanna|title=[[Unapologetic]]|year=2012|type= inlay cover|publisher= [[Def Jam Recordings]], SRP|page=19}}</ref>

In November 2012, singer Bebe Rexha was at Stadium Red studio in [[Harlem, New York]] working on material to be included in her debut album. During the sessions Rexha stated that she "was in a really dark place, a dark head space. Figuring out where you are in life and trying to make shit work for yourselfâ€”it gets to you. You get super down on yourself. I was just trying to get out of a depressed phase." At that moment, she wrote the hook for "The Monster"; in the moment she wrote it she knew that it was going to be a song performed by Eminem.<ref name="beberexhawritting">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/singer-bebe-rexha-talks-co-writing-eminem-and-rihannas-mmlp2-collaboration-monster|title=Singer Bebe Rexha Talks Co-Writing Eminem And Rihanna's 'MMLP2' Collaboration 'The Monster'|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|last=Kennedy|first=John|date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=October 29, 2013}}</ref> The singer further stated that she got the inspiration from the quote "about the monsters that are around us and that live inside of us"; additionally, Rexha was disappointed at being dropped from the [[Island Def Jam]] record label.<ref name="beberexhawritting"/>

The Senior Director of A&R for [[Shady Records]], [[Riggs Morales]] started looking for potential songs to be included on Eminem's eighth studio album. When the producer of "The Monster", [[Frequency (record producer)|Frequency]] played the song for Morales he "freaked out" and asked for the verses to be stripped and [[ProTools]] sessions to be sent to Eminem.<ref name="beberexhawritting"/> When Eminem heard the demo he then added his own verses and adjusted the instrumental portion(s) of the track. However, he left the background vocals sung by Rexha intact.  On September 11, 2013, Rihanna wrote on her [[Twitter]] account that she had recorded a "#monster" hook for one of her favorite artists.<ref name="beberexhawritting"/> On October 22, Eminem revealed the track listing for his eighth studio album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'', including "The Monster" on which Rihanna was credited as a featured artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eminem-reveals-mmlpii-cover-art-news.7326.html |title=Eminem Reveals "MMLP2" Cover Art [Update: Deluxe Edition Tracklist Revealed&#93; |publisher=Hotnewhiphop.com |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref> Shortly after premiering the song, Eminem spoke of working with Rihanna again to [[MTV News]]: "The perception of the record, what it's saying, I thought it would be a good idea to have her on it because I think people look at us like we're both a little nuts. That's one of the things that I was telling her in making the record: I think that people look at us a little crazy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1716821/eminem-rihanna-monster-collaboration-perfect/|title=Eminem On 'Monster' Rihanna Collabo: 'People Look At Us Like We're Both A Little Nuts'|first=Rob|last=Markman|website=MTV News}}</ref>
