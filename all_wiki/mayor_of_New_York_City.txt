The '''mayor of New York City''', officially '''Mayor of the City of New York''', is head of the executive branch of the [[Government of New York City]]. The [[Mayoralty in the United States|mayor]]'s office administers all city services, public property, police and fire protection, most public agencies, and enforces all city and state laws within [[New York City]].

The budget, overseen by [[New York City Mayor's Office of Management and Budget]], is the largest municipal budget in the [[United States]] at $92 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/omb/downloads/pdf/sum4-19.pdf |title=The City of New York Executive Budget |date=April 25, 2019 |author=OMB}}</ref> The city employs 325,000 people, spends about $21 billion to educate more than 1.1 million students (the largest public school system in the United States) and levies $27 billion in taxes. It receives $14 billion from the state and federal governments.

The mayor's office is located in [[New York City Hall]]; it has jurisdiction over all five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of New York City: [[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], [[the Bronx]], [[Staten Island]] and [[Queens]]. The mayor appoints numerous officials, including commissioners who head city departments, and his deputy mayors. The mayor's regulations are compiled in title 43 of the ''[[New York City Rules]]''. According to current law, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office but may run again after a four-year break. It was changed from two to three terms on October 23, 2008, when the [[New York City Council]] voted 29–22 in favor of passing the term limit extension into law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/bloomberg.third.term.2.847239.html |title='Aye' And Mighty: Bloomberg's Wish Is Granted |date=October 23, 2008 |author=WCBS |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025085132/http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/bloomberg.third.term.2.847239.html |archivedate=October 25, 2008 }}</ref> However, in 2010, a referendum reverting the limit to two terms passed overwhelmingly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/11/is-term-limit-vote-a-big-smack.html |location=New York |title=Is Term Limit Vote a Big Smack at Mayor? – New York Daily News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606081258/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/11/is-term-limit-vote-a-big-smack.html |archivedate=June 6, 2013 }}</ref>

The current mayor is [[Bill de Blasio]], who was [[New York City mayoral election, 2013|elected]] on November 5, 2013, and again [[New York City mayoral election, 2017|reelected]] to a second term on November 7, 2017.

== History ==
{{see also|List of mayors of New York City}}
[[File:Bloomberg Inaguration.jpg|thumb|left|Second inauguration of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] on the steps of City Hall, 2006]]

In 1665, Governor [[Richard Nicolls]] appointed [[Thomas Willett]] as the first mayor of New York. For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power. Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]] in which the state's governor had the loudest voice. In 1821 the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor. An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor. [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence|Cornelius W. Lawrence]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], was elected that year.

[[Gracie Mansion]] has been the official residence of the mayor since [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s administration in 1942. Its main floor is open to the public and serves as a small museum.

The mayor is entitled to a salary of [[United States dollar|$]]258,750 a year.<ref name="lwvnyc1">{{cite web |url=http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |title=League of Women Voters of the City of New York – About Us |publisher=Lwvnyc.org |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231120643/http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |archivedate=December 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Michael Bloomberg]], mayor of the city from 2002 to 2013 and one of the richest people in the world,<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|title=Forbes Profile|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/|work=Forbes|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> declined the salary and instead was paid [[One-dollar salary|$1 yearly]].

In 2000 direct control of the city's public school system was transferred to the mayor's office. In 2003 the reorganization established the [[New York City Department of Education]].

=== Tammany Hall ===
{{Main|Tammany Hall}}
[[File:New York's New Solar System2.jpg|thumb|230px|"New York's new solar system": [[Tammany Hall]] revolves around [[Richard Croker|Boss Croker]] in this 1899 cartoon in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]''.]]

Tammany Hall, which evolved from an organization of craftsmen into a Democratic political machine, gained control of Democratic Party nominations in the state and city in 1861. It played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854 through the era of [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.|Robert Wagner]] (1954–1965).

== Deputies==
The mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter. The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed [[Grover Whalen]] as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. 
Deputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor. (The order of succession is the [[New York City Public Advocate|Public Advocate of the City of New York]], then the [[New York City Comptroller|Comptroller of the City of New York]].<ref name="NYCRun">{{cite book|title=What Makes New York City Run?

== In popular culture ==

Local [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers often refer to the mayor as "Hizzoner", a corruption of the [[honorific]] [[Style (form of address)|style]] [[The Honourable#United States|His Honor]].

''[[Spin City]]'', a 1990s TV [[sitcom]], starred [[Michael J. Fox]] as a deputy mayor of New York under [[Barry Bostwick]]'s fictional Mayor Randall Winston.

Several mayors have appeared in television and movies, as well as on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], most notably in ''[[The Will Rogers Follies]]''. In the 1980s and 1990s, mayors [[Ed Koch]] and [[Rudy Giuliani]] appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on several occasions, sometimes mocking themselves in sketches. Giuliani and Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] have both appeared, as themselves in their mayoral capacities, on episodes of ''[[Law & Order]]''. Giuliani also appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', titled "[[The Non-Fat Yogurt]]". Giuliani has made cameos in films such as ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1999 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'' and ''[[Anger Management (film)|Anger Management]]''. Bloomberg has appeared on ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' and ''[[Horace and Pete]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089255/|title=Michael Bloomberg|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5585044/fullcredits#cast|title=Episode #1.9|publisher=IMDb|date=March 26, 2016|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref>

In "Recycled Koopa", an episode of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', [[King Koopa]] is dumping his garbage into New York, causing New Yorkers including the mayor to transform into mindless "Koopa Zombies". Although the episode aired during the term of Mayor [[David Dinkins]], the mayor in the episode does not seem based on him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recycled Koopa|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Recycled_Koopa|publisher=Super Mario Wiki, the Mario encyclopedia|language=en|access-date=February 12, 2017}}</ref>
