'''Phillip Burton''' (June 1, 1926 – April 10, 1983) was an American politician and attorney who served as a [[United States Representative]] from [[California]] from 1964 until his death in 1983. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he was instrumental in creating the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]]. Burton was one of the first members of Congress to acknowledge the need for [[AIDS]] research and introduce an AIDS bill. He was the husband of Congresswoman [[Sala Burton]], brother of [[California State Senator]] and Congressman [[John Burton (American politician)|John Burton]].

== Early years and education ==
Burton was born in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, the son of Mildred (Leonard) and Thomas Burton, who was a salesman and physician.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0700352 |title = Burton, Phillip (1926-1983), congressman &#124; American National Biography}}</ref> He attended Washington High School in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], and graduated from [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|George Washington High School]] in the [[Richmond District, San Francisco, California|Richmond District]] of [[San Francisco]], in 1944. He earned a B.A. from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1947 and an LL.B. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law|Golden Gate College School of Law]] in 1952.

== Career ==
Burton worked as a lawyer and was admitted to practice before the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1956. He was a member of the [[United States Air Force]] during both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]].

Burton was elected to the [[California State Assembly]] in November 1956, and served there from 1957 to 1964. In 1959 he represented the United States at the Atlantic Treaty Association Conference in [[France]].

=== U.S. Congress ===
Burton, as Democrat, won a special election in February 1964 to fill the U.S. House of Representatives vacancy caused by the resignation of United States Representative [[John F. Shelley]], who was elected mayor of San Francisco. Burton was reelected to the 10 succeeding Congresses (February 18, 1964 – April 10, 1983). In 1965, Burton was one of only 3 members of the House to vote against appropriations that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] requested for the Vietnam War.

Burton was a delegate to the California State Democratic convention from 1968 to 1982. He was also a delegate to the [[Democratic National Convention]] in 1968 and 1972. At the 1968 convention, he was a part of the delegation pledged to [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who was assassinated after winning the California Democratic Primary in June.

In 1973, Burton allowed a bill to go to the floor without a "closed rule"—a stipulation that there could be no amendments proposed to it—for the first time since the 1920s.<ref name="'70s 278">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|pages= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/278 278–279]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/278}}</ref> The ending of the closed rule created an infusion of federal [[lobbyists]] at the Capitol building; the lobbyists targeted members of Congress to add funding for lobbyists' favorite projects into bills.<ref name="'70s 278"/> For this reason, [[David Frum]] wrote that Burton "created the modern Congress" more than anyone else.<ref name="'70s 278"/>

After the Democrats gained a strong majority in 1974, he was successful in getting the House to abolish the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VF9iA2s1cEC&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447&dq=House+Committee+On | title=The House: The History of the House of Representatives| isbn=9780060884345| last1=Remini| first1=Robert V.| last2=Congress| first2=Library of| date=2006-04-25}}</ref> Burton was supported by [[labor union]]s<ref name="'70s 278"/> and championed union activists, supporting the activities of the farm workers union and the coal miners union.<ref>http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/sontag/burton.htm</ref>

When President [[Gerald Ford]] appeared before Congress in 1975 to request aid during a refugee crisis in the [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Cambodia]]n capitals, Burton became so upset with Ford's request that he called it "an outrage" and left halfway through the speech.<ref name="'70s 306">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/306 306]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/306}}</ref> In December 1976, Burton narrowly lost a bid for [[House Majority Leader]] to [[Jim Wright]] of [[Fort Worth, Texas]], by a vote of 148 to 147.<ref name="Pelosi">{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2014/11/28/the-beginning-of-the-end-for-nancy-pelosi/ |title=The beginning of the end for Nancy Pelosi? |date=2014-11-28 |accessdate=2014-11-29}}</ref>

He was the author of the bill that created the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]], and legislation setting up wilderness areas across the country. The [[Point Reyes National Seashore]] includes the [[Phillip Burton Wilderness]], named for the congressman in 1985. In the early 1980s, he worked with gay liaison [[Bill Kraus]] to create legislation and funding for AIDS research in the San Francisco area. He also was instrumental in establishing the position of [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting representative]] from [[Guam]], [[United States Virgin Islands|the Virgin Islands]], and [[American Samoa]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Navigating the Future: A Samoan Perspective on U.S.-Pacific Relations|last=Faleomavaega|first=Eni F.H.|publisher=KIN Publications|year=1995|isbn=0964442612|location=|pages=3}}</ref>

== Death and legacy==
Burton died on April 10, 1983, in San Francisco at age 56, of a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]].<ref name="Widow"/> He was [[cremated]], and the ashes were interred in the National Cemetery of the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. His wife [[Sala Burton]] won a special election in June 1983 to serve the remainder of his term.<ref name="Widow">{{cite news |work=Ocala Star-Banner |date=June 22, 1983 |title=Widow elected to fill seat of Phil Burton |publisher=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2MITAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bwYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5780,995867&dq=phillip+burton+death&hl=en }}</ref> She was reelected in November 1984 and November 1986. Burton's House seat is currently held by [[Nancy Pelosi]], who won a special election in 1987, following Sala Burton's death.
