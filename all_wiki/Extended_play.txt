===History===
EPs were released in various sizes in different eras. The earliest multi-track records, issued around 1919 by [[Grey Gull Records]], were vertically cut 78 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] discs known as "2-in-1" records. These had finer than usual grooves, like [[Edison Disc Records]]. By 1949, when the 45&nbsp;rpm single and 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm LP were competing formats, seven-inch [[Single (music)|45&nbsp;rpm]] singles had a maximum playing time of only about four minutes per side.

Partly as an attempt to compete with the LP introduced in 1948 by rival [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] introduced "Extended Play" [[Gramophone record|45s]] during [[1952 in music|1952]]. Their narrower grooves, achieved by lowering the cutting levels and sound compression optionally, enabled them to hold up to 7.5 minutes per side—but still be played by a standard 45&nbsp;rpm [[phonograph]]. In the early era record companies released the entire content of LPs as 45&nbsp;rpm EPs.<ref name="Osborne">Richard Osborne ''Vinyl: A History of the Analogue Record'', Routledge 2016, p.106</ref> These were usually 10-inch LPs (released until the mid-1950s) split onto two seven-inch EPs or 12-inch LPs split onto three seven-inch EPs, either sold separately or together in gatefold covers. This practice became much less common with the advent of triple-speed-available phonographs.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} 

Introduced by [[RCA]] in the US in 1952, [[EMI]] issued the first EPs in Britain in April 1954.<ref name="Osborne" /> EPs were usually compilations of singles or album samplers and were typically played at 45&nbsp;rpm on seven-inch (18&nbsp;cm) discs, with two songs on each side.<ref name="Strong"/><ref name="key-concepts">

RCA had success in the format with their top money earner, [[Elvis Presley]], issuing 28 Elvis EPs between [[1956 in music|1956]] and [[1967 in music|1967]], many of which topped the separate ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' EP chart during its brief existence.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}  Other than those published by [[RCA]], EPs were relatively uncommon in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but they were widely sold in the [[United Kingdom]], and in some other European countries, during the 1950s and 1960s. In [[Sweden]] EP was for long the most popular record format, with as much as 85% of the market in the late 1950s being EPs.<ref>Leif Aulin & Pontus von Tell ''British Beat in Sweden. The Original Vinyls 1957-1969'' Premium Publishing {{ISBN|978-91-89136-60-1}}</ref> 

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced a weekly EP chart in October 1957, noting that "the teen-age market apparently dominates the EP business, with seven out of the top 10 best-selling EP's featuring artists with powerful teen-age appeal — four sets by [[Elvis Presley]], two by [[Pat Boone]] and one by [[Little Richard]]".<ref>June Bundy [https://books.google.se/books?id=3SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=ep+charts&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9w5v-sbjrAhWBtIsKHYh9BdEQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=ep%20charts&f=false Billboard Adds to Pop Chart Score: New Service Cover Weekly Listing of EP Best-sellers; Album Box Score] Billboard 7 October 1957</ref> ''[[Record Retailer]]'' printed an EP chart in 1960.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The [[NME|''New Musical Express'' (''NME'')]], ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''[[Disc and Music Echo]]'' and the ''Record Mirror'' continued to list EPs on their respective singles charts.  When the [[BBC]] and ''Record Retailer'' commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to compile a chart it was restricted to singles and EPs disappeared from the listings.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The popularity of EPs in the US had declined in the early 1960s in favour of LPs. In the UK [[Cliff Richard]] and [[The Shadows]], both individually and collectively, and [[The Beatles]] were the most prolific artists issuing EPs in the 1960s, many of them highly successful releases. [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Twist and Shout (EP)|Twist and Shout]]'' outsold most singles for some weeks in 1963. The success of the EP in Britain lasted until around 1967, but it later had a strong revival with [[punk rock]] in the late 1970s and the adaptation of the format for 12" and CD singles.<ref>Dave Thompson "EPs – Albums on Installment Plans" ''The Music Lover's Guide to Record Collecting'', Hal Leonard Corporation 2002</ref>

===Notable EP releases===
Some [[classical music]] albums released at the beginning of the LP era were also distributed as EP albums—notably, the seven operas that [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducted on [[radio]] between 1944 and 1954. These opera EPs, originally broadcast on the [[NBC#Radio|NBC Radio]] network and manufactured by RCA, which owned the NBC network then, were made available both in 45 rpm and 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm. In the 1990s, they began appearing on compact discs.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

During the [[1950s in film|1950s]], RCA published several EP albums of [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] movies, containing both the story and the songs. These usually featured the original casts of [[actor]]s and [[actress]]es. Each album contained two seven-inch records, plus a fully illustrated booklet containing the text of the recording so that children could follow along by reading. Some of the titles included ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and what was then a recent release, the movie version of ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' that was [[1954 in film|presented in 1954]]. The recording and publishing of ''20,000'' was unusual: it did not employ the movie's cast, and years later, a 12 in 33⅓&nbsp;rpm album, with a nearly identical script, but another different cast, was sold by [[Walt Disney Records|Disneyland Records]] in conjunction with the re-release of the movie in 1963.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Because of the popularity of 7" and other formats, SP (78&nbsp;rpm, 10") records became less popular and the production of SPs in [[Japan]] was suspended in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/issue/pdf/RYB2000E01.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727021117/http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/issue/pdf/RYB2000E01.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2004|title=A brief description of the Japanese recording industry 2000|format=PDF|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/chronicle/1900/1960.html|script-title=ja:レコード産業界の歴史 1960年～1969年|trans-title=The History of The Record Industry 1960–1969|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}</ref>

In the [[Philippines]], seven-inch EPs marketed as "[[mini-LP]]s" (but distinctly different from the mini-LPs of the 1980s) were introduced in 1970, with tracks selected from an album and packaging resembling the album they were taken from.<ref name="Salazar">{{cite journal |last=Salazar |first=Oskar |title=Philippines Gets First Mini-LP |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=June 13, 1970 |pages=80–81}}</ref> This mini-LP format also became popular in America in the early 1970s for promotional releases, and also for use in [[jukebox]]es.<ref name="BB1972">{{cite journal |title=7-in. LP Growing Concept |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=March 25, 1972 |page=39}}</ref>

[[Stevie Wonder]] included a bonus four-song EP with his double LP ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' in 1976. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was less [[standardization]] and EPs were made on seven-inch (18&nbsp;cm), 10-inch (25&nbsp;cm) or 12-inch (30&nbsp;cm) discs running either 33{{frac|1|3}} or 45&nbsp;rpm. Some [[Novelty record|novelty]] EPs used odd shapes and colors, and a few of them were [[picture disc]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

[[Alice in Chains]] was the first band to ever have an EP reach number one on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album chart. Its EP, ''[[Jar of Flies]]'', was released on January 25, 1994. In 2004, [[Linkin Park]] and [[Jay-Z]]'s collaboration EP, ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]'', was the next to reach the number one spot after Alice in Chains. In 2010, the cast of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' became the first artist to have two EPs reach number one, with ''[[Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna]]'' on the week of May 8, 2010, and ''[[Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals]]'' on the week of June 26, 2010.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In 2010, [[Warner Bros. Records]] revived the format with their "Six-Pak" offering of six songs on a compact disc.<ref name="sixpak">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/country/1211856/another-body-blow-for-albums-warner-to-launch-new-six-pak-format |title=Another Body Blow For Albums: Warner To Launch New Six-Pak Format |first=Deborah Evans |last=Price |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

===EPs in the digital and streaming era===
Due to the increased popularity of [[music download]]s and [[music streaming|streaming]] beginning the late 2000s, EPs have become a common marketing strategy for [[Pop music|pop]] musicians wishing to remain relevant and deliver music in more consistent timeframes leading to or following full studio albums. In the late 2000s to early 2010s, [[reissue]]s of studio albums with expanded track listings were common, with the new music often being released as stand-alone EPs. In October 2010, a ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article regarding the trend noted post-album EPs as "the next step in extending albums' shelf lives, following the "deluxe" editions that populated stores during the past few holiday seasons—add a few tracks to the back end of an album and release one of them to radio, slap on a new coat of paint, and—voila!—a stocking stuffer is born."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/10/kesha-lady-gaga-taylor-swift-new-companion-albums|title=With Ke$ha, Gaga, and Taylor Swift, It’s All About the Art of the Tease|website=Vanity Fair|date=20 October 2010|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref> Examples of such releases include [[Lady Gaga]]'s ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) following her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), and [[Kesha]]'s ''[[Cannibal (EP)|Cannibal]]'' (2010) following her debut album ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010).

A 2019 article in ''[[Forbes]]'' discussing [[Miley Cyrus]]' decision to release her then-upcoming seventh studio album ''[[She Is Miley Cyrus]]'' as a trilogy of three EPs stated: "By delivering a trio of EPs throughout a period of several months, Miley is giving her fans more of what they want, only in smaller doses. When an artist drops an album, they run the risk of it being forgotten in a few weeks, at which point they need to start work on the follow-up, while still promoting and touring their recent effort. Miley is doing her best to game the system by recording an album and delivering it to fans in pieces."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/06/13/three-reasons-why-miley-cyrus-new-album-rollout-plan-is-brilliant/|title=3 Reasons Miley Cyrus' New Album Rollout Plan Is Brilliant|website=Forbes|date=13 June 2019|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref> Major-label pop musicians who had previously employed such release strategies include [[Colbie Caillat]] with her fifth album ''[[Gypsy Heart (Colbie Caillat album)|Gypsy Heart]]'' (2014) being released following an EP of the album's first five tracks known as ''Gypsy Heart: Side A'' three months prior to the full album; and [[Jessie J]]'s fourth studio album ''[[R.O.S.E. (Jessie J album)|R.O.S.E.]]'' (2018) which was released as four EPs in as many days entitled ''R (Realisations)'', ''O (Obsessions)'', ''S (Sex)'' and ''E (Empowerment)''.

==Definition==
The first EPs were seven-inch vinyl records with more tracks than a normal single (typically five to nine
of them). Although they shared size and speed with singles, they were a recognizably different format than the seven-inch single. Although they could be named after a lead track, they were generally given a different title.<ref name="Strong" /> Examples include [[The Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles' Hits]]'' EP from 1963, and [[The Troggs]]' ''Troggs Tops'' EP from 1966, both of which collected previously released tracks.<ref name="Strong"/> The playing time was generally between 10 and 15 minutes.<ref name="Strong"/> They also came in cardboard picture sleeves at a time when singles were usually issued in paper company sleeves. EPs tended to be album samplers or collections of singles. EPs of all original material began to appear in the 1950s. Examples are Elvis Presley's ''[[Love Me Tender (EP)|Love Me Tender]]'' from 1956 and "Just for You", "[[Peace in the Valley]]" and "[[Jailhouse Rock (EP)|Jailhouse Rock]]" from 1957, and [[The Kinks]]' ''[[Kinksize Session]]'' from 1964.

Twelve-inch EPs were similar, but generally had between three and five tracks and a length of over 12 minutes.<ref name="Strong"/> Like seven-inch EPs, these were given titles.<ref name="Strong"/> EP releases were also issued in [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and 10-inch vinyl formats.<ref name="Strong"/> With the advent of the [[compact disc]] (CD), more music was often included on "single" releases, with four or five tracks being common, and playing times of up to 25 minutes.<ref name="Strong"/> These extended-length singles became known as [[maxi single]]s and while commensurate in length to an EP were distinguished by being designed to feature a single song, with the remaining songs considered [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], whereas an EP was designed not to feature a single song, instead resembling a mini album.

EPs of original material regained popularity in the [[punk rock]] era, when they were commonly used for the release of new material, e.g. [[Buzzcocks]]' ''[[Spiral Scratch (EP)|Spiral Scratch]]'' EP.<ref name="Strong"/> These featured four-track seven-inch singles played at 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm, the most common understanding of the term ''EP''.{{citation needed|reason=Surely ''most common understanding'' is an age-related opinion – if you remember the EPs of the 1960s you would say they were all 45 rpm.|date=March 2016}}

Beginning in the 1980s, many so-called "singles" have been sold in formats with more than two tracks. Because of this, the definition of an EP is not determined only by the number of tracks or the playing time; an EP is typically seen{{By whom|date=March 2016}} as four (or more) tracks of equal importance, as opposed to a four-track single with an obvious A-side and three B-sides.

In the United States, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], the organization that declares releases "gold" or "platinum" based on numbers of sales, defines an EP as containing three to five songs or under 30 minutes.<ref name="Gold and Platinum">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/about-awards/|title=About the Awards – RIAA|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]}}</ref> On the other hand, [[The Recording Academy]]'s rules for [[Grammy Award]]s state that any release with five or more different songs and a running time of over 15 minutes is considered an album, with no mention of EPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.org/awards-process-updates|title=Awards Process Updates|publisher=[[The Recording Academy]]|date=July 8, 2015}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, any record with more than four distinct tracks or with a playing time of more than 25 minutes is classified as an album for sales-chart purposes. If priced as a single, they will not qualify for the main album chart but can appear in the separate Budget Albums chart.<ref name="UKCA"/>

An intermediate format between EPs and full-length LPs is the [[mini-LP]], which was a common album format in the 1980s. These generally contained 20–30 minutes of music and about seven tracks.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=6th |year= 2002 |publisher=Canongate |isbn=978-1-84195-312-0 }}</ref>

In underground dance music, vinyl EPs have been a longstanding medium for releasing new material, e.g. ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' by [[The Chemical Brothers|The Dust Brothers]].

==Double EPs==
{{Tone|section|date=May 2019}}
A double extended play is a name typically given to [[vinyl records]] or [[compact discs]] released as a set of two discs, each of which would normally qualify as an EP. The name is thus analogous to [[double album]]. As vinyl records, the most common format for the double EP, they consist of a pair of 7-inch discs recorded at 45 or 33{{frac|1|3}} [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], or two 12-inch discs recorded at 45&nbsp;rpm. The format is useful when an album's worth of material is being pressed by a small plant geared for the production of singles rather than albums and may have novelty value which can be turned to advantage for publicity purposes. Double EPs are rare, since the amount of material recordable on a double EP could usually be more economically and sensibly recorded on a single [[Gramophone record|vinyl LP]].

In the 1950s, [[Capitol Records]] had released a number of double EPs by its more popular artists, including [[Les Paul]]. The pair of double EPs (EBF 1–577, sides 1 to 8!) were described on the original covers as "parts ... of a four-part album".{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1960, [[Joe Meek]] released four tracks from his planned ''[[I Hear a New World]]'' LP on an EP that was marked "Part 1". A second EP was planned, but never appeared; only the sleeve was printed.<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Beta|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17864-joe-meek-i-hear-a-new-world/|title=Joe Meek: ''I Hear a New World'' Album Review|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=5 April 2013|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> The first double EP released in Britain was [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' film soundtrack.<ref>{{cite book|first=Colin|last=Larkin|year=2006|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music ''(4th edn)''|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-531373-4|p=488}}</ref><ref name="NeaversonBeatlesMovies">{{cite book|last=Neaverson|first=Bob|title=The Beatles Movies|publisher=Cassell|location=London|year=1997|isbn=978-0-304337965|url=http://www.beatlesmovies.co.uk/magical-mystery-tour/background.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002072940/http://www.beatlesmovies.co.uk/magical-mystery-tour/background.asp |archivedate=2 October 2009|via=beatlesmovies.co.uk (chapter: "Magical Mystery Tour Part 1 – Background and Production")|pp=53–54}}</ref> Released in December 1967 on EMI's [[Parlophone]] label, it contained six songs spread over two 7-inch discs and was packaged with a lavish colour booklet.<ref name="NeaversonBeatlesMovies" /> In the United States and some other countries, the songs were augmented by the band's single A- and B-sides from 1967 to create a full LP –&nbsp;a practice that was common in the US but considered exploitative in the UK.<ref name="NeaversonBeatlesMovies" /> The [[Style Council]] album ''[[The Cost of Loving]]'' was originally issued as two 12-inch EPs.

It is becoming more common to release two 12-inch 45s rather than a single 12-inch LP. Though there are 11 songs that total about 40 minutes, enough for one LP, the songs are spread across two 12" 45&nbsp;rpm discs. Also, the vinyl pressing of ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'' by [[Radiohead]] uses this practice but is considered to be a full-length album. In 1982 [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] released their studio album "[[2x45]]" on the UK-based label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], featuring extended tracks over four sides of two 12-inch 45&nbsp;rpm discs, with graphics by artist [[Neville Brody]].  The band subsequently released a further album in this format, 1985's "[[Drinking Gasoline]]", on the [[Virgin Records]] label.

There are a limited number of double EPs which serve other purposes,{{which|date=May 2014}} however. An example of this is the ''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]'' EP, which contains tracks by four different bands. Using a double EP in this instance allowed each band to have its tracks occupying a different side. In addition, the groove on the physical record could be wider and thus allow for a louder album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Jukebox EP==
[[Image:Filben Maestro juke box 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A jukebox of 1948<br>Filben FP-300 Maestro<br>78 rpm]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, record companies released EP versions of long-play (LP) albums for use in [[jukebox]]es. These were commonly known as "compact 33s" or "little LPs". It was played at 33{{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;rpm, was pressed on seven-inch vinyl and frequently had as many as six songs. What made them EP-like was that some songs were omitted for time purposes, and the tracks deemed the most popular were left on. Unlike most EPs before them, and most seven-inch vinyl in general (pre-1970s), these were issued in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]].

== Biggest selling debut EP all time ==
The hard rock band [[Ugly Kid Joe]] holds the record of highest selling debut EP with ''[[As Ugly as They Wanna Be]]'', which sold two million copies in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uglykidjoe.net/bio/|title=Ugly Kid Joe Biography|publisher=UglyKidJoe.net|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/ugly-kid-joe-still-ugly-after-all-these-years-20171128-gzu66e.html|title=Ugly Kid Joe get last laugh on haters after all these years|last=Drever|first=Andrew|date=November 29, 2017|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>
