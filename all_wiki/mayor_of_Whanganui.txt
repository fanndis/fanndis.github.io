The '''Mayor of Whanganui''' (previously '''Wanganui''') is the head of the [[Whanganui District|Whanganui District Council]]. Since 1872, there have been 28 mayors. Hamish McDouall is the current mayor.

==History==
The Wanganui Town Board was first formed in 1862, and its first chairman was J Handley who served in that capacity until 1864. The Board became a Borough Council in 1872 until 1924, when Wanganui was granted city status and the Mayor was the head of the [[Wanganui City Council]]. It continued as the City Council until 1989, when [[Whanganui|Wanganui]]'s [[city charter]] was cancelled. Local government reform of 1989 amalgamated various city and council councils – Wanganui District Council includes the old Wanganui City Council, Wanganui County Council and a part of the Waitotara County Council.  The motto of the then Wanganui City, and now Wanganui District Council, is 'Sans Dieu Rien' ('Without God, we are nothing').

The first meeting of the Wanganui Council was held on 14 February 1872. Councillor Francis Williamson, who was the last chairman of the Town Board,<ref name="1872 nomination mtg">{{cite news|title=The Evening Herald.

Several weeks and many attempted council meetings went by without a new mayor being elected, mostly because some councillors stayed away so that there was no quorum. Finally, on 10 April 1874, [[Robert Pharazyn]] was elected as the 3rd Mayor of Wanganui.<ref name="Pharazyn election, 1874">{{cite news |title=Borough Council |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=WC18740311.2.7 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |newspaper=Wanganui Chronicle |volume=XVII |issue=XVII |date=11 March 1874 |page=2}}</ref>

Wanganui's most controversial mayor, by far, was well regarded lawyer [[Charles Mackay (mayor)|Charles MacKay]] who was found guilty of the attempted murder of poet [[Walter D'Arcy Cresswell|D'Arcy Cresswell]] – a charge stemming from an attempt to allegedly blackmail Mayor MacKay for homosexual advances. MacKay was arrested, pleaded guilty and imprisoned. He was released from prison in 1927, travelled to England and became a journalist. He was killed in 1929 during riots in Munich, Germany whilst reporting the civil unrest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Whanganui mayor shoots poet |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/wanganui-mayor-charles-mackay-shoots-poet-darcy-cresswell |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=15 May 2012}}</ref>

Edward Alan Millward OBE was mayor from 1953–1962. He retired in 1962. He was succeeded by Reg Andrews OBE of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]; Andrews retired in 1974.<ref name="Whanganui govt" /> Ron Russell QSO succeeded him and retired in 1983.

The 1983 mayoralty was won by Doug Turney, with [[Chas Poynter]] coming second. Poynter was made deputy mayor in 1983 as a consequence. Poynter had served on the Wanganui council from 1977. In 1986, Poynter challenged Turney and was successful, winning with a majority of 1529 votes.<ref name="Herald obit">{{cite news|title=Former Wanganui mayor Chas Poynter dies|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10458882|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=20 August 2007}}</ref> In 1989, Poynter increased his majority, defeating challenger John Blaikie by almost 6,000 votes. This was the first election under the new local government boundaries with Wanganui City incorporating Wanganui County and some of Waitotara County. Blaikie was the chairman of the Wanganui County Council prior to the reorganisation. The new territorial authority was named Wanganui District Council.

In 1992, Poynter was challenged by Wanganui greengrocer Randhir Dahya, a popular Indian businessman. His majority was cut to just 939 votes.<ref>''Wanganui Chronicle'', 20 October 1992</ref> Dahya challenged him twice more, in 1995 and 1998, but Poynter easily resisted these challenges, assisted by his handling of the [[Moutoa Gardens]] occupation of 1995 and the unfortunate death of his wife, Joy, four months prior to the 1998 election. By 2001, the writing was on the wall and he regained the mayoralty with just 27% of the vote, warding off four councillor challengers. In 2004, he stood again and was defeated, polling third behind media personality [[Michael Laws]] and businessman John Martin with just 20% of the vote.<ref name="Herald obit" />

Laws did not stand again in the [[2010 New Zealand local elections|2010 local elections]], and [[Annette Main]] was elected, to take office in October 2010. Main narrowly defeated [[Dot McKinnon]]<!-- Q92864460 -->, who had been deputy-mayor under Laws.<ref>{{cite news |title=McKinnon ponders life in wake of narrow defeat |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503426&objectid=11005748 |accessdate=2 May 2020 |work=[[Wanganui Chronicle]] |date=11 October 2010}}</ref> Main is the 27th Mayor of Wanganui and the first woman to hold the office.<ref name="Whanganui govt">{{cite web |last=Beaglehole |first=Diana |title=Whanganui region – Government |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/whanganui-region/11 |publisher=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=3 November 2011}}</ref>
