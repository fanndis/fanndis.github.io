'''STX Financing, LLC''', [[doing business as]] '''STX Entertainment''', is a [[Major film studio #Mini-majors|mini-major]] American entertainment and media company that creates, produces, distributes, finances and markets film, television and digital media, which includes live events and virtual reality.

The company was founded in 2014 by film producer [[Robert Simonds]] and [[Bill McGlashan]]. Investors in the company include [[Hony Capital]], [[Tencent]], [[PCCW]], [[TPG Capital|TPG Growth]], [[Liberty Global]] and individual investors including [[Gigi Pritzker]], [[William Wrigley, Jr. II|Beau Wrigley]], and [[Dominic Ng]].<ref>Ryan Faughnder, [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-stx-tencent-20160811-snap-story.html "STX Entertainment secures funding from China's Tencent and PCCW"], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 11, 2016.</ref><ref name="rford">Rebecca Ford, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/showtime-stx-entertainment-announce-tv-764964 "Showtime, STX Entertainment Announce TV Deal and First Four Films"], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', January 20, 2015.</ref><ref name="variety.com">Dave McNary, [https://variety.com/2017/film/news/john-malone-invests-stx-entertainment-through-liberty-global-1202627313/ "'John Malone Invests in STX Entertainment Through Liberty Global"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', November 30, 2017.</ref>

==History==

In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market, and self-distribute star-driven content around the world.<ref name="abusch">Anita Busch, [https://deadline.com/2014/03/bob-simonds-tpg-growths-studio-venture-fully-financed-says-top-jp-morgan-exec-hiring-deals-to-start-in-earnest-698363/ "Is This Hollywood's Next Major Studio?

STX's Board of Directors is composed of investors and industry veterans including Simonds, McGlashan, [[David Bonderman]] (founding partner of [[TPG Capital]]), John Zhao (CEO of [[Hony Capital]]), [[Gigi Pritzker]] (founder of [[MWM Studios]]), Janice Lee (managing director of [[PCCW|PCCW Media Group]]), Tracy Cui (managing director of Hony Capital), [[Frank Biondi]] (former president and CEO of [[Viacom (2005–2019)|Viacom]] and former chairman and CEO of [[Universal Pictures]]), [[Dominic Ng]] (chairman and CEO of [[East West Bank]]), Carmen Chang (chairman and head of Asia for [[New Enterprise Associates]], and Bruce Mann (chief programming officer of [[Liberty Global]]).<ref>David Lieberman, [https://deadline.com/2015/11/stx-entertainment-adds-venture-capitalist-carmen-chang-board-1201605253/ "STX Entertainment Adds Venture Capitalist Carmen Chang To Its Board"], Deadline.com, November 3, 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140310/NEWS07/140319978/gigi-pritzker-investing-in-new-u-s-movie-studio "Gigi Pritzker investing in new U.S. movie studio"], ''[[Crain's Chicago Business]]'', March 10, 2014.</ref><ref name="variety.com"/>

In September 2017, it was reported that STX was close to an [[initial public offering]] on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] (SEHK). While based in the US, the company has numerous corporate and business relationships with China, and it has been reported that a listing on the SEHK could make it easier for Chinese companies to invest in Hollywood films. STX was valued at $1.5 billion in 2016. In September 2017, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' stated that the company could be valued at $3.5 billion, after raising an additional $500 million following the IPO.<ref name="wma">Wayne Ma and Julie Steinberg, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/independent-hollywood-studio-stx-entertainment-plans-hong-kong-ipo-1506536274 "'Bad Moms' Movie Studio Plans Hong Kong IPO"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', September 27, 2017.</ref><ref>Anita Busch, [https://deadline.com/2017/09/stx-entertainment-ipo-hong-kong-stock-exchange-first-quarter-2018-1202178526/ "STX To Launch IPO On Hong Kong Stock Exchange In 2018"], Deadline.com, September 27, 2017.</ref> In April 2018, the company announced it had filed for an IPO on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-stx-hong-kong-20180426-story.html|title=STX Entertainment files for planned IPO in Hong Kong|date=2018-04-26|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>
