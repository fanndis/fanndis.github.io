He is the elder son of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Since birth, he has been second in the [[line of succession to the British throne]].

Born in [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], William was educated at [[Wetherby School]], [[Ludgrove School]] and [[Eton College]].

He served as a full-time pilot with the [[East Anglian Air Ambulance]] from July 2015 for two years. 

William holds patronages within 30 organisations, and undertakes projects through [[The Royal Foundation]], revolving around mental health, conservation, and young people. In December 2014, he founded the "United for Wildlife" initiative, which aims to reduce worldwide illegal wildlife trade. In April 2016, the Cambridges and [[Prince Harry]] initiated the mental health awareness campaign "Heads Together" to encourage people to open up about their [[mental health]] issues. In October 2020, William launched the Earthshot Prize, a £50 million initiative to incentivise environmental solutions over the next decade. 

In 2011, Prince William was made [[Duke of Cambridge]] preceding his [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|marriage]] to [[Catherine Middleton]].

The decision to place William in Eton went against the family tradition of sending royal children to [[Gordonstoun]], which William's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended. Diana's father and brother both attended Eton.<ref name="people1" /> The royal family and the tabloid press agreed William would be allowed to study free from intrusion in exchange for regular updates about his life. [[John Wakeham]], chairman of the [[Press Complaints Commission]], said of the arrangement, "Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero. He is a boy: in the next few years, perhaps the most important and sometimes painful part of his life, he will grow up and become a man."<ref name="people1" />

The Prince's position as second-in-line to the throne and the convention of ministers advising against placing that person into dangerous situations cast doubts on William's chances of seeing combat. These doubts increased after Prince Harry's deployment was cancelled in 2007 due to "specific threats". William, instead, went on to train in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], obtaining his commission as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in the former and [[flying officer]] in the latter—both broadly equivalent to the army rank of lieutenant. After completing his training, William undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force at [[RAF Cranwell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=217 |title=Prince William ready for Search and Rescue role |publisher=meeja.com.au |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019214531/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=217 |archive-date=19 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Pierce">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/4218703/Prince-William-starts-as-a-search-and-rescue-helicopter-pilot.html |title=Prince William starts as a search and rescue helicopter pilot |accessdate=18 January 2009 |last=Pierce |first=Andrew |date=13 January 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412192233/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/4218703/Prince-William-starts-as-a-search-and-rescue-helicopter-pilot.html |archive-date=12 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon completing the course  he was presented with his [[Aircrew brevet|RAF wings]] by his father,<ref name="smh1">{{Cite news |author = Staff |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/kate-watches-william-get-his-wings/2008/04/12/1207856847954.html |title = Kate watches William get his wings |publisher = [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (via [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]) |date = 12 April 2008 |accessdate = 26 July 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054749/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/kate-watches-william-get-his-wings/2008/04/12/1207856847954.html |archive-date = 21 September 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> who had received his own wings after training at Cranwell.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7340692.stm |title=Prince William awarded RAF wings |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726202857/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7340692.stm |archive-date=26 July 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> During this secondment, William flew to Afghanistan in a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17 Globemaster]] that repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7374589.stm |title=William visits Afghanistan troops |work=BBC News |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521024416/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7374589.stm |archive-date=21 May 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> William was then seconded to train with the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7429261.stm |title=William's Navy posting revealed |work=BBC News |date=31 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111230022/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7429261.stm |archive-date=11 January 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> In June 2008, William participated in a £40m drug bust in the Atlantic, north-east of [[Barbados]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Norton-Taylor |first1=Richard |title=Prince William's ship in £40m drugs rai |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jul/03/monarchy.military |accessdate=11 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=2 July 2008}}</ref> He was a part of the crew on the Lynx helicopter, which helped seize 900kg of cocaine from a speedboat.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prince William recalls the time he took part in an R825 million drugs bust |url=https://www.news24.com/channel/gossip/royal-news/prince-william-recalls-the-time-he-took-part-in-an-r825-million-drugs-bust-20201111-2 |accessdate=11 November 2020 |agency=Channel24 |date=11 November 2020}}</ref>

As a [[British prince]], William does not use a surname for everyday purposes. For formal and ceremonial purposes, children of the Prince of Wales use the title "prince" or "princess" before their forename and follow it with their father's territorial designation. Thus, before his marriage, Prince William was styled "Prince William of Wales". Such territorial designations are discarded by women when they marry and by men if they are given a [[peerage]] of their own,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5657.asp |title=Titles and succession: Royal Family name|publisher=Royal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804094423/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5657.asp |archive-date=4 August 2008|accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref> such as when Prince William was given his dukedom.

Although the name of the Royal House is [[House of Windsor|Windsor]], the surname ''[[Mountbatten-Windsor]]'' belongs to all the children and male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and is used, if needed, by those who do not have the style of Royal Highness and the title Prince or Princess;<ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Family Name |url=https://www.royal.uk/royal-family-name |website=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530221439/https://www.royal.uk/royal-family-name |archive-date=30 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> when a female descendant marries, she traditionally takes her husband's surname from that point onward, and their children take their father's. Both Princes William and Harry used ''Wales'' as their surname for military purposes; this continues to be the case for William since his creation as Duke of Cambridge.<ref name="Duke of Cambridge, Flt Lt Wales">{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/working-day-the-life-of-flight-lieutenant-wales |title=A working day in the life of Flight Lieutenant Wales |publisher=[[Clarence House]] |date=20 November 2012 |accessdate=30 January 2013 |quote=The Duke of Cambridge – who is known in his Royal Air Force working life as Flight Lieutenant Wales |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130091753/http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/working-day-the-life-of-flight-lieutenant-wales |archive-date=30 January 2013 }}</ref>

==Ancestry ==
Prince William is a member of the [[House of Windsor]]. [[Patrilineally]], he descends from the [[House of Oldenburg]], one of Europe's oldest royal houses; and more specifically the [[cadet branch]] known as the [[House of Glücksburg]].<ref name="huberty">Huberty, Michel (1994). ''L'Allemagne dynastique''. Volume 7 ("Oldenbourg"). Le Perreux-sur-Marne:  [[Giraud (publishers)|Giraud]]. {{ISBN|2-901138-07-1}}, {{ISBN|978-2-901138-07-5}}.</ref>

Through his mother, William descends from the [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earls Spencer]]—a cadet branch of the [[Spencer family]] descended from the [[Earl of Sunderland|Earls of Sunderland]]; the senior branch are now also [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukes of Marlborough]]; the [[Baron Fermoy|Barons Fermoy]]; and more anciently from [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton]], and [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond]]—two illegitimate sons of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. As king, William would be the first monarch since [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] to descend from [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and the first to descend from Charles II.<ref name="TOI" /><ref name="williamson"/>

William descends [[matrilineally]] from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his eighteenth-century ancestor Theodore Forbes—a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in [[Surat]]. She is variously described in contemporary documents as "a dark-skinned native woman", "an Armenian woman from Bombay", and "Mrs. Forbesian".<ref name="williamson">Williamson, D (1981) "The Ancestry of Lady Diana Spencer".
