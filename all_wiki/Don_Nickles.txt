'''Donald Lee Nickles''' (born December 6, 1948) is an American politician and lobbyist who was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Oklahoma]] from 1981 until 2005. He was considered both a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal]] and [[Social conservatism|social conservative]]. After retiring from the Senate as the longest serving senator from Oklahoma (1981–2005) up until that point, he founded the Nickles Group, a lobbying firm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/nickles-plans-to-launch-lobbying-venture-group/article/2876952|title=Nickles plans to launch lobbying, venture group |work=NewsOK.com |accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Nickles was born and raised in [[Ponca City, Oklahoma|Ponca City]], Oklahoma, the son of Coeweene (Bryan) and Robert C. Nichols.<ref>https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=NI005</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=VwvScLjCam4C&q=Coeweene+Robert+Nichols&dq=Coeweene+Robert+Nichols&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMsvHz6ZTpAhUol3IEHU5fC30Q6AEwAHoECAQQAQ]</ref> He attended Ponca City public schools. To help pay for their education at [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]], he and his wife, the former Linda Lou Morrison, operated Don Nickles Professional Cleaning Service in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]]. He was a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity at [[Oklahoma State University]], and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[business administration]] in 1971.

After college, he went to work for Nickles Machine Corporation in Ponca City, a business started in 1918 by his grandfather, Clair Nickles. He became the company's vice president and general manager. He also served in the [[United States National Guard|Oklahoma National Guard]] from 1970 until 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NI005.html |title=Nickles, Donald Lee|accessdate=July 3, 2008|last=Everett|first=Dianna|work=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture |publisher=[[Oklahoma Historical Society]]}}</ref><ref name=Nickles2004>{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/67thnationalconfdoc7.pdf |title=(speech at) 2004 Annual Dinner Awards|accessdate=July 3, 2008 |last=Nickles|first=Don|date=November 18, 2004|format=PDF|work=Tax Foundation|quote=But we were self-employed and we had a little janitor service.

But we had that when we were going to school and we did quarterly estimated taxes and we were paying 40-some percent with this little janitor service. It was just my wife and I. She quit and it was a real small business. And the government was taking so much.

In 1978, aged 29, his election to the Oklahoma State Senate was the beginning of his career in public office. Two years later,  at the age of 31, he became and remains the youngest Republican ever elected to the U.S. Senate.<ref name=NatBus1989>{{cite news|first=Albert G.|last=Holzinger|author2=Alison A.

==U.S. Senate==

===Tenure===
[[File:President Ronald Reagan walking and talking with republican senator Donald Nickles of Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|right|Nickles with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1986]]
He sponsored legislation to cut taxes, reduce government spending, promote national defense, and reduce what he believed to be official hostility to religion. He sponsored the <!--so-called (yes, like other legislation it has a somewhat silly name)--> [[Defense of Marriage Act]] which allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages conducted in other states.

As Republican Whip, Nickles called for the resignation of fellow Republican [[Trent Lott]] as majority leader after Lott made remarks praising [[Strom Thurmond]] that seemed insensitive to the issue of racial segregation. The National Federation of Independent Business praised Nickles for including in the Senate's 2005 budget a provision that would accelerate by one year a complete repeal of the federal estate tax<ref>{{cite news|title=Nickles' death tax fight hailed|url=http://newsok.com/nickles-death-tax-fight-hailed/article/1892737|accessdate=October 12, 2014|publisher=The Oklahoman|date=March 6, 2004}}</ref>

More legislative stuff, committee assignments, chairmanships (finance, budget) List above requires a little more subtlety.

Nickles was one of many Republican senators who in 1981 called the White House to express his discontent over the nomination of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] of [[Arizona]] to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Nickles said that he and other socially conservative Republican senators would not support O'Connor because of her "presumed unwillingness" to overturn the [[abortion]] decision, ''Roe v. Wade''.<ref>Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court.2007. Penguin Books, pg. 222.</ref>

During a 1986 campaign rally at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] accidentally called him [[Don Rickles]], the American comedian. The president was later told about his mistake and found it very amusing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jim Kuhn|year=2004|title=Ronald Reagan in Private|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|id=1-59523-008-4|page=146}}</ref>

Nickles was one of three Senators to vote against the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1993.<ref>https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&session=1&vote=00232 </ref>

===Leadership===
Nickles quickly rose in the Senate Republican leadership, serving as chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] in the [[101st Congress]]; [[Republican Policy Committee Chairman of the United States Senate|Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee]] in the [[102nd Congress|102nd]], [[103rd Congress|103rd]], and [[104th Congress|104th]] [[Congress of the United States|Congresses]]; and Assistant [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Republican Leader]] from 1996 to 2003. After being term-limited out of the Assistant Leader position, Nickles served in the 108th Congress as chairman of the [[Senate Budget Committee]]. Nickles was also on [[Bob Dole]]'s short list of [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] choices, before Dole finally decided on former [[United States Representative|Congressman]] [[Jack Kemp]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].

In December 2002, Nickles became embroiled in the controversy surrounding Republican Leader [[Trent Lott]]. At Senator [[Strom Thurmond]]'s 100th birthday party, Lott had made comments that some took to be racially insensitive. As the controversy grew, Nickles went on national television and became the first senator in the Republican leadership to say that Lott should step down. Nickles believed that the controversy over Lott's remarks would distract from the Republican legislative agenda, and as he served as Lott's deputy in the Senate this statement was seen as the proverbial "straw that broke the camel's back." Despite many apologies for his remarks, Lott stepped down shortly thereafter. Declining to run for the position of [[Senate Majority Leader]] himself, Lott was succeeded by [[Bill Frist]] of [[Tennessee]].

Nickles was re-elected in 1986, 1992 and 1998 and was the senior senator from Oklahoma from 1994 to 2005.

==Post-Senate career==
On October 7, 2003, he announced that he would not run in the 2004 election.<ref name=NYT2004>{{cite news |first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg|title= Oklahoma Republican Is Retiring From Senate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/08/us/oklahoma-republican-is-retiring-from-senate.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 8, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Republican [[Tom Coburn]] was elected to succeed Nickles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morrison |first1=Sara |title=Tom Coburn Is Retiring From the Senate |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/tom-coburn-retiring-senate/357115/ |website=theatlantic.com |accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>

Nickles went on to found the Nickles Group, a government consulting group in Washington, D.C. He also serves on the board of directors of a number of public companies, such as [[Oklahoma City]]-based [[Chesapeake Energy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/officerProfile?symbol=FIGI.O&officerId=772815|title=Fortress International Group Inc (FIGI.O) Officers|accessdate=July 3, 2008 |work=[[Reuters]]|quote=Donald L. Nickles has been a member of board of directors since February 2005 and currently serves as a member of the board of directors of Chesapeake Energy Corporation and [[Valero Energy Corporation]]. In 2005, after his retirement from the United States Senate, Nickles founded and is currently Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Nickles Group, LLC, a consulting and business venture firm headquartered in Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

Nickles was one of the politicians featured in the film ''[[Traffic (2000 movie)|Traffic]]'', giving his opinion on the war on drugs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richardson |first1=Lisa |title=Left, Right--the Cameos Come From All Sides in ‘Traffic’ |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-07-cl-9257-story.html |website=latimes.com |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref>
