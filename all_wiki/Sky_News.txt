'''Sky News''' is a British [[free-to-air]] television news channel and organisation. Sky News is distributed via a radio news service, and through online channels. It is owned by [[Sky Group]], a division of [[Comcast]]. [[John Ryley]] is the head of Sky News, a role he has held since June 2006. Sky News is currently [[Royal Television Society]] News Channel of the Year, the 12th time it has held the award.<ref name="Sky News">{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/sky-news-wins-rts-news-channel-of-the-year-for-second-time-running-11650362|title=Sky News wins RTS News Channel of the Year for second time running|work=Sky News|access-date=23 April 2019|date=28 February 2019}}</ref> It is a provider of [[live streaming world news]] which can be viewed via its website, [[YouTube]], and various [[mobile devices]] and [[digital media players]]. 

A sister channel, [[Sky News Arabia]], is operated as a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Media Investment Corporation. Another sister channel, [[Sky News Australia]], was part-owned by Sky News parent Sky plc until December 2016. A channel called Sky News International, simulcasting the UK channel directly but without British advertisements, is available in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Asia Pacific, Australia, and the Americas. Narrated segments (which generally cover lighter issues unrelated to current news stories) are played in lieu of advertisements, and international weather forecasts also are given at the end of each half-hour newswheel. Sponsored advertisements are still broadcast before and/or after the sports news and weather segments. [[Sky News Radio]] provides national and international news to [[commercial radio]] and [[community radio]] stations in the UK and  other English-language stations around the world. Sky News also provides content to [[Yahoo! News]]. The channel is available on [[Apple TV]], [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Roku]], [[YouTube]], and [[Pluto TV]].

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of Sky News}}

===Establishment and early years===
On 8 June 1988, [[Rupert Murdoch]] announced plans to start a new television news service in a speech to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]. Sky News started broadcasting at 6&nbsp;pm on 5 February 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://successstory.com/companies/sky-news|title=Sky News Success Story|website=www.successstory.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>

{{quote|Visually Sky News looked very neat, with slick and classy presentation and John O'Loan's original vocation as an architect showing in the studio set. Sky had gone for the same format as the [[BBC Nine O'Clock News|Nine O'Clock News]] on the [[BBC]], which had recently been redesigned to give the impression of activity and immediacy by placing the newsreader against a backdrop of the working newsroom. Sky News, it was universally agreed as staff nodded in vigorous approval, had succeeded rather better at the same thing. The critics were mildly taken aback. Contrary to some of the horror scenarios bandied about by the chattering classes there seemed to be little to grumble about. And as its slogan of 'We're there when you need us,' emphasised, it was always on.}}

In the early days, the channel operated on a £40&nbsp;million budget (plus £10&nbsp;million share of overheads), which led [[Sam Chisholm]], chief executive of the newly merged BSkyB to suggest to Murdoch that the station be closed, but Murdoch was "pleased with its achievements ... there were overriding reasons of prestige and politics for keeping it ... the final hurdle of the Broadcasting Bill had still to be overcome and the case for the acceptability of Sky would collapse if suddenly there was no news channel."<ref>{{cite book |title=Dished! The Rise and Fall of British Satellite Broadcasting |page=262 |isbn=9780671710774 |last1=Chippindale |first1=Peter |first2=Suzanne |last2=Franks |chapter=Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1991}}</ref> – former deputy Prime Minister [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|William Whitelaw]] said in the House of Lords in 1990 that Sky News had "a very high reputation ... I admire it, as do many other people, it will certainly waken up both the BBC and ITN and ensure that they compete with what is a very important news service". The channel has never been run for a profit,<ref>{{cite news|title=Touch down for Sky|work=BBC News|date=7 January 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1742197.stm|accessdate=29 January 2007}}</ref> and has considered using ITN to supplement the service.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

By March 1992, Sky News' parent company turned from loss to profit.<ref name="newsjournalisminuk">{{cite book|title=News and Journalism in the UK (Communication and Society) |page=124|author=McNair, Brian|isbn=978-0-415-41072-4|year=2009}}</ref> On the channel's growth, Murdoch said at that time: "Sky News, has quietly, if expensively, become the first building block of what we envision will become the premier worldwide electronic news-gathering network anywhere. Ask anyone in Europe, and particularly the BBC and you will be told that Sky News has added a new and better dimension to television journalism."

Sky News was the UK's first 24-hour news channel, broadcast on [[Astra 1A]]. It had no local competition until November 1997, when [[BBC News]] launched a new 24-hour channel, BBC News 24, now known simply as [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]]. In September 1999, the [[European Commission]] ruled against a Sky News complaint, which argued that the publicly funded BBC News 24 was unfair and illegal under [[European Union|EU]] law. The EC ruled that the [[television licence fee]] ''should'' be considered state aid (within the meaning of Article 87), but that the BBC's public service remit justified the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/community_law/state_aids/comp-1998/nn088-98.pdf|title=SG(99) D10201 – State aid No NN 88/98–UNITED KINGDOM Financing of a 24-hour advertising-free news channel out of the licence fee by the BBC|accessdate=23 May 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Sky News since 2000===
[[File:Sky News 2015 Logo.svg|right|thumb|Former Sky News logo used until 2018]]
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2016}}
In March 2000 '''Sky News Active''' was launched, a 24-hour interactive service providing headlines (and other services which ranged from weather, the top story of the day and showbiz) on demand.

In March 2004, Sky News was announced to have won a five-year contract to supply news bulletins to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], taking over from [[ITN]] in January 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3546373.stm|title=Five to take Sky News bulletins|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=4 January 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref>

On 24 October 2005, Sky News moved to new studios in [[Isleworth]], Greater London, and underwent a major on-screen revamp. The new studio was integrated with the newsroom and boasted the biggest video wall in Britain; it was designed by New York architects [[Janson Design Group]].<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news |author=Owen Gibson |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/oct/21/broadcasting.bskyb |title=Sky News unveils new studios and beefed up schedule |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=21 October 2005 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> New music was scored by Adelphoi Music and recorded with a full orchestra at Air Studios, [[Hampstead]], and mastered at Metropolis Studios.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelphoimusic.com/|title=Adelphoi Music – Music Composition and Sound Design|publisher=}}</ref> New on-screen graphics were launched and the channel began broadcasting in [[widescreen]] ([[16:9]]) format.

The 2005 relaunch also had the introduction of a new schedule designed around "appointment to view" programmes rather than continuous rolling news.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> [[James Rubin]] joined to present a new evening programme called ''World News Tonight'', [[Julie Etchingham]] presented another new "hard-hitting" evening show called ''[[The Sky Report]]'', [[Eamonn Holmes]] joined to present ''[[Sky News Sunrise|Sunrise]]'', [[Kay Burley]] presented a new programme called ''[[Lunchtime Live]]'' from 12 to 2&nbsp;pm, and the daytime show ''[[Sky News Today]]'' had the introduction of a three-presenter format. However, the relaunched schedule was unsuccessful, and from October 2005, the BBC News channel overtook Sky News in the ratings.

In response to the schedule's unpopularity with viewers,     July 2006 saw the removal of the evening programmes--which were replaced by rolling news and an interactive programme, ''[[Sky News with Martin Stanford]]'', and the return to a two-presenter format on ''Sky News Today''. These changes came with the arrival of John Ryley, who is still the head of Sky News. On 1 October 2007, Sky introduced another new schedule, extending Kay Burley's ''Lunchtime Live'' programme and renaming it ''Afternoon Live''. It also switched to a new format for much of the day, with a solo lead presenter and a summary newsreader. Sky News put more emphasis on interactive news with [[Martin Stanford]]'s new ''[[SkyNews.com]]'' programme; an early evening financial news programme presented by [[Jeff Randall (journalist)|Jeff Randall]], was also introduced, initially on Mondays only. Further changes were made to the Sky News schedule on 8 September 2008, with [[Colin Brazier]] presenting a new show from 1 – 2&nbsp;pm, ''[[The Live Desk (Sky)|The Live Desk]]'', and Martin Stanford's ''Sky.com News'' became ''SkyNews.com'', moving to 7&nbsp;pm every weeknight.  More changes took place during the early part of 2009. These changes involved major changes to the layout of the newsroom/studio, the introduction of a morning edition of ''The Live Desk'' and the extension of the financial news programme ''[[Jeff Randall Live]]'' to run for four nights each week, Monday to Thursday.

From 6&nbsp;am to midnight on 8 March 2010, Sky News was presented and produced exclusively by women to mark [[International Women's Day]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skypressoffice.co.uk/SkyNews/Resources/showarticle.asp?id=2932 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052418/http://www.skypressoffice.co.uk/SkyNews/Resources/showarticle.asp?id=2932 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This exercise was repeated in 2011 and 2012.

In preparation for the start of high-definition broadcasting, Sky News moved to its second studio (Studio B) on the morning of 30 March 2010. Broadcasting from Studio B continued until 9&nbsp;pm on 6 May, when it moved back to the main newsroom and launched Sky News HD in time for the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] results. Sky News received a graphics refresh and a new logo to coincide with the launch of the new HD channel – this was tried out during the soft launch for Sky News HD on 22 April; Sky News' distinctive orchestral theme music, in use since 2005, was also updated on 6 May 2010.  The new title music, orchestrated by [[David Arnold (conductor)|David Arnold]], was recorded with a 60-piece [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in [[Angel Recording Studios]], London, and uses more than 132 [[audio channel]]s for 18 seconds of sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidarnoldmusic.com/sky-news-hd/ |title=Recording the SKY News HD Theme at Angel Studios |publisher=Davidarnoldmusic.com |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>

Following the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Sky News was rebranded, with a new top-of-the-hour sequence and on-screen graphics. The traditional opening voiceover, read by Bruce Hammal, was dropped after two decades in use. On 24 October 2016, Sky News began broadcasting from a new studio (Studio 21) at Sky Central, Sky's new headquarters in West London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnewsroom.site/sky-news/sky-central-now-open-145750/|title=Sky Central now open..|date=18 July 2016|access-date=28 July 2016}}</ref> The "glass box" studio was initially used for broadcasts from 6&nbsp;am to 6.30&nbsp;pm each weekday (with the exception of All Out Politics, which comes from Sky's Westminster studio) - as of April 2019 it is now only used from 11&nbsp;am to 7&nbsp;pm, and 9&nbsp;pm to 12&nbsp;am. The schedule was also changed.

In January 2017, Sky moved its business operations into [[The News Building (London)|the News Building]] in central London.<ref>{{Cite press release|date=7 November 2016|url=https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2016/sky_news_to_open_new_business_studio_at_the_baby_shard|title=Sky News to open new business studio at the 'Baby Shard'|work=Sky TV|accessdate=5 January 2017}}</ref>  On 16 January 2018, Sky moved all its news operations over to Studio 21, "the glass box", and a new studio in [[Sky Campus|Sky Studios]].

=== Acquisition by Comcast ===
On 9 December 2016, Sky shareholder [[21st Century Fox]] announced that it had made an offer to acquire the remainder of the company for £11.7&nbsp;billion.<ref name="bloomberg-foxtakeover">{{cite web|title=21st Century Fox Agrees to Buy Sky|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-09/fox-in-preliminary-deal-to-acquire-sky-for-10-75-pounds-a-share|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="bbc-sky21cf">{{cite web|title=Sky and 21st Century Fox agree £18.5bn takeover deal|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38326530|website=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> The combination of Sky with Fox's other assets led to concerns that the [[Murdoch family]] would attain "material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms" and "increased influence over the UK news agenda and the political process". Concerns were also raised about recent [[Fox_News#Sexual_harassment|sexual harassment allegations]] centered upon Fox's U.S. network [[Fox News Channel]], although Ofcom did deem 21st Century Fox to be "fit and proper" to hold broadcast licences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox News Scandals, Political Influence Concerns Cast Long Shadow Over Sky Review|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fox-news-sexual-harassment-sky-21st-century-fox-1202482623/|website=Variety|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="guardian-bradley">{{cite web|title=Murdoch's Sky bid likely to be referred to competition authorities|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/29/rupert-murdoch-sky-takeover-bid-referred-to-competition-authorites|work=The Guardian|date=29 June 2017|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref><ref name="nyt-foxreview">{{cite web|title=Major Setback for Murdoch in $15 Billion Sky Takeover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/business/media/sky-21st-century-fox.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> On 14 December 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] in turn announced its intent to [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire 21st Century Fox]], following the divestiture of certain assets (particularly the U.S. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] proper). Analysts felt that would ease regulatory tensions surrounding the Fox purchase of Sky, as Sky was to be included in the purchase, and Disney's scope of media ownership in the UK was not as wide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/disney-fox-deal-sky-deal-still-on-the-table-expected-to-close-june-2018-1202226861/|title=Disney-Fox Deal: Sky Deal Still On The Table, Expected To Close By June 2018|last=White|first=Peter|date=14 December 2017|work=Deadline|access-date=14 December 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> 

In January 2018, the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] issued a preliminary report recommending that Sky News be insulated from the remainder of Murdoch's assets, or divested, in order to preserve its editorial independence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/23/rupert-murdoch-sky-bid-blocked-21st-century-fox-cma|title=Rupert Murdoch's Sky bid is not in public interest, says regulator|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=23 January 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref> The following month, Fox proposed a commitment to funding Sky News for 10 years, and the establishment of an independent editorial board.

On 5 June 2018, [[Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Matt Hancock]] cleared Fox's proposed deal, contingent on the divestiture of Sky News. It also cleared counteroffers for Sky that were being made in a [[bidding war]] by U.S. telecoms and media conglomerate [[Comcast]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44373621|title=Sky bid battle looms after government nod|date=5 June 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=5 June 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Szalai |first1=Georg |title=U.K. Approves Fox's Sky Bid, Subject to Sale of Sky News, and Clears Comcast Offer |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/uk-approves-foxs-sky-bid-subject-sale-sky-news-clears-comcast-offer-1115661 |accessdate=5 June 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> Comcast made a US$65 billion counter-offer to acquire the 21st Century Fox assets being sold to Disney.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17457244/comcast-21st-century-fox-film-tv-studios-acquisition-deal-announced|title=Comcast makes $65 billion offer to steal 21st Century Fox away from Disney|work=The Verge|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> Fox rejected the offer, in favour of a higher-valued offer from Disney.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fox-disney-announce-new-deal-1529496937|title=21st Century Fox Agrees to Higher Offer From Disney|last=Hagey|first=Keach|date=21 June 2018|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=26 June 2018|last2=Schwartzel|first2=Erich|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Comcast subsequently pursued a counter-offer for Sky only, resulting in the [[Panel on Takeovers and Mergers]] ordering that a [[First-price sealed-bid auction|blind auction]] be held between Comcast and Fox.

In 2007, BSkyB announced its intention to cease broadcasting Sky News, as well as other BSkyB channels over Freeview pending [[Ofcom]] approval.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2080022,00.html|title=Ofcom looks into Sky News move|accessdate=16 May 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=15 May 2007|first=Mark|last=Sweney}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6343715.stm|title=Sky's top shows to go terrestrial|accessdate=16 May 2007 |work=BBC News|date=8 February 2007}}</ref>

{{More citations needed section|date=September 2016}}
Sky News is also available internationally on cable systems, on satellite, and in some hotels. While the UK feed is broadcast in 16:9, the international version remained broadcast in a 4:3 picture format until August 2010.

The international version is shown as free-to-air on [[Astra (satellite)|Astra 1L]] at 19.2° east. It is also carried encrypted on a number of satellites for international reception, including [[Hot Bird]], [[Nilesat]], Amos 1, and [[Intelsat]] 10-02. It is also usually carried on cable systems in Europe, particularly in Northern Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries.

International viewers receive the same programming line-up of Sky News as the UK version. Brief news stories, entertainment news, worldwide weather forecast summaries, and the front pages of international newspapers are broadcast in lieu of UK commercials.  The timepiece on the lower left side of the ticker is covered with a banner that says "skynews.com".

Sky News is not available on [[Sky Deutschland]], Sky plc's offering in Germany, but is available on [[Sky Italia]].

On 19 June 2013, Sky News International was added to [[Apple TV]] for users in the UK, Ireland, and the United States.

===Previous partnership with CBS News===
Until 2017, Sky News had a resource-sharing agreement with [[CBS News]] in the United States to share footage and reporting. In July 2017, in the wake of Sky's pending takeover by [[21st Century Fox]] (which runs the competing and ''de facto'' sister [[Fox News Channel]] in the U.S.), and [[NBC News]] acquiring a stake in [[Euronews]], CBS ended the agreement and entered into a similar deal with the BBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cbs-news-bbc-strike-content-sharing-partnership-1020724|title=CBS News, BBC Strike Content Sharing Partnership|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=13 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Beginning in early 2008, Sky News began using HD-capable cameras in the field. Some one-off programmes were made available in HD to [[Sky+ HD]] subscribers on [[On Demand (Sky)|Sky On Demand]]. The programmes included ''Technofile'', ''Diana: The Final Word'', ''Canoe Man: Rise and Fall of John Darwin'', and ''Pathfinders: Into The Heart Of Afghanistan''.

On 20 January 2009, before the launch of the Sky News HD channel, [[Sky Arts]] broadcast Sky News coverage in HD of the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration of Barack Obama]]. [[Jeremy Thompson]] fronted the coverage from Washington, D.C. [[Michael Jackson]]'s memorial service was also broadcast in HD, with Kay Burley presenting.

Sky News moved operations to a [[Chroma key|chroma-key]] set in Studio B from 30 March 2010, so  final preparations for HD could take place in the main newsroom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skynewselectionmagazine.com/1I4bbaf8743d3ef012.cde |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409125920/http://skynewselectionmagazine.com/1I4bbaf8743d3ef012.cde |archivedate=9 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The first live broadcast of Sky News HD, on Sky Channel 517, was the channel's election debate, which was held on 22 April 2010. For the 10 days leading up to the debate, channel 517 displayed a countdown clock to launch. The debate was hosted in HD by [[Kay Burley]] and [[Adam Boulton]]. Following the end of the coverage for the evening, channel 517 moved to show a looping preview tape. The tape included the HD, which were available on Sky Anytime. The loop continued until Sky News HD was launched on the evening of 6 May 2010, coinciding with the coverage of the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] results, hosted by Adam Boulton.

On 26 July 2010, Sky News HD launched on the [[OSN]] Network, broadcasting to the Middle East and Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/593602-sky-news-joins-hd-offering-on-osn |title=Sky News joins HD offering on Orbit Showtime |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>

===Sky News Brexit-Free===
From 16 October to 1 November 2019, Sky News ran a pop-up channel called '''Sky News Brexit-Free'''. The channel aired on weekdays from 17:00 to 22:00, and carried coverage of other news headlines unrelated to [[Brexit|the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union]]. Sky News head John Ryley cited viewer fatigue over the near-constant coverage of Brexit as justification for the channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rxtvlog.com/2019/11/sky-news-brexit-free-closes-down.html|title=Sky News Brexit-Free closes down|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/pa7v58/sky-news-brexit-free-tv-channel-news-fatigue|title=The Brexit-Free TV Channel Is Meant to Solve News Fatigue – It Made Mine Worse|last=|first=|date=2019-10-22|website=Vice|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>

In early 1994 [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], former editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, was appointed managing director of BSkyB, Sky News's parent company at the time. MacKenzie's proposed changes to Sky News led to clashes with CEO Sam Chisholm and the head of Sky News, Ian Frykberg, who protested at what they saw as an attempt to take the channel's news values downmarket. The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with [[Philip Antony Fyson Buck|Lady Bienvenida Buck]]. Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards.

==Fabrication==
In April 2003, Sky News carried a report from James Forlong aboard the [[United Kingdom|British]] nuclear [[submarine]] [[HMS Splendid|HMS ''Splendid'']] purportedly showing a live firing of a cruise missile during the Iraq war. The report was a fabrication, with the crew acting along for the benefit of the cameras. The ''Sky News'' team did not accompany the submarine when it left port and the scenes were actually recorded whilst the vessel was docked. The shot of the missile launch had been obtained from stock footage.

The faked report was revealed because another film crew did accompany the vessel to sea, and its footage showed that a modern missile is not launched by a crew member pressing a red button marked with the word "FIRE", as had been portrayed in the Sky News report, but is actually launched with a left mouse click. When the fabrication was exposed, Forlong and his producer were suspended. The next day, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Forlong had resigned following an internal investigation.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jason Deans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/18/iraqandthemedia.tvnews |title=Sky News reporter quits over bogus Iraq story &#124; Media |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}</ref> In a follow-up article, ''The Guardian'' speculated on the long-term effects on Sky News credibility.<ref>{{cite news | title = The backfiring missile | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 21 July 2003 | url = http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1002105,00.html | accessdate=2008-10-11 | location=London | first=Matt | last=Wells}}</ref> In October 2003, Forlong was found dead by his wife after committing suicide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3168220.stm |title=UK &#124; War reporter found dead |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-06 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}</ref> In December, Sky News was fined £50,000 by the [[Independent Television Commission]] for breaching accuracy regulations.<ref>{{cite news | title = Sky fined £50,000 over war report | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 16 December 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3324281.stm | accessdate = 2008-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/nov/19/1|title=MediaGuardian Briefing: November 19|date=19 November 2003|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

In August 2016 Sky News was criticised after allegedly paying €2,000 to a group of Romanians to pretend they were part of an eastern European gang selling guns to terrorists in Syria. The Romanians were arrested by Romanian [[DIICOT]] and confessed that they were paid by Sky News journalist [[Stuart Ramsay]] to pretend they were gun traffickers. The guns featured in the report were legally owned and were hunting weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-21216320-barbatul-care-inlesnit-intalnirea-dintre-jurnalistii-sky-news-presupusii-traficanti-arme-fost-pacalit-spus-este-documentar.htm|title=Barbatul care a inlesnit intalnirea dintre jurnalistii Sky News si presupusii traficanti de arme: Am fost pacalit, mi-au spus ca este un documentar|access-date=10 August 2016|date=2016-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2016/08/10/sky-news-journalists-intermediary-these-people-tricked-me-they-said-it-was-a-documentary-17-57-13|title=Sky News journalists' intermediary: These people tricked me; they said it was a documentary – AGERPRES|website=www.agerpres.ro|access-date=10 August 2016}}</ref> Sky News has said it stands by the story.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/19/romanian-investigators-charge-british-journalists-with-spreading/|title=Romanian investigators accuse British journalists of fabricating arms trading investigation|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=27 October 2016|date=2016-08-19|last1=Day|first1=Matthew}}</ref>

==Legal cases==
* November 2008 – BSkyB paid substantial undisclosed libel damages to [[Robert Murat]] in relation to their reporting of the abduction of [[Madeleine McCann]]. Sky News had falsely suggested that Murat, who was assisting in the search of McCann, had acted like child murderer [[Ian Huntley]] following McCann's disappearance. Sky News also falsely accused Murat of misleading journalists into thinking he was working for the police. An apology was also placed on the Sky News website, the libellous material removed and Murat's costs were paid.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/3458813/Madeleine-McCann-Robert-Murat-accepts-libel-damages-from-BSkyB.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Madeleine McCann: Robert Murat accepts libel damages from BSkyB | date=14 November 2008}}</ref>
* November 2010 – the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], [[Dominic Grieve]] [[QC]], was given the right to launch [[contempt of court]] proceedings against Sky News over the broadcaster's alleged breach of a media injunction. It was in relation to the reporting of the story of [[Foreign hostages in Somalia|Paul and Rachel Chandler]], a Kent couple who were held captive by [[Piracy off the coast of Somalia|Somali pirates]] for 13 months. The media was blocked from publishing details of the couple's "health and welfare" prior to their being freed on 14 November 2010. Sky claims that it "scrupulously observed the terms of the injunction", but also admitted that it "followed the spirit, if not the letter" of the order. At the time, lawyers representing the Chandlers obtained the court order over fears that their lives could be put in danger by the media reporting their capture. Sky News was alleged to have breached the injunction on the day of their release around from Somalia, leading the Attorney General to seek permission at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to bring contempt proceedings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a352022/sky-news-facing-contempt-case-over-kidnap-report.html |location=London |work=Digital Spy |title=Sky News facing contempt case over kidnap report |date=21 November 2011<!--, 12:32 GMT-->}}</ref> The Attorney General dropped the case in January 2012; a spokesperson for his office said that continuing with proceedings would no longer be in the public interest.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16584767 |title=Sky News contempt action dropped |date=16 October 2017 |publisher= |via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News }}</ref>
* March 2013 – Sky News journalist Mark Stone and his camera operator were detained in [[Tiananmen Square]] live on British television, in what he described as a surreal but telling episode about reporting in [[China]]. Viewers saw Stone being directed into a police van live from [[Beijing]]. The square is a popular tourist site near the regime's nerve centre and the scene of 1989 democracy protests that were crushed by the Chinese authorities. A police officer was filmed asking the Sky team to switch off their camera, saying they were now inside the [[Forbidden City]] and did not have permission to film there. While they had permission to film in the square, Stone said police told him the team were not displaying their passes correctly, and noted he was not carrying his passport as required. China's foreign ministry insists that press censorship does not exist in the country, but journalists report the constant threat of interference from government officials.

The site underwent a further refresh in 2012, when both the look of the pages and the content management system were updated.

==Virgin Media dispute==
[[File:Sky News Virgin EPG.jpg|thumb|Virgin Media's Electronic Program Guide contents after Virgin Media's contract to carry Sky News expired.]]

Sky News, and the other Sky channels that had been removed, reappeared on Virgin Media on 13 November 2008.{{fact|date=August 2020}}
