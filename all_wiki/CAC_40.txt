The '''CAC 40''' ({{lang-fr|CAC quarante}} {{IPA-fr|kak kaʁɑ̃t|}}) (''Cotation Assistée en Continu'') is a benchmark French [[stock market index]]. The index represents a capitalization-weighted measure of the 40 most significant stocks among the 100 largest [[market capitalization|market caps]] on the [[Euronext Paris]] (formerly the [[Paris Bourse]]). It is one of the main national indices of the pan-European stock exchange group [[Euronext]] alongside [[Brussels]]' [[BEL20]], [[Lisbon]]'s [[PSI-20]] and [[Amsterdam]]'s [[AEX index|AEX]].

==History==
The CAC 40 takes its name from the [[Paris Bourse]]'s early automation system '''[[Cotation Assistée en Continu]]''' (''Continuous Assisted Quotation''). Its base value of 1,000 was set on 31 December 1987, equivalent to a market capitalisation of 370,437,433,957.70 [[French franc]]s.<ref name="profile">{{cite web

==Rules==

===Selection===
The CAC 40 index composition is reviewed quarterly by an independent Index Steering Committee ({{lang-fr|Conseil Scientifique}}).<ref name="profile" /> If any changes are made, they are
effected a minimum of two weeks after the review meeting.<ref name="profile" /> At each review date, the companies listed on Euronext Paris are ranked according to [[Float (finance)|free float]] [[Market capitalization|market capitalisation]] and [[stock|share]] turnover over the prior 12 months.<ref name="rules">{{cite web

}}</ref> From the top 100 companies in this ranking, forty are chosen to enter the CAC 40 such that it is "a relevant benchmark for [[Investment management|portfolio management]]" and "a suitable underlying asset for [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] products".<ref name="rules" /> If a company has more than one class of shares traded on the exchange, only the most actively traded of these will be accepted into the index (generally this will be the ordinary share).<ref name="rules" />

===Weighting===
The CAC 40 is a [[capitalization-weighted index]]. The number of shares issued (used to calculate the market cap and hence the index weight) of a company is reviewed quarterly, on the third Friday of March, June, September and December.<ref name="profile" /> Since December 2003, the index weightings of companies in the index have been capped at 15% at each quarterly index review,<ref name="rules" /> but these range freely with [[share price]] subsequently. A capping factor is used to limit the weights to 15% (if necessary), and is reviewed annually by the Index Steering Committee on the third Friday of September.<ref name="rules" />

===Calculation===
The index value I of the CAC 40 index is calculated using the following formula:<ref name="rules" />
<math> I_t = 1000\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Q_{i,t}\,F_{i,t}\,f_{i,t}\,C_{i,t}\,}{K_t\,\sum_{i=1}^N Q_{i,0}\,C_{i,0}\,} </math>
with ''t'' the day of calculation; ''N'' the number of constituent shares in the index (usually 40); ''Q<sub>i,t</sub>'' the number of shares of company ''i'' on day ''t''; ''F<sub>i,t</sub>'' the free float factor of share ''i''; ''f<sub>i,t</sub>'' the capping factor of share ''i'' (exactly 1 for all companies not subject to the 15% cap); ''C<sub>i,t</sub>'' the price of share ''i'' on day ''t''; ''Q<sub>i,0</sub>'' the number of shares of company ''i'' on the index base date; ''C<sub>i,0</sub>'' the price of equity ''i'' on the index base date; and ''K<sub>t</sub>'' the "adjustment coefficient for base capitalization" on day ''t'' (reflecting the switch from the French franc to the [[Euro]] in 1999).

==Holders==
Although the CAC 40 is almost exclusively composed of French-domiciled companies, about 45% of its listed shares are owned by foreign investors, more than any other main European index.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chirac |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Chirac |url=http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/European-Council-Press-conference.html |title=Press conference given by M. Jacques Chirac, President of the Republic, following the European Council (excerpts) |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620140510/http://ambafrance-uk.org/European-Council-Press-conference.html# |archive-date=20 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> German, Japanese, American and British investors are amongst the most significant holders of CAC 40 shares. This large percentage is due to the fact that CAC 40 companies are more international, or [[Multinational corporation|multinational]], than any other European market. CAC 40 companies conduct over two-thirds of their business and employ over two-thirds of their [[workforce]] outside France.<ref>{{cite web
