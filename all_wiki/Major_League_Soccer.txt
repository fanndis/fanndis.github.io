==History==
{{main|History of Major League Soccer}}

{{see also|Soccer in Canada|Soccer in the United States}}
Major League Soccer is the most recent of a series of men's premier professional national [[soccer]] leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of MLS was the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL), which existed from 1968 until 1984.<ref>{{Cite web |title=By The Numbers… North American Soccer League vs Major League Soccer |url=http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212061104/http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2013/02/by-the-numbers-north-american-soccer-league-vs-major-league-soccer.html |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref>

In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[U.S. Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] promised to establish a Division 1 professional soccer league.<ref name="leagle.com">{{Cite web |title=FRASER v.

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Resurgence and Expansion of the MLS |url=https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/ |date=November 25, 2013 |website=Soccer Politics / The Politics of Football |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209173530/https://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/world-cup-2014/usa-soccer-and-world-cup-2014/resurgence-and-expansion-of-the-mls/ |archive-date=December 9, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2014 }}</ref> The league's low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large [[American football]] stadiums.<ref name="Last Word On Sports" />
One aspect that had alienated fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to "Americanize" the sport. The league implemented the use of [[Penalty shootout (association football)|shootouts]] to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 0:00.

In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', that the players had filed in 1996.

MLS underwent a transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent European leagues.

The league's financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific stadiums.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]], so that by the end of 2008, a majority of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.<ref name="Last Word On Sports" />

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998.

In the single-entity business structure, club operators own a financial stake in the League, not just their individual team.}}</ref> In order to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead of players contracting with individual teams. In ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'', a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services.<ref name=fraser /> The court also ruled that even absent their [[collective bargaining agreement]], players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.<ref name=fraser />

Having multiple clubs operated by a single investor was a necessity in the league's first ten years.<ref name="latimes2006" /> At one time [[Phil Anschutz]]'s AEG operated six MLS franchises and [[Lamar Hunt]]'s Hunt Sports three franchises. In order to attract additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and increase the incentives to be an individual club operator.<ref name="Contraction">{{Cite web |title=Major League Soccer Announces Elimination of Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami Fusion for 2002 Season |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/08/major-league-soccer-announces-elimination-of-tampa-bay-mutiny-and-miami-fusion-for-2002-season |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082916/http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/12/08/major-league-soccer-announces-elimination-of-tampa-bay-mutiny-and-miami-fusion-for-2002-season |archive-date=August 19, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> These changes included granting operators the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits of [[Soccer United Marketing]], and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.<ref name="Contraction" />

MLS salaries are limited by a [[Salary cap#Major League Soccer|salary cap]], which MLS has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending on player salaries and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams.<ref name="leagle.com" /> The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the ''[[Fraser v. Major League Soccer]]'' lawsuit. The 2017 salary cap increased to $3.845 million per team.<ref name="Major League Soccer" /><ref name=pressbox2015/>

Teams may augment their squads by signing players from other leagues. MLS has two [[transfer window]]s—the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August.<ref name="Roster Rules and Regulations">{{Cite web |title=Roster Rules and Regulations |url=http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920193128/http://pressbox.mlssoccer.com/content/roster-rules-and-regulations |archive-date=September 20, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref> When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining from 33% to 75% depending on the player's status and tenure.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Goff |first=Steve |date=August 2, 2016 |title=Israeli club ups offer for D.C.

MLS teams have a limited number of [[MLS International Roster Slots|international roster slots]] that they can use to sign non-domestic players. However, MLS teams often obtain green cards for their non-domestic players in order to qualify them for domestic status and thus free up international roster slots.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ASN article: MLS Allure: Why Wages Are Only Part of the Story |url=http://americansoccernow.com/articles/mls-allure-why-wages-are-only-part-of-the-story |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916192944/http://americansoccernow.com/articles/mls-allure-why-wages-are-only-part-of-the-story |archive-date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=September 15, 2015}}</ref> In 2015, 49% of MLS players were born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Recent analysis of foreign player pool in MLS reveals interesting numbers |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/sideline/news/article/2015/09/10/recent-analysis-foreign-player-pool-mls-reveals-interesting-numbers |date=September 10, 2015 |website=MLSsoccer.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912153409/http://www.mlssoccer.com/sideline/news/article/2015/09/10/recent-analysis-foreign-player-pool-mls-reveals-interesting-numbers |archive-date=September 12, 2015 |access-date=September 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MLS remains most diverse professional sports league in North America |url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2015/04/mls-remains-most-diverse-professional-sports-league-north-america |date=April 23, 2015 |website=LA Galaxy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222317/http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2015/04/mls-remains-most-diverse-professional-sports-league-north-america |archive-date=April 25, 2015 |access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>

====Designated Players and TAM====
MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about an increase in on-field competition.<ref name="monstersandcritics.com">{{Cite news |last=Martin |first=Pat |date=May 4, 2007 |title=MLS comes out of the gates strong in '07 |publisher=monstersandcritics.com |url=http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=soc-mls/misc/mls_features_archive/mls_features_archive_050407.htm |url-status=dead |access-date=August 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524072946/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=soc-mls%2Fmisc%2Fmls_features_archive%2Fmls_features_archive_050407.htm |archive-date=May 24, 2015}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

The [[Designated Player Rule|designated player (DP) rule]] allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the maximum cap; in 2017, each DP player only counted as $480,625 (the maximum non-DP salary) against the cap. Instituted in 2007, England's [[David Beckham]] was the first signing under the DP rule.<ref name="forbes-2014-09" /> The DP rule has led to large income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more than a player earning the league minimum.<ref name="2014-salaries-mlsplayers">{{Cite web |title=2014 MLS Player Salaries: April 1, 2014: By Club |url=http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201,%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf |date=April 2, 2014 |publisher=Major League Soccer Players Union |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618064130/http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/April%201%2C%202014%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf |archive-date=June 18, 2015 |access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> In the 2013 season, 21% of the league's wage spending went to just 5 players; this stretched to 29% on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reese |first=Bill |date=January 30, 2014 |title=A Look at Income Inequality in MLS |work=Empire of Soccer |url=http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/ |url-status=live |access-date=August 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726234141/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/look-income-inequality-22820/ |archive-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=2014 MLS Salaries Visualized |url=http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/ |last=Fenn |first=Steve |date=April 11, 2014 |publisher=StatHunting |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712170437/http://www.stathunting.com/2014/04/11/mls-salaries-visualized/ |archive-date=July 12, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2019}}

The league's "Core Players" initiative allows teams to re-sign players using retention funds that do not count against the salary cap.<ref name="mlssoccer.com" /> Retention funds were implemented in 2013 as a mechanism for MLS to retain key players; among the first high-profile players re-signed using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars [[Graham Zusi]] and [[Matt Besler]].<ref name="mlssoccer.com" /> MLS teams can also obtain [[allocation money]], which is money that the team can use on player salaries that does not count against the cap, and teams can earn allocation money in several ways, such as from the transfer fees earned by selling players to teams in other leagues.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The great allocation money chase |url=http://www.phillysoccerpage.net/2012/06/26/the-great-allocation-money-chase/ |date=June 26, 2012 |website=The Philly Soccer Page |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717212245/http://www.phillysoccerpage.net/2012/06/26/the-great-allocation-money-chase/ |archive-date=July 17, 2014 |access-date=September 25, 2014}}</ref> MLS teams can also use Targeted Allocation Money (often referred to as TAM), an initiative announced in 2015.

The development of additional MLS stadiums has continued to progress.  D.C. United had played their home games at former NFL and Major League Baseball venue [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]]. In 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private partnership term sheet to build a new soccer stadium in Washington, D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014. In late February 2017,  D.C. United finally broke ground on their new stadium, [[Audi Field]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Goff |first=Steven |date=December 17, 2014 |title=D.C.

Two teams have announced their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. New York City FC play home games at [[Yankee Stadium]], a Major League Baseball venue, although they intend to move into a soccer-specific stadium in the future.

In early 2005, MLS signed a 10-year, $150&nbsp;million sponsorship deal with Adidas for its jerseys and other equipment.<ref name="nytimes" /> In 2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, specifically soccer.

By 2012 the league had shown a marked improvement in its financial health. In November 2013, ''[[Forbes]]'' published a report that revealed that ten of the league's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league's collective annual revenues were $494&nbsp;million, and that the league's collective annual profit was $34&nbsp;million. Forbes valued the league's franchises to be worth $103&nbsp;million on average, almost three times as much as the $37&nbsp;million average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $175&nbsp;million, a 483% gain over the $30&nbsp;million league entrance fee it paid in 2009.<ref name="forbes.com" />

The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015 ''Forbes'' updated its MLS franchise values with the most profitable team measuring $245 million and the least $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 to $157 million.<ref name="forbes-2015-08" />

As of 2018 ''Forbes'' estimates Atlanta United FC are the most valuable MLS team, worth $330 million, while the Colorado Rapids are the lowest value, at $155 million.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Chris |title=Major League Soccer's Most Valuable Teams 2018: Atlanta United Debuts On Top |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2018/11/14/mls-most-valuable-teams-2018/?src=rss |access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> These valuations do not include the value of stadiums or training facilities owned by the respective clubs.

MLS teams typically use commercial flights to transport players and staff between matches, with only four [[charter flight]]s allowed under league rules.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Karstens-Smith |first=Gemma |date=April 26, 2019 |title=Montreal Impact, Vancouver Whitecaps voice concerns about Major League Soccer travel woes |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-montreal-impact-vancouver-whitecaps-voice-concerns-about-major-league/ |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>

===Rules and officials===
MLS follows the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules and standards]] of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).
Since 2005, the playoff extra time structure follows IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] if necessary.

[[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] hired the first full-time professional referees in league history in 2007 as part of the league's "Game First" initiatives.<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 2, 2007 |title='Game First' initiatives enhance on-field product |publisher=Major League Soccer Communications |url=http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&content_id=87043&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp |url-status=dead |access-date=May 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426134827/http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&content_id=87043&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp |archive-date=April 26, 2008}}</ref>

===Branding===

The current MLS logo debuted in 2014, ahead of the league's 20th season, replacing an earlier logo that featured a stylized boot and ball. The current logo is a simple crest with a diagonal stripe, the MLS wordmark, and three stars that represent "community, club, and country". The logo was designed to be remixed in different color schemes that match teams when used on merchandise and jerseys.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Straus |first=Brian |date=September 17, 2014 |title=Ahead of 20th season, MLS unveils new logo, branding to alter look |work=Sports Illustrated |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/09/17/new-mls-logo-crest-shield-major-league-soccer |access-date=February 27, 2020}}</ref>

====Team names====
:''For more information on MLS team names, see the individual team entries.''

In the early years of MLS, teams were typically given official nicknames in the style of other U.S. sports leagues (e.g., [[Columbus Crew]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], [[New England Revolution]]). Several club names in MLS originated with previous professional soccer clubs, such as the 1970s-era [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]] team names [[San Jose Earthquakes (1974–88)|San Jose Earthquakes]], [[Seattle Sounders (1974–83)|Seattle Sounders]], [[Portland Timbers (1975–82)|Portland Timbers]] and [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1974–84)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Toye: Fans are delighted the old NASL names, Sounders, Timbers, Whitecaps and Quakes were saved |url=http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202155940/http://www.prostamerika.com/2012/09/24/toye-fans-are-delighted-the-old-nasl-names-sounders-timbers-whitecaps-and-quakes-were-saved/71346 |archive-date=February 2, 2014 |access-date=September 20, 2014}}</ref>
