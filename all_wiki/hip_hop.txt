'''Hip hop''' or '''hip-hop''' is a [[culture]] and [[art movement]] that was created by [[African Americans]], [[Latino Americans]] and [[Caribbean Americans]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]]. The origin of the name is often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the [[South Bronx|South]] or [[West Bronx]].<ref name="Dyson 2007, p. 6">[[Michael Eric Dyson|Dyson, Michael Eric]], 2007, ''Know What I Mean?

The Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood [[Block party|block parties]] thrown by the [[Black Spades]], an [[African-American]] group that has been described as being a [[gang]], a club, and a music group.

==History==
===1970s===
[[File:DJ Jazzy Jeff.jpg|thumb|right|[[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], who is also a [[record producer]], manipulating a [[phonograph|record turntable]] in England in 2005.]]
In the 1970s, an underground urban movement known as "hip hop" began to form in the [[The Bronx|Bronx, New York City]]. It focused on emceeing (or MCing) over house parties and neighborhood block party events, held outdoors. Hip hop music has been a powerful medium for protesting the impact of legal institutions on minorities, particularly police and prisons.<ref name="papers.ssrn.com">SpearIt, Muslim Hip Hop in the age of Mass Incarceration https://ssrn.com/abstract=2767194 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918232146/https://ssrn.com/abstract=2767194 |date=September 18, 2016 }}</ref> Historically, hip hop arose out of the ruins of a post-industrial and ravaged South Bronx, as a form of expression of urban Black and Latino youth, whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities.<ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/> Jamaican-born DJ Clive "Kool Herc" Campbell<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04s04nk|title=The Birth of Hip Hop, The Forum - BBC World Service|website=BBC|access-date=2017-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313045054/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04s04nk|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> pioneered the use of DJing percussion "breaks" in hip hop music. Beginning at Herc's home in a high-rise apartment at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, the movement later spread across the entire borough.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hermes|first=Will|title=All Rise for the National Anthem of Hip-Hop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/arts/music/29herm.html?_r=1|access-date=March 29, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 29, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520125656/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/arts/music/29herm.html?_r=1|archive-date=May 20, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> On August 11, 1973 [[DJ Kool Herc]] was the DJ at his sister's back-to-school party.

A second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing (also called MCing or rapping). Emceeing is the rhythmic spoken delivery of [[rhyme]]s and wordplay, delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a [[beats (music)|beat]]. This spoken style was influenced by the [[African American music|African American]] style of "capping," a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Hip hop: Origins, Characteristics and Creative Processes|last = Neumann|first = Fredreich|date = 2000|journal = The World of Music|jstor=41699313|volume=42|issue = 1|pages=51–63}}</ref> The basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps, rival "posses" (groups), uptown "throw-downs," and political and social commentary—were all long present in African American music. MCing and rapping performers moved back and forth between the predominance of toasting songs packed with a mix of boasting, 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, socially conscious style. The role of the MC originally was as a [[Master of Ceremonies]] for a DJ dance event. The MC would introduce the DJ and try to pump up the audience. The MC spoke between the DJ's songs, urging everyone to get up and dance. MCs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd. Eventually, this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken, rhythmic wordplay, and rhyming, which became rapping.

By 1979 hip hop music had become a mainstream genre. It spread across the world in the 1990s with controversial "gangsta" rap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acesandeighths.com/hip_hop.html|title=The History of Hip Hop Music|website=Acesandeighths.com|access-date=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618001714/http://www.acesandeighths.com/hip_hop.html|archive-date=June 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Herc also developed upon [[break (music)|break-beat]] [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejaying]],<ref name="The guide">Browne, P. ''The guide to United States popular culture'' Popular Press, 2001. p. 386</ref> where the breaks of [[funk]] songs—the part most suited to dance, usually percussion-based—were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties. This form of music playback, using hard funk and rock, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers would lead to the syncopated, rhymed spoken accompaniment now known as rapping.

Street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the South [[The Bronx|Bronx]], and much of the graffiti, [[rapping]], and [[Breakdancing|b-boying]] at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and one-upmanship of street gangs.

Women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the Bronx. Nevertheless, as [[gangsta rap]] became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with [[misogyny|misogynistic]] (anti-women) lyrics and many music videos depicted women in a sexualized fashion. The negation of female voice and perspective is an issue that has come to define mainstream hip hop music.

===Commercialization===
{{Synthesis|date=March 2009}}
[[File:Jay-Z concert (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Rapper, entrepreneur and executive [[Jay-Z]] emphasizes his wealth.]]
In the early-to-mid 1980s, there wasn't an established hip hop music industry, as exists in the 2020s, with record labels, [[record producer]]s, managers and [[Artists and Repertoire]] staff. Politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement. Most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes. However, in the late 1980s, music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of "gangsta rap." They made a formula that created "a titillating buffet of [[hypermasculinity]] and glorified violence." This type of rap was marketed to the new fan base: white males. They ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved.<ref>Johnson, Gaye Theresa. "On Blackness, Humanity, and The Art of Rap." The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, 12 June 2012. Web. 02 June 2014.</ref>

In an article for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[Greg Tate]] argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon, writing that "what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry, in which the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' and the super-rich employers get richer".<ref name="Diawara" /> Ironically, this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/05/music/main2537326.shtml |title=Rap Criticism Grows Within Own Community, Debate Rages Over {{sic|It's|nolink=y}} Effect On Society As It Struggles With Alarming Sales Decline&nbsp;– The ShowBuzz |publisher=Showbuzz.cbsnews.com |date=February 17, 2010 |access-date=April 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221122805/http://www.showbuzz.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/03/05/music/main2537326.shtml |archive-date=December 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Even other musicians, like Nas and KRS-ONE have claimed "[[Hip Hop Is Dead (song)|hip hop is dead]]" in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created.

However, in his book ''In Search Of Africa'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyTbwaEDTsUC&pg=PP5|title=In Search of Africa|last=Diawara|first=Manthia|date=July 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674034242|language=en}}</ref> [[Manthia Diawara]] states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society. He argues that the "worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution" is actually global "expression of poor people's desire for the good life," and that this struggle aligns with "the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging, but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition." The problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts; it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases. Industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won't want to listen to female rappers, so they are given fewer opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shepherd|first1=Julianne Escobedo|title=Previewing the BET Awards: Where Are the Lady Rappers?|url=http://www.thirteen.org/riffcity/music/previewing-the-bet-awards-where-are-the-lady-rappers/|website=Thirteen.org|access-date=June 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607000306/http://www.thirteen.org/riffcity/music/previewing-the-bet-awards-where-are-the-lady-rappers/|archive-date=June 7, 2014|url-status=live|date=June 22, 2011}}</ref>

As the hip hop genre has changed since the 1980s, the [[African Americans|African-American]] cultural "tradition" that [[Manthia Diawara|Diawara]] describes has little place in hip hop's mainstream artists music. The push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as [[Rick Ross]], [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Jay Z]] has irked older hip hop fans and artists. They see the genre losing its community-based feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth. The commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white, affluent and suburban audiences.

After realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on Video Music Box, Darlene Lewis (model/lyricist), along with Darryl Washington and Dean Carroll, brought hip hop music to the ''First Exposure'' cable show on Paragon cable, and then created the ''On Broadway'' television show. There, rappers had opportunities to be interviewed and have their music videos played. This pre-dated MTV or [[Video Soul]] on BET. The commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic, but it also has enabled hip hop artists to become successful.<ref>Imani Perry, [https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6TBwf1QfqMkP3FwrRg6w "Bling Bling and Going Pop Consumerism and Co-Optation in Hip-Hop"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227184602/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6TBwf1QfqMkP3FwrRg6w |date=December 27, 2014}}, 2003.

==Culture==
[[Disc jockey|DJing]] and [[turntablism]], MCing/[[rapping]], [[breakdancing]], [[graffiti art]] and [[beatboxing]] are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic. Like the [[blues]], these arts were developed by [[African Americans|African American]] communities to enable people to make a statement, whether political or emotional and participate in community activities. These practices spread globally around the 1980s as fans could "make it their own" and express themselves in new and creative ways in music, dance and other arts.<ref>Brooks, S. and T. Conroy.

===DJing===
{{Main|Turntablism}}
[[File:DJ Q-bert in France.jpg|thumb|right|DJ [[DJ Qbert|Q-bert]] manipulating a [[phonograph|record turntable]] at a turntablism competition in France in 2006.]]

DJing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more [[phonograph]] turntables (or other sound sources, such as tapes, CDs or [[digital audio file]]s) and a [[DJ mixer]] that is plugged into a [[PA system]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/keyword/turntable/2 ''New York Times''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520135040/http://www.nytimes.com/keyword/turntable/2 |date=May 20, 2013 }}</ref> One of the first few hip hop DJs was [[Kool DJ Herc]], who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation and extending of "breaks" (the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat). In addition to developing Herc's techniques, DJs [[Grandmaster Flowers]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], and [[Grandmaster Caz]] made further innovations with the introduction of "[[scratching]]", which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music.

Traditionally, a DJ will use two turntables simultaneously and mix between the two. These are connected to a DJ mixer, an [[amplifier]], [[Loudspeaker|speakers]], and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and [[effects unit]]s. The DJ mixes the two albums currently in rotation and/or does "[[scratching]]" by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the [[crossfader]] on the mixer. The result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song. Although there is considerable overlap between the two roles, a DJ is not the same as a [[record producer]] of a music track.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mca.org.au/web/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=234&Itemid=1 |title=Music and Human Evolution |publisher=Mca.org.au |access-date=September 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706125158/http://www.mca.org.au/web/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=234&Itemid=1 |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The development of DJing was also influenced by new [[turntablism]] techniques, such as [[beatmatching]], a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1200 MK 2]], first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable [[pitch control]] and a [[direct drive]] motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure [[soul music|soul]] records and vintage [[funk]] recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.
[[File:Pete Rock at Launch Party.jpg|thumb|left|upright|DJ Pete Rock mixing with two turntables.]]

In the early years of hip hop, the DJs were the stars, as they created new music and beats with their record players. While DJing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the 2010s, the star role has increasingly been taken by MCs since the late 1970s, due to innovative, creative MCs such as Kurtis Blow and [[Melle Mel]] of [[Grandmaster Flash]]'s crew, the [[Furious Five]], who developed strong rapping skills. However, a number of DJs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years. Famous DJs include Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, [[Mr. Magic]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Charlie Chase]], [[DJ Disco Wiz]], [[DJ Scratch]] from [[EPMD]], [[DJ Premier]] from [[Gang Starr]], DJ [[Scott La Rock]] from [[Boogie Down Productions]], DJ [[Pete Rock]] of [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[DJ Muggs]] from [[Cypress Hill]], [[Jam Master Jay]] from [[Run-DMC]], [[Eric B.]], [[DJ Screw]] from the [[Screwed Up Click]] and the inventor of the [[Chopped & Screwed]] style of mixing music, [[Funkmaster Flex]], [[Tony Touch]], [[DJ Clue]], [[Mix Master Mike]], Touch-Chill-Out, DJ Red Alert, and [[Q-bert (DJ)|DJ Q-Bert]]. The underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the DJ. In the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.

In America in the late 1960s, before hip hop, [[graffiti]] was used as a form of expression by political activists. In addition, gangs such as the [[Savage Skulls]], [[La Familia Michoacana]], and [[Savage Nomads]] used graffiti to mark territory. [[Julio 204|JULIO 204]] was a Puerto Rican graffiti writer, one of the first graffiti writers in New York City. He was a member of the "Savage Skulls" gang, and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as 1968. In 1971 the ''New York Times'' published an article ("'Taki 183' Spawns Pen Pals") about another graffiti writer, [[TAKI 183]]. According to the article Julio had been writing for a couple of years when Taki began tagging his own name all around the city. Taki also states in the article that Julio "was busted and stopped." Writers following in the wake of Taki and [[Tracy 168]] would add their street number to their nickname, "bomb" (cover) a train with their work, and let the subway take it—and their fame, if it was impressive, or simply pervasive, enough—"all city". Julio 204 never rose to Taki's fame because Julio kept his tags localized to his own neighborhood.

Spray painting public property or the property of others without their consent can be considered vandalism, and the "tagger" may be subject to arrest and prosecution for the criminal act.  Whether legal or not, the hip hop culture considers tagging buildings, trains, bridges and other structures as visual art, and consider the tags as part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules.

The relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/24298544/history-of-Graffiti |title=history of Graffiti |publisher=Scribd.com |date=December 19, 2009 |access-date=September 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917135000/http://www.scribd.com/doc/24298544/history-of-Graffiti |archive-date=September 17, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music, just as [[breakdance|breaking]] is viewed as a physical expression. The 1983 film ''[[Wild Style]]'' is widely regarded as the first hip hop motion picture, which featured prominent figures within the New York graffiti scene during that period. The book ''[[Subway Art]]'' and the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' were also among the first ways the mainstream public were introduced to hip hop graffiti. Graffiti remains part of hip hop, while crossing into the mainstream art world with exhibits in galleries throughout the world.

Breaking, also called B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing, is a dynamic, rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements of hip hop culture. Like many aspects of hip hop culture, breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures, including 1930s-era street dancing,<ref>"Earl 'Snakehips' Tucker". Drop Me off in Harlem. Kennedy Center. 2003.

Breaking took form in the South Bronx in the 1970s alongside the other elements of hip hop. Breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of [[hip hop music]] playing on a [[boom box]] or [[PA system]].
[[File:Break Dancer.png|thumb|A silhouette shows a man break dancing. One of the 4 elements of hip hop.]]
According to the 2002 documentary film ''The Freshest Kids: A History of the B-Boy'', DJ Kool Herc describes the "B" in B-boy as short for breaking, which at the time was slang for "going off", also one of the original names for the dance. However, early on the dance was known as the "boing" (the sound a spring makes). Dancers at DJ Kool Herc's parties saved their best dance moves for the percussion [[break (music)|break]] section of the song, getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive, frenetic style. The "B" in B-boy or B-girl also stands simply for break, as in break-boy or -girl. Before the 1990s, B-girls' presence was limited by their gender minority status, navigating sexual politics of a masculine-dominated scene, and a lack of representation or encouragement for women to participate in the form. The few B-girls who participated despite facing gender discrimination carved out a space for women as leaders within the breaking community, and the number of B-girls participating has increased.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Imani Kai|date=2014|title=From blues women to b-girls: performing badass femininity|journal=Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|pages=17–18}}</ref> Breaking was documented in ''[[Style Wars]]'', and was later given more focus in fictional films such as ''[[Wild Style]]'' and ''[[Beat Street]]''.

===Beatboxing===
{{Main|Beatboxing}}
[[File:Biz Markie at Amager Bio 6 (Ausschnitt).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Biz Markie]] is noted for his beatboxing skills. He is holding the mic close to his mouth, a technique beatboxers use to imitate deep basslines and bass drums, by exploiting the [[proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]].]]
[[Beatboxing]] is the technique of [[vocal percussion]], in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice. It is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth.<ref>Perry, I. (2004). ''Prophets of the Hood: Politics and Poetics in Hip Hop'', Duke University Press.</ref> The term ''beatboxing'' is derived from the mimicry of the first generation of [[drum machines]], then known as beatboxes. It was first popularized by [[Doug E. Fresh]].<ref>Hess, M. (2007). ''Icons of hip hop: an encyclopedia of the movement, music, and culture'', Volume 1, Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref>  As it is a way of creating hip hop music, it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop, though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the human-created beat. It is generally considered to be part of the same "Pillar" of hip hop as DJing—in other words, providing a musical backdrop or foundation for MC's to rap over.

Beatboxers can create their beats just naturally, but many of the beatboxing effects are enhanced by using a microphone plugged into a [[PA system]]. This helps the beatboxer to make their beatboxing loud enough to be heard alongside a rapper, MC, turntablist, and other hip hop artists. Beatboxing was popular in the 1980s with prominent artists like the Darren "Buffy, the Human Beat Box" Robinson of the [[Fat Boys]] and [[Biz Markie]] displaying their skills within the media. It declined in popularity along with b-boying in the late 1980s, but has undergone a resurgence since the late 1990s, marked by the release of "Make the Music 2000." by [[Rahzel]] of [[The Roots]].

===Beatmaking/producing===
{{Main|Hip hop production}}
[[File:Accompaniment Rap.png|thumb|right|A typical rap drum beat, written in drum notation.]]
Although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop, [[record producer|music producing]] is another important element. In music, record producers play a similar role in [[sound recording]] that [[film director]]s play in making a movie. The record producer recruits and selects artists (rappers, MCs, DJs, beatboxers, and so on), plans the vision for the recording session, coaches the performers on their songs, chooses [[audio engineer]]s, sets out a budget for hiring the artists and technical experts, and oversees the entire project. The exact roles of a producer depend on each individual, but some producers work with DJs and drum machine programmers to create beats, coach the DJs in the selection of sampled [[bassline]]s, [[riff (music)|riff]]s and [[catch phrase]]s, give advice to rappers, vocalists, MCs and other artists, give suggestions to performers on how to improve their flow and develop a unique personal style. Some producers work closely with the audio engineer to provide ideas on mixing, [[effects unit]]s (e.g., [[Autotune]]d vocal effects such as those popularized by [[T-pain|T-Pain]]), micing of artists, and so on. The producer may independently develop the "concept" or vision for a project or album, or develop the vision in collaboration with the artists and performers.
[[File:Chilly Chill LENCH MOB Throwing The W's.jpg|thumb|left|Hip hop producer [[Chilly Chill]] behind a large [[audio console]] in a recording studio.]]
In hip hop, since the beginning of MCing, there have been producers who work in the studio, behind the scenes, to create the beats for MCs to rap over. Producers may find a beat they like on an old funk, soul, or disco record. They then isolate the beat and turn it into a loop. Alternatively, producers may create a beat with a [[drum machine]] or by hiring a [[drumkit]] percussionist to play acoustic drums. The producer could even mix and layer different methods, such as combining a sampled disco drum break with a drum machine track and some live, newly recorded percussion parts or a live electric bass player. A beat created by a hip hop producer may include other parts besides a drum beat, such as a sampled [[bassline]] from a funk or disco song, dialogue from a spoken word record or movie, or rhythmic "scratching" and "punches" done by a [[turntablist]] or DJ.

An early beat maker was producer [[Kurtis Blow]], who won producer of the year credits in 1983, 1984, and 1985. Known for the creation of sample and sample loops, Blow was considered the [[Quincy Jones]] of early hip hop, a reference to the prolific African American record producer, conductor, arranger, composer, musician and bandleader. One of the most influential beat makers was J. Dilla, a producer from Detroit who chopped samples by specific beats and would combine them together to create his unique sound. Those who create these beats are known as either beat makers or producers, however producers are known to have more input and direction on the overall the creation of a song or project, while a beat maker just provides or creates the beat. As Dr. Dre has said before "Once you finish the beat, you have to produce the record."<ref>{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sselUE6zQYM|access-date = December 1, 2015|title = Dr. Dre interview (2012)|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112203705/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sselUE6zQYM|archive-date = January 12, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> The process of making beats includes sampling, "chopping", looping, sequencing beats, recording, mixing, and mastering.

Most beats in hip hop are [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] from a pre-existing record. This means that a producer will take a portion or a "sample" of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section, beat or portion of their song. Some examples of this are [[The Isley Brothers]]' "Footsteps in the Dark Pts. 1 and 2" being sampled to make [[Ice Cube]]'s "[[Today Was a Good Day]]".<ref>{{cite web|title = Ice Cube's It Was a Good Day - Discover the Sample Source|url = http://www.whosampled.com/sample/232/Ice-Cube-It-Was-a-Good-Day-The-Isley-Brothers-Footsteps-in-the-Dark/|website = WhoSampled|access-date = December 1, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151114180651/http://www.whosampled.com/sample/232/Ice-Cube-It-Was-a-Good-Day-The-Isley-Brothers-Footsteps-in-the-Dark/|archive-date = November 14, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Another example is [[Otis Redding]]'s "[[Try a Little Tenderness]]" being sampled to create the song "[[Otis (song)|Otis]]",  released in 2011, by [[Kanye West]] and [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Jay Z and Kanye West feat.

"Chopping" is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you "chop" out the part or parts of the song, be that the bassline, rhythm guitar part, drum break, or other music, you want to use in the beat.<ref>{{cite web|title = What does "chopping" mean? - Future Producers forums|url = http://www.futureproducers.com/forums/production-techniques/sampling-and-digging/what-does-chopping-mean-208685/|website = Future Producers|access-date = December 1, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208171731/http://www.futureproducers.com/forums/production-techniques/sampling-and-digging/what-does-chopping-mean-208685/|archive-date = December 8, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time, so basically a producer will make an even-number of bars of a beat (e.g., four bars or eight bars) repeat itself or "loop" of a full song length. This loop provides an [[accompaniment]] for an MC to rap over.
[[File:Marcelo D2, Palco São João (2474012990).jpg|thumb|left|While hip hop music makes a significant use of [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] old records, using turntables and [[drum machine]]s to create beats, producers use electric and acoustic instruments on some songs. Pictured is an electric bass player at a hip hop show.]]

The tools needed to make beats in the late 1970s were funk, soul, and other music genre [[Gramophone record|record]]s, [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, [[DJ mixer]]s, [[audio console]]s, and relatively inexpensive [[Portastudio]]-style [[multitrack recording]] devices. In the 1980s and 1990s, beat makers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed, such as samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and synthesizers. From the 1970s to the 2010s, various beat makers and producers have used live instruments, such as [[drum kit]] or [[electric bass]] on some tracks. To record the finished beats or beat tracks, beat makers and producers use a variety of [[sound recording]] equipment, typically [[multitrack recorder]]s. [[Digital Audio Workstation]]s, also known as DAWs, became more common in the 2010s for producers. Some of the most used DAWs are [[FL Studio]], [[Ableton Live]], and [[Pro Tools]].

DAWs have made it possible for more people to be able to make beats in their own home studio, without going to a [[recording studio]]. Beat makers who own DAWs do not have to buy all the hardware that a recording studio needed in the 1980s (huge 72 channel audio consoles, multitrack recorders, racks of rackmount effects units), because 2010-era DAWs have everything they need to make beats on a good quality, fast laptop computer.<ref>{{cite web|title = Introduction to DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) « EarSketch|url = http://earsketch.gatech.edu/learning/intro-to-daw/introduction-to-daws-digital-audio-workstations|website = earsketch.gatech.edu|access-date = December 1, 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208103314/http://earsketch.gatech.edu/learning/intro-to-daw/introduction-to-daws-digital-audio-workstations|archive-date = December 8, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

Beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums. Even though these instrumentals have no rapping, listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats, samples and instrumental melodies. Examples of these are [[9th Wonder]]'s "Tutenkhamen" and [[J Dilla]]'s "Donuts". Some hip hop records come in two versions: a beat with rapping over it, and an instrumental with just the beat. The instrumental in this case is provided so that DJs and turntablists can isolate breaks, beats and other music to create new songs.

===Language===
The development of hip hop linguistics is complex. Source material include the spirituals of slaves arriving in the new world, Jamaican dub music, the laments of jazz and blues singers, patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes.<ref name="Stylo, Saada Page 10">Motion live entertainment.

''It's Bigger Than Hip Hop: the Rise of the Post-hip-hop Generation''. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2008, pp. 106–108.</ref> The word ''[[:wikt:diss#English|diss]]'' for example is particularly prolific. There are also a number of words which predate hip hop, but are often associated with the culture, with ''homie'' being a notable example. Sometimes, terms like ''what the dilly, yo'' are popularized by a single song (in this case, "[[Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See]]" by [[Busta Rhymes]]) and are only used briefly. One particular example is the rule-based slang of [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[E-40]], who add ''-izzle'' or ''-izz'' to the end or middle of words.

Hip Hop lyrics have also been known for containing swear words. In particular, the word "bitch" is seen in countless songs, from NWA's "A Bitch Iz a bitch" to Missy Elliot's "She is a Bitch." It is often used in the negative connotation of a woman who is a shallow "money grubber". Some female artists have tried to reclaim the word and use it as a term of empowerment. Regardless, the hip hop community has recently taken an interest in discussing the use of the word "bitch" and whether it is necessary in rap.<ref>Elan, Priya.

==Social impact==
===Effects===
[[File:Sf hiphop.jpg|thumb|A [[Breakdancing|b-boy]] performing in [[San Francisco]]]]
Hip hop has made a considerable social impact since its inception in the 1970s. "Hip hop has also become relevant to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language, learning, identity, and curriculum."<ref>Asante, M. K.

New York: St. Martin's Press, 2008, pp. 21–23.</ref> [[Orlando Patterson]], a sociology professor at [[Harvard University]], helps describe the phenomenon of how hip hop has spread rapidly around the world. Patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy, the government, and major businesses in [[Third World]] nations and countries around the world.<ref name="lehblz">{{cite web|author=Patterson, Orlando |title=Global Culture and the American Cosmos |publisher=The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts |id=Paper Number 21994 01Feb2008 |url=http://www.warholfoundation.org/paperseries/article2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104053935/http://www.warholfoundation.org/paperseries/article2.htm |archive-date=January 4, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref> He also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hip hop scene. As a result, the youth are influenced by the American hip hop scene and start their own forms of hip hop. Patterson believes that revitalization of hip hop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with American hip hop music,<ref name = "lehblz"/> and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hip hop.

It has also been argued that rap music formed as a "cultural response to historic oppression and racism, a system for communication among black communities throughout the United States".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/arts-english/2008/August/20080814205112eaifas0.7286246.html |title=Hip-Hop: The "Rapper's Delight" |publisher=America.gov |access-date=April 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422052900/http://www.america.gov/st/arts-english/2008/August/20080814205112eaifas0.7286246.html |archive-date=April 22, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> This is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth.

===Linguistics===
Hip hop lyricism has gained a measure of legitimacy in [[Hip-Hop in academia|academic]] and literary circles. Studies of hip hop linguistics are now offered at institutions such as the [[University of Toronto]], where poet and author George Eliot Clarke has taught the potential power of hip hop music to promote social change.<ref name="Stylo, Saada Page 10"/> Greg Thomas of the [[University of Miami]] offers courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level studying the feminist and assertive nature of [[Lil' Kim]]'s lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |first=G |last=Thomas |title=Hip-Hop Revolution In The Flesh. xi.

As quoted in their work "Promoting Academic Literacy with Urban Youth Through Engaging Hip Hop Culture":

{{quote|Hip hop texts are rich in imagery and metaphors and can be used to teach irony, tone, diction, and point of view. Hip hop texts can be analyzed for theme, motif, plot, and character development. Both Grand Master Flash and T.S. Eliot gazed out into their rapidly deteriorating societies and saw a "wasteland." Both poets were essentially apocalyptic in nature as they witnessed death, disease, and decay.<ref>Morrell, Ernest. Duncan-Andrade, Jeffrey.

===Censorship===
[[File:Don't Blame Yourself...Blame Hip-Hop.jpg|thumb|A [[graffiti]] artist uses his artwork to make a satirical social statement on censorship: "Don't blame yourself ... blame hip hop!"]]

Hip hop music has been censored on radio and TV due to the explicit lyrics of certain genres. Many songs have been criticized for [[anti-establishment]] and sometimes violent messages. The use of [[profanity]] as well as graphic depictions of violence and sex in hip hop music videos and songs makes it hard to broadcast on television stations such as MTV, in music video form, and on radio. As a result, many hip hop recordings are broadcast in censored form, with offending language "bleeped" or blanked out of the soundtrack, or replaced with "clean" lyrics. The result&nbsp;– which sometimes renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording&nbsp;– has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music, and has been parodied in films such as ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', in which [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]' character Dr. Evil&nbsp;– performing in a parody of a hip hop music video ("[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]" by [[Jay-Z]]) – performs an entire verse that is blanked out.

In 1990, [[Luther Campbell]] and his group [[2 Live Crew]] filed a lawsuit against Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro, because Navarro wanted to prosecute stores that sold the group's album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' because of its obscene and vulgar lyrics. In June 1990, a [[U.S. district court]] judge labeled the album obscene and illegal to sell. However, in 1992, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] overturned the obscenity ruling from Judge Gonzalez, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to hear Broward County's appeal. Professor Louis Gates testified on behalf of The 2 Live Crew, arguing that the material that the county alleged was profane actually had important roots in [[African-American]] vernacular, games, and literary traditions and should be protected.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Appeals Court Voids Obscenity Ruling on 2 Live Crew Album|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-08/news/mn-1911_1_live-crew|access-date=November 5, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=May 8, 1992|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106124234/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-08/news/mn-1911_1_live-crew|archive-date=November 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Gangsta rap is a [[subgenre]] of hip hop that reflects the violent culture of inner-city American black youths.<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=http://rap.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/GangstaRap.htm |title=Gangsta Rap – What Is Gangsta Rap |publisher=Rap.about.com |date=October 31, 2009 |access-date=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232338/http://rap.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/GangstaRap.htm |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as [[Schoolly D]] and [[Ice-T]], and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups such as [[N.W.A]]. Ice-T released "[[6 in the Mornin']]", which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song, in 1986. After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop.

[[N.W.A]] is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. Their lyrics were more violent, openly confrontational, and shocking than those of established rap acts, featuring incessant profanity and, controversially, use of the word "[[nigga]]". These lyrics were placed over rough, rock guitar-driven beats, contributing to the music's hard-edged feel. The first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A's ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' would establish [[West Coast hip hop]] as a vital genre, and establish [[Los Angeles]] as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. ''[[Straight Outta Compton (song)|Straight Outta Compton]]'' sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song "[[Fuck tha Police]]" earned a letter from [[FBI]] Assistant Director Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing [[police|law enforcement]]'s resentment of the song.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ryan |last=Ritchie |title=Eazy to be hard |url=http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527 |work=Press Telegram |publisher=Los Angeles Newspaper group |date=February 28, 2007 |access-date=January 26, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304170024/http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527 |archive-date=March 4, 2007 }}</ref><ref>Deflem, Mathieu. 2019.

Controversy surrounded Ice-T's song "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" from the album ''[[Body Count (album)|Body Count]]''. The song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. Ice-T's rock song infuriated government officials, the [[National Rifle Association]] and various police advocacy groups.<ref name="Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator.

Ice-T suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist Chuck Philips "... they've done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers. [Actor] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] blew away dozens of cops as [[the Terminator]]. But I don't hear anybody complaining about that." [[Ice-T]] suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of "Cop Killer" and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: "The Supreme Court says it's OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer."<ref name="Arnold Schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the Terminator. But I don't hear anybody complaining"/>

The White House administrations of both [[George H. W.

What started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in American politics.

The symbiotic relationship has also stretched to include car manufacturers, clothing designers and sneaker companies,<ref>{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Johnson |url=http://www.silive.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2008/09/cover_story_frock_band.html |title=Cover Story: Frock Band |publisher=SILive.com |access-date=September 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510072326/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2008/09/cover_story_frock_band.html |archive-date=May 10, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> and many other companies have used the hip hop community to make their name or to give them credibility. One such beneficiary was [[Jacob the Jeweler]], a diamond merchant from New York. Jacob Arabo's clientele included [[Sean Combs]], [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Nas]]. He created jewelry pieces from precious metals that were heavily loaded with diamond and gemstones. As his name was mentioned in the song lyrics of his hip hop customers, his profile quickly rose.

While some brands welcome the support of the hip hop community, one brand that did not was [[Cristal (champagne)|Cristal]] champagne maker [[Louis Roederer]]. A 2006 article from ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine featured remarks from managing director Frederic Rouzaud about whether the brand's identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively.

===Media===
{{Cleanup rewrite|section=yes|date=December 2011}}

Hip hop culture has had extensive coverage in the media, especially in relation to television; there have been a number of television shows devoted to or about hip hop, including in Europe ("[[H.I.P. H.O.P.]]" in 1984). For many years, [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] was the only television channel likely to play hip hop, but in recent years{{When|date=January 2014}} the channels [[VH1]] and MTV have added a significant amount of hip hop to their play list. Run DMC became the first [[African American]] group to appear on MTV.<ref>"Hip-hop", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2010. Retrieved January 31, 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266545/hip-hop |title=hip-hop (cultural movement)&nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511185325/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266545/hip-hop |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> With the emergence of the Internet, a number of online sites began to offer hip hop related video content.

===Magazines===
Hip hop magazines describe hip hop's culture, including information about rappers and MCs, new hip hop music, concerts, events, fashion and history. The first hip hop publication, ''The Hip Hop Hit List'' was published in the 1980s. It contained the first rap music record chart. It was put out by two brothers from Newark, New Jersey, Vincent and Charles Carroll (who was also in a hip hop group known as [[The Nastee Boyz]]). They knew the art form very well and noticed the need for a hip hop magazine. DJs and rappers did not have a way to learn about rap music styles and labels. The periodical began as the first Rap record chart and tip sheet for DJs and was distributed through national record pools and record stores throughout the New York City Tri-State area. One of the founding publishers, Charles Carroll noted, "Back then, all DJs came into New York City to buy their records but most of them did not know what was hot enough to spend money on, so we charted it." Jae Burnett became Vincent Carroll's partner and played an instrumental role in its later development.
[[File:Juice-Cover mit Genetikk (Juni 2013).jpg|thumb|right|upright|The German hip hop magazine ''[[Juice (magazine)|Juice]]''.]]

Another popular hip hop magazine that arose in the 1980s was [[Word Up! (magazine)|''Word Up'' magazine]], an American magazine catering to the youth with an emphasis on hip hop. It featured articles on what is like to be a part of the hip hop community, promoted up-coming albums, bringing awareness to the projects that the artist was involved in, and also included posters of trending celebrities within the world of Hip Hop. The magazine was published monthly and mainly concerning rap, Hip Hop and R&B music. Word Up magazine was highly popular, it was even mentioned in the popular song by [[The Notorious B.I.G]] - Juicy "it was all a dream, use to read WordUp magazine". Word Up magazine was a part of pop culture.

New York tourists from abroad took the publication back home with them to other countries to share it, creating worldwide interest in the culture and new art form.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} It had a printed distribution of 50,000, a circulation rate of 200,000 with well over 25,000 subscribers. The "Hip Hop Hit List" was also the first to define hip hop as a culture introducing the many aspects of the art form such as fashion, music, dance, the arts and most importantly the language. For instance, on the cover the headliner included the tag "All Literature was Produced to Meet Street Comprehension!" which proved their loyalty not only to the culture but also to the streets. Most interviews were written verbatim which included their innovative broken English style of writing. Some of the early charts were written in the graffiti format tag style but was made legible enough for the masses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The Carroll Brothers were also consultants to the many record companies who had no idea how to market hip hop music. Vincent Carroll, the magazine's creator-publisher, went on to become a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting Blow-Up Media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in NYC's Tribeca district. At the age of 21, Vincent Carroll employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the culture's biggest and brightest stars (the Fugees, Nelly, the Outzidaz, feat. Eminem and many more).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Later other publications spawned up including: ''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'', ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]'', ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' and ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kitwana|2005|pp=28–29}}.</ref> Many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. The 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.

===Fashion===
[[File:Snoop Dogg @ Døgnvill 2009 07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rapper [[Snoop Dogg]] at a 2009 show.]]
Clothing, hair and other styles have been a big part of hip hop's social and cultural impact since the 1970s. Although the styles have changed over the decades, distinctive urban apparel and looks have been an important way for rappers, breakdancers and other hip hop community members to express themselves. As the hip hop music genre's popularity increased, so did the effect of its fashion. While there were early items synonymous with hip hop that crossed over into the mainstream culture, like Run-DMC's affinity for [[Adidas]] or the Wu-Tang Clan's championing of [[C. & J. Clark#Wallabee|Clarks' Wallabees]], it wasn't until its commercial peak that [[hip hop fashion]] became influential. Starting in the mid- to late 1990s, hip hop culture embraced some major designers and established a new connection with classic fashion. Brands such as [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Tommy Hilfiger]] all tapped into hip hop culture and gave very little in return. Moving into the new millennium, hip hop fashion consisted of baggy shirts, jeans, and jerseys. As names like Pharrell and Jay-Z started their own clothing lines and still others like Kanye West linked up with designers like [[Louis Vuitton]], the clothes got tighter, more classically fashionable, and expensive.

As hip hop has a seen a shift in the means by which its artists express their masculinity, from violence and intimidation to wealth-flaunting and entrepreneurship, it has also seen the emergence of rapper branding.<ref>Miller, Janice. ''Fashion and Music''. Oxford: Berg, 2011, p. 13.</ref> The modern-day hip hop artist is no longer limited to music serving as their sole occupation or source of income. By the early 1990s, major apparel companies "[had] realized the economic potential of tapping into hip hop culture ... Tommy Hilfiger was one of the first major fashion designer[s] who actively courted rappers as a way of promoting his [[streetwear|street wear]]".<ref>Elam, Harry Justin, Jr., and Kennell A. Jackson. ''Black Cultural Traffic: Crossroads in Global Performance and Popular Culture''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2005, p. 329.</ref> By joining forces, the artist and the corporation are able to jointly benefit from each other's resources. Hip Hop artists are trend-setters and taste-makers. Their fans range from minority groups who can relate to their professed struggles to majority groups who cannot truly relate but like to "consume the fantasy of living a more masculine life".<ref>Arthur, Damien (2006), "Hip Hop Consumption and Masculinity", ''Gender and Consumer Behavior'', Volume 8, Association for Consumer Research, 113.</ref> The rappers provide the "cool, hip" factor while the corporations deliver the product, advertising, and financial assets. Tommy Hilfiger, one of the first mainstream designers to actively court rappers as a way of promoting his street wear, serves a prototypical example of the hip hip/fashion collaborations:

{{quote|In exchange for giving artists free wardrobes, Hilfiger found its name mentioned in both rhyming verses of rap songs and their 'shout-out' lyrics, in which rap artists chant out thanks to friends and sponsors for their support. Hilfiger's success convinced other large mainstream American fashion design companies, like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, to tailor lines to the lucrative market of hip hop artists and fans.<ref name="Elam, 329">Elam, 329.</ref>}}

Artists now use brands as a means of supplemental income to their music or are creating and expanding their own brands that become their primary source of income. As Harry Elam explains, there has been a movement "from the incorporation and redefinition of existing trends to actually designing and marketing products as hip hop fashion".<ref name="Elam, 329"/>

===Diversification===
{{Main|List of hip hop genres}}
[[File:Hip hop.jpg|thumb|[[Breakdancing|Breaking]] in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia]]

Hip hop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches, such as [[sampling (music)|sampling]], creating beats, or rapping. The diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups. There are many varying social influences that affect hip hop's message in different nations. It is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political and/or social injustices. In South Africa the largest form of hip hop is called [[Kwaito]], which has had a growth similar to American hip hop. Kwaito is a direct reflection of a post apartheid South Africa and is a voice for the voiceless; a term that U.S. hip hop is often referred to. Kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle, encompassing many aspects of life, including language and fashion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Simon |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/040419/kwaito.html |title=TIMEeurope Magazine &#124; Viewpoint |work=Time |date=April 11, 2004 |access-date=April 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516175357/http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/040419/kwaito.html |archive-date=May 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Kwaito is a political and party-driven genre, as performers use the music to express their political views, and also to express their desire to have a good time.

In [[Jamaica]], the sounds of hip hop<!-- local name?--> are derived from American and Jamaican influences. Jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music. Jamaican [[Kool Herc]] brought the sound systems, technology, and techniques of [[reggae]] music to New York during the 1970s. Jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both Brooklyn and Jamaican accents. Jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces. Outside forces such as the bling-bling era of today's modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anti-colonialism and marijuana or "ganja" references which [[Rastafarians]] believe bring them closer to God.<ref>Wayne Marshall, "Bling-bling for Rastafari: How Jamaicans deal with hip hop".</ref><ref>[https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/marshall-bling-bling.pdf/]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldmusic.about.com/od/genres/p/Reggae.htm |title=Reggae Music 101&nbsp;– Learn More About Reggae Music&nbsp;– History of Reggae |publisher=Worldmusic.about.com |date=November 4, 2009 |access-date=April 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511030421/http://worldmusic.about.com/od/genres/p/Reggae.htm |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Author [[Wayne Marshall (deejay)|Wayne Marshall]] argues that "Hip hop, as with any number of African-American cultural forms before it, offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to Jamaican artist and audiences. From "modern blackness" to "foreign mind", transnational cosmopolitanism to militant [[pan-Africanism]], radical remixology to outright mimicry, hip hop in Jamaica embodies the myriad ways that Jamaicans embrace, reject, and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms."<ref>Marshall, Wayne, "Bling-Bling ForRastafari: How Jamaicans Deal With Hip-Hop", ''Social and Economic Studies.. 55:1&2 (2006):49–74.</ref>

In the developing world, hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context. Despite the lack of resources, hip hop has made considerable inroads.<ref name="Schwartz"/> Due to limited funds, hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools, and even graffiti, an important aspect of the hip hop culture, is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person. Hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists. There are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age. One example is rapper Awkwafina, an [[Asian-American]], who raps about being Asian as well as being female. She, like many others, use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to "unite" minorities together but to tell her story.<ref>Trinh, Jean. "Meet Awkwafina." The Daily Beast.

===Education===
Scholars argue that hip hop can have an empowering effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Travis | first1 = Raphael | last2 = Deepak | first2 = Anne | year = 2011 | title = Empowerment in Context: Lessons from Hip Hop Culture for Social Work Practice | journal = Journal of Ethnic and Cultural Diversity in Social Work | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 203–22 | doi=10.1080/15313204.2011.594993| s2cid = 144918145 }}</ref> Hip hop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morrell|first1=Ernest|last2=Duncan-Andrade|first2=Jeffrey M.

Organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hip hop. An example is the [[IMP Labs]] in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

The hip-hop community has been a major factor in educating its listeners on HIV/AIDS, a disease that has affected the community very closely.

==Values and philosophy==
===Essentialism===
Since the age of slavery, music has long been the language of African American identity. Because reading and writing were forbidden under the auspices of slavery, music became the only accessible form of communication. Hundreds of years later, in inner-city neighborhoods plagued by high illiteracy and dropout rates, music remains the most dependable medium of expression. Hip Hop is thus to modern day as Negro Spirituals are to the plantations of the old South: the emergent music articulates the terrors of one's environment better than written, or spoken word, thereby forging an "unquestioned association of oppression with creativity [that] is endemic" to African American culture".<ref name="Schloss, J. G. 2014">Schloss, J. G. & Chang, J..Making Beats: The Art of Sample-Based Hip-Hop. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2014.</ref>

As a result, lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as "confessions" to a number of violent crimes in the United States.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/q/blog/2014/01/15/why-are-rap-lyrics-being-used-as-evidence-in-court/ "Why are rap lyrics being used as evidence in court?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103819/http://www.cbc.ca/q/blog/2014/01/15/why-are-rap-lyrics-being-used-as-evidence-in-court/ |date=August 8, 2014 }} ''Q'', CBC Radio, January 15, 2014.</ref> It is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists (DJs, dancers) to "represent" their city and neighborhood. This demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame, and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti. This has potentially been one of the ways that hip hop has become regarded as a "local" rather than "foreign" genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades. Nevertheless, sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu, and an album like the surprise hit ''[[Kala (album)|Kala]]'' by Anglo-Tamil rapper [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track.<ref>Judy Rosen, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-m-i-a-made-kala-20130319 "How M.I.A. Made 'Kala'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622121651/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-m-i-a-made-kala-20130319 |date=June 22, 2013 }}, ''Rolling Stone'', March 19, 2013.</ref>

According to scholar Joseph Schloss, the essentialist perspective of Hip Hop conspicuously obfuscates the role that individual style and pleasure plays in the development of the genre. Schloss notes that Hip Hop is forever fossilized as an inevitable cultural emergent, as if "none of hip-hop's innovators had been born, a different group of poor black youth from the Bronx would have developed hip-hop in exactly the same way".<ref name="Schloss, J. G. 2014"/> However, while the pervasive oppressive conditions of the Bronx were likely to produce another group of disadvantaged youth, he questions whether they would be equally interested, nonetheless willing to put in as much time and energy into making music as Grandmaster Flash, DJ Kool Herc, and Afrika Bambaataa. He thus concludes that Hip Hop was a result of choice, not fate, and that when individual contributions and artistic preferences are ignored, the genre's origin becomes overly attributed to collective cultural oppression.

===Authenticity===
[[File:Graffiti of 50 Cent.jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti depicting US rapper [[50 Cent]]. Larry Nager of ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' wrote that 50 Cent has "earned the right to use the trappings of [[gangsta rap]] – the macho posturing, the guns, the drugs, the big cars and magnums of champagne. He's not a [[poseur]] pretending to be a gangsta; he's the real thing."<ref>{{cite news|last=Nager|first=Larry|title=50 Cent's performance won't propel rapper to next level|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:trRANTublH0J:enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/23/tem_50cent23.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209110315/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:trRANTublH0J:enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/23/tem_50cent23.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 December 2012|newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer|access-date=30 July 2012}}</ref>]]
Hip hop music artists and advocates have stated that hip hop has been an [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] (true and "real") African-American artistic and cultural form since its emergence in inner-city Bronx neighborhoods in the 1970s. Some music critics, scholars and political commentators{{who|date=October 2017}} have denied hip hop's authenticity. Advocates who claim hip hop is an authentic music genre state that it is an ongoing response to the violence and discrimination experienced by black people in the United States, from the [[slavery]] that existed into the 19th century, to the [[lynching]]s of the 20th century and the ongoing [[racial discrimination]] faced by blacks.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[Paul Gilroy]] and [[Alexander Weheliye]] state that unlike [[disco]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], [[house music]], and other genres that were developed in the African-American community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives, hip hop has remained largely controlled by African American artists, producers and executives.<ref>Weheliye, Alexander. "Hip-Hop Pts. 1-3." Kresge Hall, Evanston. 17 October 2013. Lecture.</ref> In his book, ''Phonographies'', Weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables.<ref>Weheliye, Alexander G.. Phonographies: Grooves in Sonic Afro-modernity. Durham: Duke University Press, 2005.</ref> In contrast, [[Greg Tate]] states that the market-driven, commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of African-American culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms.<ref>Tate, Greg. "Hip-hop Turns 30: Whatcha Celebratin' For?" ''Village Voice'', January 4, 2005.</ref> Tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for African-American communities.

These two dissenting understandings of hip hop's scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hop's possession of or lack of authenticity.<ref>See for instance {{Harvnb|Rose|1994|pp=39–40}}.</ref> Anticipating the market arguments of Tate and others, both Gilroy and Weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than Western [[popular music]] as a whole, a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism. Weheliye notes, "Popular music, generally in the form of recordings, has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the [[African diaspora]], allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities."<ref>Weheliye (2005), ''Phonographies'', p. 145.</ref> For Paul Gilroy, hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which African Americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains.<ref name="Gilroy, Paul 1993">Gilroy, Paul. ''The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1993.</ref>

In "Phonographies", Weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage "diasporic citizenship" and African-American cultural and political activities.<ref>Weheliye (205), ''Phonographies'', p. 147.</ref> Gilroy states that the "power of [hip hop] music [lies] in developing black struggles by communicating information, organizing consciousness, and testing out or deploying ... individual or collective" forms of African-American cultural and political actions.<ref name="Gilroy, Paul 1993"/> In the third chapter of ''The Black Atlantic'', "Jewels Brought from Bondage: Black Music and the Politics of Authenticity", Gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities. What Gilroy calls the "Black Atlantic" music's rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about African-American "blackness", a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around [[Essentialism|essentialist and anti-essentialist]] arguments. As such, Gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work, responsibility, and future role of black cultural and artistic production.<ref>Gilroy (1993), ''The Black Atlantic'', p. 109.</ref>

==Traditional vs. progressive views==

==Reception==
===Commercialization and stereotyping===
In 2012, hip hop and rap pioneer [[Chuck D]], from the group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] criticized young hip hop artists from the 2010s, stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in [[underground music]] and turned it into commercialized pop music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/09/07/public-enemy-chuck-d-young-rappers/ |title=AOL Radio Stations &#124; Free Internet Radio &#124; AOL Radio |publisher=Spinner.com |access-date=October 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628131833/http://www.spinner.com/2012/09/07/public-enemy-chuck-d-young-rappers/ |archive-date=June 28, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> In particular, seminal figures in the early underground, politically motivated music, such as [[Ice-T]], have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/09/19/icet_slams_modern_hiphop_music "Ice-T Slams Modern Hip-Hop Music"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728225803/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/09/19/icet_slams_modern_hiphop_music |date=July 28, 2013 }}, StarPulse.com, September 19, 2011.</ref> Critics have stated that 2010s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of African-American culture and are [[poseur]] gangsters.

Hip hop has been criticized by [[Rock music|rock-centric]] critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]. These critics are advocating a viewpoint called "[[rockism]]" which favors music written and performed by the individual artist (as seen in some famous [[singer-songwriter]]-led rock bands) and is against 2000s (decade)-era hip hop, which these critics argue give too large a role to [[record producer]]s and digital [[sound recording]]. Hip hop is seen as being too violent and explicit, in comparison with rock. Some contend that the criticisms have racial overtones, as these critics deny that hip hop is an art form and praising rock genres that prominently feature white males.<ref>Kelefa Sanneh, "The Rap Against Rockism." 2004.</ref>

===Marginalization of women===

The hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its [[gender bias]] and its negative impacts on women in African-American culture. [[Gangsta rap]] artists such as [[Eazy-E]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Dr. Dre]] have, primarily in the 90's, rapped lyrics that portray women as sex toys and inferior to or otherwise dependent upon men.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Negative Influence of Gangster Rap And What Can Be Done About It|url = https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/mediarace/negative.htm|website = web.stanford.edu|access-date = October 11, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150823143058/http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/mediarace/negative.htm|archive-date = August 23, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape, assault, and murder.<ref name="sagepub3">{{cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Kubrin | first2 = Charis E. | author-link1 = Ronald Weitzer | author-link2 = Charis E.

Hip hop music frequently promotes masculine [[Hegemonic masculinity|hegemony]] and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men.<ref name="sagepub3"/> The portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. There is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/792/3/the-influence-of-rap-and-hip-hop-music-an-analysis-on-audience-perceptions-of-misogynistic-lyrics|title = The Influence of Rap and Hip-Hop Music: An Analysis on Audience Perceptions of Misogynistic Lyrics|last = Cundiff|first = Gretchen|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150928005038/http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/792/3/the-influence-of-rap-and-hip-hop-music-an-analysis-on-audience-perceptions-of-misogynistic-lyrics|archive-date = September 28, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the [[Objectification of women|object of male pleasure]].<ref>{{cite web|title = "WHERE MY GIRLS AT?"

The misrepresentation of women, primarily woman of color, as objects rather than other human beings and the presence of male dominance in hip hop extends back to the birth of the genre. However, many female artists have also emerged in shedding light on both their personal issues and the misrepresentations of women in hip-hip and culture. These artists include but are not limited to [[Queen Latifah]], TLC and [[MC Lyte]]. Despite the success of them and others, female rappers remain proportionally few in the mainstream industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Independent Lens .

Very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop, and the most popular, successful and influential artists, [[record producer]]s and music executives are males. Women who are in rap groups, such as [[Lauryn Hill]] of the [[Fugees]], tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/16024/3_muhammad_kareem.pdf?sequence=8 |title = Cash rules everything around me: the high price of sustaining hip hop community in Chicago |last = Muhammad |first = Kareem |year = 2010 |journal = PHD Dissertation, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112203706/https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/16024/3_muhammad_kareem.pdf?sequence=8 |archive-date = January 12, 2016 |url-status = live }}</ref>

====Marginalization of Latinas====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}
{{main|Latina stereotypes in hip hop}}
Latinas, especially Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican women, are degraded and fetishized in hip hop.
White women and Asian women are also fetishized in hip hop but not as much as Latinas, who are referred to as "Spanish". Latinas, especially Puerto Rican models and Dominican models, are often portrayed as an object of sexual desire in hip hop videos.

===Homophobia and transphobia===
{{Main|Homophobia in hip hop culture}}
As well, the hip hop music community has been criticized with accusations of [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title = Conscious Women Rock the Page: Using Hip-hop Fiction to Incite Social Change|last = Hall|first = Marcella Runell|publisher = Sister Outsider EntertainmentNew York: Sister Outsider Entertainment|year = 2008|location = New York|pages = 147–148}}</ref> Hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs (most popularly, the pejorative term "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]") and sometimes violent threats towards [[queer]] people, such as rapper [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]'s "Where the Hood At," rapper [[Eazy-E]]'s "Nobody Move," rap group [[Brand Nubian]]'s "Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2012/07/18/timeline-hip-hop-homophobia|title = Howls & Echoes|date = November 17, 2015|access-date = December 9, 2015|website = Advocate.com|publisher = Advocate|last = Heigl|first = Alex|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211095103/http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2012/07/18/timeline-hip-hop-homophobia|archive-date = December 11, 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or transphobia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://howlandechoes.com/2015/07/hip-hop-homophobia-ignorance|title = Hip Hop and Homophobia: An Ingrained Ignorance|date = July 15, 2015|access-date = December 9, 2015|website = Howls & Echoes|publisher = Howls & Echoes|last = Turner|first = Mitchell|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112203707/http://howlandechoes.com/2015/07/hip-hop-homophobia-ignorance/|archive-date = January 12, 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> These artists include [[Ja Rule]], who in an interview claimed,"We need to go step to MTV and Viacom, and let's talk about all these fucking shows that they have on MTV that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids can't watch this shit,"<ref name="Grant"/> and rap artist [[Erick Sermon]], who has said publicly,"[Hip hop] will never accept transgender rappers."<ref name="Ziegler"/>

Until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the [[LGBT community|lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community]]. This has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people, making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in.<ref name=":0" /> Despite this prejudice, some queer/[[genderqueer]] rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s.

Having its roots in [[reggae]], [[disco]], [[funk]] and [[soul music]], hip hop has since expanded worldwide. Its expansion includes events like Afrika Bambaataa's 1982 releasing of ''[[Planet Rock: The Album|Planet Rock]]'', which tried to establish a more global harmony. In the 1980s, the British [[Slick Rick]] became the first international hit hip hop artist not native to America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} From the 1980s onward, television made hip hop global. From ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' to Public Enemy's world tour, hip hop spread to Latin America and became a mainstream culture.

Black female artists such as [[Queen Latifah]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[MC Lyte]] have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Clay|first1=Andreana|title=Keepin' it Real: Black Youth, Hip-Hop Culture, and Black Identity|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=2003|volume=46|issue=10|page=1354|doi=10.1177/0002764203046010005|s2cid=144706751}}</ref> Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchize black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative.

For women, artists such as Missy Elliott, Lil' Kim, Young M.A. and others are providing mentorship for new female MCs. In addition, there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish.<ref name="Nielson" />
