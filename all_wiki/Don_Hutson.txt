'''Donald Montgomery Hutson''' (January 31, 1913 – June 26, 1997) was an American professional [[American football|football]] player and assistant coach in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played as an [[End (gridiron football)|end]] and spent his entire 11-year professional career with the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Under head coach [[Curly Lambeau]], Hutson led the Packers to four [[NFL Championship Games]], winning three: [[1936 NFL Championship Game|1936]], [[1939 NFL Championship Game|1939]], and [[1944 NFL Championship Game|1944]].

In his senior season at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1934, Hutson was recognized as a consensus [[1934 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] and won a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] with the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football]] team. After his career at Alabama, he joined the Packers in 1935 and played 11 seasons before he retired in 1945. He led the league in receiving yards in seven separate seasons and in receiving touchdowns in nine. A talented [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] on defense, he also led the NFL in interceptions in 1940. Hutson was an eight-time [[All-Pro]] selection, a four-time All-Star, and was twice awarded the [[Joe F. Carr Trophy]] as the [[NFL Most Valuable Player]].

Hutson is considered to have been the first modern receiver,<ref name=sportsc>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014269.html|work=ESPN|publisher=Sports Century|title=Hutson was first modern receiver|author=David Whitley|access-date=March 29, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205164624/http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014269.html|archive-date=December 5, 2004|url-status=live}}</ref> and is credited with creating many of the modern [[Route (gridiron football)|pass routes]] used in the NFL today.

Hutson's number 14 was the first jersey [[Retired number|retired]] by the Packers, and he is a member of the [[Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame]]. In 1969, Hutson was selected to the [[National Football League 50th Anniversary All-Time Team]] as one of the greatest players of the NFL's first 50 years. In 1994, Hutson was selected to the [[National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team]] as one of the greatest players of the NFL's first 75 years. In 2019, he was unanimously selected to the [[NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team]] as one of the greatest players of the NFL's first 100 years.

==Early years and college==
Hutson was born on January 31, 1913, in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], one of three sons of Roy B. Hutson and Mabel Clark Hutson. While a [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], he played with snakes.

As a [[Senior (education)|senior]] at [[Pine Bluff High School]] he was an all-state [[basketball]] player, which he said was his favorite sport. "I'm like most [athletes]," he said.

Hutson was recognized as a first-team [[1934 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] for six different organizations and received a second-team selection by one other. In an attempt to name retroactive [[Heisman Trophy]] winners before its first year of 1936, Hutson was awarded it for 1934 by the [[National Football Foundation]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=National Football Foundation|title=A Hall of Fame Class for the Ages|journal=Footballetter|date=Summer 2009|volume=51|issue=3|page=2|url=http://www.footballfoundation.org/Portals/7/nff/file_file/2009_footballetter_issue_3.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126011919/http://www.footballfoundation.org/Portals/7/nff/file_file/2009_footballetter_issue_3.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 26, 2013|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2016/07/don_hutson_the_babe_ruth_of_fo.html|title=Don Hutson, the Babe Ruth of wide receivers and Alabama's greatest football player|work=The Birmingham News|last1=Stephenson|first1=Creg|date=July 1, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811103737/http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2016/07/don_hutson_the_babe_ruth_of_fo.html|archive-date=August 11, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] coach [[William Alexander (coach)|Bill Alexander]] once said, "All Don Hutson can do is beat you with clever hands and the most baffling change of pace I've ever seen."<ref name=zipp>{{cite web|url=http://acumen.lib.ua.edu/u0003/0000511/0000112|title=Alabama's grid stars of '20's put gravy in bowls|author=[[Zipp Newman]]|date=September 11, 1955|work=Birmingham News|accessdate=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816103746/http://acumen.lib.ua.edu/u0003/0000511/0000112|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==NFL career==

When he graduated from Alabama, Hutson did not plan on playing professionally, since the NFL was not highly regarded in the South compared to college football.<ref name=E22/> But [[Green Bay Packers]] head coach [[Curly Lambeau]] saw Hutson as the perfect receiver for his passing attack, which at the time was headed by quarterback [[Arnie Herber]] and end [[John McNally (American football)|John "Blood" McNally]]. Before the draft existed, college players could sign with any team they wanted, and while Hutson did sign a contract with Green Bay, he had also signed a contract with the NFL's [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. Both contracts came to the NFL office at the same time, and NFL president [[Joseph Carr]] declared that Hutson would go to Green Bay, as the Green Bay contract had an earlier date of signing.<ref name=E22>Eisenberg 2009, p. 22</ref> Hutson later stated he chose the Packers because they offered the most money—$300 a game. "That was far and above what they had ever paid a player," said Hutson. "Each week they'd give me a check for $150 from one bank and $150 from another so nobody would know how much I was getting paid."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lea|first1=Bud|title=Hutson recalls the glory years|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19850918&id=OoVQAAAAIBAJ&pg=6644,4411438&hl=en|accessdate=June 9, 2016|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=September 18, 1985|page=1}}</ref>

In 1941, Hutson became the first receiver to catch 50 passes in a season,<ref name=E22/> doing so while again leading the league in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns. He also scored two rushing touchdowns, for a total of 12. After the season, he was awarded the [[Joe F. Carr Trophy]] as the league's most valuable player. He received six of the nine first place votes, finishing ahead of his quarterback [[Cecil Isbell]], who received two first place votes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Don Hutson Voted Most Valuable Pro|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19420212&id=pU5QAAAAIBAJ&pg=2346,6948119&hl=en|accessdate=June 13, 2016|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|agency=Associated Press|date=February 12, 1942|page=4}}</ref>

Hutson repeated as league MVP in 1942 as he shattered most of his own records; he caught 74 passes for 1,211 yards and 17 touchdowns and averaged over 110 receiving yards per game. He again received six of nine first place votes for the Joe F. Carr Trophy. "The selection did not rest alone on his great pass catching ability," reasoned the selection committee.

[[File:Chairroute.png|thumb|220px|Diagram of the [[Chair (route)|chair route]], a Hutson innovation]]
For the third time in as many years Hutson announced his retirement, and for the third time he returned as a player in 1945. A sportswriter for ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'' jokingly declared Hutson "holder of the world's record for coming out of retirement."<ref>{{cite news|title=Packers Picked As Pro Team To Conquer|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19451001&id=WOUdAAAAIBAJ&pg=3681,5070236&hl=en|accessdate=June 15, 2016|work=The Pittsburgh Press|agency=United Press|date=October 1, 1945|page=19}}</ref> In a week three, 57–21 blowout win against the [[Detroit Lions]], Hutson set an NFL record with four touchdown receptions in a game, all of them coming in the second quarter.<ref name=JS/> He also kicked five extra points in the quarter, for a total of 29 points, which as of 2015 remains a record for points by a player in a single quarter.<ref name=sportsc/>

In all, Hutson caught 488 passes for 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns. He rushed for three touchdowns, scored two touchdowns on blocked punts, and had an interception return touchdown for a career total of 105. He scored at least six receiving touchdowns in each of his 11 seasons.<ref name=Oates/> Hutson led the NFL in receptions eight times, including five consecutive times: 1941 to 1945. He led the NFL in receiving yards seven times, including four straight times: 1941 to 1944. He led the NFL in scoring five times: 1941 to 1945. As of 2016, Hutson still holds the highest career average touchdowns per game for a receiver, at 0.85.<ref name="prohof"/> Hutson's single season record of 17 touchdown receptions in 1942 stood for 42 years until broken by receiver [[Mark Clayton (American football, born 1961)|Mark Clayton]] in 1984, a year in which Miami's quarterback [[Dan Marino]] had more completions (362) than the entire 1942 Packers team's pass attempts (330).<ref name="prohof"/> His four receiving touchdowns in a game has been surpassed three times and tied several times,<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL Single Game Receiving Touchdowns Leaders|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_td_single_game.htm|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405032949/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_td_single_game.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> but his four in a single quarter has yet to be matched.

At his peak, Hutson was a challenge to defend, even when opposing coaches deployed their best defender or multiple defenders against him. This was mainly because no one had ever seen anything like him in the NFL before.<ref name=PowerSweep>{{cite web|url= https://thepowersweep.com/blog/don-hutson-was-almost-literally-unstoppable|title=Don Hutson Was Almost Literally Unstoppable|author1=John Meerdink|work=The Power Sweep|date=June 26, 2017}}</ref> Hutson's ability to beat defenders was remarkable considering he played in an era when there were far fewer restrictions on how and when a defender could legally hit a receiver. It was initially thought that the 6-1, 185-pound Hutson was too fragile for the NFL. However, according to [[Tony Canadeo]], who played alongside Hutson from 1941 to 1944, Hutson was as skilled going over the middle as he was going deep.<ref name=sportsc/>

===Defense and special teams===
For many of his 11 seasons, Hutson was also the Packers' [[Place kicker|kicker]]. He added 172 [[extra point]]s on 183 attempts and seven [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] on 15 attempts for another league record 823 points. He led the league in extra points made and attempted in 1941, 1942 and 1945 and in field goals made in 1943. As did almost all players in his day, Hutson played both [[Offense (sports)|offense]] and [[Defense (sport)|defense]]. On defense, he played [[Safety (American football position)|safety]] and [[Interception|intercepted]] 30 passes over the final six years of his career.{{efn|Interceptions were not counted in statistics until the 1940 season.}} His highest season total was in 1943, when he intercepted eight passes in ten games. In 1940, he led the NFL with six interceptions.<ref name="prohof"/>

Hutson was a player-coach during the last two seasons of his playing career. After his retirement as a player, Hutson remained on the Packers staff as an assistant until 1948.<ref name=Manoyan/>

==Personal and later life==
From an early age Hutson was interested in business. "At the university [of Alabama], I was the only athlete in the business school," he said. "The only reason I wanted to play pro sports was to get a stake."<ref name=Oates/> While both were students at Alabama, he partnered with Bear Bryant to operate a laundromat in Tuscaloosa called Captain Kidd Cleaners. However, neither were educated in laundering, and they sold the business after two years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barra|first1=Allen|title=The Last Coach: A Life of Paul "Bear" Bryant|date=2006|publisher=W.

I just wanted to run a business, any business.<ref name=Oates/> He also served on the Packers board of directors from 1952 to 1980, when he was elected a director emeritus.<ref name=sportsc/>

After he retired from the dealership business, Hutson settled in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], where he lived until his death on June 26, 1997, at the age of 84.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|last1=Hodges|first1=Jim|title=Green Bay Great Hutson Dies at 84|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-27/sports/sp-7545_1_green-bay|accessdate=June 17, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 27, 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812120101/http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-27/sports/sp-7545_1_green-bay|archive-date=August 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2005, the Flagstad family of Green Bay donated to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an authentic Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson.

The jersey, a rare NFL artifact valued at over $17,000, was donated by son Daniel Flagstad in memory of his parents.<ref>Poling 2006, pp. 266–267.</ref>
