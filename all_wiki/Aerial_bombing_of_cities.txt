The '''aerial bombing of cities''' in [[war]]fare is an optional element of [[strategic bombing]] which became widespread during [[World War I]]. The bombing of cities grew to a vast scale in [[World War II]], and is still practiced today. The development of aerial bombardment marked an increased capacity of [[armed forces]] to deliver [[Aircraft ordnance|ordnance]] from the air against [[combatant]]s, [[military base]]s, and [[Factory|factories]], with a greatly reduced risk to its ground forces. [[Civilian casualties|Civilian]] and [[non-combatant]] [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] in bombed cities have variously been a purposeful result of the bombings, or unavoidable [[collateral damage]] depending on intent and technology. A number of multilateral efforts have been made to restrict the use of aerial bombardment so as to protect non-combatants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dannen.com/decision/int-law.html/|title=International Law on the Bombing of Civilians|archive-date=2013-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311011813/http://www.dannen.com/decision/int-law.html}}</ref>

===Venice 1849===
In 1849, Austrian forces besieging Venice launched some 200 [[incendiary balloon]]s, each carrying a 24- to 30-pound bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched from land and from the Austrian navy ship [[SMS Vulcano|SMS ''Vulcano'']] that acted as a [[balloon carrier]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Justin D.

The first ever air raid was conducted during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] by Italian forces against the Ottoman province of Libya on November 1, 1911.

In the morning of 29 October 1912 at 9:30&nbsp;a.m. the plane [[Albatros F-3]] took off from an airfield near the village of Mustafa Pasha – present day [[Svilengrad]], Bulgaria. The pilot was captain [[Radul Mikov]] with spotter and bombardier [[Prodan Tarakchiev]]. The airfield was specially created to carry out the take off and landing. According to the report weather conditions were perfect. The flight lasted for 1 hour and 20 minutes and the altitude was 500m. During the flight the crew flew over the city of [[Edirne]], discovered hidden Ottoman forces in the nearby villages and flew towards to city railroad station, near the village of [[Karaağaç, Edirne|Karaagach]]. The plane was equipped with two bombs, which were released at 10:00 am over the station. The crew landed successfully at the airfield with 4 holes on the hull.
A number of journalists and military [[attaché]]s attended the site.

===Mexican Revolution===
In May 1914, during the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution of 1910–17]], General [[Venustiano Carranza]], later president, ordered a [[biplane]] to bomb Neveria Hill adjacent to the downtown area of [[Mazatlán]] in order to take the city. The bomb landed not on target but in a city street and in the process killed four civilians, including a French diplomat, and wounded several others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Violence All Around|last=Sifton|first=John|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0674057692|page=81}}</ref><!-- For the whole paragraph-->

==World War I==
[[File:German airship bombing Warsaw.JPG|thumb|German [[airship]] [[List of Schütte-Lanz airships#SL2|Schütte Lanz SL2]] bombing [[Warsaw]] in 1914.]]
{{main|Strategic bombing during World War I}}
The first civilian target to be bombed from the air was the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]. This city, at that moment the [[National Redoubt]] of Belgium, was bombed during the night of 24–25 August 1914. Instead of targeting the surrounding fortresses, the Zeppelin LZ 25's intention was to bomb the clearly distinguishable historical centre of the city. The zeppelin dropped approximately ten bombs, killing ten people and injuring forty.
The British [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) undertook the first [[Entente Powers|Entente]] strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914 and 8 October, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in [[Cologne]] and [[Düsseldorf]]. The aeroplanes carried twenty-pound bombs, and at least one airship was destroyed.{{sfn|Madison|2005|pp=45–46}}{{sfn|Tilford Jr.|1996|pp=13–15}} On 19 January 1915 two German [[Zeppelin]]s dropped 24 fifty-kilogram (110&nbsp;lb) high-explosive bombs and ineffective three-kilogram incendiaries on the English towns of [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Sheringham]], [[King's Lynn]], and the surrounding villages; in all, four people were killed, 16 injured, and monetary damage was estimated at £7,740.<ref>

London was bombed for the first time on 30 May 1915. In July 1916, the German government allowed directed raids against urban centers, sparking 23 [[airship]] raids in 1916 in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved and the Germans also introduced large bomber aircraft for bombing Britain. In 1917 and 1918 there were only eleven Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on 5 August 1918, which resulted in the death of KK [[Peter Strasser]], commander of the German Naval Airship Department. By the end of the war, 51 raids had been undertaken, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Near the Flying Time|last=Petrescu|first=Florian Ion|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2011|isbn=978-1447752813|page=141}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900|last=Roberts|first=Andrew|publisher=Hachette UK|year=2010|isbn=978-0297865247}}</ref> In the course of the Zeppelin raids the Germans lost more than half their airships and 40% of their crew. It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond material damage inflicted, in diverting and hampering wartime production, and diverting twelve squadrons and over 10,000 men to air defenses.<ref name=":0" />
The British developed an [[Independent Force]] of long-range bombers that could bomb Berlin, but the war ended before these raids began.

After the war, bombers' increasing sophistication led to the general belief that aerial bombing would both destroy cities and be impossible to stop; as [[Stanley Baldwin]] stated in a 1932 speech, "[[The bomber will always get through]]".

== Interbellum period ==

===Iraqi revolt against the British===
After World War I, there were protests in Iraq against continued British rule. Many Iraqis across a wide spectrum of opinion opposed the British Mandate for Iraq. The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] began, with peaceful demonstrations in May 1920. Initial demands were rejected by the British administration, and fighting broke out in June 1920. This was suppressed, with many deaths, and at very high costs to the Empire. A policy of 'aerial policing', an invention of Winston Churchill's was brought in. This amounted to bombing restive civilians, followed up by pacification by ground troops. This continued up to the mid 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1924/1924%20-%200517.PDF|title=Lord Thomson 1924 – Note from Air Ministry, August 14, 1924|website=flightglobal.com|access-date=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306101159/https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1924/1924%20-%200517.PDF|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> The aerial campaign included [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet]], who commanded a [[Vickers Vernon]] squadron engaged in the bombing and strafing of recalcitrant civilians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Longmate|first=Norman |title=The Bombers: The RAF offensive against Germany 1939–1945 |publisher= London: Hutchinson|year=1983 |isbn= 0-09-151580-7 |page=139}}</ref> Harris felt that the Arab civilians required this kind of "heavy hand" treatment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corum|first1= James S |last2= Johnson |first2=Wray R.|title=Airpower in Small Wars: Fighting Insurgents and Terrorists (Modern War Studies)|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year= 2003|isbn=978-0700612406|page=65}}</ref>

Following the end of World War I, the British stepped up their efforts in their war against the Somali [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]], led by the so-called "[[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|Mad Mullah]]", whom they had been fighting for the control the area formerly known as [[British Somaliland]]. However, they had been unable to defeat the Dervish movement for nearly 25 years.

===Second Italo-Abyssinian War===
The [[Italy|Italians]] used aircraft against the [[Ethiopia]]n cities in the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. For example, in February 1936, the Italian invasion forces in the south prepared for a major thrust towards the city of [[Harar]]. On 22 March, the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' bombed Harar and [[Jijiga]] as a prelude. Both cities were reduced to ruins even though Harar had been declared an "[[open city]]".<ref>Barker, A.

===Spanish Civil War===
During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalists under [[Francisco Franco]] made extensive use of aerial bombing on civilian targets. [[Nazi Germany]] gave aircraft to Franco to support the overthrow of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] government. The first major example of this came in November 1936, when German and Spanish aircraft bombed Republican-held [[Madrid]]; this bombardment was sustained throughout the [[Siege of Madrid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/SPmadrid.htm|title=Madrid during the Spanish Civil War|last=Simkin|first=John|website=Spartacus Educational}}</ref> [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] were also targeted in this way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Greatest Briton: Essays on Winston Churchill's Life and Political Philosophy|last=Havardi|first=Jeremy|publisher=Shepheard-Walwyn|year=2010|isbn=978-0856833359}}</ref> On 26 April 1937, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' ([[Condor Legion]]) [[bombing of Guernica|bombed the Spanish city of Guernica]] carrying out the most high-profile aerial attack of the war.

The [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] government also used aerial bombings, but not as extensively, as they did not have as many planes available. Cities like [[Valladolid]], [[Granada]], [[Sevilla]], [[Zaragoza]] or [[Burgos]] were bombarded, killing some people.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
[[File:Casualties of a mass panic - Chungking, China.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Casualties of a mass panic during a Japanese [[Bombing of Chongqing|air raid in Chongqing (Chungking)]].]]

During the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, the Japanese widely used airplanes to indiscriminately bomb key targets and cities, such as [[Mukden]]. After the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]], in conjunction with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]], began relentlessly bombing [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]] (Peking), [[Tianjin]] (Tientsin) and several cities on the Chinese coast from the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937.

The bombing campaigns on Nanking and Canton which started in September 1937 evoked protests from the Western powers culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the [[League of Nations]]. An example of the many expressions of indignation came from Lord Cranborne, the British Under-Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs: <blockquote>Words cannot express the feelings of profound horror with which the news of these raids had been received by the whole civilized world. They are often directed against places far from the actual area of hostilities. The military objective, where it exists, seems to take a completely second place. The main object seems to be to inspire terror by the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians&nbsp;...<ref>{{cite book |title=The Illustrated London News, Marching to War 1933–1939 |publisher=Doubleday |year=1989 |page=135}}</ref>

Germany began aerial bombing of British cities immediately after the British declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, while the first British bombing raids against Germany were on the night of 15/16 May of 1940, with 78 bombers against oil targets, 9 against steelworks and 9 against marshalling yards, all military and industrial targets in the German hinterland.<ref>Ellis, Major L.F., "The War In France And Flanders 1939–1940"</ref> Oil remained the main British objective until the summer of 1941, although German cities and towns were regularly bombed from May 1940. Previous raids had been carried out by the RAF, but when targets were not found, the bombers returned without making an attack.

After the [[Fall of France]], the Luftwaffe redirected its full attention to the United Kingdom.

The bombing campaign was known in the UK as "[[the Blitz]]", and ran from September 1940 through to May 1941. The [[Coventry Blitz]] and the [[Belfast Blitz]] were two of the heaviest of all bombings by the Luftwaffe, killing 568–1,000 civilians of Coventry, killing over 1,100 civilians in [[Belfast]], and destroying much of both city centres.

British bombing policy evolved during the war. In the beginning, the RAF was forbidden to attack urban targets in Germany due to the risk of accidental civilian casualties.<ref>Cox, Sebastian, "The Strategic Air War Against Germany, 1939–1945", pp. 1, 2</ref> Following a German attack on military targets in the [[Orkney]] Islands on 16 March 1940 that killed a civilian, the RAF mounted an attack on the seaplane base on the island of [[Sylt]].<ref>Terraine, John, "The Right of the Line", p. 112</ref> The RAF began attacking transport targets west of the Rhine on the night of 10 May following the German invasion of the Low Countries, and military targets in the rest of Germany after the bombing of Rotterdam.<ref>Ellis, p. 57</ref> On 9 September 1940 RAF crews were instructed that due to the "indiscriminate" nature of German bombing, if they failed to find their assigned targets they were to attack [[Target of opportunity|targets of opportunity]] rather than bring their bombs home.<ref>Cox p. 4</ref> On the 15/16 December the RAF carried out its first area bombing attack (destroying 45% of the city of [[Mannheim]]), officially in response to the raid on Coventry.<ref>Terraine p. 268</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Horst Boog|author2=Germany.

In 1942, the goals of the British attacks were defined: the primary goal was the so-called "morale bombing", to weaken the will of the civil population to resist. Following this directive intensive bombing of highly populated city centers and [[working class]] quarters started. On 30 May 1942, the [[RAF Bomber Command]] launched the first "1,000 bomber raid" when 1,046 aircraft [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|bombed Cologne]] in Operation Millennium, dropping over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on the medieval town and burning it from end to end.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyinreview.org/et_opmillen.html|title=Operation Millennium|last=Ztvordokov|first=Sheldon|date=January 2007|website=historyinreview.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Geographies of Violence: Killing Space, Killing Time|last=Doel|first=Marcus|publisher=Sage|year=2017|isbn=978-1526413888|page=cxxxix}}</ref> 411 civilians and 85 combatants were killed, more than 130,000 had to leave the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii1002|title=Devastation of Cologne, Germany|last=McDonald|first=Jason|date=2007|website=World War 2 Database}}</ref><!-- For the whole paragraph-->

UN-led coalition aircraft attacked targets in Iraqi cities, including in the capital [[Baghdad]] and the largest southern city of [[Basra]] during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/JointSTARSReCap/Documents/pageDocuments/desert_storm.pdf|title=Desert Storm |last=Grant|first=Rebecca|date=January 2011|website=Northrop Grumman}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/ns97134.pdf|title=Operation Desert Storm – Evaluation of the Air Campaign|date=June 1997|website=United States General Accounting Office}}</ref>

===Yugoslav wars===
At the beginning of the [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[Croatian War|in Croatia]] (1991), the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) carried out aerial bombing of [[Siege of Dubrovnik|Dubrovnik]] and [[Battle of Vukovar|Vukovar]].<ref>{{cite book|title=US Department of State Dispatch|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ZQJ1svMVEsC|year=1992|publisher=Office of Public Communication, Bureau of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of State|p=29}}</ref>

[[NATO]]'s aerial [[bombing of FR Yugoslavia]] in 1999, an answer to the [[Kosovo War|Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo]], included targeted aerial bombing throughout [[Serbia]], notably of targets in [[Belgrade]], [[NATO bombing of Novi Sad|Novi Sad]] and [[Niš cluster bombing|Niš]].

===Chechen wars===
Post-Soviet Russia heavily bombed the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] capital of [[Grozny]] from the air with mostly unguided munitions (including [[fuel-air explosive]]s) as well as bombarding it with a massive artillery [[barrage (artillery)|barrages]] (1994–1995, 1996 and 1999–2000), killing thousands of people (some estimates say 27,000 civilians were killed during the [[Battle of Grozny (1994–95)|1994–1995 siege]] alone<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caucasus.dk/publication1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083643/http://www.caucasus.dk/publication1.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Battle(s) of Grozny|archive-date=July 20, 2011|website=www.caucasus.dk}}</ref>) including civilians during the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s. Although the Russian pilots and soldiers were ordered to attack designated targets only, such as the [[Presidential Palace, Grozny|Presidential Palace]], due to their inexperience and lack of training, Russian soldiers and pilots bombed and shelled random targets inside the city. In 2003, the UN still called Grozny the most destroyed city on earth.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6414603.stm Scars remain amid Chechen revival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731041611/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6414603.stm |date=2016-07-31}}, BBC News, 3 March 2007</ref>

{{main|Aerial bombardment and international law}}

[[Air warfare]], theoretically, must comply with [[laws and customs of war]], including [[international humanitarian law]] by protecting the victims of the conflict and refraining from attacks on protected persons.<ref name="Gomez">{{cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Javier Guisández|date=20 June 1998|title=The Law of Air Warfare|journal=[[International Review of the Red Cross]]|volume=nº 323|issue=323|pages=347–63|doi=10.1017/S0020860400091075|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106232251/http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList200/42F64C9A4212EA07C1256B66005C0BF1|archive-date=6 January 2010}}</ref>

These restraints on aerial warfare are covered by the general laws of war, because unlike war on land and at sea&nbsp;– which are specifically covered by rules such as the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] and [[Protocol I]] additional to the [[Geneva Conventions]], which contain pertinent restrictions, prohibitions and guidelines&nbsp;– there are no treaties specific to aerial warfare.<ref name="Gomez"/>

To be legal, aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law: ''[[military necessity]]'', ''[[distinction (law)|distinction]]'', and ''[[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]'':<ref name="Gomez"/> An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a [[legitimate military target|legitimate military objective]], and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
