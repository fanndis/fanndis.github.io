==History==
[[Image:East bay street 2222.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Most of the older neighborhoods have [[Quercus virginiana|Southern live oak]]s overarching the streets, such as these on East Bay Street.]]

===Pre-Revolution===
In 1526 a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] expedition under [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] founded a colony on [[Waccamaw Neck]] called [[San Miguel de Guadalupe]]. The settlers included enslaved Africans, and was the first European settlement in North America with African slaves. The colony failed for multiple reasons including a fever [[epidemic]] and a revolt of the slaves, who escaped to join the indigenous [[Cofitachequi]] Indians in the area. Having failed as farmers, the surviving Spanish built a ship from local [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] and [[oak]] trees and sailed to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The next settlement in the area was by English colonists. After settling [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]] in 1670, the [[England|English]] established trade with regional [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]]. Trading posts in the outlying areas quickly developed as settlements.

By 1721 the colonial government granted the English residents' petition to found a new parish, [[Prince George Winyah Episcopal Church|Prince George, Winyah]], on the [[Black River (South Carolina)|Black River]]. In 1734, Prince George, Winyah was divided; and the newly created [[Prince Frederick Parish]] congregation occupied the church at Black River. Prince George Parish, Winyah encompassed the new town of Georgetown that was developing on the [[Sampit River]].

In 1729, [[Elisha Screven]] laid the plan for Georgetown and developed the city in a four-by-eight block grid. The original grid city is listed as a historic district on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It bears the original street names, lot numbers, and has many original homes.

The Indian trade declined soon after Georgetown was established. Planters established large plantations and cultivated [[indigo]] as the cash commodity crop, with [[rice]] as a secondary crop. Both were labor-intensive and dependent on [[slavery in the United States|slave labor]], primarily workers imported from Africa in the Atlantic slave trade.<ref>Note: Indigo production in [[British India]] soon eclipsed the production of indigo in the Carolinas, and rice took its place as the chief commodity crop.</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Agricultural profits were so great between 1735 and 1775 that in 1757 the [[Winyah Indigo Society]], whose members paid dues in indigo, opened and maintained the first [[state school|public school]] for white children between [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. Rice became the chief commodity crop by the early 19th century, and a staple of regional diets as well.

In the [[American Revolution]], the father and son Georgetown planters, Thomas Lynch Sr. and [[Thomas Lynch Jr.]], signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. During the final years of the conflict, Georgetown was the important port for supplying General [[Nathanael Greene]]'s army. [[Francis Marion]] (the "Swamp Fox") led many [[guerrilla]] actions in the vicinity.

===Antebellum period===

{{main|Antebellum South Carolina}}
Following the American Revolution, rice surpassed indigo as the staple crop. It was cultivated in the swampy lowlands along the rivers, where enslaved labor built large [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]]: dams, gates and canals to irrigate and drain the rice fields during cultivation. Large rice plantations were established around Georgetown along its five rivers. Planters often had chosen to import slaves from rice-growing regions of West Africa, as they knew the technology for cultivation and processing.

By 1840, the [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown District (later County)]] produced nearly one-half of the total rice crop of the United States. It became the largest rice-exporting port in the world. Wealth from the rice created an elite European-American planter class; they built stately plantation manor houses, bought elegant furniture, and extended generous hospitality to others of their class. Their relatively leisured lifestyle for a select few, built on the labor of thousands of slaves, lasted until 1860.<ref>The collapse of the rice economy was due to the abolition of slavery. The soft silt soil of the South Carolina low country required harvesting of the rice by hand. Slavery made the labor-intensive cultivation and harvesting profitable. The abolition of slavery and rise of free labor meant that the economics had changed. In addition, the disruption and destruction of the war delayed the resumption of agriculture.</ref>

The profits from Georgetown's rice trade buoyed the economy also of nearby Charleston, where a thriving mercantile economy developed. The profits from rice meant that planters bought products from Charleston artisans: fine furniture, jewelry, and silver, to satisfy their refined tastes. [[Joshua John Ward]], who owned the most slaves in the US &ndash; eventually more than 1,000 slaves on several plantations, lived in Georgetown.

Many of the historic plantation houses are still standing today, including [[Mansfield Plantation]] on the banks of the [[Black River (South Carolina)|Black River]]. Joshua Ward's main [[Brookgreen Plantation]] is the center and namesake of the [[Brookgreen Gardens]] park. Since the late 20th century, historic societies and independent plantations have worked to present more of the entire plantation world, including the lives and skills of enslaved African Americans.

Georgetown's thriving economy long attracted settlers from elsewhere, including numerous planters and shipowners who migrated from [[Virginia]]. These included the Shackelford family, whose migrant ancestor John Shackelford moved to Georgetown in the eighteenth century after serving in the Virginia forces of the [[Continental Army]]. His descendants became prominent planters, lawyers, judges and Georgetown and Charleston businessmen.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sTcVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&dq=shackelford+georgetown+south+carolina&ei=7M7WSNPTCYLwsQOToMneDg#PPA87,M1 Yates Snowden, Harry Gardner Cutler, ''History of South Carolina''], The Lewis Publishing Company, 1920</ref>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] fort and two camps were installed near Georgetown by [[Murrells Inlet]]. Fort Ward was in service beginning in 1861 but was abandoned and disarmed in March 1862; its exact location is unknown due to shifting sandbars and erosion.<ref>Payette, Peter.

===Reconstruction and post-reconstruction period===

[[File:Arcadia Plantation 1893 Georgetown County.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Arcadia Plantation, circa 1893, Georgetown vicinity, [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown County]]]]
Georgetown and Georgetown County suffered terribly during the [[Reconstruction Era]] because of its continued reliance on agriculture, for which the national market was low. In addition, the rice crops of 1866–88 were failures due to lack of capital, which prevented adequate preparation for new crops; inclement weather; and the planters' struggle to find laborers.

Some [[freedmen]] left the area in an effort to reunite families separated by the domestic slave trade. Many families withdrew women and children from working as field laborers. Many freedmen families wanted to work for themselves as [[subsistence farmers]], rather than work in gangs for major planters. Rice continued to be grown commercially until about 1910, but the market had changed. It was never as important economically or as profitable a crop as before 1860.

By the time the Reconstruction period ended, the area's economy was shifting to harvesting and processing wood products. By 1900 several lumber mills were operating on the [[Sampit River]]. The largest was the [[Atlantic Coast Lumber Company]]; its mill in Georgetown was the largest lumber mill on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] at the time.

===20th century===
Around 1905, "Georgetown reached its peak as a lumber port", according to the historian Mac McAlister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/2012/10/14/3112595/wooden-boat-show-sails-into-georgetown.html|title=Wooden Boat Show sails into Georgetown|last=Palisin|first=Steve|work=[[The Sun News]]|date=2012-10-14|accessdate=2012-10-19}}</ref>

As the twentieth century dawned, Georgetown under the leadership of Mayor [[William Doyle Morgan]] began to modernize. The city added electricity, telephone service, sewer facilities, rail connections, some paved streets and sidewalks, new banks, a thriving port, and a new public school for white students. Public schools were segregated and black schools were historically underfunded. The US government built a handsome combination post office and customs house.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Like most cities, Georgetown suffered economic deprivation during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. The [[Atlantic Coast Lumber Company]] went bankrupt early in the depression, putting almost everyone out of work. Businesses related to the mills also lost revenues and had to lay off employees, with a cascading effect through the city. In 1936 help arrived, when the Southern Kraft Division of [[International Paper]] opened a mill; by 1944 it was the largest in the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

From the mid-20th century, the city developed more industry. In 1973, the [[Korf (company)|Korf]] company of Germany founded a [[steel mill]] in town.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} in 1993, the steel mill was financed  by [[Bain Capital]] and was called Georgetown Steel, which became GST Steel Company with its sister [[Kansas City Bolt and Nut Company plant]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}
 
In 1978, Sigma Chemical Company founded its third chemical plant (the other 2 being in Italy) in Georgetown.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Part of 3V Group - 3V Sigma |url=https://www.3vsigma.com/en/part-of-3v-group |date=n.d. |website=www.3vsigma.com |language=en |access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref>
 
In September 1989, a major disaster struck the area with [[Hurricane Hugo]] struck south of Georgetown. Its extremely hard winds and an intense [[storm surge]] along the rivers flooded and damaged Georgetown and nearby areas. As Georgetown was under Hugo's northern [[eyewall]], it suffered winds more severe and damaging than in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], which was in the hurricane's weak corridor.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===2000 to present===
In recent years, the economy has become more diversified. The GST Steel Company declared bankruptcy in 2001, first closing the Kansas City plant. In 2003 it closed the South Carolina plant. The Georgetown plant has subsequently reopened under ownership of [[ArcelorMittal]]. Due to the influx of cheap foreign steel into the United States, the plant closed its doors again in August 2015.<ref name="kansascity1">{{cite web| last=Helling |first=Dave |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2012/01/06/3356924/bain-capital-tied-to-bankruptcy.html |title=Bain Capital tied to bankruptcy, closing of KC steel plant |publisher=KansasCity.com |date=2012-01-06 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref name="kansascity2">{{cite web| author=David Wren |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2012/01/14/3370204/romneys-bain-made-millions-as.html |title=Romney's Bain made millions as S.C. steelmaker went bankrupt |publisher=KansasCity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kchistory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Local&CISOPTR=22900&CISOBOX=1&REC=14 |title=Missouri Valley Special Collections: Item Viewer |publisher=Kchistory.org |date=2001-02-08 |accessdate=2012-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234803/http://www.kchistory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FLocal&CISOPTR=22900&CISOBOX=1&REC=14 |archivedate=2013-01-16 }}</ref><ref name="reuters1">{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Andy |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/06/us-campaign-romney-bailout-idUSTRE8050LL20120106 |title=Special report: Romney's steel skeleton in the Bain closet |work=Reuters |date= 2012-01-06|accessdate=2012-02-01}}</ref>
