The '''2008 Australian Open''' was a [[tennis]] tournament played on [[Tennis court#Hard courts|outdoor hard courts]]. It was the 96th edition of the [[Australian Open]], and the first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] event of the year. It took place at the [[Melbourne Park]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia, from 14 through 27 January 2008.

After twenty years of playing on [[Rebound Ace]], the courts were changed to [[Plexicushion]], a marginally faster surface. The new surface is thinner, and therefore has lower heat retention. This decision was made in a bid to reduce the "stick" of the court and the frequency of the [[extreme heat policy]] being invoked.<ref name=PLEX>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/tennis/7178646.stm | title = On-court blues for Aussie tennis? | publisher = BBC SPORT, Chris Bevan | date = 11 January 2008}}</ref> However, the new surface faced criticism for being too similar to [[DecoTurf]], the surface used at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]].<ref name=SUR>{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21823655-2722,00.html | title = Fears of second-rate US Open | publisher = [[The Australian]] | date = 31 May 2007 | access-date = 27 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081229105436/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21823655-2722,00.html | archive-date = 29 December 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Player reaction to the change of surface was generally ambivalent.<ref name="FED">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/federer-unimpressed-by-plexicushion/story-e6frf4mu-1111115309530|title=Federer unimpressed by Plexicushion|date=14 January 2008|work=[[Fox Sports Australia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522110646/http://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/federer-unimpressed-by-plexicushion/story-e6frf4mu-1111115309530|archive-date=22 May 2011|url-status=live|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]}}</ref><ref name="TOP">{{cite news|url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-7184355,00.html|title=Top players unimpressed by Australian Open surface|last=Cambers|first=Simon|date=29 December 2007|work=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101160223/http://sport.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-7184355,00.html|archive-date=1 January 2008|url-status=live|location=London}}</ref>

Both [[Roger Federer]] and [[Serena Williams]] were unsuccessful in defending their 2007 titles; Federer losing to [[Novak Djokovic]] in the semi-finals and Williams losing in the quarter-finals to [[Jelena Jankovic]]. Djokovic won his first Grand Slam singles title, defeating unseeded [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] in the final; [[Maria Sharapova]], runner-up to Williams in 2007, defeated [[Ana Ivanovic]] to win her first Australian Open title and third Grand Slam title.

For the mixed doubles, in every game, the first team to score four points, won the game. In other words, when a deuce happened in a game, the team who won the next point won the game.

==Notable stories==

===Surface change===
On 30 May 2007, Australian Open tournament director [[Craig Tiley]] announced that as of the 2008 Australian Open, the [[Rebound Ace]] surface that had been used since 1988 would be replaced by a newer, faster [[Plexicushion]] surface. The Rebound Ace surface had been criticized for several years, from players including [[Andy Roddick]] and [[Mark Philippoussis]], who claimed that the "stick" of the court was a contributing factor in many players injuring themselves.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/australian_open/1765862.stm | title = Tournament chief defends court surface | publisher = BBC SPORT | date = 24 January 2008}}</ref> This "stick" was a result of the thick rubber mat (10&nbsp;mm) laid beneath the surface,<ref name=SUR/> the high heat retention because of this, and the high temperatures present during the Australian summer, which intermittently resulted in the [[extreme heat policy]] being invoked. Conversely, players such as [[Pete Sampras]] and [[Marat Safin]] put the high number of injuries down to lack of preparation from players; partly due to the fact that the tournament is held so early in the year, but also because there were so few tournaments preceding it. Rebound Ace was also chastised by [[Lleyton Hewitt]] for having an inconsistent bounce, in terms of height and pace (shock absorption); and claimed that these factors varied depending on the weather.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/News.aspx?id=4&pageId=11499&HandlerId=2&archive=false&newsid=3003 | title = Hewitt supports new court surface | publisher = Tennis.com | date = 1 June 2007 | access-date = 29 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212022132/http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/News.aspx?id=4&pageId=11499&HandlerId=2&archive=false&newsid=3003 | archive-date = 12 February 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The heat retention of the surface had also been a point of contention between players.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/australian_open/6703267.stm | title = Australian Open plans new surface | publisher = BBC SPORT | date = 30 May 2007}}</ref>

In announcing the change, Tiley said Plexicushion would have a "lower rubber content than Rebound Ace, was firmer under foot and retained less heat through its thinner top layer."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tennis/open-drops-rebound-ace-for-new-surface/2007/05/30/1180205342716.html | title = Open drops Rebound Ace for new surface | publisher = The Age | date = 31 May 2007 | location=Melbourne | first=Linda | last=Pearce}}</ref> Tiley later said that the change of colour, from green to blue, would also benefit players and officials,<ref name="PLEX"/> although this change was quite arbitrary. The manufacturers of Rebound Ace derided the new surface, with director Paul Bull saying that, "We had an Australian icon event with a unique Australian product and now we are just going to become a clone of the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]]." Bull also said that the inconsistencies in pace were down to the organizers' imperative, who kept asking for the pace to be adjusted to pander for certain players, such as Hewitt. Bull, however, conceded that a change was needed; and said that the suggestion of a Rebound Ace court with a rubber mat thickness of around 5&nbsp;mm was made.<ref name=SUR/>

The [[Plexicushion]] surface received a relatively mixed reception from players. [[Lleyton Hewitt]], [[Justine Henin]] and [[Serena Williams]] were all keen to endorse the new courts; with Hewitt's appraisal focused on the greater consistency of the courts.<ref name=PLEX/> Henin called it a "good surface" but said she did not find it markedly distinguishable from Rebound Ace, saying the biggest difference was the change of colour. Williams claimed that the court was not as "bouncy" and was causing less physical strain on her feet and ankles.<ref name=FED/> One source of criticism from players was the slower than expected pace, although many of these comments came prior to the event's commencement. Players were exposed to the new courts through other tournaments, played in advance of the Open; and practise on the new surface. [[Roger Federer]] described it as slow, with [[Novak Djokovic]], [[Jelena Janković]] and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] all corroborating this opinion, albeit from experience in preliminary tournaments.<ref name=TOP/> Pundit and former World No. 1 [[Pat Rafter]] said it was possible that the courts would speed up in time.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/sport/doubts-on-new-oz-open-surface/2007/12/22/1198344862355.html?page=2 | title = Doubts on new Oz Open surface | work = [[Brisbane Times]] | date = 23 December 2007}}</ref>

===Implementation of anti-corruption policing===
On 21 December 2007, organizers of the event announced that the tournament would be watched under the scrutiny of anti-corruption officials.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7155445.stm | title = Aussie Open takes anti-fraud step | publisher = BBC SPORT | date = 21 December 2007 | access-date =22 December 2007}}</ref> A partnership was formed with [[Victoria Police]]. This announcement came in the wake of a series of scandals to hit the sport, including World No. 4 [[Nikolay Davydenko]] coming under suspicion of [[match fixing]]; with at least a dozen other players coming forward about having been approached to influence matches in an unethical manner.<ref>{{cite episode | transcript-url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s2111972.htm |transcript=Transcript| title = Tennis Australia targets match fixing | series = PM | network = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]] | station = Radio National | credits = Alison Caldwell (reporter) | airdate = 21 December 2007 <!-- |access-date =22 December 2007 -->}}</ref> [[Tennis Australia]] chief executive Steve Wood commented that, "Match-fixing and illegal gambling are a threat to the integrity of sport. We're putting our policies, procedures and programme in place to protect it."

This was followed by a statement from the wider community of the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF), [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP), [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) and organizers of all four Grand Slams that they would review their anti-corruption policies in the future. This announcement came six days prior to the start of the Open, on 8 January 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7176539.stm | title = Tennis launches corruption review | publisher = BBC SPORT | date = 8 January 2008}}</ref>

===Crowd trouble===
On 15 January, Day 2 of the tournament, Victoria Police had to intervene when [[Greek Australian]] supporters, following Greece's [[Konstantinos Economidis]] in his match against Chilean [[Fernando González]], became unruly.<ref name=COR>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7189615.stm | title = Crowd unrest mars Australian Open | publisher = BBC SPORT | date = 15 January 2008 | access-date =16 January 2008}}</ref> The match, in progress at the [[Margaret Court Arena]], was suspended for ten minutes as the police attempted stop the "offensive chanting" and eject certain fans. Approximately forty supporters, heavily outnumbered by [[Chile]]an fans,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A004AC5A-9B7C-4E16-BD66-2D5F41D4796A.htm | title = Crowd trouble hits Australian Open | publisher = [[Al-Jazeera English]] | date = 15 January 2008 | access-date =16 January 2008}}</ref> were warned of their disorderly conduct prior to the police deploying [[pepper spray]]. The police regiment was heavily outnumbered, with a [[BBC Radio]] employee commenting that, "[there were] two guys against maybe 70-80, that's not good."<ref name="COR"/> Tournament officials said that 3 people had been sprayed and 5 evicted; a small proportion of the Greek fans left the arena, upset at how events were transpiring and fearing for their safety.

Both players said that the trouble was not something they had witnessed before; and Economidis condemned his supporters, saying that, "It was a really nice atmosphere until this moment. I am really unhappy." Some witnesses have implicated [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] and [[Serbia]]n supporters in the trouble.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/tennis/crowd-trouble-at-australian-open/2008/01/15/1200159452093.html | title = Crowd trouble at Australian Open | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 15 January 2008 | access-date =16 January 2008}}</ref>

Australian Open director, Craig Tiley, had announced in the week preceding the event that police and security forces would "impose a 'zero-tolerance' policy on anti-social behaviour". This statement appeared to be a delayed reaction to the trouble that marred the event in 2007, with Australian youths of Greek, Serbian and [[Croats|Croatian]] origins involved in mutually abusive sparring. However, the problem was much more pronounced in 2007, with violence breaking out and around 150 fans ejected.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/tennis/serbs-croats-clash-at-open/2007/01/15/1168709659893.html?page=fullpage | title = Serbs, Croats clash at Open | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald, Jessica Halloran | date = 15 January 2007 | access-date =16 January 2008}}</ref>

===Sexual assault===
Police were called to investigate a report that a 12-year-old girl was indecently assaulted by a drunk man at the Australian Open.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23061194-661,00.html | title = 12-year-old reportedly molested at Australian Open | publisher = [[Herald Sun]] | date = 16 January 2008}}</ref>

In a brief statement, Victoria Police said they received a report that the girl was inappropriately touched on the buttocks on Monday.

"The matter was reported to police this morning and the incident is currently being investigated", the statement said. This event mirrors a series of incidents that occurred at last year's event, when several men attending the tournament were arrested for taking [[upskirt]] photographs.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/sports/view_article.php?article_id=45327 | title = Third up-skirt incident mars Australian Open | publisher = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 24 January 2007 | access-date = 29 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126075334/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/sports/view_article.php?article_id=45327 | archive-date = 26 January 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Marcos Baghdatis video controversy===
During the Open, a video posted on [[YouTube]] almost a year earlier made headlines in the Australian media. The video shows the 2008 fifteenth seed, [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[Marcos Baghdatis]], at a barbecue hosted by his [[Greek Australian]] fans in Melbourne in early 2007. In it, Baghdatis is holding a flare and taking part in chants against the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. Melbourne's [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot]] community called for Baghdatis to be expelled from Australia,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23071537-29277,00.html |title=Kick out Baghdatis, say Turkish Cypriots |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=18 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321140225/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C23071537-29277%2C00.html |archive-date=21 March 2009 }}</ref> but in a statement issued through his manager, the Cypriot player said he was "supporting the interest of my country, Cyprus, while protesting against a situation that is not recognized by the United Nations".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tennis/banish-baghdatis-say-angry-turks/2008/01/18/1200620184170.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | title = Ban Baghdatis, say Turks | publisher = [[The Age]], Reko Rennie | date = 18 January 2008 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>

The women's draw saw [[Jelena Janković]], the 2001 girls' champion, and [[Ana Ivanovic]] produce notable performances to reach the semi-finals and the final, respectively. Janković saved three match points against [[Tamira Paszek]] in the first round, before defeating rising Australian player [[Casey Dellacqua]] in the fourth round.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-20/dellacquas-dream-run-ends-at-open/1018026 Dellacqua's dream run ends at Open - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref> Janković then ended the [[2007 Australian Open &ndash; Women's Singles|title defence]] of [[Serena Williams]] in the quarter-finals,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-22/serena-sent-packing-in-melbourne/1019770 Serena sent packing in Melbourne - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref> before losing her semi-final to [[Maria Sharapova]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/tennis/sharapova-to-face-ivanovic/2008/01/24/1201025068943.html Sharapova to face Ivanovic - Tennis - Sport]</ref> Twenty-four hours after Janković's victory over Serena Williams, Ana Ivanovic recorded her first career victory against [[Venus Williams]] in her quarter-final,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-23/ivanovic-topples-venus/1021112 Ivanovic topples Venus - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref> and went on to reach her second Grand Slam final by defeating [[Daniela Hantuchová]] in the semi-finals, having to recover from a 0&ndash;6, 0&ndash;2 deficit to do so.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-24/ivanovic-wrestles-into-open-final/1022690 Ivanovic wrestles into Open final - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref> Ivanovic was then defeated in the final by [[Maria Sharapova]], in a match dubbed as the "Glam Slam" final.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/tennis/expect-substance-and-style-in-blonde-v-brunette-glam-slam/2008/01/25/1201157667043.html Expect substance and style in blonde v brunette glam slam - Tennis - Sport]</ref>

Seeds [[Roger Federer]], [[Novak Djokovic]], [[Fernando González]], [[David Nalbandian]], [[Tomáš Berdych]] and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] all came through unscathed; with Federer dropping only 3 games against [[Fabrice Santoro]].

===Day 5===
The first match of the night session on the [[Rod Laver Arena]] saw local player [[Casey Dellacqua]], who had previously never progressed beyond the first round at the [[Australian Open]], defeat former champion [[Amélie Mauresmo]] 3–6, 6–4, 6–4. [[Justine Henin]] struggled to get to grips with [[Francesca Schiavone]] before winning; and [[Nicole Vaidišová]] and [[Serena Williams]] set up an intriguing fourth round match, a re-match of [[2007 Australian Open|the previous year's semi-final]].

In the last match of the day, [[Philipp Kohlschreiber]], the 29th seed of Germany, defeated the 6th seeded [[Andy Roddick]] in 232 minutes: 6–4, 3–6, 7–6, 6–7, 8–6; with the match reaching its conclusion past 02:00.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news | url = http://sport.guardian.co.uk/australianopen2008/story/0,,2242933,00.html | title = Roddick dumped out after gruelling duel with Kohlschreiber | publisher = The Guardian, Paolo Bandini | date = 18 January 2008 | location=London}} Retrieved 24 February 2008</ref> Roddick was visibly perturbed during the match, which resulted in his earliest exit at the Australian Open since 2002.

===Day 6===
Day 6 in [[Melbourne]] was plagued by rain and consequently matches could only take place on the indoor courts. In the women's competition, [[Ana Ivanovic]] made light work of [[Katarina Srebotnik]] whilst [[Venus Williams]] was more sternly tested by [[Sania Mirza]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7197439.stm | title = Kuznetsova makes shock early exit | publisher = BBC SPORT | date = 19 January 2008}}</ref> However, [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] and [[Anna Chakvetadze]] both saw their tournaments ended in the third round by [[Agnieszka Radwańska]] and [[Maria Kirilenko]] respectively.

The men's competition featured two prolonged five-set matches. In the first, No. 1 seed [[Roger Federer]] was pushed to the limit by [[Janko Tipsarević]] before triumphing; 6–7, 7–6, 5–7, 6–1, 10–8 in 267&nbsp;minutes.

World number 4 [[Jelena Janković]] was handed a US$2,000 fine after allegedly receiving coaching from her mother, Snežana, during her third round match with [[Virginie Razzano]] of France. The game took place on Day 3 of the event. Umpire Maria Alves spotted the infringement during the match, and although unable to understand what had been communicated, dealt Janković a code violation for illegal coaching.

Janković denied the allegation, saying that she simply shouted 'C'mon' in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The practice of coaching during a match is banned at all [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] events.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23080328-5010361,00.html | title = Jankovic fined despite innocence plea | publisher = The Australian | date = 20 January 2008 | access-date = 20 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080124134333/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23080328-5010361,00.html | archive-date = 24 January 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Venus Williams]] fought back twice from service breaks in the first set to secure a place in the quarter-finals; with a 6–4, 6–4 win over [[Marta Domachowska]]. She next faces No. 4 seed [[Ana Ivanovic]], who put together a 6–1, 7–6 win over Denmark's [[Caroline Wozniacki]].
