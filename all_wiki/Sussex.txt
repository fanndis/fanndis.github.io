'''Sussex''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|s|ɪ|k|s}}), from the [[Old English]] ''Sūþsēaxe'' ([[South Saxons]]), is a [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] in [[South East England]] and was formerly an [[Kingdom of Sussex|independent medieval kingdom]].  It is bounded to the west by [[Hampshire]], north by [[Surrey]], northeast by [[Kent]], south by the [[English Channel]], and divided for many purposes into the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[West Sussex]] and [[East Sussex]]. 

[[Brighton and Hove]], though part of East Sussex, was made a [[unitary authority]] in 1997, and as such, is administered independently of the rest of East Sussex. Brighton and Hove was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|City status]] in 2000.  Until then, [[Chichester]] was Sussex's only city.  The [[Brighton and Hove built-up area]] is the 15th largest conurbation in the UK and [[Brighton and Hove]] is the most populous city or town in Sussex. [[Crawley]], [[Worthing]] and [[Eastbourne]] are major towns, each with a population over 100,000.  Sussex has three main geographic sub-regions, each oriented approximately east to west.  In the southwest is the fertile and densely populated [[coastal plain]].  North of this are the rolling [[chalk]] hills of the [[South Downs]], beyond which is the well-wooded [[Sussex Weald]].

Sussex was home to some of Europe's earliest known hominids (''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''), whose remains at [[Eartham Pit, Boxgrove|Boxgrove]] have been dated to 500,000 years ago.  Sussex played a key role in the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], with some of the earliest significant signs of a Roman presence in Britain.  Local chieftains allied with Rome, resulting in [[Cogidubnus]] being given a [[client kingdom]] centred on [[Chichester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Sussex-historical-county-England|title=Sussex, historical county, England|publisher=Britannica.com|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref>  The [[kingdom of Sussex]] was founded in the aftermath of the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]].  According to legend, it was founded by [[Ælle of Sussex|Ælle, King of Sussex]], in AD 477. Around 827, it was annexed by the kingdom of [[Wessex]]<ref name="EcgODNB">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |last=Edwards |first=Heather |title=Ecgberht [Egbert] (d. 839), king of the West Saxons in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |access-date=22 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714235747/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and subsequently became a county of England. Sussex played a key role in the [[Norman conquest of England]] when in 1066, [[William, Duke of Normandy]] landed at Pevensey and fought the decisive [[Battle of Hastings]].

In 1974, the [[Lord-Lieutenant]] of Sussex was replaced with one each for East and West Sussex, which became separate ceremonial counties.  Sussex continues to be recognised as a geographical territory and [[cultural region]].  It has had a single police force since 1968 and its name is in common use in the media.<ref name="BBCSx">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/england/sussex/|title=BBC News - Sussex|publisher=BBC|access-date=16 February 2013}}</ref>  In 2007, [[Sussex Day]] was created to celebrate the county's rich [[culture of Sussex|culture]] and [[history of Sussex|history]] and in 2011 the [[flag of Sussex]] was recognised by the Flag Institute.

==Toponymy==
The name "Sussex" is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Suth-sæxe'', which is in turn derived from the [[Old English]] ''Suth-Seaxe'' which means (land or people) of the [[South Saxons]] (cf. [[Essex#History|Essex]], [[Middlesex#Toponomy|Middlesex]] and [[Wessex]]). The South Saxons were a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] that settled in the region from the [[North German Plain]] during the 5th and 6th centuries.

The earliest known usage of the term South Saxons (Latin: ''Australes Saxones'') is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king, [[Nothhelm of Sussex|Noðhelm]], although the term may well have been in use for some time before that. The monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong; recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late.<ref name="lowerson"/>

Three [[United States]] [[County (United States)|counties]] (in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Delaware]], [[Sussex County, New Jersey|New Jersey]], and [[Sussex County, Virginia|Virginia]]), and a former [[Lands administrative divisions of Western Australia|county/land division]] of [[Sussex County, Western Australia|Western Australia]], are named after Sussex.

==Symbols==
{{Main|Symbols of Sussex}}
[[File:Sussex shield.svg|thumb|160px|The traditional Sussex emblem first known recording in 1611 by John Speed: ''Azure, six [[martlet]]s or'']]

The [[flag of Sussex]] consists of six gold [[martlet]]s, or heraldic [[swallow]]s, on a blue background, [[blazon]]ed as ''Azure, six [[martlet]]s or''. Officially recognised by the [[Flag Institute]] on 20 May 2011, its design is based on the [[coat of arms of Sussex|heraldic shield of Sussex]]. The first known recording of this emblem being used to represent the county was in 1611 when cartographer [[John Speed]] deployed it to represent the [[Kingdom of Sussex|Kingdom of the South Saxons]]. However it seems that Speed was repeating an earlier association between the emblem and the county, rather than being the inventor of the association. It is now firmly regarded that the county emblem originated and derived from the coat of arms of the 14th-century [[Knight of the Shire]], Sir John de Radynden.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Sussex County Flag | publisher = The Sussex County Flag| url=http://sussexflag.wordpress.com|date=December 2016 | access-date = 8 December 2016}}</ref> Sussex's six martlets are today held to symbolise the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as ''[[Rape (county subdivision)|rapes]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sussex Martlets | publisher = The Sussex County Flag| url=http://sussexflag.wordpress.com/sussexmartlets/|date=December 2016 | access-date = 8 December 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Campanulaceae - Phyteuma orbiculare.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The [[Phyteuma orbiculare|round-headed rampion]], or Pride of Sussex, is Sussex's county flower]]

''[[Sussex by the Sea]]'' is regarded as the unofficial anthem of Sussex; it was composed by [[William Ward-Higgs]] in 1907, perhaps originally from the lyrics of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem entitled ''Sussex''. Adopted by the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] and popularised in [[World War I]], it is sung at celebrations across the county, including those at [[Lewes Bonfire]], and at sports matches, including those of [[Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club]] and [[Sussex County Cricket Club]].

The county day, called [[Sussex Day]], is celebrated on 16 June, the same day as the feast day of [[St Richard of Chichester]], Sussex's [[patron saint]], whose shrine at [[Chichester Cathedral]] was an important place of pilgrimage in the [[Middle Ages]].

Sussex's motto, ''[[We wunt be druv]]'', is a [[Sussex dialect]] expression meaning "we will not be pushed around" and reflects the traditionally independent nature of Sussex men and women. The [[Round-headed Rampion|round-headed rampion]], also known as the "Pride of Sussex", was adopted as Sussex's [[county flower]] in 2002.

===Landscape===
[[File:Seven Sisters cliffs and the coastguard cottages, from Seaford Head showing Cuckmere Haven (looking east - 2003-05-26).jpg|thumb|right|The South Downs meets the sea at the [[Seven Sisters, Sussex|Seven Sisters]]]]The physical geography of Sussex relies heavily on its lying on the southern part of the [[Weald–Artois anticline|Wealden anticline]], the major features of which are the high lands that cross the county in a west to east direction: the [[Weald]] itself and the [[South Downs]]. [[Natural England]] has identified the following seven [[national character area]]s in Sussex:<ref name="NE-NCAs">{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape/englands/character/areas/southeast.aspx|title=South East and London National Character Area map|publisher=[[Natural England]]|access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>

* [[South Coast Plain]]
* [[South Downs]]
* [[Greensand Ridge|Wealden Greensand]]
* [[Low Weald]]
* [[High Weald]]
* [[Pevensey Levels]]
* [[Romney Marsh]]es

At 280m, [[Blackdown, West Sussex|Blackdown]] is the highest point in Sussex, or [[List of English counties by highest point|county top]]. [[Ditchling Beacon]] (248m) is the highest point in East Sussex. At {{convert|113|km|mi|abbr=off}} long, the [[River Medway]] is the longest river flowing through Sussex. The longest river entirely in Sussex is the [[River Arun]], which is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. Sussex's largest lakes are man-made reservoirs. The largest is [[Bewl Water]] on the Kent border, while the largest wholly within Sussex is [[Ardingly Reservoir]].

===Climate===
The coastal resorts of Sussex and neighbouring [[Hampshire]] are the sunniest places in the United Kingdom.<ref name="MetOff"/> The coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas: sea breezes, blowing off the sea, tend to clear any cloud from the coast.<ref name="VisSx">{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsussex.org/page/weather-and-climate/|title=Weather and Climate in Sussex|publisher=Visit Sussex|access-date=14 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430170843/http://www.visitsussex.org/page/weather-and-climate/|archive-date=30 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The sunshine average is approximately 1,900 hours a year; this is much higher than the UK average of 1,340 hours a year.  Most of Sussex lies in [[hardiness zone]] 8; the exception is the coastal plain west of Brighton, which lies in the milder zone 9.

Rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the South Downs with {{convert|950|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year.<ref name="VisSx"/> The close proximity of Sussex to [[the Continent]] of Europe, results in cold spells in winter and hot, humid weather in summer.<ref name="VisSx"/>

The climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea, which, because of its tendency to warm up slower than land, can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer. In the autumn months, the coast sometimes has higher temperatures.<ref name="VisSx"/> Rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers; from January to March the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems.<ref name="VisSx"/>

In winter, the east winds can be as cold as further inland.<ref name="VisSx"/> [[Selsey]] is known as a [[tornado]] hotspot, with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986, 1998 and 2000,<ref name="MetOff"/> with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated £10 million of damage to 1,000 buildings.<ref name="MetOff">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/so/print.html|title=Southern England: climate|publisher=Met Office|access-date=14 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314025659/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/so/print.html|archive-date=14 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Conurbations===
Most of Sussex's population is distributed in an east-west line along the English Channel coast or on the east-west line of the [[A272]]. The exception to this pattern is the 20th century north-south development on the [[A23 road|A23]]-[[Brighton Main Line|Brighton line]] [[Transport corridor|corridor]], Sussex's main link to London. Sussex's population is dominated by the Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation that, with a population of over 470,000, is home to almost 1 in 3 of Sussex's population. According to the [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 5 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):

==Population==
The combined population of Sussex as of 2011 is about 1.6 million.<ref name="ONS2011">{{cite web|last=Office for National Statistics|title=Census 2011 result shows increase in population of the South East|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mro/news-release/census-2011-result-shows-increase-in-population-of-the-south-east/censussoutheastnr0712.html|access-date=4 December 2012}}</ref><ref group="nb">Combined population of local authority areas of Brighton and Hove (273,400), East Sussex, (527,200) and West Sussex (808,900)</ref> In 2011, Sussex had a population density of 425 per km<sup>2</sup>, higher than the average for England of 407 per km<sup>2</sup>.

The earliest statement as to the population of Sussex is made by Bede, who describes the county as containing in 681 land of 7,000 families; allowing ten to a family (a reasonable estimate at that date), the total population would be 70,000.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Sussex|inline=1}}</ref>  In 1693 the county is stated to have contained 21,537 houses. The 1801 census found that the population was 159,311. The decline of the Sussex ironworks probably accounts for the small increase of population during several centuries, although after the [[massacre of St Bartholomew]] upwards of 1,500 [[Huguenots]] landed at Rye, and in 1685, after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], many more refugees were added to the county.<ref name=EB1911/>  The population of Sussex was 550,446 in 1891 and was 605,202 in 1901.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Beginnings===

Finds at [[Eartham Pit, Boxgrove|Eartham Pit]] in Boxgrove show that the area has some of the earliest hominid remains in Europe, dating back some 500,000 years and known as Boxgrove Man or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''. At a site near Pulborough called The Beedings, tools have been found that date from around 35,000 years ago and that are thought to be from either the last [[Neanderthals]] in northern Europe or pioneer populations of modern humans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7466735.stm | work=BBC News | first=Christine | last=McGourty | title='Neanderthal tools' found at dig | date=23 June 2008}}</ref> The thriving population lived by hunting game such as horses, bison, [[mammoth]] and [[Woolly rhinoceros|woolly rhinos]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3345244/Neanderthal-tools-reveal-advanced-technology.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Roger | last=Highfield | title=Neanderthal tools reveal advanced technology | date=23 June 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Around 6000BC the ice sheet over the North Sea melted, sea levels rose and the meltwaters burst south and westwards, creating the English Channel and cutting the people of Sussex off from their [[Mesolithic]] kinsmen to the south. Later in the [[Neolithic]] period, the area of the South Downs above Worthing was one of Britain's largest and most important [[flint]]-mining centres.<ref name="SSST10">{{Harvnb|Kerridge|Standing|2000|p=10.}}</ref> The flints were used to help fell trees for agriculture. The oldest of these mines, at Church Hill in Findon, has been carbon-dated to 4500BC to 3750BC, making it one of the earliest known mines in Britain. Flint tools from [[Cissbury]] have been found as far away as the eastern Mediterranean.<ref name="SteyningMus">{{cite web| url=http://steyningmuseum.org.uk/prehistory.htm|title=Prehistory: The Downs Above Steyning|publisher=Steyning Museum|access-date=3 February 2014}}</ref>

Sussex is rich in remains from the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, in particular the Bronze Age barrows known as the [[Devil's Jumps, Treyford|Devil's Jumps]] and [[Cissbury Ring]], one of Britain's largest hillforts. Towards the end of the Iron Age in 75BC people from the [[Atrebates]], one of the tribes of the [[Belgae]], a mix of Celtic and German stock, started invading and occupying southern Britain.<ref name="armstrong24">Armstrong. A History of Sussex. Ch. 3.</ref> This was followed by an invasion by the Roman army under [[Julius Caesar]] that temporarily occupied the south-east in 55BC.<ref name="armstrong24"/>
Soon after the first Roman invasion had ended, the Celtic [[Regnenses]] tribe under their leader [[Commius]] occupied the [[Manhood Peninsula]].<ref name="armstrong24"/> [[Tincomarus]] and then [[Cogidubnus]] followed Commius as rulers of the Regnenses.<ref name="armstrong24"/>

===Roman canton===
[[File:Fishbourne model.JPG|thumb|Museum model of how Fishbourne Roman Palace may have appeared]]

At the time of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an ''[[oppidum]]'' in the southern part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region.<ref name="cunliffe169">Cunliffe. Iron Age communities in Britain. p. 169.</ref> A number of archaeologists now think there is a strong possibility that the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion of Britain]] in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of [[Richborough]] in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee [[Verica]], king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the [[Catuvellauni]], a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.<ref>[http://www.ospreypublishing.com/articles/ancient_world/The_roman_invasion_of_britain/ Osprey Publishing - Military History Books - The Roman Invasion of Britain<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222053039/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/articles/ancient_world/The_roman_invasion_of_britain/ |date=22 December 2014 }}</ref>

Sussex was home to the magnificent [[Fishbourne Roman Palace|Roman Palace at Fishbourne]], by far the largest Roman residence known north of the Alps. Much of Sussex was a Roman canton of the [[Regnenses]] or Regni, with its capital at [[Noviomagus Reginorum]], modern-day Chichester. The Romans built villas, especially on the coastal plain and around Chichester, one of the best preserved being that at [[Bignor]]. Christianity first came to Sussex at this time, but faded away when the Romans left in the 5th century. The nationally important Patching hoard of Roman coins that was found in 1997 is the latest find of Roman coins found in [[Great Britain|Britain]], probably deposited after 475 AD, well after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] around 410 AD.<ref name="white351">{{Cite journal|last=White |first=Sally|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol42/42_088_093.pdf |title=A Mid-Fifth Century Hoard of Roman and Pseudo-Roman Material from Patching, West Sussex |year=1999 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |access-date=16 November 2011 |pages=88–93 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013906/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol42/42_088_093.pdf |archive-date=5 January 2012 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

===Saxon kingdom===
{{main|Kingdom of Sussex}}

The foundation legend of Sussex is provided by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which states that in the year AD 477 [[Ælle of Sussex|Ælle]] landed with his three sons.<ref name="welchase9">Welch. Anglo-Saxon England p.9</ref><ref name="asc477">ASC Parker MS. 477AD.</ref> Having fought on the banks of the [[Battle of Mercredesburne|Mearcredesburna]],<ref>ASC 485 Parker MS: ''This year Ælle fought with the Welsh nigh Mecred's- Burnsted.''
</ref> it seems Ælle secured the area between the Ouse and Cuckmere in a treaty.<ref name="welchess24">Welch. ''Early Anglo-Saxon Sussex''; pp. 24-25</ref> After Ælle's forces seized the [[Saxon Shore]] fort of [[Anderida]], the South Saxons were able to gradually colonise free of Romano-British control and extend their territory westwards to link with the Saxon settlement at [[Highdown Hill]].<ref name="welchess24"/> Ælle was recognised as the first '[[Bretwalda]]' or overlord of southern Britain. He was probably the most senior of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kings and led the ill-fated campaign against [[King Arthur]] at [[Mount Badon]].

[[File:Swilfrid1.jpg|thumb|left| 250px |alt=An engraving, which is a 17th-century copy, of an earlier painted Tudor mural in Chichester cathedral depicting Cædwalla confirming the granting of land to Wilfrid to build his monastery in Selsey|Engraving showing Cædwalla confirming the granting of land to Wilfrid to build his monastery in Selsey.]]

By the end of the 7th century, the region around Selsey and Chichester had become the political centre of the kingdom. In the 660s-670s, [[Æthelwealh of Sussex|King Æthelwealh]] of Sussex formed an alliance with the Mercian king [[Wulfhere]] and together they took the Isle of Wight from the West Saxons, probably at the battle of Biedanheafele. As Mercia's first Christian king, Wulfhere insisted that Æthelwealh also convert to Christianity. Æthelwealh was [[baptised]] in Mercia, with Wulfhere as his [[Baptism|sponsor]]. Wulfhere gave the Isle of Wight and Meon Valley to Æthelwealh, with Wulfhere acting as [[Lord|overlord]]. The alliance with Mercia was sealed with Æthelwealh taking the hand of Eabe, a Mercian princess in marriage.

[[Wilfrid]], the exiled bishop of York, came to Sussex in 681 and with King Æthelwealh's approval set up a mission to convert the people of Sussex to [[Christianity]]. Æthelwealh gave Wilfrid land on the Manhood peninsula, close to his own royal estate and Wilfrid founded [[Selsey Abbey]]. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh was killed by [[Cædwalla]], a prince of Wessex. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh's grant of land and Wilfrid built his Selsey Abbey. Cædwalla was driven out by the South Saxon nobles [[Berthun]] and [[Andhun]].

The South Saxons fought off the West Saxons in 722 and again in 725. At the end of the 8th century, [[Ealdwulf of Sussex|Ealdwulf]] was perhaps the last independent king of Sussex, after which Sussex and other southern kingdoms came increasingly under Mercian rule. Mercia's grip was shattered in 825 at the [[battle of Ellendun]], after which Sussex and the other southern kingdoms came under the control of Wessex, which later grew into the kingdom of England.

The [[Battle of Hastings]] was fought in Sussex, the victory that led to the [[Norman conquest of England]]. In September 1066, [[William of Normandy]] landed with his forces at [[Pevensey]] and erected a wooden castle at [[Hastings]], from which they raided the surrounding area.<ref name=Bates79>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 79–89</ref><ref>''Anglo-Saxon Chronicles'', pp. 198–199; Orderic, vol. 2, pp. 168–171</ref> The battle was fought between Duke William of Normandy and the English king, [[Harold Godwinson]], who had strong connections with Sussex and whose chief [[family seat|seat]] was probably in [[Bosham]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41737|title=Victoria County History A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 4, The Rape of Chichester}}</ref> After having marched his exhausted army {{convert|250|mi|km|}} from Yorkshire, Harold fought the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, where England's army was defeated and Harold was killed. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's [[thegns]] were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated.<ref name="seward5">{{Cite book|last=Seward|first=Desmond|title=Sussex|publisher=Random House|year=1995|location=London|isbn=0-7126-5133-0|pages=5–7}}</ref> William built [[Battle Abbey]] at the site of the battle, with the exact spot where Harold fell marked by the high altar.<ref name="seward5"/>

Sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any English county under the Normans, for it was the heartland of King Harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion.<ref name="SxLand">{{cite book | last = Brandon | first = Peter | title = The Shaping of the Sussex Landscape | year = 2009 | publisher = Snake River Press}}</ref>
The county was of great importance to the Normans; Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy.<ref name="armstrong48">Armstrong. A History of Sussex. pp. 48-58</ref><ref name=EB1911/> The county's existing sub-divisions, known as rapes, were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of William's most trusted barons. Castles were built to defend the territories including at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. Sussex's bishop, [[Æthelric II]], was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with William the Conqueror's personal chaplain, [[Stigand of Selsey|Stigand]].<ref name="kelly9">{{cite book|last=Kelly|first= S.E|title= Anglo-Saxon Charters VI, Charters of Selsey|year= 1998|publisher=OUP for the British Academy| isbn=0-19-726175-2}}</ref> The Normans also built [[Chichester Cathedral]] and moved the seat of Sussex's bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex, including New Shoreham (the centre of modern Shoreham-by-Sea), Battle, Arundel, Uckfield and Winchelsea.<ref name="SxLand"/>

===Sussex under the Plantagenets===
In 1264, the Sussex Downs were the location of the [[Battle of Lewes]], in which [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] and his fellow barons captured Prince Edward (later [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]), the son and heir of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. The subsequent treaty, known as the [[Mise of Lewes]], led to Montfort summoning the [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|first parliament]] in English history without any prior royal authorisation. A provisional administration was set up, consisting of Montfort, the [[Stephen Bersted|Bishop of Chichester]] and the [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester|Earl of Gloucester]]. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached.<ref>{{Citation|last=Powicke|first=F.

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], Sussex found itself on the frontline, convenient both for intended invasions and retaliatory expeditions by licensed French pirates.<ref name="lowerson">{{Cite book|last=Lowerson|first=John|title=A Short History of Sussex|publisher=Dawson Publishing|year=1980|location=Folkestone|isbn=978-0-7129-0948-8}}</ref> Hastings, Rye and Winchelsea were all burnt during this period<ref name="lowerson"/> and all three towns became part of the [[Cinque Ports]], a loose federation for supplying ships for the country's security. Also at this time, [[Amberley Castle|Amberley]] and [[Bodiam Castle|Bodiam]] castles were built to defend the upper reaches of navigable rivers.<ref name="lowerson"/>
One of the impacts of the war and the [[Black Death]], which killed around half of the population of Sussex,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/sbroadberry/wp/medievalpopulation7.pdf|last1=Broadberry|first1=Stephen|last2=Campbell|first2=Bruce M.S.|last3=van Leeuwen|first3=Bas|title=English Medieval Population: Reconciling Time Series and Cross Sectional Evidence|page=9|type=PDF|publisher=University of Warwick|date=27 May 2010|access-date=25 April 2015}}</ref> was the perceived injustice that led many Sussex people to participate in the [[Peasant’s Revolt]] of 1381.  Economic and social tensions continued and Sussex people were also involved in [[Jack Cade]]’s rebellion of 1450, in which Cade may have been killed at [[Cade Street]], near Heathfield.  Demands grew more radical in Sussex in 1451 when [[John and William Merfold]] advocated rule by common people and the deposition of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], publicly inciting the killing of the nobility and clergy.<ref>{{harvnb|Mate|1992|p=667}}</ref>

===Early modern Sussex===
[[Henry VIII]]’s separation of the [[Church of England]] from Rome and the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] led to the demolition of [[Lewes Priory]] and [[Battle Abbey]] and the sites being given to Henry’s supporters.  The shrine to [[St Richard of Chichester|St Richard]] at Chichester Cathedral was also destroyed.  In the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], 41 people in Sussex were burnt at the stake for their Protestant beliefs. Elizabeth re-established the break with Rome when she passed the 1559 [[Act of Supremacy 1558|Acts of Supremacy]] and [[Act of Uniformity 1558|Uniformity]]. Under [[Elizabeth I]], religious intolerance continued albeit on a lesser scale, with several people being executed for their Catholic beliefs.<ref name="lowerson"/>

Sussex escaped the worst ravages of the [[English Civil War]], although in 1642 there were [[siege]]s at Arundel and [[Siege of Chichester|Chichester]], and a skirmish at Haywards Heath when [[Royalists]] marching towards Lewes were intercepted by local [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. The Royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner.<ref name="CivWar">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1642-south.htm|title=1642: Civil War in the South East|access-date=29 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510075517/http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1642-south.htm|archive-date=10 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite its being under Parliamentarian control, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was able to [[Escape of Charles II|journey through the county]] after the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651 to make his escape to France from the port of Shoreham.

In 1681 [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted [[William Penn]] lands in what became [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Delaware]]. Amongst those whom he carried to Pennsylvania as colonists were 200 people from Sussex, mostly Quakers,<ref name=lower341>Lower. Worthies of Sussex. p. 341</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Smith Futhey|Cope|1995|p=21}}</ref> who founded settlements with Sussex names including [[Horsham Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Horsham Township]] and [[Chichester Friends Meetinghouse|Chichester]] in Pennsylvania and in [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]], Delaware the towns of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] and [[Seaford, Delaware]].

===Politics===
{{Main|Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner|Sussex (UK Parliament constituency)|High Sheriff of Sussex|Lord Lieutenant of Sussex|Custos Rotulorum of Sussex}}

For most of the 20th century Sussex was a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] stronghold; until the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] the only seats won by other parties were in the constituencies of [[Brighton (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton]] and [[Brighton Kemptown (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Kemptown]]. In the early 21st century this gradual shift to the left has continued, especially in more urban areas.  This has been most notable in Brighton and Hove, where in [[Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton Pavilion]] the UK's first and only [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]] MP, [[Caroline Lucas]], was elected in 2010 and the UK's first Green-led local authority was elected in 2011.  In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the lower house of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]], Sussex is represented by 16 MPs.  At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], 13 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs, 2 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Labour and Co-operative|Labour Co-op]] MPs and 1 [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]] MP were elected from Sussex constituencies.

Amongst top-tier local authorities, [[East Sussex County Council|East]] and [[West Sussex County Council]]s are both held by the Conservatives and [[Brighton and Hove City Council]] is led by a minority Green administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18597868.green-party-take-brighton-council-labour/|title=Green Party to Take Over Brighton Council from Labour|publisher=The Argus|first=Jody|last=Doherty-Cove|date=21 July 2020|access-date=15 September 2020}}</ref>  Amongst district councils, as of September 2020 the Conservative Party controls 6 local authorities ([[Adur District|Adur]], [[Chichester District|Chichester]], [[Horsham District|Horsham]], [[Mid Sussex District|Mid Sussex]], [[Wealden District|Wealden]] and [[Worthing Borough Council|Worthing]]), the Lib Dems control 3 ([[Arun District|Arun]], [[Eastbourne]] and [[Lewes District|Lewes]]) and the Labour Party controls 2 ([[Crawley]] and [[Hastings]]).  Conservative [[Katy Bourne]] is the [[Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner]], having first been elected in 2012.  In the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum on UK membership of the EU]], the people of Sussex voted to leave the EU by the narrowest of margins, by 50.23% to 49.77% or 4,413 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wscountytimes.co.uk/news/result-sussex-votes-to-leave-by-majority-of-just-4-400-votes-1-7447628|title=RESULT: Sussex votes to leave by majority of just 4,400 votes|publisher=West Sussex County Times|date=24 June 2017|access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36617385|title=EU referendum: Sussex votes narrowly for Brexit|publisher=BBC|date=24 June 2017|access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref> 

From 1290, Sussex returned two [[Members of Parliament]] to the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of England]]. Each county returned two MPs and each borough designated by Royal charter also returned two MPs. After the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] with Scotland two members represented the county in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] from 1707 to 1800 and of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 to 1832. The Reform Act 1832 led to the disenfranchisement of some of the smaller Sussex boroughs<ref name="leslie72"/> and divided what had been a single county constituency into [[East Sussex (UK Parliament constituency)|eastern]] and [[West Sussex (UK Parliament constituency)|western]] divisions, with two representatives elected for each division.<ref name="horsefieldapp23">Horsfield.

===Administrative divisions===

====Historic sub-divisions====
{{main | Rape (county subdivision)}}
[[File:Sussex administrative map 1832.png|thumb|right|Map of Sussex in 1851 showing the six Rapes]]

A [[Rape (county subdivision)|rape]] is a traditional territorial sub-division of Sussex, formerly used for various administrative purposes.<ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 900">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Rape (division)|display=Rape |volume=22 |page=90 }}</ref>  Their origin is unknown, but they appear to predate the [[Norman Conquest]]<ref>The origin was still reported as "contested" as late as 1942 (Helen Maud Cam (preface dated 1942), ''Liberties & communities in medieval England: Collected Studies in Local Administration and Topography'', 1944:193).</ref> Each rape was split into several [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s and may be [[Romano-British]] or [[Anglo-Saxon]] in origin.<ref name="EPNS-AMetc">{{Cite book|last=Mawer|first=Allen, F. M. Stenton with J. E. B. Gover|title=Sussex - Part I and Part II|publisher=English Place-Name Society|orig-year=1929|year=1930}}</ref>

At the time of the Norman Conquest, there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. The [[rape of Bramber]] was created later in the 11th century and the [[rape of Chichester]] was created in the 13th century.

====Modern local authority areas====
Local government in Sussex has been [[History of local government in Sussex|subject to periodic review over time]] and Sussex is currently divided two counties for ceremonial purposes and for administrative purposes into two [[non-metropolitan counties|county council areas]], East and West Sussex, and one unitary authority, the city of Brighton and Hove.  There is a [[non-metropolitan district|two-tier structure]] for East Sussex and West Sussex with [[local education authority|education]], [[social services]], [[library|libraries]], public transport and [[waste disposal]] carried out by the [[county councils]] and [[planning permission|local planning]] and [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|building control]] carried out by the district and borough councils.

For the governance of a long narrow territory it became practical to divide the county into two sections. The three eastern rapes of Sussex became east Sussex and the three western rapes became west Sussex.  This began in 1504 with separate administrations ([[Quarter Sessions]]) for east and west, a situation recognised by the County of Sussex Act 1865. Under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], the two divisions became two [[administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] (along with three [[county borough]]s: Brighton, [[Hastings]] and, from 1911, [[Eastbourne]]).<ref>[http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/newsroom/CONNECTIONS_12%20.pdf CONNECTIONS 12 .pdf<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525062727/http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/newsroom/CONNECTIONS_12%20.pdf |date=25 May 2013 }}</ref>

==Economy==
Sussex has considerable variation in income and deprivation. For statistical purposes at the [[NUTS2]] level, the UK Government pairs Sussex with Surrey, a significantly better off region.  In 2018 the four Sussex statistical areas at the NUTS3 level had a GDP per head that varied between £18,852 and £33,711 - typically below the UK average of £32,216. This was in contrast to the two areas in Surrey, which had a GDP per head of £37,429 and 42,433.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/datasets/regionalgrossdomesticproductallnutslevelregions|title=Regional gross domestic product all NUTS level regions|access-date=11 August 2020}}</ref>  There is also serious deprivation in Sussex comparable to the most deprived UK inner city areas.

These were the Coast to Capital LEP, covering West Sussex, Brighton and Hove and the Lewes district in the west of East Sussex, as well as parts of Surrey and South London; and the South East LEP, which covers the local authority area of East Sussex, as well as Kent and Essex.  In the most populous part of Sussex, around the [[Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton|Brighton and Hove Built-up area]], the [[Greater Brighton City Region|Greater Brighton City Deal]] was formed to enable the area to fulfil its economic potential, into one of the highest performing urban economies in the UK.<ref name="GBCD">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/288903/Greater_Brighton_City_Deal.pdf|type=PDF|title=Greater Brighton City Deal|access-date=26 May 2014}}</ref>

Tourism in Sussex is well-established, and includes seaside resorts and the [[South Downs National Park]]. Brighton and Hove has a high density of businesses involved in media, particularly digital or "[[new media]]"; since the 1990s Brighton has been referred to as "Silicon Beach".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/brightons-silicon-beach-tech-cluster-finally-breaks-shore/|title=Brighton's Silicon Beach tech cluster finally breaks shore}}</ref> The Greater Brighton City Deal seeks to develop Brighton's creative-tech cluster under the name Tech City South.<ref name="GBCD"/> The [[University of Sussex]] and the [[University of Brighton]] provide employment for many more.

The Sussex Weald had an [[Wealden iron industry|iron working industry]] from the Iron Age until the 19th century. The glass making industry started on the Sussex/Surrey border throughout the late medieval period until the 17th century.<ref name="brandon175">Brandon. Sussex. pp. 175 -176.</ref> Agriculture in Sussex depended on the terrain, so in the sticky clays and acid sands of the Susex Weald, pastoral and mixed farming took place, with sheep farming being common on the chalk downland.  Fishing fleets continue to operate along the coast, notably at Rye and Hastings. There are working harbours at Rye, Hastings, Newhaven and Shoreham; whilst Pagham, Eastbourne and Chichester harbours cater for leisure craft, as does Brighton Marina. The Mid Sussex area had a thriving clay industry in the early 20th century.

===Science===
[[Pell's equation]] and the [[Pell number]] are both named after 17th century mathematician [[John Pell]]. Pell is sometimes credited with inventing the division sign, which has also been attributed to Swiss mathematician [[Johann Heinrich Rahn]], one of his students.
