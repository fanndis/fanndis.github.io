Since 1867, there have been over fifty '''visits by a member of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Royal Family]] to Australia''', though only six of those came before 1954. [[Elizabeth II]] is the only reigning monarch of Australia to have set foot on Australian soil; she first did so on 3 February 1954. She was only 27 when she first visited Australia. During her sixteen journeys the Queen has visited every Australian state and the two major territories.

==19th century==
The first member of the Royal Family to visit Australia was [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], son of [[Queen Victoria]], in 1867, during his 'round-the-world voyage. Stops were made at [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]]. The Duke was shot by [[Henry James O'Farrell]] in an assassination attempt while picnicking on the beach in the Sydney suburb of [[Clontarf, New South Wales|Clontarf]], on 12 March 1868. The Duke recovered fully and continued on to New Zealand seven months later.

[[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince George of Wales]], aged 15, visited Australia with his older brother, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence|Prince Albert Victor of Wales]], aged 17, in 1881, as midshipmen in training on {{HMS|Bacchante|1876|6}}.  They arrived at [[Albany, Western Australia]] in May, crossed to [[South Australia]] in a passenger vessel, travelled overland to Melbourne and from there sailed on a naval vessel to Sydney.

==Early 20th century (1901–1950)==
[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|In 1901, [[George V|Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York]] opened the first Australian parliament. Prince George visited Australia with his wife, the [[Mary of Teck|Duchess of Cornwall and York]].]]
In 1901, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]] and his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]] were planning an Empire tour. However, the death of [[Queen Victoria]] on 22 January 1901 meant that the couple had to prepare for a coronation in 1902. Consequently, Edward's son [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York]], and [[Mary of Teck|Mary]], were assigned to undertake the voyage instead. Arriving at Albany, [[Western Australia]], on {{SS|Ophir}}, they sailed to Melbourne, where he opened the first Australian federal parliament. The royal couple later travelled by train to Sydney. They visited [[Queensland]] from 20 to 25 May, where they laid the foundation stone of [[St John's Cathedral (Brisbane)]].<ref name=qsa>{{cite web|title=Royal visits to Queensland, an historic essay|url=http://www.archives.qld.gov.au/Researchers/Exhibitions/royals/Pages/HistoricalEssay.aspx|publisher=[[Queensland State Archives]]|accessdate=11 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917012937/http://www.archives.qld.gov.au/Researchers/Exhibitions/royals/Pages/HistoricalEssay.aspx|archive-date=17 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1920s===
[[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] arrived in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 26 May 1920, representing his father, [[George V]] (previously Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York), to thank Australians for their participation in the [[World War I|First World War]]. He was accompanied by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]].
 
During the tour, his railway carriage overturned near [[Bridgetown, Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37467818 |title=THE ROYAL TRAIN SENSATIONAL DISASTER. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth |date=8 July 1920 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |page=29 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Royal Train Derailment in Western Australia from the ''Diary of Lord Louis Mountbatten'' |journal=[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] |date=December 1998 |pages=479–482}}</ref> However, the Prince remained unharmed and made light of the situation, emerging from the wreck with some important papers and a cocktail shaker, an act which endeared him to Australians and caused them to give him the nickname the "[[Digger (soldier)|Digger]] Prince".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 1926, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert, Duke of York]], and wife [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]] had their first child, Princess Elizabeth{{mdash}}"Lilibet" to the family{{mdash}}who would later become [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The following year they undertook a Royal Tour without the baby. The Duchess of York was, in her own words, "very miserable at leaving the baby".<ref>Elizabeth's diary, 6 January 1927, quoted in Shawcross, p. 264</ref> Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success.<ref>Shawcross, pp. 266–296</ref> In New Zealand The Yorks enjoyed the local fishing<ref>Shawcross, pp. 281–282</ref> in the [[Bay of Islands]] accompanied by Australian sports fisherman [[Harry Andreas]].<ref name="ROYAL ANGLERS">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54884539 |title=ROYAL ANGLERS. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=25 February 1927 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

When they sailed into Sydney harbour on {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, they attracted Australia's first gathering of more than one million people. The principal duty of the Prince on this visit was to open the provisional [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in Canberra, on 9 May 1927. They spent 12 days in [[New South Wales]], seven in [[Queensland]], four in Tasmania, eleven in Victoria, six in South Australia, six in Western Australia and three in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], with the remaining 10 for travelling and recreation.

According to a report by the director-general of the royal visit, [[Cyril Brudenell White]], "the Royal Visitors had expressed the wish that when travelling through the States they might have opportunities of seeing and of being seen by, the greatest number of the general public. They especially desired to meet returned soldiers, new settlers and school children."{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}  On 9 May, Prince Albert reviewed over 2,000 Australian troops with various air squadrons flying overhead. One aircraft, that of Flying Officer Charles Ewan, crashed; Ewan died that evening in hospital.

[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] the third son of George V, visited for an extensive 67-day tour in 1934, (4 October – December), the main purpose being to open the centenary celebrations of Victoria on 18 October. He arrived on {{HMS|Sussex|96|6}} at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], then travelled by train to Adelaide and ship to Melbourne. He also visited the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland. While in Melbourne, the Duke dedicated the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] on 11 November and later opened the [[ANZAC War Memorial]] in Sydney on 24 November 1934. He sailed to New Zealand from Brisbane, before returning to England.

Prince Henry served as [[Governor-General of Australia]] from 20 January 1945 – 10 March 1947, the first and only royal Governor-General of Australia.

==Late 20th century (1951–2000)==
===1950s===
[[Elizabeth II]] was the first reigning monarch of Australia to set foot on Australian soil, coming ashore at Farm Cove, Sydney, on 3 February 1954. She had two years earlier been en route to Australia when her father died while she was on a private visit to [[Kenya]], forcing her to return to the United Kingdom. Once finally in Australia, with her husband the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], she undertook a journey through the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], including greeting 70,000 ex-servicemen and women at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and opening the [[Australian Parliament]] in [[Canberra]]. In all, the Queen travelled 10,000 miles by air, making approximately 33 flights, 2000 miles by road (130 hours in cars in 207 trips), visiting all capitals except Darwin and 70 country towns, many by special "royal trains".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Last Hurrah |last=Bull |first=Tony |journal=[[Australian Railway History]] |date=May 2008 |pages=151–158}}</ref> On one such train trip they visited [[Leuralla]], at [[Leura, New South Wales|Leura]], in the [[City of Blue Mountains|Blue Mountains]]. Twenty-seven years earlier, [[Harry Andreas]] of Leuralla had acted as a fishing guide for The Queen's parents,<ref name="ROYAL ANGLERS" /> whilst the young Princess "Lillibet" was left at home with her grandparents, [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. This extensive travel allowed some 75 per cent of the Australian population to see the Queen at least once during the tour{{Citation needed|reason=This is a widely quoted figure but does not seem to have an empirical source|date=March 2016}}. At the conclusion of the tour the Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]], stated in an article published in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'':
[[File:Queen Elizabeth train.jpg|left|thumb|Queen Elizabeth II arriving in Leura for her visit to [[Leuralla]] during the 1954 Australian Royal Tour]]
<blockquote>"It is a basic truth that for our Queen we have within us, sometimes unrealised until the moment of expression, the most profound and passionate feelings of loyalty and devotion. It does not require much imagination to realise that when eight million people spontaneously pour out this feeling they are engaging in a great act of common allegiance and common joy which brings them closer together and is one of the most powerful elements converting them from a mass of individuals to a great cohesive nation. In brief, the common devotion to the Throne is a part of the very cement of the whole social structure."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18407792 |title=The Queen's Visit Is First By A Reigning Monarch. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=4 February 1954 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |page=2 Supplement: Royal Tour Supplement |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1956, the Duke of Edinburgh opened the [[1956 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Melbourne, and opened the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Perth]], while on a tour through Western Australia, New South Wales and the ACT. In 1965 he opened the [[Royal Australian Mint]], and in 1968 went to Australia to open the Duke of Edinburgh Study Conference.

[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] visited in 1958 to attend the British Empire Service League Conference in Canberra. She travelled to the Australian Capital Territory, Brisbane,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=23 November 2018|title=Footage of the Queen Mother at St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, 1958|url=https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/footage-queen-mother-st-johns-cathedral-brisbane-1958|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-07|website=State Library Of Queensland|language=en}}</ref> Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania, Adelaide and Perth, as well as many provincial and country areas during the time of her visit 14 February – 7 March.

Planned as a less formal tour than the one in 1954, the Queen and Prince Philip returned in 1963, touring all the states and territories, with the primary purpose being to lead the Canberra jubilee celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the naming of the capital. During this trip she also toured the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]] base in [[Alice Springs]]. In preparation for this tour, Sir [[Roy Dowling]], the Queen's Australian Secretary for the visit, was warned about Northern Territory mosquitoes.

[[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] attended the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] as its patron, and opened [[Flinders University]], also travelling to Western Australia, the Snowy Mountains and the Australian Capital Territory between 22 March and 7 April 1966.

[[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] attended the Timbertop campus of [[Geelong Grammar School]] for one term in 1966.  This was not an official trip as the Prince was there primarily for schooling. A press release of 10 January 1966 made this clear, stating that he should be left alone by journalists: "The Prince of Wales will be engaged in full time study in Australia and will not undertake any official engagements. The Queen and the Commonwealth Government have requested that the Prince's visit should be treated as a private one and that he should be allowed the same freedom from public attention as any other school boy."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

He returned in 1967 as the Queen's representative at the memorial service for Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]], and again in 1970.

[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] helped in 1967 to organise the third Commonwealth Study Conference to be held in May 1968. He travelled to the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania, where he helped volunteer fire fighters to fight a local fire.

The Queen, Prince Philip, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] (for part of the tour only) and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] made an extensive tour of Australia in 1970 in connection with the bi-centenary of Captain James Cook sailing up the east coast of Australia in 1770. This was a very popular tour and large crowds turned out to see the Queen. One large gathering occurred when the royal yacht [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']] sailed up the [[Brisbane River]], mooring just below the historic [[Newstead House, Brisbane|Newstead House]] in [[Brisbane]]. In January 2009, a retired police detective revealed an unsuccessful attempt to derail the Royal Train near [[Bowenfels, New South Wales]] on 29 April 1970.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24973958-5001021,00.html|title=Aussie plot to kill the Queen|work=Daily Telegraph|date=28 January 2009|first1=Charles|last1=Miranda|access-date=28 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130214647/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24973958-5001021,00.html|archive-date=30 January 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Queen returned to Australia again in 1973 to open the [[Sydney Opera House]] and also in 1974 to open the Australian Parliament in Canberra.  This time the Queen returned to London on 28 February for a General Election in Britain, cutting short the tour, which the Duke of Edinburgh completed.

An extended royal tour of Australia was made in 1977 as part of the Silver Jubilee of Her Majesty's reign.

[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] made a brief visit in May 1978 to attend the funeral of former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies. Wearing the full dress uniform of a commander of the [[Royal Navy]], the prince read from the book of [[Ecclesiasticus|Ecclesiasticus chapter 44]]: "Let us now praise famous men . . .".  He arrived and departed at [[Tullamarine Airport|Tullarmarine Airport]] in Melbourne aboard a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[VC10]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/media/images/cabinet/1978/menzies-funeral.aspx|title=Sir Robert Menzies is farewelled|date=19 May 1978|website=[[National Archives of Australia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617121442/http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/media/images/cabinet/1978/menzies-funeral.aspx|archive-date=17 June 2019|url-status=live|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131853781|title=Prince Charles due tonight|date=18 May 1978|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=17 June 2019|issue=15,580|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=52|page=14|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131854208|title=SIR ROBERT GORDON MENZIES (1894-1978)|date=20 May 1978|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=17 June 2019|issue=15,582|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=52|page=13|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===1990s===
In 1992 the Queen returned to the sesquicentenary of the incorporation of the city of Sydney. In the last years of the decade she did not visit the country to avoid being embroiled in the debate about future of the monarchy. Her next tour was timed to be made well after the 1999 referendum on the republic. The Australian government of [[John Howard]] had advised the Queen on the timing.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/queens-visit-to-australia-is-timed-to-avoid-referendum-1086036.html | work = [[The Independent]] | location = [[London]] | title = Queen's visit to Australia is timed to avoid referendum | authorlink = Joanna Jolly | first = Joanna | last = Jolly | date = 9 April 1999 | accessdate = 22 May 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025065921/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/queens-visit-to-australia-is-timed-to-avoid-referendum-1086036.html | archive-date = 25 October 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref>

At a reception in her honour held at Parliament House in Canberra on 21 October 2011, the Prime Minister, [[Julia Gillard]], described the Queen as "a vital constitutional part of Australian democracy".<ref>Speech by Prime Minister Julia Gillard at reception for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Parliament House, Canberra – 21 October 2011, Office of the Prime Minister</ref> The Queen in her speech at the same reception stated that,
<blockquote>"It has been a difficult year for this country in many ways despite the successes. The world witnessed the anguish of Australians as they lived through a summer of national disasters. We were all inspired by the courage and resolution shown by those affected in the face of crippling desolation. Ever since I first came here in 1954 I have watched Australia grow and develop at an extraordinary rate. This country has made dramatic progress economically in social scientific and industrial endeavours and above all in self-confidence." <ref>Speech by HM The Queen of Australia, reception at Parliament House, Canberra – 21 October 2011</ref></blockquote>
