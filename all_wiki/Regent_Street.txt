'''Regent Street''' is a major shopping street in the [[West End of London]]. It is named after [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, the Prince Regent]] (later George IV) and was laid out  under the direction of the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]]. It runs from Waterloo Place in [[St James's]] at the southern end, through [[Piccadilly Circus]] and [[Oxford Circus]], to [[All Souls Church, Langham Place|All Souls Church]]. From there [[Langham Place, London|Langham Place]] and [[Portland Place]] continue the route to [[Regent's Park]].

The street's layout was completed in 1825 and was an early example of [[town planning]] in England, replacing earlier roads including [[Swallow Street]]. Nash and Burton's street layout has survived, although all the original buildings except All Souls Church have been replaced following reconstruction in the late 19th century.<ref name=regentstreethistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.regentstreetonline.com/RegentStreet/HeritageChannel/History+and+Conservation.htm|title=Regent Street|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> The street is known for its flagship retail stores, including [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]], [[Hamleys]], [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] and the [[Apple Store]]. The Royal Polytechnic Institution, now the [[University of Westminster]], has been based on Regent Street since 1838.

==History==

===Beginnings: 1811–1825===
[[File:Regent St proposal published 1813.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Regent Street proposal, published 1813, titled ''"PLAN, presented to the House of Commons, of a STREET proposed from CHARING CROSS to PORTLAND PLACE, leading to the Crown Estate in Marylebone Park"'']]
Regent Street was one of the first planned developments of London. An ordered structure of London streets, replacing the mediaeval layout, had been planned since just after the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666) when Sir [[Christopher Wren]] and [[John Evelyn]] drew plans for rebuilding the city on the classical formal model. After a lack of progress, houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=341}}

In 1766, [[John Gwynn (architect)|John Gwynn]] complained in ''London and Westminster Improved'' that there was a lack of planning throughout the [[West End of London|West End]] and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now [[Regent's Park]]) with the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]'s [[Carlton House]]. [[John Fordyce (MP)|John Fordyce]] was appointed as Surveyor-General to the [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]] in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] and the [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]], which had declined and became downmarket. A further problem was increased congestion around [[Charing Cross]], which would benefit from road improvements.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=685}}

The street was designed by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] (who had been appointed to the Office of Woods and Forests in 1806 and previously served as an adviser to the Prince Regent) and by developer [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]].{{sfn|Williams|1990|p=136}} Nash proposed his own plans for the street in 1810 following the death of Fordyce,{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=685}} envisioning broad, architecturally distinguished thoroughfares and public spaces, and {{sfn|Stern|Fishman|Tilove|2013|p=23}} planned to construct a straight boulevard as seen in French cities, but this was not possible because of land ownership issues.{{sfn|Westminster|p=6}} Nash's final design resulted in a road situated further west than on previous plans, and Nash believed the road would run down a ''de facto'' line separating the upper classes and nobility in [[Mayfair]] with the working class in [[Soho]].{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=685}} 
[[File:Quadrant, Regent Street engraved by J.Woods after J.Salmon publ 1837 edited.jpg|thumb|right|The Quadrant, Regent Street in 1837, seen from Piccadilly Circus. The buildings have since been replaced]]

The construction of the northern section of the New Street involved demolishing most of the existing [[Swallow Street]], which had become run down and was an ideal candidate for regeneration.<ref name=onl>{{cite book|first=Edward|last=Walford|title=Regent Street and Piccadilly|work=Old and New London|volume=4|location=London|year=1878|pages=246–262|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol4/pp246-262|accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> The road was designed to curve east between Oxford Street and Piccadilly so that it did not meet [[St James's Square]], and the circuses allowed visual continuity down the street.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=685}}  The central section, known as the Quadrant, was designed for "shops appropriated to articles of fashion and taste," and was Nash's centrepiece for the street. It was built with a [[colonnade]] of cast-iron columns, allowing commuters to walk along the street without having to face bad weather. The buildings along the Quadrant had different facades, a deliberate choice by Nash to break away from the uniform design of the previous century and  a pragmatic means of using what building materials were available and what clients wanted.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=686}} The road was planned to end outside [[Carlton House]] in Pall Mall, the residence of the Prince of Wales.{{sfn|Westminster|p=6}} Nash insisted that businesses on the street would be of high-quality to rival nearby [[Bond Street]]; common trades such as butchers or greengrocers were not allowed.{{sfn|Weightman|Humphries|Mack|Taylor|2007|p=23}}

The design was adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which permitted the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended for commercial purposes and it was expected that most of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=685}} Construction of the road required demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|pp=685–6}} Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=686}} The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily on private developers, such as Nash himself.{{sfn|Hobhouse|2008|p=7}} The buildings were let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.{{sfn|Hobhouse|2008|p=194}}

===Other architects===
The vast majority of the street was designed by Nash or Burton.<ref name="Arnold 3"/> However, a few buildings were designed by [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], [[Sir John Soane]], or others. By 1819, the Crown was receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=686}} At first, it was named New Street and became a dividing line between [[Soho]], which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of [[Mayfair]] to the west.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=254}} Carlton House was demolished after completion of the works in 1829 and was replaced by [[Carlton House Terrace]], designed by Nash and the son of James Burton, [[Decimus Burton]].<ref name="Williams pp.135-157">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Guy |title=Augustus Pugin Versus Decimus Burton: A Victorian Architectural Duel|year=1990|publisher=Cassell Publishers Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-304-31561-3|pages=135–157}}</ref>{{sfn|Westminster|p=6}} Regent Street was the first shopping area in Britain to support late night opening in 1850, when shopkeepers agreed to keep stores open until 7pm.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=255}}

===Rebuilding: 1895–1927===
[[File:Panorama of the Quadrant on Regent Street.jpg|thumb|center|x250px|The Quadrant on Regent Street, leading to [[Piccadilly Circus]]{{efn|This photograph has a wide [[field of view]]. In reality, the curvature is not as extreme.}}]]
During the 19th century, Regent Street became established as the "centre of fashion." Shops expanded into multiple properties, selling imported and exotic products to appeal to niche consumers.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=686}} By the end of the century, fashions had changed and the original buildings were small and old fashioned, restricting trade.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=687}} The colonnade constructed by Nash was demolished in the mid-19th century for fear it might attract "doubtful characters."{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=254}} Other buildings were not up to modern building standards; some had been extended and were structurally suspect.{{sfn|Westminster|p=6}} As the 99-year leases came to an end, Regent Street was redeveloped between 1895 and 1927 under the control of the Office of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (now known as the [[Crown Estate]]).<ref name=regentstreethistory/><ref name=britishhistoryonline>{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41456 |title=The rebuilding of Piccadilly Circus and the Regent Street Quadrant|work=Survey of London|volume=31–32|pages=85–100|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>

The modern Regent Street is the result of this redevelopment. No original structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=255}} The current design is an example of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect.{{sfn|Westminster|p=7}} Strict rules governed the reconstruction.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=687}} Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone.{{sfn|Westminster|p=7}} The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by [[Reginald Blomfield|Sir Reginald Blomfield]]'s Quadrant.<ref name=britishhistoryonline/>

The architect [[Norman Shaw]], then aged 73, was brought in to draw up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were considered unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition and retailers' demand for bigger display windows.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=687}} Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw's designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928.<ref name=britishhistoryonline/> Significantly, no accommodation was built above any of the retail properties, contributing to the demise of the West End as a place of residence.{{sfn|Weightman|Humphries|Mack|Taylor|2007|p=110}} A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including [[Sir John James Burnet]],<ref>{{cite book|title=William Reid Dick, Sculptor|first=Dennis|last=Wardleworth|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2013|pages=81–2|isbn=978-1-409-43971-4}}</ref> [[Arthur Joseph Davis]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Architects and Architecture of London|first=Kenneth|last=Allinson|publisher=Routledge|page=290|year=2008|isbn=978-0-750-68337-1}}</ref> and [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Henry Tanner]].{{sfn|Westminster|p=26}}

The Work was delayed by [[World War I]]{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=687}} and not finished until 1927. Its completion was marked by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] driving in state along its length.{{sfn|Weightman|Humphries|Mack|Taylor|2007|p=110}} The only remaining Nash building is All Souls Church and all the buildings on the street are at least Grade II [[listed building|listed]].

===Crown Estate redevelopment===
By the 1970s, Regent Street had started to decline because of under-investment and competition from neighbouring areas such as Oxford Street or shopping centres away from Central London. In 2002, the [[Crown Estate]], which owns most of Regent Street on behalf of the Queen, started a major redevelopment programme.<ref name=t10019134>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/10019134/Regent-Streets-revival-gives-hope-to-high-streets-everywhere.html|title=Regent Street's revival gives hope to high streets everywhere|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|first=Graham|last=Ruddick|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref> In 2013 the Estate sold a quarter of the {{convert|270000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} Regent Street Quadrant 3 building to the [[Norwegian Oil Fund]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Norway's $815 bln oil fund buys into London property|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/03/norway-oilfund-purchase-idUSO9N09T02820131203|agency=Reuters|accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref> while later that year, [[Hackett London]] bought the lease for the [[Ferrari]] store on Regent Street for £4m. Smaller shops have been replaced by larger units; the street is now the flagship location of several major brands, including [[Apple Inc|Apple]] and [[Banana Republic]].<ref name=t10019134/>

The largest part of the plan was the reconstruction of the Quadrant close to Piccadilly Circus, which was completed in 2011. It offers {{convert|200000|sqft}} of office space spanning over seven floors. Two [[Art Deco]]-designed restaurants have also been restored, and the development includes a small number of apartments.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/07/quadrant-3-retail-development|title=Conversion of Regent Palace Hotel into £300m retail development completed|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 November 2011|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>

===Retail===
[[File:Londres 233..jpg|thumb|left|[[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] is at the junction of Regent Street with [[Great Marlborough Street]]]]
The [[department store]] [[Dickins and Jones]] was established at No.&nbsp;54 [[Oxford Street]] as Dickins and Smith before moving to Nos.&nbsp;232–234 Regent Street in 1835. It was renamed to Dickins and Jones in the 1890s after John Pritchard Jones became a business partner, and by the turn of the 20th century employed over 200 people. It became part of the [[Harrods]] group in 1914, and expanded to cover Nos.&nbsp;224–244 in 1922, in a new building designed by [[Henry Tanner (architect)|Sir Henry Tanner]]. In 1959, [[House of Fraser]] took over the store by buying the Harrods group.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=236}} In 2005, House of Fraser announced that the store would close the following year, after it had been making a loss for several years and not kept up with more fashion-conscious department stores elsewhere. The building has been redeveloped with small shop units on the lower floors and flats and offices above.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=236}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1657791,00.html |title='Stuffy' retail giant shuts as owner cuts its cloth |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=6 September 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628192011/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article534280.ece|archive-date=28 June 2011|date=17 June 2005|first=Alan|last=Hamilton|publisher=[[News UK]]}}</ref>

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] department store is based at Nos.&nbsp;210–220. It was founded by entrepreneur [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]], who had been inspired by the [[1862 International Exhibition]] and wanted to open an oriental warehouse. He opened his first shop, East India House in 1875 at No.&nbsp;218a, selling silk garments and various oriental goods. The shop expanded into other properties on Regent Street in the 1880s, separated by a jeweller's shop which was bridged by a double staircase called the "Camel's Back." Liberty later took over all of Nos.&nbsp;140–150 Regent Street.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=483}} In 1925, this complex was replaced by two new buildings, and a [[mock tudor]] building (built by architects [[Edwin T. Hall]] and his son Edwin S. Hall, constructed from the timbers of two ships, {{HMS|Impregnable|1810|6}}, and {{HMS|Hindustan|1841|6}} on neighbouring [[Great Marlborough Street]] connected by a footbridge over [[Kingly Street]], which separates the properties.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=483}}

The toy store [[Hamleys]] is at No.&nbsp;188 Regent Street, just south of Oxford Circus. It was founded as Noah's Ark at No.&nbsp;231 [[High Holborn]] in 1760.{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=371}} An additional branch opened at Nos.&nbsp;64–66 Regent Street in 1881, while the original High Holborn building burned down in 1901, moving to Nos.&nbsp;86–87. The store was frequently the first to market the latest games and toys, and became a strong seller of [[table tennis]] equipment in the late 19th century, allowing the sport to become popular. The business moved to Nos.&nbsp;200–202,{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=372}} and moved to the current address in 1981. It claims to be the largest toy shop in the world.<ref>{{cite news|title=The history of Hamleys – London's famous toy shop|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8510000/8510277.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>

The main London branch of the clothing store [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] is at Nos.&nbsp;200–206 Regent Street.

===Broadcasting===
[[File:Broadcasting House by Stephen Craven.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Broadcasting House]] is immediately north of the top end of Regent Street, and has been used by the [[BBC]] since 1932]]
Immediately north of Regent Street is the [[BBC]]'s headquarters, [[Broadcasting House]], whose front entrance is in Langham Place. Several national radio stations are broadcast from this building. The site had formerly been a building on the gardens of Foley House designed by [[James Wyatt]] and called Wyatt's House. It was demolished in 1928 (with much of the fixtures ending up in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) to construct Broadcasting House. Construction was challenging because the building had to be visually similar to other properties on Regent Street, yet also contain over twenty [[soundproofed]] studios. The exterior is built of [[Portland stone]] and above the front entrance is a sculpture by [[Eric Gill]].{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=100}}

Broadcasting House was first used by the BBC on 2 May 1932, and total construction costs were £350,000. It was too small for all services, and St George's Hall, next to All Souls, was used for variety broadcasts until it was demolished during [[the Blitz]]. On 15 October 1940, the building took a direct hit, killing seven people, and later that year a landmine exploded on Portland Place, causing widespread fires in Broadcasting House. Despite the damage, it survived the war and became one of the best known buildings associated with radio broadcasting. Subsequently, the BBC expanded with additional studios at [[Maida Vale]],{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=100}} followed by the former<ref name="bbctvcentreclosed">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/31/bbc-television-centre-virtual-experience|title=BBC Television Centre to be redeveloped as a 'digital experience'|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=5 September 2016|date=1 April 2013|first1=Tara|last1=Conlan|first2=John|last2=Plunkett}}</ref> headquarters of [[BBC Television]], [[BBC Television Centre]] at [[Wood Lane]].{{sfn|Hibbert|Weinreb|Keay|Keay|2010|p=100}} In the 2000s, Broadcasting House was expanded to include a new wing and modernise the site, replacing earlier extensions.

The [[Paris Theatre]] was located in a converted cinema in Lower Regent Street, near other BBC buildings. Several [[rock group]]s performed live concerts here, including [[The Beatles]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Pink Floyd]], which were simultaneously recorded for broadcast.
