In a July 2020 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', The Dixie Chicks admitted that collaborating with Swift "felt like a lot of pressure", wondering "what if we don't like this song? How are we going to say no to Taylor Swift?"; however the trio liked the song and recorded their backing vocals. [[Natalie Maines]] stated that Swift is showing "that vulnerable place of figuring this shit out for herself", while [[Emily Strayer]] added that "the power she [Swift] has right now to change things is way beyond any power we [The Dixie Chicks] ever had. She's in a different position than we ever were."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Newman|first=Melinda|date=July 17, 2020|title=How the Music Industry Finally Caught Up to The Chicks|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/9419501/the-chicks-gaslighter-interview|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 21, 2020|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

''Time''<nowiki/>'s Raisa Bruner has described "Soon You'll Get Better" as a "sweet country [[lullaby]]" and an "[[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] ballad about illness and hoping for health", and added that "ultimately the song is a kind of [[prayer]]". Bruner expanded that Swift's repetition of the song title "functions more as a plea than a proclamation, an uncertainty that the song's delicacy echoes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5651207/taylor-swift-lover-songs-explained/|title=Let's Discuss the Lyrics to Every Song on Taylor Swift's Lover|first=Raisa |last=Bruner |website=Time |date=August 23, 2019 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> [[New York (magazine)|''Vulture'']]'s Jewly Height noted that Swift's vocal delivery, in the song, is "hushed as she steers the perspective like a [[cinematographer]] — first the focus on a tiny detail ("coat buttons tangled in her hair"), then a zoomed-out shot of the settings where the trouble's playing out ("doctors’ offices and hospital rooms")".<ref name=":6" />

== Critical reception ==
"Soon You'll Get Better" received widespread critical acclaim, often being noted as a highlight from ''Lover'', with critics praising Swift's "sincere" vocal performance, the "vulnerable" songwriting and the acoustic instrumentation of the song. 
 
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has called the song "heart-wrenching",<ref name=":3" /> with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' saying that it contains the "most vulnerable lyrics Swift has written in her entire career".<ref name=":2" /> ''USA Today'' said that it ranked among her saddest songs, referring to her previous charity single "[[Ronan (song)|Ronan]]", also about cancer.<ref name=":5" /> ''Rolling Stone'' complimented that lack of powerful instruments allowed Swift's personal memories to be the focus on the song, with The Dixie Chicks' background vocals serving this further and echoing the internal struggle the lyrics indicate.<ref name=":2" /> ''[[USA Today]]'' said that there was no better song on the album for the collaboration.<ref name=":5" /> ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to the track as "a gorgeous, hushed country ballad about [Swift's] mother's illness, bedecked with banjo, fiddle and backing vocals by the Dixie Chicks" perfect for "those who think it all went wrong when she left Nashville" to "console themselves with".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/23/taylor-swift-lover-review|title=Taylor Swift: Lover review |last=Petridis|first=Alexis|authorlink=Alexis Petridis|date=August 23, 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=August 23, 2019 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> [[New York (magazine)|''Vulture'']] referred to the song as a "fingerpicked throwback" with Swift's singing exhibiting "breathiness, crisp enunciation, and telegraphed sincerity". They added that Swift's solo verses repeat a "modest, wilting pattern with each line over a soft bed of [[acoustic guitar]]" and that "the sound gets only slightly bigger at the first chorus, with the introduction of The Dixie Chicks' brightening harmonies, gingerly picked [[banjo]], and lyrical [[fiddle]] accents".<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/taylor-swift-dixie-chicks-soon-youll-get-better-review.html|title=Taylor Swift and the Dixie Chicks Come Full Circle on the Devastating 'Soon You'll Get Better|last=Height|first=Jewly|date=August 23, 2019|work=Vulture|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref>
