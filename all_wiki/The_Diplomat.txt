'''''The Diplomat''''' is an international [[Online magazine|online]] [[news magazine]] covering [[politics]], [[society]], and [[culture]] in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

It was originally an Australian bi-monthly print magazine, founded by Minh Bui Jones, David Llewellyn-Smith and Sung Lee in 2001, but due to financial reasons it was converted into an [[online magazine]] in 2009 and moved to [[Japan]] and later Washington, D.C..
 
The magazine is currently owned by Trans-Asia Inc.

==History==
It was originally an Australian bi-monthly print magazine, founded by Minh Bui Jones, [[David Llewellyn-Smith]] and Sung Lee in 2001. The first edition was published in April 2002, with Bui Jones as the founding editor and Llewellyn-Smith the founding publisher.

The magazine was acquired by James Pach through his company Trans-Asia Inc. in December 2007. Pach assumed the role of executive publisher and hired former ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' editor Ian Gerrard to update its presentation. Nonetheless, the print edition suffered continued losses, and ''The Diplomat'' eventually went completely online in August 2009. Its [[Sydney]] office was closed and its headquarters were moved to Tokyo; Jason Miks was appointed editor in September 2009 and Ulara Nakagawa was appointed associate editor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Diplomat magazine folds, 7 years in|author=Ari Sharp|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/diplomat-magazine-folds-7-years-in-20090904-fbgj.html|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=September 5, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> Miks was succeeded as editor by Harry Kazianis before publisher James Pach took over.<ref>[http://thediplomat.com/about-us/ "About us"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813081415/http://thediplomat.com/about-us/ |date=August 13, 2012 }}, ''The Diplomat''</ref> Shannon Tiezzi currently serves as editor-in-chief, with Catherine Putz as managing editor.

Prior to 2004, ''The Diplomat'' used to run advertisements emphasising the magazine's Australian perspective by presenting the national flags of the United States, the UK, and Australia and logos of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'' with a headline "To which view do you subscribe?" ''Time'' magazine forced the cancellation of such advertisements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/08/1094530694129.html |title='Non-American' Time heavies small local rival |author=Paul McIntyre |date=September 9, 2004 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>
