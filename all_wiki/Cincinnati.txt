In the 19th century, Cincinnati was an American [[boomtown]] in the middle of the country. Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.

Cincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.

Cincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Two years after the founding of the settlement, [[Arthur St. Clair]], the governor of the [[Northwest Territory]], changed its name to "Cincinnati", possibly at the suggestion of the surveyor [[Israel Ludlow]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Teetor|first=Henry Benton|date=May–October 1885|title=Israel Ludlow and the naming of Cincinnati|location=Cleveland|volume=2|pages=251–257|quote=The fair and reasonable presumption is that after consultation (certainly with Ludlow, the surveyor of the town, the proprietor of a two-thirds' interest in his own right, and as agent of [[Mathias Denman|Denman]]), St. Clair adopted the name suggested by Ludlow—a name which, as may seen from the following testimony, was not only mentioned for more than a year prior to the coming of St. Clair, but was selected and adopted by Denman, [[Robert Patterson (pioneer)|Patterson]] and Ludlow in the winter of 1788–9, and was inscribed upon the plat made by Ludlow to take the place of the one first made by [[John Filson|Filson]], which was destroyed in a personal altercation between Colonel Ludlow and Joel Williams.|work=[[Magazine of Western History]]}}</ref> in honor of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]].<ref name="Suess 2013">{{cite news|last=Suess|first=Jeff|date=December 28, 2013|title=Cincinnati's beginning: The origin of the settlement that became this city|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/ourhistory/2013/12/28/cincinnatis-beginning-the-origin-of-the-settlement-that-became-this-city/5363707/|accessdate=August 11, 2018|quote=On Jan. 2, 1790, Gen.

Cincinnati began in 1788 when Mathias Denman, [[Colonel Robert Patterson]], and [[Israel Ludlow]] landed at a spot at the northern bank of the Ohio opposite the mouth of the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking]] and decided to settle there. The original surveyor, [[John Filson]], named it "Losantiville".<ref name="History of Cincinnati">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924032193520|title=History of Cincinnati, Ohio|publisher=Cleveland, O., L.A.

The introduction of steamboats on the Ohio River in 1811 opened up the city's trade to more rapid shipping, and the city established commercial ties with [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[New Orleans]] downriver. Cincinnati was incorporated as a city on March 1, 1819.{{sfn|Greve|1904|pp=507–508}} Exporting pork products and hay, it became a center of pork processing in the region. From 1810 to 1830, the city's population nearly tripled, from 9,642 to 24,831.<ref name="The United States Census Bureau">{{cite web|title=Population of the 100 largest cities 1790–1990|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714032017/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027.html|archive-date=July 14, 2007|accessdate=July 29, 2007|publisher=The United States Census Bureau}}</ref> 

Construction on the Miami and Erie Canal began on July 21, 1825, when it was called the Miami Canal, related to its origin at the [[Great Miami River]]. The first section of the canal was opened for business in 1827.<ref name="Condit">{{cite book|author=Carl W.

Railroads were the next major form of commercial transportation to come to Cincinnati.

During the time, employers struggled to hire enough people to fill positions. The city had a labor shortage until large waves of immigration by Irish and Germans in the late 1840s. The city grew rapidly over the next two decades, reaching 115,000 people by 1850.<ref name="city-ws" />

During this period of rapid expansion and prominence, residents of Cincinnati began referring to the city as the Queen City.

===Industrial development and Gilded Age===
Cincinnati's location, on the border between the free state of Ohio and the slave state of Kentucky, made it a prominent location for slaves to escape the slave-owning south. Many prominent abolitionists also called Cincinnati their home during this period, and made it a popular stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/citywiseblog/lost-city-underground-railroad/|title=Lost City: Underground Railroad Sites - Cincinnati Magazine|date=May 18, 2017|work=Cincinnati Magazine|access-date=November 14, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118012505/http://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/citywiseblog/lost-city-underground-railroad/|archive-date=November 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2004, the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]] was completed along Freedom Way in Downtown, honoring the city's involvement in the Underground Railroad.

In 1859, Cincinnati laid out six streetcar lines; the cars were [[Horsecar|pulled by horses]] and the lines made it easier for people to get around the city.<ref name="Vexler" /> By 1872, Cincinnatians could travel on the streetcars within the city and transfer to rail cars for travel to the hill communities. The Cincinnati Inclined Plane Company began transporting people to the top of Mount Auburn that year.<ref name="Condit" /> In 1889, the [[Streetcars in Cincinnati|Cincinnati streetcar system]] began converting its horse-drawn cars to [[Tram|electric streetcars]].<ref name="Exhibit commemorates the streetcar era">{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Tom |title=Exhibit commemorates the streetcar era |newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=August 18, 2001 |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/18/loc_exhibit_commemorates.html |accessdate=January 3, 2014 }}</ref>

In 1880 the city government completed the [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway|Cincinnati Southern Railway]] to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. It is the only municipally owned interstate railway in the United States.

In 1884 outrage over a [[manslaughter]] verdict in what many observers thought was a clear case of murder triggered the [[Cincinnati riots of 1884|Courthouse riots]], one of the most destructive riots in American history. Over the course of three days, 56 people were killed and over 300 were injured.{{sfn|Stradling|2003|p=67}} The riots ended the regime of political bosses [[John Roll McLean]] and [[Thomas C. Campbell]] in Cincinnati.

===During the Great Depression===
An early rejuvenation of downtown began in the 1920s and continued into the next decade with the construction of [[Cincinnati Union Terminal|Union Terminal]], the post office, and the large [[Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building]]. Cincinnati weathered the [[Great Depression]] better than most American cities of its size, largely due to a resurgence in river trade, which was less expensive than transporting goods by rail.  The [[Ohio River flood of 1937|flood in 1937]] was one of the worst in the nation's history and destroyed many areas along the [[Ohio valley]]. Afterward the city built protective flood walls.

The seven hills are fully described in the June 1853 edition of the ''West American Review'', "Article III--Cincinnati: Its Relations to the West and South".

For many years, Cincinnati was known as "Porkopolis"; this less desirable nickname came from the city's large pork interests.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hB6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA334| title=Cincinnati, the Queen City, 1788–1912, Volume 2 | publisher=The S.

Newer nicknames such as "The 'Nati" are emerging and are attempted to be used in different cultural contexts.

"The City of Seven Hills" is another name for the city.  When the city was younger and smaller, the June 1853 edition of the ''West American Review'', "Article III—Cincinnati: Its Relations to the West and South" described and named seven specific hills.  The hills form a crescent around the city: [[Mount Adams, Ohio|Mount Adams]], [[Walnut Hills, Cincinnati|Walnut Hills]], [[Mount Auburn, Cincinnati, Ohio|Mount Auburn]], Vine Street Hill, College Hill, Fairmont (now rendered Fairmount), and Mount Harrison (now known as Price Hill). The name refers to ancient Rome, reputed to be built on seven hills.

{{Main|Culture of Cincinnati}}

Like all major cities in the United States, Cincinnati was proliferated by [[American ancestry|Americans]], but also [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] known as the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots Irish]], [[American frontier|frontiersmen]], and [[keelboat]]ers. Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].

[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]

Cincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20–21</ref> Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the "Black Code" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>

Germans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: "This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati. David Ziegler was the first president of the town, [[William Corry (Cincinnati mayor)|William Corry]] the first mayor of the town, and [[Isaac G.

In 1830 residents with German roots made up 5% of the population, as many had migrated from Pennsylvania; ten years later this had increased to 30%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnati-cityofimmigrants.com/cci/german.htm |title=:: Cincinnati, A City of Immigrants  |publisher=Cincinnati-cityofimmigrants.com |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724105123/http://www.cincinnati-cityofimmigrants.com/cci/german.htm |archive-date=July 24, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Thousands of Germans entered the city after the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|Prussian revolution of 1848]], and by 1900, more than 60 percent of its population was of Prussian background.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hetzer|first=Laura|title=Cincinnati: Our German History|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/cincinnati-our-german-history-327345.html|publisher=Yahoo!|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102191716/http://voices.yahoo.com/cincinnati-our-german-history-327345.html|archive-date=November 2, 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}</ref> The menial-jobbed, aggravated Irish often organized mobs and the Germans, far away from their [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] connections, did the same. Thus, leaders of the city had to use fortifying measures against the arrivals' clashes.

Volatile social conditions saw [[Cincinnati riots of 1829|riots in 1829]], when many blacks lost their homes and property.

The [[Flying Pig Marathon]] is a yearly event attracting many runners and so is the [[Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati Masters Western & Southern tennis tournament]].

The Cincinnati Reds have won five World Series titles and had one of the most successful baseball teams of all time in the mid-1970s, known as The Big Red Machine. The Bengals have made two Super Bowl appearances since its founding, in 1981 and 1988, but have yet to win a championship. As of 2016, the Bengals have the longest active playoff win drought (26 years) despite making five straight playoff appearances from 2011 to 2015. Whenever the Bengals and [[Carolina Panthers]] play against each other (an interconference matchup that occurs every four years), their games are dubbed the "Queen City Bowl", as [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], North Carolina, the home city of the Panthers, is also known as the Queen City.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mayors want 'Queen City' debate settled in Carolina-Cincy game |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=October 7, 2014 |accessdate=December 10, 2019 |url=https://www.si.com/mayors-fighting-Queen-City-nickname-Panthers-Bengals}}</ref> The Bengals enjoy strong rivalries with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (both of whom are also members of the [[AFC North]]).

Cincinnati is also home to two men's college basketball teams: The [[Cincinnati Bearcats]] and [[Xavier Musketeers]]. These two teams face off as one of college basketball's rivalries known as the [[Crosstown Shootout]]. In [[2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2011]], the rivalry game erupted in [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|an on-court brawl]] at the end of the game that saw multiple suspensions follow. The Musketeers have made 10 of the last 11 [[NCAA]] tournaments while the Bearcats have made six consecutive appearances. Previously, the [[Cincinnati Royals]] competed in the [[National Basketball Association]] from 1957 to 1972; they are now known as the [[Sacramento Kings]].

==Politics==
[[File:Logo for the City of Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|The logo for the City of Cincinnati]]

The city proper operates with a [[Election Results, City Council of Cincinnati, Ohio|nine-member city council]], whose members are elected [[at-large]]. Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of George B. [[George B. Cox|"Boss" Cox]] exerting control.

A reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council–manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.

In an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name="amy">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The top nine vote-getters were elected (the "9-X system"), which favored candidates who could appeal to the entire geographic area of the city and reach its residents with campaign materials. The mayor was elected by the council.  In 1977, 33-year-old [[Jerry Springer]], later a notable television talk show host, was chosen to serve one year as mayor.

Residents continued to work to improve their system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} To have their votes count more, starting in 1987, the top vote-getter in the city council election was automatically selected as mayor.

Due to its location on the Ohio River, Cincinnati was a border town in a free state, across from Kentucky, which was a slave state. Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.

Given its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829. Anti-abolitionists attacked blacks in the city in a wave of destruction that resulted in 1,200 blacks leaving the city and the country; they resettled in Canada.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/negroinourhisto01woodgoog|title=The Negro in Our History|authors=Carter G.

White riots against blacks took place again in Cincinnati in 1836 and 1842.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 1836 a mob of 700 pro-slavery men attacked black neighborhoods, as well as a press run by [[James M.

[[Levi Coffin]] made the Cincinnati area the center of his anti-slavery efforts in 1847.<ref>Levi Coffin, ''Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, the reputed president of the underground railroad: being a brief history of the labors of a lifetime in behalf of the slave, with the stories of numerous fugitives, who gained their freedom through his instrumentality, and many other incidents'', Cincinnati: Western Tract Society, University of Michigan Library</ref> [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] lived in Cincinnati for a time, met escaped slaves, and used their stories as a basis for her novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). The [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]], which opened in 2004 on the Cincinnati riverfront in the middle of "[[The Banks]]" area between [[Great American Ballpark]] and [[Paul Brown Stadium]], commemorates the volunteers who aided refugee slaves and their drive for freedom, as well as others who have been leaders for social justice.

Located in a free state and attracting many European immigrants, Cincinnati has historically had a predominantly white population.<ref name="pop"/> By 1940, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 87.8 percent white and 12.2 percent black.<ref name="pop">{{cite web|title=Ohio&nbsp;– Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 6, 2012 }}</ref>

In the second half of the 20th century, Cincinnati, along with other [[rust belt]] cities, underwent a vast demographic transformation. By the early 21st century, the city's population was 40% black. Predominantly white, working-class families who constituted the urban core during the European immigration boom in the 19th and early 20th centuries, moved to newly constructed suburbs before and after World War II. Blacks, fleeing the oppression of the [[Jim Crow]] South in hopes of better socioeconomic opportunity, had moved to these older city neighborhoods in their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the industrial North. The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty. In 1968 passage of national civil rights legislation had raised hopes for positive change, but the assassination of national leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] resulted in riots in many black neighborhoods in Cincinnati; unrest occurred in black communities in nearly every major U.S. city after King's murder.

More than three decades later, in April 2001, racially charged [[Cincinnati riots of 2001|riots]] occurred after police fatally shot a young unarmed black man, [[Cincinnati riots of 2001#Incident|Timothy Thomas]], during a foot pursuit to arrest him, mostly for outstanding traffic warrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/unrest/|title=Cincinnati.Com – Your Key to the City|work=cincinnati.com|access-date=June 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706105950/http://cincinnati.com/unrest/|archive-date=July 6, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> After the 2001 riots, the ACLU, Cincinnati Black United Front, the city and its police union agreed upon a community-oriented policing strategy.

The development of a [[light rail]] system has long been a goal for Cincinnati, with several proposals emerging over many decades. The city grew rapidly during [[Streetcars in Cincinnati|its streetcar era]] of the late 19th century and early 1900s.

The subway was planned to be a 16-mile loop from Downtown to [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]] to Oakley and back to the east side of Downtown. [[World War I]] delayed the construction in 1920 and inflation raised the costs causing the Oakley portion never to be built.  Mayor Seasongood who took office later on argued it would cost too much money to finish the system.

It is also served by [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]], [[Interstate 74 (Ohio)|Interstate 74]], [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate 75]] and numerous U.S. highways: [[U.S. Highway 22 (Ohio)|US 22]], [[U.S. Highway 25 (Ohio)|US 25]], [[U.S. Highway 27 (Ohio)|US 27]], [[U.S. Highway 42 (Ohio)|US 42]], [[U.S. Route 50 in Ohio|US 50]], [[U.S. Highway 52 (Ohio)|US 52]], and [[U.S. Highway 127 (Ohio)|US 127]].  The [[Riverfront Transit Center]], built underneath 2nd Street, is about the size of eight football fields. It is only used for sporting events and school field trips.  At its construction, it was designed for public transit buses, charter buses, school buses, city coach buses, light rail, and possibly commuter rail.  When not in use for sporting events, it is closed off and rented to a private parking vendor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.go-metro.com/about-metro/about2/doingbusiness/doingbusinesswithmetro/riverfront-transit-center |title=Riverfront Transit Center|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|title=I-Team: $48 million transit station sits empty|first=Brendan|last=Keefe|date=October 31, 2011|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216100317/http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/i-team-48-million-transit-station-sits-empty|archive-date=February 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|title=Cincinnati's Riverfront Transit Center Attracts Criticism|date=July 7, 2009|access-date=February 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112215226/http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/07/07/cincinnatis-riverfront-transit-center-attracts-criticism/|archive-date=November 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
