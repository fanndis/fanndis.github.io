{{MTV}}

'''VH1''' (originally an [[initialism]] of '''Video Hits One''') is an American [[basic cable]] television network based in New York City owned by [[ViacomCBS]]. It was created by [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]], at the time a division of [[Warner Communications]] and the original owner of [[MTV]], and launched on January 1, 1985, in the former space of [[Turner Broadcasting System]]'s short-lived [[Cable Music Channel]].

The channel was originally conceived to build upon the success of sister channel MTV by playing [[music videos]] targeting a slightly older demographic than MTV by focusing on the lighter, softer side of [[popular music]].<ref name=launsch>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=11xOAAAAIBAJ&pg=5661%2C1204403 |work=Spokane Chronicle |location=(Washington) |agency=(New York Times) |last=Sherwood |first=Rick |title=VH-1 wants adult video viewers|date=October 5, 1984 |page=11}}</ref> Like MTV, VH1 ultimately drifted away from music videos and into [[reality television]] programming, albeit with a focus on music personalities and celebrities, and shows targeting African-American audiences. VH1 is best known for franchises such as ''[[Behind the Music]]'', the ''[[I Love...#VH1 series|I Love…]]'' series, the ''[[VH1#Celebreality|Celebreality]]'' block, and ''[[Love & Hip Hop]]''.

As of January 2016, approximately 90.2 million US households received VH1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history (1985–1994)===
====Format and VJs (1985–89)====
[[File:VH-1.svg|thumb|150px|right|The first VH1 logo used from 1985 to 1988 in the USA; between 1995–2002 in Germany and 1993–1999 in the UK/Ireland. Designed by LPG/Pon, Dale Pon and George Lois.]]
[[File:Vh1.svg|thumb|150px|right|The second VH1 logo used from 1988 to 1994. Designed by Scott Miller. During the Christmas season the "V" would be flipped upside down to resemble a Christmas tree.]]

VH1's aim was to focus on the lighter, softer side of [[popular music]],<ref name="b and c">{{cite news|last=Becker|first=Anne|title=VH1 Hits a New High Note|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6557244.html?rssid=193|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=May 3, 2009|access-date=May 3, 2008}}</ref> including such musicians as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Kenny G]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Anita Baker]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]], in hopes of appealing to people aged 18 to 35, and possibly older. Also frequently featured in the network's early years were "videos" for [[Motown Records|Motown]] and other 60s [[oldies]] consisting of [[newsreel]] and concert footage. It was introduced on January 1, 1985, with the video performance of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]],<ref name="b and c"/> who died a year before the network launched (the national anthem was also played at the launch of Cable Music Channel).

From the start, Video Hits One was branded as an urban version of its sister/parent channel. It played more jazz and R&B artists than MTV and had a higher rotation of urban-contemporary performers. Its early on-camera personalities were New York radio veterans [[Don Imus]] (then of [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]]), [[Frankie Crocker]] (then program director and DJ for [[WBLS]]), [[Scott Shannon]] (of [[WHTZ]]), [[Jon Bauman]] ("Bowzer" from [[Sha Na Na]]), [[Bobby Rivers]], and [[Rita Coolidge]].

Later VJs included Tim Byrd of [[WFAN-FM|WPIX-FM]] (the current day FM rebroadcast of [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]]), a station whose eclectic ballad-and-R&B oriented format mirrored that of VH-1, Roger Rose - Actor and comedian (Ski Patrol), and [[Alison Steele]] ("The Nightbird" of [[WNEW-FM]]). [[Rosie O'Donnell]] later joined the outlet's veejay lineup. O'Donnell would also host a comedy show featuring various comedians each episode. As an added touch to make the network more like a televised radio station, the early years of the network featured jingles in their bumpers produced by [[JAM Creative Productions]] in Dallas, who had previously made jingles for radio stations worldwide.

The format left room for occasional ad-libs by the VJ, a godsend for emcees such as Imus and O'Donnell. In true Imus style, he used a 1985 segment of his VH-1 show to jokingly call smooth-jazz icon [[Sade Adu]] a "grape" for her oval-shaped head.

Typical of VH1's very early programming was ''New Visions'', a series which featured videos and in-studio performances by [[smooth jazz]] and classical and [[New-age music|new-age]] bands and performers, including [[Spyro Gyra]], [[Andy Narell]], [[Mark Isham]], [[Philip Glass]],<ref>{{youtube|tye8bHjPRUU|"Opening" by Philip Glass on VH-1's 'New Visions'}}</ref> and [[Yanni]]. At first many different musicians guest-hosted the program, but eventually musician/songwriter [[Ben Sidran]] became the permanent host.

New Age music videos continued to play on the channel into the 1990s. They would be seen on the Sunday morning two-hour music video block titled ''Sunday Brunch''.

====Early programming (1989–1994)====
Once VH1 established itself a few years later, they catered to Top 40, [[adult contemporary]], [[classic rock]], and 1980s mainstream pop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NPYAxnuVgc |title=1991 VH1 Commercials |website=YouTube |date=27 October 2011 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> For a time, even country music videos aired in a one-hour block during the afternoons. They started out using MTV's famous [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]] typeface font for their music video credit tags. It was later replaced in 1991 by a larger font, with the year the video was made added to the lower column that identified the label on which the album was released. In 1993, the name of the videos' director was included at the bottom of the credits.

During this time, they also had some non-music programming, such as a comedy hour hosted by [[Rosie O'Donnell]] with various amateur and veteran comedians, called ''Stand Up Spotlight'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE3cp0qg7go |title=Stand Up Spotlight – Robert G. Lee |website=YouTube |date=27 October 2011 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> an in-depth look at current movies called ''Flix'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlwFedNQs1Y |title=VH-1 Flix reports on Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey – 1991 |website=YouTube |date=14 March 2009 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> and reports on good civilians and volunteers in the community, called ''Good News People''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_eGsNBCjUQ |title=1991 Little River Canyon Cleanup High Res Version |website=YouTube |date=7 September 2008 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref>

Every week, the Top 21 Video Countdown usually had a different guest host.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5WJd3mYiVM |title=Schascle-VH1 Top 21 Count Down |website=YouTube |date=24 August 2011 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> Occasionally, they had themed countdowns as well, such as Elvira hosting creepy videos for Halloween in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VMyXii3LZE |title=Elvira's Video Countdown |website=YouTube |date=27 October 2011 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref>

Long blocks of music videos by a particular artist or band, theme, or years were also very popular in this era. One popular weekend program was called ''Video Rewind'', in which blocks of 1980s videos from one particular year would play for an hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WjmqbFeVzA|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> There was also a short-lived hour-long program called ''By Request'' in which viewers could call a 1–900 hotline number to request their videos.

Also in 1991, a popular morning program was introduced called ''Hits News & Weather'' that ran from 7{{nbsp}}am to 9{{nbsp}}am ET.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QseEyA2O_rA |title=VH1 1991 |website=YouTube |date=19 August 2010 |access-date=22 September 2013}}</ref> (It later expanded to 10{{nbsp}}am ET.) It composed of music videos both past and present along with a 90-second update of the day's news & weather provided by [[All News Channel]]. The updates were typically shown twice an hour during the program. A box displaying the minutes past the hour was shown below the logo during the period. It was discontinued a week before the channel was re-branded in the Spring of 1994. During the week prior, classic music videos from forgotten artists/bands aired, titled ''Whatever Happened To...?''

The channel's playlist was gradually expanding, and, by 1994, included contemporary musicians such as [[Ace of Base]], [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Amy Grant]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], and other slightly heavier, or more [[alternative rock]]-influenced music than what it had originally played, although favorites such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Cher]], [[Elton John]], [[Madonna]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]] still continued to receive heavy play for several more years as well. VH1 to One was a program in the Video Hits One days that was very similar to Behind The Music. It profiled artists such as Phil Colins, Michael Bolton and Paul McCartney. Plus other various artists of interest at the time that were playing the network's chosen style of music at the time and their music careers

====VH1 Corvette Give-away Sweepstakes====
In order to reach a wider and younger audience, VH1 announced in late 1989 that in 1990 they would be holding a contest where the grand prize was a collection of 36 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s, one for every model year from its introduction year of 1953, to the then current model year of 1989 (there is no model for 1983), all going to a single grand winner. All cars were to be certified as roadworthy and in "good" to "excellent" condition. The collection at the time had an estimated worth of over {{US$}}1 million. Contestants entered by calling a 900 number and registering, at $2 per call. VH1 received over 4 million call-in entries. The winner was a man from Long Island, New York, who immediately sold the entire collection to artist [[Peter Max]] for $500,000. Max intended to use the cars for an art project, but it never got started and the entire collection was left in an underground parking lot in New York City for over 20 years, and deteriorated into poor condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/vh1-once-gave-away-a-collection-of-corvettes-from-every-single-model-year-256039|title=vh1-once-gave-away-a-collection-of-corvettes-from-every-single-model-year|publisher=autotrader.com|access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://roadtrippers.com/stories/max-corvettes|title=max-corvettes|publisher=roadtrippers.com|access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://corvetteheroes.com/|title=vh1 corvette giveaway|publisher=corvetteheroes.com|access-date=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/peter-max-s-forgotten-corvette-collection-emerges-from-the-dust-after-25-years-162558587.html|title=Forgotten Corvette collection emerges from the dust after 25 years|date=23 December 2014|work=Yahoo Autos|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://restomods.com/forgotten-corvette-collection-rediscovered-256/|title=Long Forgotten Corvette Collection Rediscovered|work=Restomods.com|access-date=3 January 2015}}</ref>

===''VH1: Music First'' (1994–2003)===
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2008}}
[[File:VH1 94-2003 logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The third VH1 logo used from 1994 to 2003. The circle ring surrounding the logo was added in 1998. It was used on [[MTV Classic (British and Irish TV channel)|VH1 Classic UK]] from 1999 to 2010, [[MTV Classic (American TV channel)|VH1 Classic US]] from 2000 to 2007, and [[VH1 Classic (European TV channel)|VH1 Classic Europe]] from 2004 to 2020.]] In May 1994, VH1 re-branded itself as ''VH1: Music First'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDB3ynCBudc |title=MADONNA, VH1 94' Advice |website=YouTube |date=11 March 2007 |access-date=September 22, 2013}}</ref> following a slight ratings decline in the early 1990s.<ref name="b and c"/> They began airing "History of Music Videos A to Z" during the July 4 weekend from 1994 to 1998 where they would show a large percentage of their library of music videos, which would include mini-marathons of videos by artists with a large number of videos. The success of A to Z led to a weeknight 11{{nbsp}}p.m. hour-long broadcast of [[Madonna]] videos, titled ''The Madonna Show''. The videos were aired without introduction by a VJ and the program was soon shortened to thirty minutes, and then scrapped altogether. By 1996, VH1 was heading down the same path as its sister channel, MTV, choosing to focus more on music-related shows than on music videos. Additionally, the network began to expand its playlist of music videos to include more rock music.<ref name="b and c"/> Old episodes of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' could regularly be seen on the channel. By that time, the channel's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were beginning to fall.

====''Video Countdown''====
As part of VH-1's re-branding as "VH1: Music First" in 1994, the channel launched a new series, the ''VH1 Top 10 Countdown'', that counted down the top 10 music videos played on VH1 each week. A combination of record sales, radio airplay, video spins, [[Internet forum|message board]] posts, and [[Mail|conventional mail]] would decide the order of the countdown. A rotating cast of [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] picked up hosting duties for the show over the years. The series expanded from 10 to 20 music videos, becoming the ''[[VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown]]'', in 2001. The show was renamed ''The 20'' in early 2015, and ended later that year.

====''Pop-Up Video''====
In the fall of 1996, VH1 premiered ''[[Pop-Up Video]]'', in which music videos were accompanied by "pop-ups" (also known as "bubbles" or "info nuggets")—small enclosed areas of the screen containing facts about the band artists, and videos such as career highlights, discography, biographical details, quotes, and anecdotes. For a time, this was VH1's highest rated show.

====''VH1 Storytellers''====
{{main|VH1 Storytellers}}
In February 1996, VH1 again hit it big with the premiere of the first of the network's flagship shows, ''VH1 Storytellers''. The show started with a broadcast of [[Ray Davies]], during his "Storyteller" tour, and took its name from this first show. In each hourlong episode, artists appear in front of a (mostly small and intimate) live audience, interspersing musical performances with anecdotes related to the songs' meaning, the songwriting process, audience reaction, etc. Along with Davies, the series has featured a widely diverse list of artists, including [[Culture Club]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Johnny Cash]], [[Kanye West]], [[Tom Waits]], and [[Def Leppard]]. [[Meat Loaf]] enjoyed the show's format so much that he bought the stage decorations from VH-1 and went on to do a "Storytellers" tour in 1998/1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/772.html|publisher=livedaily.com|title=Meat Loaf's "Storytellers" Tour Extended Through January|date=7 December 1999|access-date=27 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517044055/http://www.livedaily.com/news/772.html|archive-date=May 17, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====''Behind the Music''====
{{main|Behind the Music}}
VH1 scored another hit in August 1997 with the debut of ''Behind the Music''. The hourlong show features interviews and biographies of some of popular music's biggest stars qualified to be profiled on the series. The premiere episode featured [[Milli Vanilli]]. Episodes have ranged from [[Aaliyah]] to [[Stryper]] to [[Queen (band)|Queen]], as well as others such as, [[Meat Loaf]], [[Tori Amos]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Cher]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[TLC (music)|TLC]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Megadeth]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Selena]], [[Petra (band)|Petra]], [[Pantera]], and [[Eminem]], with more episodes being produced periodically. By the late 1990s, the show began to run out of artists to profile, leading to the short-lived ''BTM2'' program, half-hour looks into bands and artists whose popularity was rising, but not yet at its peak.

====''Legends''====
{{Main|VH1's Legends}}
Shortly after, VH1 created a companion series, ''[[VH1's Legends|Legends]]'' (originally sponsored by [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]), profiling artists who have made a more significant contribution to music history to qualify as "Legends" (that is, those artists who have gone beyond the category of ''Behind the Music'' biographies). The artists profiled so far have included <!--KEEP IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->[[Aerosmith]]; the [[Bee Gees]]; [[David Bowie]]; [[Johnny Cash]]; [[Eric Clapton]]; [[The Clash]]; [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]; [[Sam Cooke]]; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]; [[The Doors]]; [[John Fogerty]]; [[Aretha Franklin]]; [[Marvin Gaye]]; [[The Grateful Dead]]; [[Guns N' Roses]]; [[Jimi Hendrix]]; [[Michael Jackson]]; [[Eminem]]; [[Elton John]]; [[Janis Joplin]]; [[B.

==== VH1 Save The Music Foundation ====
The VH1 Save The Music Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to restoring instrumental music education programs in America's public schools, and raising awareness about the importance of music as part of each child's complete education. Founded in 1997, VH1 Save The Music was the first organization in existence dedicated to restoring music programs in America's schools. For nearly 20 years, the foundation has donated over $53 million worth of new musical instruments to 2,024 public schools in 247 school districts around the country to date—impacting the lives of more than three{{nbsp}}million public school students. Learn about the foundation's Play it Forward campaign in celebration of its 20th anniversary here: on.vh1.com/playitforward

VH1 Save The Music Foundation's 2012 Ambassador class includes [[Gavin Rossdale]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Vanessa Carlton]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Chris Daughtry]], [[Matthew Morrison]], and [[AJ Mclean]], joining Alumni Ambassadors including: [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[John Mayer]], [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[John Legend]], [[The Fray]], [[Colbie Caillat]], [[Tamia]], [[Ne-Yo]], and [[Nick Lachey]], among many other musicians, singers, athletes and celebrities dedicated to the cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1savethemusic.com/ambassadors |title=Ambassadors |publisher=VH1 Save The Music |access-date=24 October 2012}}</ref> VH1 Save The Music Ambassadors help raise awareness and deliver key messages about the importance of music education in a young person's life, as well as help raise funds to further the Foundation's mission to restore instrumental music education programs in U.S. public elementary and middle schools. It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 1999.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/life-according-to-sam-hbo 59th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2000.</ref>

====''VH1 Divas''====
In 1998, VH1 debuted the first annual ''[[VH1 Divas]]'' concert and featured the "divas" [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Gloria Estefan]], and [[Celine Dion]], and the "special guest" [[Carole King]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=There Are Divas, and There Are Divas|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDD173CF935A25757C0A96E958260|work=The New York Times|date=16 April 1998|access-date=3 May 2008}}</ref> The second installment of these "diva" shows was produced in 1999 featuring [[Whitney Houston]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Cher]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], and special "divo" [[Elton John]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Freydkin|first=Donna|title=VH1's dueling divas belt it out for a good cause|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9904/16/divas/|work=CNN.com|date=16 April 1999|access-date=3 May 2008}}</ref> It became a huge success and was featured in the following years starring [[Diana Ross]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Shakira]], [[Deborah Harry]], [[Anastacia]], [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Jessica Simpson]]. Also in 1999, [[Donna Summer]] who was asked to do the "diva" concert, was given her own concert special by VH1 "Donna Summer Live and More: Encore". Some female artists such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Cher]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[Billy Joel]] were featured in two or more VH1 divas concerts, with [[Cyndi Lauper]] appearing the most times, having been featured in four concerts. In 2000, [[Diana Ross]], who has been asked several times to appear on previous editions, appeared in her own edition of the special, "VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute To Diana Ross"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRmhiwuwvzY</ref>

====''Movies That Rock''====
In 1999, VH1 aired its first original movie, a biopic on [[Sweetwater (band)|Sweetwater]]. Their third original movie (which aired in 2000), ''[[Two of Us (2000 television)|Two of Us]]'', focused on a fictional meeting between [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Over the next three years, they made over a dozen movies, including bio-pics on [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Doors]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[MC Hammer]], [[The Monkees]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Def Leppard]].

VH1 continues to air "Movies That Rock" on a regular basis, expanding to include movies not produced by VH1. The subject matter remains mostly focused on music and musicians.

====Diversification====
In the late 1990s, VH1 continued to get more diverse and teen-based with its music selection, and with that, the network updated its 1994 "Big 1" logo. Various late-night rock shows have been shown on VH1, featuring [[alternative rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] videos from the 1980s and 1990s. VH1 eventually warmed up to harder rock acts such as the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], the [[Foo Fighters]], the [[Stone Temple Pilots]], and [[Metallica]]. Their new videos began being added into VH1's playlist right away.

Around late 2002, VH1 even began to play mainstream [[hip hop music|rap]] musicians.<ref name="b and c"/> The latest videos by [[Eminem]], [[Nelly]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] began to be shown in VH1's rotation and even started to cut up on VH1's top 20 countdown. VH1 also plays music from Latin artists such as [[Ricky Martin]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Thalía]], and [[Shakira]].

====Other past trends====
''rockDocs'' was the title under which VH1 aired various [[rockumentary|music documentaries]], both those produced by VH1 and those produced by third parties. Such documentary series produced by VH1 include "''And Ya' Don't Stop''", a five-part series on the history of hip-hop and rap,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925111.html?categoryid=32&cs=1|title = And You Don't Stop: 30 Years of Hip Hop|publisher = Variety | date = 3 October 2004|author = Phil Gallo}}</ref> a four-part series on the history of heavy metal, ''[[Heavy: The Story of Metal]]'', and ''[[The Drug Years]]'', which tells the story of different drug cultures that changed America. Films produced by other studios have also been aired as ''rockDocs'', including ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare]]'', ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'', ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', ''[[Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!]]'', a documentary on the [[Beastie Boys]], and most recently ''[[Last Days of Left Eye]]'' which documented the last month of [[Lisa Lopes]]'s life from the band [[TLC (band)|TLC]], and ''N.W.A.: The World's Most Dangerous Group,'' featuring the narration of comedian [[Chris Rock]], which chronicled the rise and fall of [[N.W.A]].

VH1 endured criticism for ''Music Behind Bars'', which mainly focuses on musicians in custody. Critics have claimed prisoners, mainly those convicted of murder, should not be entitled to any exposure, especially nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc10.com/news/1712084/detail.html|title=Philadelphia News, Local News, Weather, Traffic, and Breaking News|work=NBC 10 Philadelphia|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref>

The channel aired ''[[Where Are They Now? (VH1 TV series)|Where Are They Now?]]'' from 1999 to 2002. It featured former celebrities and their current professional and personal status. Each episode was dedicated to a specific genre, ranging from past child stars to [[Aaron Spelling#Notable productions|Aaron Spelling's notable productions]], to controversial news figures.

VH1 also aired a series of promos in 2003, featuring animated kittens from the online animation website Rathergood, lipsyncing popular songs such as "[[I Love Rock n' Roll]]" written & performed by [[Alan Merrill]] of the [[Arrows (British band)|Arrows]] since 1975 (US cover hit by [[Joan Jett]] in 1982), [[Culture Club]]'s "[[Karma Chameleon]]" and [[Guns N' Roses]]' "[[Welcome to the Jungle]]". These spots were done by British animator [[Joel Veitch]].

===Box logo era (2003–2013)===
[[File:VH1 Logo.svg|thumbnail|150px|The fourth VH1 logo used from 2003 to 2013. [[MTV Classic (American TV channel)|VH1 Classic]] used the logo until 2016. VH1 international channels also used the logo, with [[VH1 India|the Indian version of VH1]] still using the logo today.]]
In August 2003, the network changed its focus again, dropping "Music First" from its name, and introducing a box logo. Having saturated its ''Behind The Music'' series (and spinoff ''BTM2'', a 30-minute version that told the stories of current chart-toppers), gotten past the point of showing music videos on a regular basis, the network began to target the pop culture nostalgia market.<ref name="b and c"/><ref name="slate">{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Bryan|title=VH1: The Surreal Network|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136882/|work=Slate|date=February 23, 2006|access-date=February 24, 2006}}</ref> Following the controversy over the murder-suicide of a contestant from ''[[Megan Wants a Millionaire]]'', the channel toned down its reality programming.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Business/Financial Desk; SECTB - With 'Celebreality,' VH1 attracts ratings and chagrin| first = Brian | last = Stelter  | page = 5 | date = 31 August 2009 | access-date = September 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/business/media/31cable.html?_r=3&fta=y&pagewanted=all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | title =  Music Index&nbsp;– Top Story 1 - VH1 revamps programming| date = 18 April 2010 | access-date = September 26, 2010 | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec3c2452ddf8270c14cd59b8ec1ea302| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130125170346/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec3c2452ddf8270c14cd59b8ec1ea302| url-status = dead| archive-date = January 25, 2013}}</ref> On July 1, 2007, VH1 and [[MTV Live (TV network)|MHD]] simulcast the entire ''Concert for Diana'' live from London, England, on the birthday of [[Princess Diana]], [[Princess of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/events/concerts/diana/|title=Watch Video of the Concert for Diana On-Demand - View Individual Performances Online - See Photos from the Concert for Princess Diana - VH1.com|work=vh1.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref>

VH1 would continue to air its music video blocks despite its decreasing reliance on such programming. Their main program block was seen from 3{{nbsp}}a.m. to 11{{nbsp}}a.m. ET. The overnight block was called ''Insomniac Music Theater'', later renamed ''Nocturnal State'' in August 2005. At of the beginning of October 2008, ''Nocturnal State'' was cut down to one hour, and ''Fresh: New Music'' was supplanted by additional hours of ''Jump Start''. In 2010, VH1 retired ''Nocturnal State''. Music Videos continued to be branded under ''Jump Start'' until January 5, 2013.

====''I Love…'' series (2002–2014)====
{{further|I Love...#VH1 series}}
In 2002, VH1 broadcast a ten-part series entitled ''[[I Love the '80s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '80s]]''. The series was adapted from a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] series, first broadcast in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/|title=BBC Two - I Love the 1970s|work=BBC|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's ''I Love the '80s'', coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from [[2003 in television|2003's]] ''[[I Love the '70s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '70s]]'', to further variants like ''[[I Love the '80s Strikes Back]]'', ''[[I Love the '90s (U.S. TV series)|I Love the '90s]]'', and ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. More recently, VH1 premiered ''[[I Love the '80s 3-D]]'' and ''[[I Love the '70s: Volume 2]]''. So eager was the network to capitalize on the trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, despite the fact that the decade had not yet ended (''[[I Love the New Millennium]]'', broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000–2007). This was thought to be the final installment of the series until 2014, when ''[[I Love the 2000s]]'' continued the format.

The concept was broadened to include non-decade based installments, ''[[I Love the Holidays]]'' and ''[[I Love Toys]]''. The format of these shows has also been repeated for the weekly program ''[[Best Week Ever]]''.

====''The Greatest'' series====
VH1 also produces its ''[[The Greatest (TV series)|The Greatest]]'' series in which a similar format is used to countdown lists like ''"100 Greatest Artists of Rock and Roll"'', ''"The 50 Sexiest Video Moments"'', ''"100 Greatest Songs of Rock 'N' Roll"'', ''"100 Greatest Songs from the Past 25 Years"'', ''"100 Greatest One-hit Wonders"'', ''"100 Greatest Kid Stars"'', and ''"100 Greatest Teen Stars"''. In 2001, [[Mark McGrath]] hosted VH1's miniseries ''"100 Most Shocking Moments in Rock 'N' Roll"'', which compiled a list of the moments in music history that changed its course and shook its foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/05-16-2001/0001495648&EDATE=|title=100 Most Shocking Moments in Rock 'N' Roll}}</ref> Recently in late December 2009, an updated series titled ''"100 Most Shocking Music Moments"'' aired on VH1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=156471|title=Ep. 207 - 100 Most Shocking Music Moments (Hour 1) - The Greatest - Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps - VH1.com|work=vh1.com|access-date=February 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.ca/2009/12/28/vh1-100-most-shocking-music-moments|title=Exclusive: VH1's '100 Most Shocking Music Moments'|author=AOL|work=PopEater|access-date=February 23, 2015}}</ref> In 2008 and early 2009, the channel premiered the "''100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs"'', ''"100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs"'', ''"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s"'', and ''"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s"''.

====''40 Most Awesomely Bad''====
In 2004, VH1 began this mini-series category with ''"50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever"''. Additional series in this group include ''"40 Most Awesomely Bad Dirrty Songs...Ever"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/40_most_awesomely_bad_dirty_songs_ever/series.jhtml|title=VH1.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> ''"40 Most Awesomely Bad Break-up Songs...Ever"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/awesomely_bad_breakup_songs/series_countdown.jhtml|title=VH1.com - Error Page 404.html|work=vh1.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> ''"40 Most Awesomely Bad #1 Songs...Ever"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/40_most_awesomely_bad_1_songs/series_countdown.jhtml|title=VH1.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> ''"40 Most Awesomely Bad Metal Songs...Ever"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/40_most_awesomely_bad_metal_songs_ever/series_featured_copy.jhtml|title=VH1.com - Error Page 404.html|work=vh1.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> and ''"40 Most Awesomely Bad Love Songs"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/40_awesomely_bad_love_songs/series_countdown.jhtml|title=VH1.com|access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref>

====''Celebreality''==== <!--Section linked from [[VH1 reality]]-->
In January 2005 VH1 launched its ''Celebreality'' programming block of reality shows featuring celebrities, anchored by ''[[The Surreal Life]]'', which mimics [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Real World (TV series)|The Real World]]'', instead placing celebrities from the past into a living environment.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | title = Arts & Entertainment - Watchable trash| first = Sharon | last = Fink  | date = 9 January 2005 | access-date = August 18, 2010 | url = http://sptimes.com/2005/01/09/news_pf/Artsandentertainment/Watchable_trash.shtml}}</ref>
The word "celebreality" is blend of the words "celebrity" and "reality" and is generally used to describe reality TV shows in which celebrities participate as subjects. The term appears to have been coined by Michael Gross, writing for The Toronto Star on May 12, 1991. In his article, entitled "Celebrity's New Face," Mr. Gross used a hyphenated form of the word ("celeb-reality") to describe the tendency of certain contemporary celebrities to downplay the traditional trappings of [[Hollywood glamour]]. "You could see the new celeb-reality on display at this year's Oscars," wrote Gross. "It is Kathy Bates and Whoopi Goldberg, not Kim Basinger and Michelle Pfeiffer. It is Jeremy Irons in black tie and the sneakers he says keep his feet on the ground. It is Kevin Costner, fighting small, important battles, winning big, but reacting with modesty and going off to party privately. The new celebrities are human first, famous second."

The next known citation of the word is by Joyce Millman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 5, 2003. In an article entitled, "Celebreality: The 'Stars' Are Elbowing Their Way In," Ms. Millman wrote: "Celebreality, the junk genre du jour, turns the notion of reality TV upside down. Instead of real people acting like celebrities on shows like "Survivor", "Big Brother" and "The Bachelor", celebreality gives us celebrities acting like real people on shows like "The Osbournes", "The Anna Nicole Show" and "Celebrity Boot Camp." I'm using the term "celebrity" loosely here—we're not talking about Russell Crowe, Julia Roberts and Dame Judi Dench eating bugs and scrubbing latrines. No, the celebrities of celebreality are a motlier crew, like, well, Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil, the former rap superstar M. C. Hammer and the wee ex-Michael Jackson ornament Emmanuel ("Webster") Lewis. Those three will be setting up housekeeping together on Thursday in "The Surreal Life" on WB, a celebreality spin on MTV's "Real World." Not to be outdone, ABC sends a Baldwin brother (Stephen), a supermodel (Frederique) and a former "L.A. Law" star (Corbin Bernsen) to Hawaii for "Celebrity Mole Hawaii", beginning Wednesday."

The VH1 Celebreality block has also aired shows such as:
*2003: ''[[Surviving Nugent]]'' sent eight individuals to [[Ted Nugent]]'s house to compete in various games and activities. One of the contestants was future reality show star [[Tila Tequila]].

===Current era (2013–present)===
On January 5, 2013, VH1 introduced a new logo that closely resembles their first. The logo has a "plus" sign in it, representing VH1's focus on music-related shows and events and pop culture-based reality programming.<ref>{{cite press|url=https://www.vh1press.com/press-releases/2014/12/30/vh1-reveals-new-brand-identity-across-linear-digital-and-social-platforms-on-the-heels-of-ratings-momentum-3|title=VH1 REVEALS NEW BRAND IDENTITY ACROSS LINEAR, DIGITAL AND SOCIAL PLATFORMS ON THE HEELS OF RATINGS MOMENTUM}}</ref> The network's main video block was ''VH1 + Music'', seen weekday mornings between 6{{nbsp}}a.m. and 9{{nbsp}}a.m. The new ''Nocturnal State'' block aired Mondays through Sundays between 3{{nbsp}}a.m. and 6{{nbsp}}a.m.

Since 2014, VH1 programming was noted to be shifting towards shows centered around African American personalities, similar to [[BET Networks|BET]] and its sister channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/vh1-and-black-viewers|title=Once You Go Black: VH1 and the Growing Power of Black TV Viewers|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]}}</ref> In the first quarter of 2016, VH1 announced its highest ratings in six years and it was then the fastest-growing subscription channel in that same period. Thanks to the success of shows like ''[[Love & Hip Hop]]'', ''[[Stevie J & Joseline Go Hollywood]]'', ''[[K. Michelle: My Life]]'', and ''[[Mob Wives]]'', the channel has moved ahead as a Top Five network for adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/254877/vh1-highest-ratings-in-6-years-leads-the-top-25-cable-networks-in-growth/|title=VH1 garners highest ratings in 6 years, leads the top 25 cable networks in growth}}</ref> Conversely, ''VH1 + Music'' was discontinued and replaced by reruns of 1990s–2000s sitcoms shared with ViacomCBS's other networks. Since then, the channel only carries music videos in continuity between shows.

Also in 2016, VH1 would revive the former [[The CW|CW]] reality competition series ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bellino|first=Damian|date=October 20, 2016|title=The reinvented America's Next Top Model cycle 23 will premiere on December 12th|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/287383/americas-next-top-model-cycle-23-premiere-december-12/|work=VH1|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url= http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/05/12/vh1-welcomes-back-ashley-graham-drew-elliott-and-law-roach-to-join-host-tyra-banks-for-the-new-cycle-of-americas-next-top-model-402210/20170512vh101/ | title=VH1 Welcomes Back Supermodel Ashley Graham, 'Paper' Magazine's Drew Elliott and Image Architect Law Roach to Join Host Tyra Banks for the New Cycle of 'America's Next Top Model'| publisher= VH1 | via= The FutonCritic.com|date=May 12, 2017|access-date= October 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/305717/tyra-banks-will-return-as-host-of-americas-next-top-model/|title=Tyra Banks Will Return as Host of America's Next Top Model|last=Bellino|first=Damian|publisher=VH1.
