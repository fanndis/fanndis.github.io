The '''2016 United States presidential election in Nevada''', held on November 8, 2016 was part of the [[2016 United States presidential election]], and was won by [[Hillary Clinton]] with a 47.92% popular vote [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] over [[Donald Trump]]'s 45.5%.<ref name=SilverStateElection/> All of [[Nevada]]'s 6 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] were assigned to Clinton. Trump became the first Republican since [[William Howard Taft]] in [[1908 United States presidential election in Nevada|1908]] to win the [[President of the United States|presidency]] without Nevada, and the first since [[William McKinley]] in [[1900 United States presidential election in Nevada|1900]] to do so without carrying [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]. This is also the first and most recent cycle since the [[1976 United States presidential election in Nevada|1976 election]] that the state has voted for the losing presidential candidate.

The '''2016 Nevada Democratic caucuses''' took place on February 20 in the U.S. state of [[Nevada]], traditionally marking the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s third nominating contest in their series of [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presidential primaries]] ahead of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].

With all other candidates having dropped out of the race ahead of the Nevada caucuses, the two remaining candidates were [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nvdems.com/caucus/candidates/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331200851/http://nvdems.com/caucus/candidates/ |archive-date=2016-03-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Process====
Of the total number of 43 delegates the Nevada Democratic Party may send to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], 35 are pledged and 8 are unpledged.

The delegate selection process is a system with three levels:
# The first step in the delegate selection process were the precinct caucuses on February 20, which elected about 12,000 delegates to the county conventions.
# At the county conventions on April 2, the county delegates selected about 4,000 delegates to the state convention.
# At the state convention on May 14–15, the final 35 pledged delegates to the National Convention will be selected. 23 of them are allocated proportionally based on congressional district results, whereas the remaining 12 are allocated based on the state convention as a whole.

A majority of participants at the February caucuses supported Hillary Clinton. However, the county conventions on April 2, 2016, resulted in more Sanders delegates than Clinton delegates being sent to the state convention in May.

====Debates and forums====

'''October 2015 debate in Las Vegas''' 
{{main article|First Democratic Party presidential debate, October 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada}}

On October 13, 2015, the Democratic Party's first debate was held at the [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]]. Hosted by [[Anderson Cooper]], it aired on [[CNN]] and was broadcast on radio by [[Westwood One]]. Participants were the candidates [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Jim Webb]], [[Martin O'Malley]], and [[Lincoln Chafee]]. It was the only debate appearance of Chafee and Webb, who ended their campaigns on October 23 and October 20, respectively.

'''February 2016 forum in Las Vegas''' 
{{See also|2016 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums}}
On February 18, MSNBC and Telemundo hosted a forum in Las Vegas.

====Caucus Results====
{{2016NVDem}}

====County Conventions====
The County Conventions were marked by bickering between Clinton and Sanders supporters, most notably in Clark County,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/bernie-vs-hillary-boils-over-nevada-clark-convention |title=Bernie vs. Hillary boils over in Nevada before Clark convention |publisher=Ralston Reports |access-date=2016-11-13}}</ref> which had been won by Clinton during the caucuses and led to the attempted arrest of the head of the credentials committee, Sanders supporter Christine Kramar, after the Clinton supporters on the Clark Country Democratic committee attempted to depose her from her position. Kramar had discovered that the Clark County Democratic Party had been having private correspondence with only Clinton's campaign, as opposed to both campaigns.

The results statewide goes as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ralstonreports.com/blog/sanders-likely-flips-two-delegates-after-dominating-clark-convention |title=Sanders likely flips two delegates after dominating Clark convention |publisher=Ralston Reports |access-date=2016-11-13}}</ref> 
Sanders  3846 (55.23%)
Clinton 2124  (44.77%)

Sanders won most of the northern counties in Nevada, including Washoe County, and Clinton won most of the southern counties, including Clark County.

====State Convention====
The state convention was held in May as the final stage of the delegate selection process. Supports of Senator Sanders were angered when Party officials declined to accept the credentials of close to 60 pro-Sanders delegates. Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman, Roberta Lange, allegedly received numerous death threats and threats to the lives of her family and grandchildren; a criminal investigation has yet to confirm these claims or the identities of those allegedly involved. At the convention, Sanders supporters protested until the staff cancelled the event.<ref name="RappeportNevada">{{cite news|last1=Rappeport|first1=Alen|title=Bernie Sanders Supporters Voice Ire at Nevada Democratic Party|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/us/politics/bernie-sanders-supporters-nevada.html |access-date=17 May 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="BenenUnrest"/> The event was later criticized as being violent, although there is no evidence that violence occurred.<ref>{{cite news|last1=LaCapria|first1=Kim|title=The Chair Thrown 'Round the World|url=http://www.snopes.com/did-sanders-supporters-throw-chairs-at-nevada-democratic-convention/ |access-date=23 May 2016|publisher=Snopes|date=19 May 2016}}</ref>

===Polling===
{{see also|Statewide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016#Nevada}}

Clinton won most polls in the summer by 1-2 points. From late September till October 20, Clinton won or tied in every poll. On October 20, Trump won a poll 47% to 44%.

===Analysis===
[[Hillary Clinton]] won the state over nationwide winner [[Donald Trump]], marking the third presidential election in a row that Nevada has voted Democratic. Most counties in the state of Nevada are rural, and voted heavily for Trump. As a whole, the rural counties outside of [[Las Vegas]] and [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] gave Donald Trump a 66-27 margin. However, Clinton won the state's two most populous counties, [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] and [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], which contain about 85% of the state's population, and thus won the state's electoral votes. Compared to [[2012 United States presidential election in Nevada|2012]], Clinton's margin of victory was narrower in these two counties and statewide.

This is the second time since 1908, and first time since 1976, that Nevada voted for a candidate who did not win the general election.
