}}The '''National Governors Association''' ('''NGA''') is an [[United States|American]] [[Politics of the United States|political organization]] founded in 1908. The association’s members are the governors of the 55 [[U.S. state|states]], [[Territories of the United States|territories]] and [[commonwealth]]s. Members come to the association from across the political spectrum, and NGA itself is nonpartisan.

[[File:Secretary Pompeo Delivers Remarks to the National Governors Association 2020 Winter Meeting (49506943613).jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] speaks at the NGA 2020 winter meeting]]
In 1907, the [[Inland Waterways Commission]] thought it necessary to ask the [[Conference of Governors]] to provide both state and national views relating to practical questions dealing with natural resources utilization and management in the [[Progressive Era]].<ref>[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/united-states-inland-waterways-commission/preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin/page-4-preliminary-report-of-the-inland-waterways-commission-message-from-the-presiden-tin.shtml Inland Waterways Commission Recommendations... Inquiries in Progress] Letter to the President, October 5, 1907: ..."3. We are of opinion that the conference may best be held in the national capital next winter, and that the conferees should comprise the governors of all our States and Territories, a limited number of delegates to be appointed by each governor, and representatives from leading organizations of both State and national scope engaged in dealing with natural resources or with practical questions relating thereto... In his Memphis address on October 4 the President announced the intention of calling such a conference, and on November 13 he issued invitations to the governors of the States and Territories to meet at the White House May 13–15, 1908;..."</ref> The NGA represents the [[Governor (United States)|governors]] of the fifty [[U.S. state]]s and five [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] ([[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]). It is funded primarily by state dues, federal grants and contracts, and private contributions.<ref>[http://www.nga.org/cms/home/about/faq/col2-content/main-content-list/f-how-are-nga-and-the-nga-center.html FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214204131/http://www.nga.org/cms/home/about/faq/col2-content/main-content-list/f-how-are-nga-and-the-nga-center.html |date=2013-12-14 }} National Governors Association website, "How is NGA funded?" Retrieved Dec 8, 2013.</ref>

The NGA serves as a [[public policy]] liaison between the [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] and at the [[White House]] when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting [[social network|networking]] [[seminar]]s for state [[executive (government)|executive branch]] officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and [[best practices]] on issues that range from [[education]] and [[public health|health]] to [[technology]], [[welfare reform]], and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. NGA also provides [[management]] and technical assistance to both new and [[incumbent]] governors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

NGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA [[Chairman|chair]] alternates yearly between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is usually of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year. The current NGA chair is [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], a Democrat. The vice chair is [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Asa Hutchinson]] of [[Arkansas]], a Republican.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Arkansas]]' [[Bill Clinton]] is, to date, the only former chair of the organization to become [[president of the United States]]. [[Janet Napolitano]] of [[Arizona]] became the first female chair in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In February 2020, [[Mike Pompeo]] warned the National Governors Association that the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) was actively attempting to influence U.S. policy through state governors and local officials.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Allen-Ebrahimian|first=Bethany|url=https://www.axios.com/china-rating-us-governors-bff6cc73-e485-44f2-98d0-b7639af3f0aa.html|title=How a Chinese think tank rates all 50 U.S. governors|date=February 19, 2020|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> In October 2020, the [[United States Department of State]] discontinued U.S. participation in the U.S.-China Governors Forum to Promote Sub-National Cooperation due to alleged attempts by the [[Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries]], a front organization for the CCP's [[United Front Work Department]], to "malignly influence state and local leaders" in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-28|title=U.S. designates Chinese body a foreign mission, quits local cooperation agreement|language=en|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-pompeo-idUSKBN27D305|access-date=2020-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=October 28, 2020|title=Designation of the National Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (NACPU) as a Foreign Mission of the PRC|url=https://www.state.gov/designation-of-the-national-association-for-chinas-peaceful-unification-nacpu-as-a-foreign-mission-of-the-prc/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=United States Department of State|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Chairs==
Formally adopted as policy in 1977, chairs preside for a one-year term and alternate party affiliation, so the same party never serves for two terms in a row.<ref name="GovsTime">{{cite web |url=http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |title=Historical Timeline |publisher=National Governors Association Centennial |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121004103801/http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |archive-date=2012-10-04 }}</ref>

The following states have never produced an NGA chairperson: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]] and [[South Dakota]]; nor have any of the five territories: [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].
