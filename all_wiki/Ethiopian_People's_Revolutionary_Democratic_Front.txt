The '''Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front''' ('''EPRDF'''; {{lang-am|የኢትዮጵያ ሕዝቦች አብዮታዊ ዲሞክራሲያዊ ግንባር}} ''ye’ītiyop’iya ḥizibochi ābiyotawī dīmokirasīyawī ginibari'') was an [[Ethnic federalism|ethnic federalist]]<ref name=":0" /> [[political coalition]] in [[Ethiopia]]. The EPRDF consisted of four political parties, namely [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF), [[Amhara Democratic Party]] (ADP), [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP) and [[Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (SEPDM).<ref name=":0"/> After leading the overthrow of the Communist [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]], it [[dominant-party state|dominated]] Ethiopian politics from 1991 to 2019.

In November 2019, the EPRDF dissolved, and Prime Minister and EPDRF chairman [[Abiy Ahmed]] merged most of the constituent parties of the coalition (except the TPLF) into a new party called the ''[[Prosperity Party]]''.<ref>[https://addisstandard.com/exclusive-third-day-eprdf-ec-discussing-prosperity-party-regulation-find-the-draft-copy-obtained-by-as/ Exclusive: Third day EPRDF EC discussing “Prosperity Party” Regulation.

== History ==
During the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], the EPRDF was a rebel group battling the [[Derg]], a military regime led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] that was effectively in power from 1974 until it was replaced by the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] in 1987. During this period, the Derg was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of opponents without trial in the [[Qey Shibir]] and the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia]] resulting in 400,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=de Waal|first=Alex|year=1997|title=Famine Crimes: Politics & the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa|location=[[Oxford]]|publisher=[[James Currey]]|isbn=0-85255-810-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IwZ1Xb-w45oC}}</ref>

The EPRDF was formed by the union of the TPLF and the [[Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (EPDM) in early-1989. They were later joined by the [[Oromo People's Democratic Organization|OPDO]] (the Oromo members of the TPLF, EPLF, and EPDM) and the Ethiopian Democratic Officers' Revolutionary Movement (a small body of Derg officers captured by TPLF, most notably at [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] in February 1989, which was later disbanded after the establishment of the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]]).<ref name=":0">Vaughan, Sarah (2003).

Following the [[Ethiopian Civil War#1990s|collapse]] of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] in the early 1990s, the EPRDF gained support from the [[United States]]. Michael Johns, an Africa expert with [[The Heritage Foundation]], wrote in 1991 that "there are some modestly encouraging signs that the front intends to abandon Mengistu's autocratic practices".<ref>Johns, Michael (August 1991). [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r102:E06MY2-393: "Does Democracy Have a Chance?"]. ''[[The World and I]]'', in: ''[[The Congressional Record]]'' (6 May 1992).</ref>

=== Leadership ===

* [[Hailemariam Desalegn]] (16 September 2012 – 27 March 2018)
* [[Abiy Ahmed|Abiy Ahmed Ali]] (27 March 2018 – 1 December 2019)

== Organization ==
The EPRDF was an alliance of four political parties: 
* [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP), which is based in the [[Oromia Region]] (formerly known as OPDO)
* [[Amhara Democratic Party]] (ADP) based in the [[Amhara Region]] (formerly known as ANDM)
* [[Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (SEPDM) based in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region]]
* [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF) based in the [[Tigray Region]]

The EPRDF was led by a Council as well as an Executive Committee, whose members were selected every three years by a congress of the party. The four member parties had the same organizational structure. Government and party structures were closely intertwined.<ref name=FES>[http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/03293.pdf ''Parteien in Äthiopien: Zwischen ethnischer Orientierung und Programmausrichtung''] (PDF). [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]].</ref>

The other five [[regions of Ethiopia]] were governed by parties which were either created or heavily influenced by the EPRDF.<ref name=HIST>{{cite journal|last1=Chanie|first1=Paulos|title=Clientelism and Ethiopia's post-1991 decentralisation|journal=[[The Journal of Modern African Studies]]|date=2007|volume=45|issue=3|pages=355–384|doi=10.1017/S0022278X07002662}}</ref> One of the earliest was the Afar People's Democratic Organization in the [[Afar Region]], which subsequently merged with other [[Afar people|Afar]] political groups to create the [[Afar National Democratic Party]] (ANDP).<ref>Yasin, Yasin Mohammed (2008).

'''42''' (1): p. 39–65.</ref> These were the five regional parties:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aalen|first1=Lovise|title=Ethnic Federalism and Self-Determination for Nationalities in a Semi-Authoritarian State: the Case of Ethiopia|journal=International Journal on Minority and Group Rights|date=2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=243–261|doi=10.1163/157181106777909849}}</ref>
* [[Afar National Democratic Party]] (ANDP) in [[Afar Region]]
* [[Argoba People's Democratic Organization]] (APDO) for the [[Argobba people]]
* [[Hareri National League]] (HNL) in [[Harari Region]]
* [[Gambela People's Democratic Movement]] (GPDM) in [[Gambela Region]]
* [[Ethiopian Somali People's Democratic Party]] (ESPDP) in [[Somali Region]]
* [[Benishangul-Gumuz People's Democratic Unity Front]] (BGPDUF) in [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region]]

=== Ideology ===
The EPRDF had not espoused a well-defined unified ideology or political philosophy. Its members held a variety of positions that could be broadly defined as being to the left of the opposition parties.<ref name=":0"/> The EPRDF traditionally identified itself with a number of general goals, namely rapid export-based economic growth; [[Ethiopia–United States relations|close cooperation]] with the [[United States]] in foreign and defense policies; [[China-Ethiopia relations|close cooperation]] with [[China]] on economic and trade policies: and several newer issues, such as administrative reform. Administrative reform encompassed several themes, namely simplification and streamlining of [[Government of Ethiopia|government bureaucracy]]; [[privatization]] of [[state-owned enterprise]]s; and adoption of measures, including [[tax reform]], in preparation for the expected strain on the [[Economy of Ethiopia|economy]] posed by a [[Demographics of Ethiopia#Population|rapidly growing population]].<ref name=":1">{{cite book|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/23333/Ethiopia0s0gre0n0and0how0to0pace0it.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Ethiopia's Great Run: The Growth Acceleration and How to Pace It|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2015}}</ref> Other priorities in the early 1990s included the promotion of a more active and positive role for Ethiopia following the [[Ethiopian Civil War#Conclusion|collapse]] of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]], the [[internationalization]] of Ethiopia's economy by the [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] and promotion of domestic demand (expected to lead to the [[industrialization]]) and the promotion of [[Education in Ethiopia|education]].<ref name=":1"/> A business-inspired commitment to [[free enterprise]] was tempered by the insistence of [[protectionism]] and [[tariff]]s.
