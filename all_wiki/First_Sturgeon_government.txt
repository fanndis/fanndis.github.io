[[Nicola Sturgeon]] formed the '''first Sturgeon government''' on 20 November 2014, following the resignation of previous [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], [[Alex Salmond]]. Sturgeon, who had been [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] under Salmond, was elected to succeed him by the SNP majority in the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 19 November 2014, before being officially sworn-in in front of senior judges at the [[Court of Session]] the next day.

==History==
Following the defeat of the [[Yes Scotland|campaign for Scottish independence]] in a [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 referendum]], then First Minister [[Alex Salmond]], who had arranged the referendum, announced that he would resign as Scottish National Party leader and first minister after a new leader was chosen.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resignation-nicola-sturgeon-destiny |title=Alex Salmond's resignation could give Nicola Sturgeon her day of destiny |first=Libby |last=Brooks |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 September 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon [[2014 Scottish National Party leadership election|took the leadership unopposed]] at the SNP's annual conference on 14 November 2014. This also effectively made her First Minister in waiting, given the SNP's outright majority in the Scottish Parliament. She was elected to succeed Salmond as First Minister by the Scottish Parliament on 19 November, and formally appointed by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on the next day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30011421 |title=The transition from Alex Salmond to Nicola Sturgeon |first=Glenn |last=Campbell |work=BBC News |date=13 November 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>

On 21 November 2014 Sturgeon's first cabinet was announced. It was formed of ten people: Sturgeon and nine cabinet secretaries. It was gender-balanced with five men and five women.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/21/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-cabinet-equal-gender-balance |title=Nicola Sturgeon announces Scottish cabinet with equal gender balance |first=Libby |last=Brooks |work=The Guardian|date=22 November 2014 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref> There were thirteen junior ministerial positions outwith the cabinet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-reshuffle-brings-gender-balance-1-3612166 |title=Nicola Sturgeon reshuffle brings gender balance |first1=David |last1=Maddox |first2=Tom |last2=Peterkin |work=The Scotsman |date=22 November 2014 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>
