In August 2017, [[Central Board of Excise and Customs|Indian customs]] alleged the Adani Group was diverting millions of funds from the company's books to Adani family tax havens overseas.

== Controversy over mining projects in Australia ==
=== Carmichael Coal Mine Project ===
{{main|Carmichael coal mine}}
The Adani Group launched in 2014, with the support of a part of the Australian Government and Queensland, a mining and rail project ([[Carmichael coal mine]]) in Carmichael in [[Queensland]]'s Galilee Basin for {{Euro}}21.5 billion<ref name=DescriptionAdani90ans>ADANI, [http://www.adaniaustralia.com.au/pdf_details.php?pid=63 "Description of the mine project" by the Adani, PDF, 110 pages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316183555/http://www.adaniaustralia.com.au/pdf_details.php?pid=63 |date=16 March 2015 }} (version projecting a 90-year exploitation)</ref> (over the life of the project, i.e. 60 years<ref name=DescriptionAdani90ans/>). This controversial mine,<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34535947 Australia approves controversial Carmichael coal mine], 15 October 2015</ref> if implemented, would be the largest coal mine in the world. Its annual capacity would be 60&nbsp;Mt of coal corresponding to the emission of 127&nbsp;Mt of CO<sub>2</sub>, the equivalent of the total emissions of [[Belgium]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}

This project is planned to occupy an area of {{convert|35,000|ha}} and would consume 297 million m<sup>3</sup> of water taken from the [[aquifer]]s of the region, which will have consequences for the environment and the local population. In view of the suggested environmental consequences of this project, most international banks refused to finance it,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/18/carmichael-mine-environmental-impact-unknown-for-years|title=Carmichael mine: environmental impact will be unknown for years|first=Oliver|last=Milman|date=17 November 2014|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> taking into account risks of [[flooding]] and/or [[Induced seismicity|induced earthquakes]] that may occur when working at such scale.{{cn|date=September 2020}} In 2018 several international banks declined approaches to finance the project, and the conclusions of the environmental report for the authorisation of the project are postponed until 2019, following promises of local job creation by the Adani group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/coordinator-general/assessments-and-approvals/coordinated-projects/completed-projects/carmichael-coal-mine-and-rail-project.html|title=Carmichael Coal Mine and Rail Project|website=statedevelopment.qld.gov.au}}</ref>

The Australian Government has been taken to the [[Federal Court of Australia]] by the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] twice, once in 2018 and once in March 2020 (still ongoing {{as of|lc=yes|September 2020}}), relating to its contravention and alleged contravention of the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' with respect to the impact of the mine on [[groundwater]] and the country's [[water resources]].<ref name=acf2020/>
=== Great Barrier Reef Project ===
In 2014, the Adani group also launched a project to dig a channel through the [[Great Barrier Reef]] of Australia to facilitate the export of coal with dredging of 38 million m<sup>3</sup> reef sand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2014/01/31/nouvelles-menaces-sur-la-grande-barriere-de-corail_4357603_3244.html|title=En Australie, la Grande Barrière de corail accueillera des déchets|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|date=31 January 2014|via=Le Monde}}</ref> This controversial project with dubious financing has aroused international opposition.{{cn|date=September 2020}}
