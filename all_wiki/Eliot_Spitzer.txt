'''Eliot Laurence Spitzer''' (born June 10, 1959) is an American politician, attorney, educator, and real estate developer. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he served as the 54th [[Governor of New York]].

After serving for six years as a prosecutor with the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Spitzer worked as an attorney in private practice with several New York law firms. He was then elected to two four-year terms as the [[New York State Attorney General|Attorney General of New York]], serving from 1999 to 2006; during this period, Spitzer became known as the "Sheriff of Wall Street" for his efforts to curb corruption in the financial services industry. Spitzer was elected Governor of New York in 2006 and served as the [[List of Governors of New York|54th Governor of New York]] from January 1, 2007 until his resignation on March 17, 2008 in the midst of [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal|a prostitution scandal]].<ref name="resignationCNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/12/spitzer/index.html |title=Spitzer to step down by Monday |access-date=March 12, 2008 |publisher=CNN | date=March 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>[https://www.npr.org] | March 12, 2008 | Spitzer Resigns After Sex Scandal, Pressure | [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88134976]</ref>

==Legal career==
Upon receiving his [[Juris Doctor]], Spitzer clerked for Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, then joined the law firm of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison]]. He stayed there for less than two years before leaving to join the New York County District Attorney's office.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Spitzer joined the staff of Manhattan District Attorney [[Robert Morgenthau]], where he became chief of the labor-racketeering unit and spent six years (1986–1992) pursuing [[organized crime]].<ref name="Atlas01">{{cite web|last1=Donway|first1=Roger|title=Eliot Spitzer: Ayatollah General|url=http://atlassociety.org/commentary/capitalism-and-morality/capitalism-morality-blog/3650-eliot-spitzer-ayatollah-general|website=The Atlas Society|access-date=October 7, 2016}}</ref> Spitzer's biggest case came in 1992, when he led the investigation that ended the [[Gambino crime family]]'s organized crime control of Manhattan's trucking and garment industries.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Spitzer devised a plan to set up his own sweatshop in the city's garment district, where he turned out shirts, pants and sweaters, and hired 30 laborers.

{{See also|Electoral history of Eliot Spitzer}}

====1994 campaign====
In February 1991 [[Robert Abrams]], a Democrat and the longstanding New York State Attorney General, announced his intention to run for the U.S. Senate seat for New York then occupied by incumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[Al D'Amato]].<ref name="Verhovek01">{{cite news|last1=Verhovek|first1=Sam Howe|title=Abrams to Run For U.S. Senate In 1992 Contest|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/02/nyregion/abrams-to-run-for-us-senate-in-1992-contest.html|access-date=October 7, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 1991}}</ref> When he announced his intention the Senate election was almost two years in the future. Abrams won the nomination in the Democratic primary but narrowly lost to D'Amato in the general election in November 1992. Ten months later, in September 1993, Abrams announced that he would resign his position as Attorney General as of December 31, 1993, although he still had one year remaining in his term. To fill this vacancy the New York State Legislature elected Assemblyman [[G. Oliver Koppell]] to serve out the remainder of the Attorney General's term during 1993.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Thirty-four-year-old Spitzer decided to run as a Democratic candidate in the 1994 election for Attorney General, as did Koppell, Brooklyn Family Court Judge [[Karen Burstein]], and Kings County DA [[Charles J. Hynes]]. At the time, Spitzer was a young and relatively unknown defense attorney representing white-collar criminals. When he announced his campaign Spitzer suggested that, if elected, he would use the state's antitrust laws to pursue corporate polluters.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF97CFAD23DF11&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM News Archives: The Buffalo News].

====1998 campaign====
Four years later, Spitzer again wanted to run for Attorney General and on May 6, 1998, he announced he would run for the office for a second time.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF9ADDE8887B16&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM News Archives: The Buffalo News].

Our Campaigns.</ref> In the general election Spitzer would face the incumbent, Dennis Vacco, a Republican.

In late October 1998, Spitzer conceded that his father had lent him most of the campaign money he raised. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', after "repeatedly contending that he alone paid his campaign bills this year and in 1994, [Spitzer] acknowledged [that] his father, a wealthy real estate developer, [played] an extensive role in helping to finance his campaigns."<ref name="nytimes1998">[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/28/nyregion/1998-campaign-money-spitzer-concedes-that-his-father-has-helped-pay-for.html THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE MONEY; Spitzer Concedes That His Father Has Helped to Pay for Campaigns – New York Times].

But any effort to challenge the propriety of that fee is way off base."<ref name="nytimes1998"/>

On October 28, ''The New York Times'' endorsed Spitzer, opining that both candidates were flawed but adding that "Vacco's performance and his key policy positions make him an even worse choice [than Spitzer]".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/opinion/eliot-spitzer-for-attorney-general.html Eliot Spitzer for Attorney General – New York Times]. ''The New York Times''. (October 29, 1998).</ref> In November, Spitzer went on to defeat Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco by a small margin of victory of 0.6%. Spitzer did not win a single county in [[Upstate New York]] and won a total of six counties statewide ([[Manhattan|New York]] (81%), [[Bronx]] (80%), [[Brooklyn|Kings]] (75%), [[Queens]] (67%), [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] (52%), and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] (48%)).<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=79411 NY Attorney General Race – Nov 03, 1998].

===Tenure overview===
{{Main|List of cases of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer}}
As Attorney General, Spitzer stepped up the profile of the office. Traditionally, state attorneys general have pursued [[consumer rights]] cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate [[white-collar crime]], securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Gross|author-link=Daniel Gross|title=Eliot Spitzer – How New York's attorney general became the most powerful man on Wall Street |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2108509/sidebar/2108525 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=October 21, 2004 |access-date=March 14, 2008}}</ref> The New York Attorney General's office has [[Wall Street]] (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the [[Martin Act]] of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to [[subpoena]] witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this [[statute]] to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Kroft |title=The Sheriff of Wall Street |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/23/60minutes/main555310.shtml |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=May 25, 2003 |access-date=November 4, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Raymond J. |last=Keating |title=Spitzer's 'federalist papers' are onerous |url=http://blog.nysrpa.org/?p=513 |work=[[Newsday]] |date=August 21, 2006 |access-date=November 4, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317040914/http://blog.nysrpa.org/?p=513 |archive-date=March 17, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. [[corporate scandal]]s that began with the collapse of [[Enron]] in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and [[United States Congress|Congress]] failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in [[public opinion]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

During his term in office, Spitzer also commissioned a 1999 study of the [[NYPD]]'s [[stop-and-frisk]] practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dianepublishing.net/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=0788187538|title= New York City Police Department's 'Stop & Frisk' Practices: A Report to the People of the State of New York from the Office of the Attorney General|publisher=Diane Publishing}}</ref>

In 2004, ''[[The Nation]]'' endorsed Spitzer as a possible Democratic candidate for vice president, stating that he was "the single most effective battler against [[corporate abuses]] in either political party".<ref>[http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?bid=1&pid=1295 Running for Running Mate].

==2006 gubernatorial campaign==
{{Main|2006 New York gubernatorial election}}
[[File:Spitzer-on-stage (292269882).jpg|thumb|Spitzer celebrating on election night]]
On December 8, 2004, Spitzer announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of New York. While long rumored, Spitzer's announcement was unusually early—nearly two years before the election. As a result of Spitzer's relative speed in bringing state Democrats to his side, he gained the respect of Democratic leaders nationwide. [[New Mexico]] Governor [[Bill Richardson]] dubbed Spitzer the "future of the Democratic Party" at a fund raiser held in June 2005 for Spitzer's gubernatorial campaign.<ref>{{cite news

In January 2006, Spitzer selected New York State Senate minority leader [[David Paterson]] as his choice for lieutenant governor and running mate. After announcing his candidacy, Spitzer was endorsed by numerous New Yorkers, including state Comptroller [[Alan Hevesi]] and two former New York City mayors, [[David Dinkins]] and [[Ed Koch]]. On May 30, 2006, Spitzer and Paterson won the endorsement of the New York State Democratic party.<ref>{{cite news

===Roadblocks to reform===
[[File:EliotSpitzerApril24.07.jpg|thumb|left|Spitzer speaking in April 2007]]
Spitzer's reform-based platform, and his pledge "to change the ethics of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]", hit an early roadblock when his ideas on how to fill vacancies in the executive department were defeated by the state legislature. According to the [[New York State Constitution]], it is the duty of the state legislature to fill executive vacancies. The governor was criticized as unreasonable for admonishing the legislature when it took constitutional actions. The appointment of state assemblyman [[Thomas DiNapoli]] to succeed the disgraced [[Alan Hevesi]] as [[New York State Comptroller]] was a serious blow to the new governor. Spitzer had backed an outside panel to draft a list of qualified candidates; the legislature resisted Spitzer's desires when these included no legislators.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cooper |title=Legislators Pick a Comptroller, Defying Spitzer. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/nyregion/08comptroller.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 8, 2007 |access-date=February 12, 2007 }}</ref> Some Assembly Democrats were alienated over the incident, and questioned Spitzer's refusal of extending [[patronage]] to party members seeking local{{Vague|date=January 2010}} political appointments<!-- Is this about state (as opposed to local, i.e., municipal, county, etc.) appts, calling for service near their homes or businesses? -->.{{Verify source|date=January 2010}} Spitzer's choice was New York City Finance Commissioner [[Martha Stark]], who was selected by a panel that consisted of former State Comptroller [[Edward Regan]], former State Comptroller [[Carl McCall]] and former New York City Comptroller [[Harrison J. Goldin]]. On February 7, 2007, when the Legislature voted, Stark was one of two names put into nomination, along with Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli of Long Island, Assembly Leader [[Sheldon Silver]]'s choice. The final vote was 150 for DiNapoli and 56 for Stark. Stark's main support came from Democrats in the Senate, along with Republicans in both chambers.{{Verify source|date=January 2010}}

Spitzer traveled to the home districts of Democratic assemblymen William B. Magnarelli and George S. Latimer (in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Westchester County]] respectively), and publicly criticized them for their votes on DiNapoli; he had plans to exert similar pressure on other of his party's legislators.<ref>Fenner, Austin and Mahoney, Joe. {{cite web |url=http://nydailynews.com/front/v-pfriendly/story/497049p-418915c.html |title=Bulldog Spitzer rips pol |access-date=June 1, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', February 12, 2007.

One of Spitzer's key campaign pledges was to reform the state budget process. While the state did pass a budget on schedule in 2007, the ultimate results fell short of what many reformers hoped Spitzer would achieve. The ''[[New York Post]]'' opined, "Spitzer promised reform, and delivered something completely different" and termed the budget itself "bitterly disappointing."<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/04032007/postopinion/editorials/eliots_education_editorials_.htm "ELIOT'S EDUCATION"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519124447/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04032007/postopinion/editorials/eliots_education_editorials_.htm |date=May 19, 2007 }}, ''[[New York Post]]'', April 3, 2007.

Spitzer's budget quickly turned into a deficit, as by the end of October it was projected the state would run a deficit exceeding $4 billion for the year. During Spitzer's first year the state payroll increased, aggravating the budget problem.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2007/12/10/daily37.html |title=State payroll jumps with Spitzer | date=December 13, 2007}}</ref> Despite increasing the public sector payroll, in late 2007 New York State started leading the nation in lost jobs.

Spitzer was criticized by members of the [[New York State Legislature]] for failing to compromise on issues during his first few months as governor. In one exchange, according to the ''New York Post'', Spitzer told New York State Assembly Minority Leader [[James Tedisco]]: "Listen, I'm a f---king <!-- hyphens included in source --> steamroller and I'll roll over you and anybody else".<ref>Dicker, Fredric.

In the wake of the [[Eliot Spitzer political surveillance controversy|political surveillance controversy]] involving Bruno, Spitzer was accused of pandering to special interest groups to solidify his base of support. "The governor who took office vowing to clean up Albany has lost so much public support that he is reduced to feathering the nest of the unions and other liberals," wrote Michael Goodwin of the ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]''.<ref>Goodwin, Michael, [http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_cornered_by_troopergate_spitzer_is_showi.html Cornered by Troopergate, Spitzer is showing his desperation], ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.</ref>

On October 22, 2007, the State Senate passed legislation that would have overturned Spitzer's plan to allow driver licenses to be obtained by undocumented immigrants.

===Resignation===
In the wake of the revelations and amid threats of impeachment, Spitzer announced on March 12, 2008, that he would resign his post as governor at noon on March 17, 2008. Spitzer said at a news conference in Manhattan:

{{quote|I cannot allow for my private failings to disrupt the people's work. Over the course of my public life, I have insisted—I believe correctly—that people take responsibility for their conduct.

==Post-resignation life and career==
In 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' summarized Spitzer's history as follows:<blockquote>Long before there was Barack Obama there was Spitzer. While Obama toiled unknown in Illinois, the Bronx-born Spitzer won himself a national reputation as the "Sheriff of Wall Street". He was New York's tough-talking attorney-general, who fought banking corruption, enforced environment law and won rights for low-paid workers. He used that fame to enter politics and in 2006 became governor of New York: a perfect springboard for the White House. Before America fell in love with its first black president, people wondered if it was willing to embrace its first Jewish one. Spitzer could have made history.<br/><br/>Instead he left office in disgrace three years ago amid a flood of tabloid headlines that recounted salacious details from his repeated use of a high-end escort service. Spitzer was dubbed the "Luv Guv" and forced into a political wilderness. Rarely in American politics was a fall from grace so spectacular, so complete and so clearly down to a self-inflicted human flaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/27/eliot-spitzer-wall-street-fallen-angel|title=Eliot Spitzer: Wall Street's fallen angel|first=Paul|last=Harris|date=February 27, 2011|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref></blockquote>

===Prostitution scandal developments===
On July 16, 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article that explained how Spitzer used campaign funds to pay for two [[Mayflower Hotel]] bookings, $411.06 apiece, where he was alleged to have met with prostitutes. While it remains unclear if Spitzer stayed in the hotel on the nights he booked, ''The Times'' has stated that Spitzer met with prostitutes in early 2008. Spitzer declined to comment on the issue.<ref name="New York Times2">{{cite news |title=Spitzer Charged Campaign for Hotel Bills, Raising Question About His Funds |first=Danny |last=Hakim |work=The New York Times |date=June 16, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/nyregion/16spitzer.html }}</ref>

In November 2008, prosecutors who were in charge of the case announced that Spitzer would not face criminal charges for his involvement in the sex ring. They cited that no evidence of misuse of public funds was found and therefore it would not serve the public interest to press charges against Spitzer. Spitzer offered an apology, saying, "I appreciate the impartiality and thoroughness of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office, and I acknowledge and accept responsibility for the conduct it disclosed."<ref name="times/no charges">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/nyregion/07spitzer.html |title=No Federal Prostitution Charges for Spitzer |last=Hakim|first=Danny|author2=William K.

=== Media appearances ===
Spitzer continued to make public appearances and engage in media commitments following his resignation. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a Spitzer opinion piece in November 2008 conveying his analysis of the [[financial crisis of 2008]] and suggested remedies. Spitzer concluded the piece by saying that he hoped the Obama Administration would make the right policy choices, "although mistakes I made in my private life now prevent me from participating in these issues as I have in the past."<ref name=WaPoOpEd>{{cite news |title=How to Ground the Street|first=Spitzer |last=Eliot|work=The Washington Post|date=November 16, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/13/AR2008111303634.html}}</ref>

He also made a number of television appearances in 2009 and 2010, including ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' and ''[[Campbell Brown (TV series)|Campbell Brown]]'' (CNN program), as well as appearing as a substitute anchor on [[MSNBC]]. On June 24, 2010, [[CNN]] announced that Spitzer would be joining the network to host a "round-table" discussion program alongside center-right commentator [[Kathleen Parker]]. ''Parker Spitzer'', compared by some media outlets to the defunct ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'', replaced ''[[Campbell Brown (TV series)|Campbell Brown]]'' in the 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] timeslot on weeknights starting in October.<ref name="spitzerparker1">{{Cite news | title = US: Former governor Eliot Spitzer joins CNN | work = The Spy Report | publisher = Media Spy | date = June 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/06/25/us-former-governor-eliot-spitzer-joins-cnn/ | access-date = June 25, 2010}}</ref> In February 2011, CNN announced that Parker was leaving the show, which was renamed ''[[In the Arena]]'' on February 28, 2011.

"Moving forward, their mission will be different," he said. He also stated: "For me, journalism has been more a matter of projecting a particular approach to covering policies, to covering issues.

On July 7, 2013, Spitzer announced he was running for [[New York City Comptroller]], and would start a petition the following day. 3,750 valid signatures from registered voters from his party were required by July 11 to register for the race but Spitzer was able to submit over 27,000 signatures to the city Board of Elections before the deadline.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spitzer Submits Signatures to Get on NYC Ballot|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/spitzer-submits-signatures-get-nyc-ballot|agency=Associated Press|access-date=July 12, 2013}}</ref> Spitzer commented that he was asking for forgiveness, and hopeful that voters could forgive him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Asking Forgiveness, Spitzer Will Run for City Comptroller |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/nyregion/spitzer-seeks-ballot-for-city-comptrollers-race.html|first1=Michael|last1=Barbaro|first2=David W.|last2=Chen|work=The New York Times|date=July 7, 2013|access-date=July 8, 2013}}</ref> Spitzer lost the primary on September 10, 2013, to [[Scott Stringer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Live Results: New York City Primary Elections|url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2013/nyc-primary-results?rr|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 10, 2013|first=Aaron|last=Bycoffe}}</ref>

=== Real estate career ===
Following his father's illness and death in 2014 and with politics behind him, Spitzer came to lead his family's real estate business, Spitzer Enterprises, despite having avoided the role for much of his life. Spitzer sold his company's apartments in [[The Corinthian (Manhattan)|The Corinthian]] and the [[Crown Building (Manhattan)|Crown Building]] for a large profit, which he used to fund a $700 million project of three waterfront buildings in South [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Bagli |first1=Charles V. |title=Spitzer Charges Into His Family's Real Estate Business |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 15, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/nyregion/spitzer-charging-into-his-familys-real-estate-business.html |issn=0362-4331 }}</ref>

===2016 extortion scandal===
In February 2016, Spitzer was investigated by the New York City Police Department after being accused of assault by Svetlana Travis-Zakharova, a woman from Russia, in an incident that supposedly occurred at the [[Plaza Hotel]] on February 13, 2016. The ''New York Daily News'' reported Spitzer had been accused of attacking the woman, who tried to kill herself by slitting her wrists after the incident.<ref>{{cite web|title = Ex-Gov.

Within a month, Travis—who left for Russia in February<ref name=ZakharovaArrestedAP>{{cite news|last1=Hays|first1=Tom|title=Woman charged in ex-NY governor extortion plot held on bail|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3d85b54d4e9f485fa5f4b29a67de2385/woman-accused-trying-extort-money-ex-gov-spitzer|access-date=October 12, 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=October 12, 2016}}</ref>—turned from an alleged victim into a suspect. On October 10, she was arrested upon landing at [[JFK International Airport]]. On October 12, Travis-Zakharova, 26,<ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_1/> faced state charges of grand larceny by extortion, while also being investigated for prostitution. Over two years, prosecutors claimed, she had collected around $50,000 from Spitzer in exchange for keeping "intimate details" of their relationship secret from his relatives.<ref name=ZakharovaArrestedAP/> The money was allegedly deposited into a bank in Russia.<ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_1>{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=James|title=Bail set at $1M for woman accused of extorting money from ex-NY Gov.

Also on October 12, Travis faced forgery and identity theft charges, from an unrelated incident, after purportedly signing a high-end apartment lease under a different name, costing the victim—a 67-year-old New Jersey man—$18,000. The bail was set at $1 million.<ref name=ZakharovaArrestedAP/><ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_1/><ref name=ZakharovaArrestedPIX11_2/>

Spitzer reportedly had a romantic relationship with [[Lis Smith]], a 31-year-old spokeswoman for then-New York City Mayor-elect [[Bill de Blasio]]. She had been Spitzer's spokeswoman during his 2013 run for comptroller.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/25/nyregion/spitzer-and-his-wife-say-their-marriage-is-over.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Spitzer and His Wife Say Their Marriage is over |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |date=December 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/nyregion/lis-smith-girl-bashed-out-of-a-job-in-mayors-office.html |work=The New York Times |title=A Tabloid Bashing, and a Lost Job With the Mayor |first=Ginia |last=Bellafante |date=January 17, 2014 |quote=Ms. Smith was prepared for the negative press attention she knew she would receive as Mr. Spitzer's girlfriend, she told me.
