'''Palo Alto''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|l|oʊ|_|ˈ|æ|l|t|oʊ}}) is a [[charter city]] located in the northwestern corner of [[Santa Clara County, California]], United States, in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Palo Alto means ''tall stick'' in Spanish; the city is named after a [[Sequoia sempervirens|coastal redwood tree]] called [[El Palo Alto]].

The city was established by [[Leland Stanford Sr.]] when he founded [[Stanford University]], following the death of his son, [[Leland Stanford Jr.]] Palo Alto includes portions of [[Stanford University]] and shares its borders with [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]], [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]], [[Stanford, California|Stanford]], [[Portola Valley, California|Portola Valley]], and [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]].

== History ==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the [[Ohlone]] lived on the San Francisco peninsula; in particular, the Puichon Ohlone lived in the Palo Alto area. The area of modern Palo Alto was first recorded by the [[Portola expedition|1769 party]] of [[Gaspar de Portolá]], a 63-man, 200-horse expedition from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. The group overshot Monterey in the fog and when they reached modern-day [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]], ascended [[Sweeney Ridge]] and saw the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Portolá descended from Sweeney Ridge southeast down [[San Andreas Creek]] to [[Laguna Creek (San Mateo County)|Laguna Creek]] (now [[Crystal Springs Reservoir]]), thence to the [[San Francisquito Creek]] watershed, ultimately camping from November 6–11, 1769, by a tall redwood later to be known as [[El Palo Alto]]. Thinking the bay was too wide to cross, the group retraced their journey to Monterey, and never became aware of the [[Golden Gate]] entrance to the Bay.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Palo Alto Park |publisher=City of Palo Alto |url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=107&TargetID=14 |access-date=January 5, 2015}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1777, Father [[Junipero Serra]] established the [[Mission Santa Clara de Asis]], whose northern boundary was San Francisquito Creek and whose lands included modern Palo Alto. The area was under the control of the viceroy of Mexico and ultimately under the control of Spain. On November 29, 1777, [[San Jose, California|Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe]] (now the city of San Jose a few miles to the south of what was to be Palo Alto) was established by order of the viceroy despite the displeasure of the local mission. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] ending in 1821 led to Mexico becoming an independent country, though San Jose did not recognize rule by the new Mexico until May 10, 1825.  Mexico proceeded to sell off or grant much of the mission land.<ref name="nps-santa-clara">{{cite web|title=Early History Essay – Santa Clara County, California – National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/santaclara/history.htm|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=July 1, 2017}}</ref>

During the [[Mexican–American War]], the United States seized Alta California in 1846; however, this was not legalized until the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed on July 4, 1848. Mexican citizens in the area could choose to become United States citizens and their land grants were to be recognized if they chose to do so (though many legal disputes arose over this).

The land grant, [[Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito]], of about {{convert|2230|acre|km2|adj=on}} on the lower reaches of San Francisquito Creek (i.e., parts of modern Menlo Park and northern Palo Alto) was given to Maria Antonia Mesa in 1841.  She and her husband Rafael Soto (who had died in 1839) had settled in 1835 near present-day Newell and Middlefield roads and sold supplies. In 1839, their daughter María Luisa Soto  (1817–1883)  married John Coppinger, who was to be, in 1841, the grantee of [[Rancho Cañada de Raymundo]] (in modern San Mateo county). Upon Coppinger's death in 1847, Maria inherited it and later married a visiting boat captain, John Greer. Greer owned a home on the site that is now Town & Country Village on Embarcadero and [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. Greer Avenue and Court are named for him.

To the south of the Sotos, the brothers Secundino and Teodoro Robles in 1849 bought [[Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito]] from José Peña, the 1841 grantee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb329004cp/?order=2|title=Plat of the Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito, finally confirmed to Teodoro and Secundino Robles : [Santa Clara Co., Calif.] / as located by the U.S. Surveyor General|date=August 23, 1863|work=cdlib.org}}</ref> The grant covered the area south of Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito to more or less present-day Mountain View. The grant was bounded on the south by Mariano Castro's [[Rancho Pastoria de las Borregas]] grant across San Antonio Road. This later became the Robles Rancho, which constitutes about 80% of Palo Alto and Stanford University today. In 1863, it was whittled down in the courts to {{convert|6981|acre|km2}}. Stories say the grand hacienda was built on the former meager adobe of José Peña near Ferne off San Antonio Road, midway between Middlefield and Alma Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/5views/5views5h87.htm|title=Spanishtown Site}}</ref> Their hacienda hosted fiestas and bull fights. It was ruined in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] and its lumber was used to build a large barn nearby, which was said to have lingered until the early 1950s. On April 10, 1853, {{convert|250|acre|km2}}, comprising the present-day Barron Park, [[Matadero Creek]] and Stanford Business Park, was sold for $2,000 to [[Elisha Oscar Crosby]], who called his new property Mayfield Farm. The name of Mayfield was later attached to the community that started nearby. On September 23, 1856, the Crosby land was transferred to [[Sarah Wallis]] to satisfy a debt he owed her.<ref name="barronhistory">{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Doug|title=Barron Park History |journal=Barron Park Association Newsletter |date=Summer 2003| url=http://www2.bpaonline.org/bp-news/2003-summer/index.html#history|access-date=July 22, 2017}}</ref> In 1880, Secundino Robles, father to twenty-nine children, still lived just south of Palo Alto, near the location of the present-day [[San Antonio Shopping Center]] in Mountain View.

Many of the Spanish names in the Palo Alto area represent the local heritage, descriptive terms, and former residents. Pena Court, Miranda Avenue, which was essentially [[Foothill Expressway]] , was the married name of Juana Briones and the name occurs in Courts and Avenues and other street names in Palo Alto and Mountain View in the quadrant where she owned vast areas between Stanford University, Grant Road in Mountain View and west of El Camino Real. Yerba Buena was to her credit. Rinconada was the major Mexican land grant name.

The township of '''Mayfield''' was formed in 1855, around the site of a [[stagecoach]] stop and saloon known as "Uncle Jim's Cabin" near the intersection of El Camino Real and today's California Avenue in what is now southern Palo Alto.<ref name=Mayfield>{{cite book |editor=Ward Winslow |year=1993 |title=Palo Alto: A Centennial History |location=Palo Alto, California |publisher=Palo Alto Historical Association |isbn=9780963809834 |chapter=Neighboring Mayfield |pages=23–43 }}</ref> In October 1863 the San Francisco to San Jose railroad had been built as far as Mayfield and service started between San Francisco and Mayfield (the station is now [[California Avenue station|California Avenue]]); train service all the way to San Jose started in January 1864.<ref>{{cite news|title=The San Jose Railroad|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18631018.2.3|access-date=August 8, 2017|work=Daily Alta California|date=October 18, 1863}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Early Milestones|url=http://www.caltrain.com/about/History/Early_Milestones.html|website=www.caltrain.com|access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> El Camino became Main Street; the northeast-southwest cross streets were named for [[American Civil War|Civil War]] heroes, with California Avenue originally being Lincoln Street. The town had its own newspaper by 1869 (the ''Mayfield Enterprise'', in English and Spanish), incorporated in 1903, and had breweries and a cannery.<ref name=Mayfield/>

In 1875, French financier Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon, better known as Peter Coutts, purchased land in Mayfield and four other parcels around three sides of today's [[College Terrace, Palo Alto, California|College Terrace]] – more than a thousand acres extending from today's [[Page Mill Road]] to Serra Street and from El Camino Real to the foothills. Coutts named his property Ayrshire Farm. His fanciful 50-foot-tall brick tower near Matadero Creek likely marked the south corner of his property. [[Leland Stanford]] started buying land in the area in 1876 for a horse farm, called the [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]]. Stanford bought Ayrshire Farm in 1882.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Brief Human and Natural History of Stanford's Dish Open Space |first=Christy|last=Holloway |journal=Sandstone and Tile |pages=15–20 |date=Spring–Summer 2011 |url=http://histsoc.stanford.edu/STbackfiles.shtml |access-date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref> In 1891 he and his wife, [[Jane Stanford|Jane]], founded Stanford University, dedicated to their son [[Leland Stanford Jr.]], who had died of [[typhoid fever]] at age 15 in 1884. In 1886, he proposed founding it in Mayfield. However, he had one condition: alcohol had to be banned from the town. Known for its 13 rowdy saloons, Mayfield rejected his request. This led him to drive the formation of a new [[Temperance Towns|temperance town]] with the help of his friend [[Timothy Hopkins]] of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], who in 1887 bought {{convert|740|acre|km2|1}} of private land for the new townsite. This Hopkins Tract, bounded by El Camino Real, San Francisquito Creek, Boyce, Channing, Melville, and Hopkins Avenues, and Embarcadero Road,<ref>{{cite web|title=Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan, page L-3|url= http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/knowzone/city_projects/land_use/comprehensive_plan.asp| access-date=2011-02-03}}</ref> was proclaimed a local Heritage District during Palo Alto's centennial in 1994. Stanford set up his university, [[Stanford University]], and a [[Palo Alto station|train stop]] (on University Avenue) by his new town.  This new community was initially called University Park (the name "Palo Alto" at that time was attached to what is now College Terrace), but was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1894 with the name Palo Alto. With Stanford's support, Palo Alto grew to the size of Mayfield. After long-running strife in Mayfield and a Mayfield ordinance banning saloons that took effect in January 1905, on July 2, 1925, Palo Alto voters approved the annexation of Mayfield and the two communities were officially consolidated on July 6, 1925.<ref name=Mayfield/> As a result Palo Alto has two downtown areas: one along University Avenue and one along California Avenue.

The ''Mayfield News'' wrote its own obituary four days later:
{{quote|It is with a feeling of deep regret that we see on our streets today those who would sell, or give, our beautiful little city to an outside community. We have watched Mayfield grow from a small hamlet, when Palo Alto was nothing more than a hayfield, to her present size … and it is with a feeling of sorrow that we contemplate the fact that there are those who would sell or give the city away.<ref>{{cite news |last=Diamond |first=Diana |date=2015-01-06 |title=Laying it on thick during change of the guard in Palo Alto

Palo Alto continued to annex more land, including the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] area in 1953.  [[Stanford Research Park]],
Embarcadero Road northeast of Bayshore, and the West Bayshore/San Antonio Road area were also annexed during the 1950s. Large amounts of land west of Foothill Expressway were annexed between 1959 and 1968; this is mostly undeveloped and includes [[Foothills Park, Palo Alto|Foothills Park]] and [[Arastradero Preserve]].  The last major annexations were of Barron Park in 1975 and, in 1979, a large area of marshlands bordering the bay.<ref>{{cite book|title=Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan|pages=50|chapter-url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/8170|access-date=July 1, 2017|chapter=Land Use and Community Design}}</ref>

Many of Stanford University's first faculty members settled in the [[Professorville]] neighborhood of Palo Alto. Professorville, now a registered national historic district, is bounded by Kingsley, Lincoln, and Addison Avenues and the cross streets of Ramona, Bryant, and Waverley. The district includes a large number of well-preserved residences dating from the 1890s, including 833 Kingsley, 345 Lincoln, and 450 Kingsley. 1044 Bryant was the home of [[Russell Varian]], co-inventor of the [[Klystron tube]]. The [[Federal Telegraph Company|Federal Telegraph]] laboratory site, situated at 218 Channing, is a [[California Historical Landmark]] recognizing [[Lee de Forest]]'s 1911 invention of the [[vacuum tube]] and [[electronic oscillator]] at that location.  While not open to the public, the [[HP garage|garage that housed the launch of Hewlett Packard]] is located at 367 Addison Avenue. Hewlett Packard recently restored the house and garage. A second historic district on [[Ramona Street Architectural District|Ramona Street]] can be found downtown between University and Hamilton Avenues. The [[Palo Alto Chinese School]] is the oldest in the entire Bay Area. It is also home to the second oldest opera company in California, the [[West Bay Opera]].

Palo Alto, California is also home to a long-standing baseball tradition: The Palo Alto Oaks. The Palo Alto Oaks are a collegiate, summer baseball club that has been in the Bay Area since 1950, 8 years longer than the San Francisco Giants. The Oaks were originally managed by Tony Makjavich for 49 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2010/08/01/palo-alto-oaks-headed-to-the-world-series|title=Palo Alto Oaks headed to the World Series|access-date=February 16, 2017|language=en}}</ref> The Oaks were going to fold before the summer 2016 season but were taken on by [[Daniel Palladino]] and Whaylan Price, Bay Area baseball coaches, who did not want to see the team die.

==Geography==
Palo Alto is in the south-eastern section of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]].

It consists of two large parcels of land connected by a narrow corridor. The southern inland section, located south of [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]], is hilly, rural, and lightly populated and is the site of [[Arastradero Preserve|Pearson-Arastradero Preserve]] and Foothills Park both part of the Palo Alto park system and also large parts of the [[Los Trancos Open Space Preserve|Los Trancos]] and [[Monte Bello Open Space Preserve|Monte Bello]] Open Space Preserves part of the [[Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District]]. The city extends as far as [[California State Route 35|Skyline Boulevard]] along the ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].

The northern more densely populated parcel is bordered by [[San Francisquito Creek]] (with [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] and [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]] in adjacent [[San Mateo County]] beyond) to the north, San Francisco Bay to the north-east, [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], and [[Los Altos Hills, California|Los Altos Hills]] to the east and south-east and Stanford University to the south-west and west.  Several major transit routes cross this parcel from the north-west to the south-east.  The biggest and closest to the bay is the [[Bayshore Freeway]] and going inland are 
[[California County Routes in zone G#G6|Alma Street/Central Expressway]], [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]], and 
[[California County Routes in zone G#G5|Foothill Expressway]].  Interstate 280 is parallel and crosses the narrow corridor of land that connects the two parcels that makeup Palo Alto.  Somewhat perpendicular to these roads are [[Sand Hill Road]] from El Camino until it crosses San Francisquito Creek into Menlo Park,  Embarcadero Road, [[California County Routes in zone G#G3|Oregon Expressway/Page Mill Road]], Arastradero Road/East Charleston Road, and San Antonio Road (the last forms part of the boundary with Mountain View).

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.8|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|23.9|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|1.9|sqmi|km2}} (or 7.38%) is water.

The official elevation is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|abbr=}} above sea level,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:0::NO::P3_FID:277572|title=GNIS Detail – Palo Alto|website=geonames.usgs.gov|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> but the city boundaries reach well into the peninsula hills.

===Water===
Palo Alto is crossed by several creeks that flow north in the direction of the San Francisco Bay, [[Adobe Creek (near Los Altos, California)|Adobe Creek]] near its eastern boundary, [[San Francisquito Creek]] on its western boundary, and [[Matadero Creek]] in between the other two. [[Arastradero Creek]] is a tributary to Matadero Creek, and [[Barron Creek]] is now diverted to [[Adobe Creek (near Los Altos, California)|Adobe Creek]] just south of Highway 101 by a diversion channel. The San Francisquito Creek mainstem is formed by the confluence of [[Corte Madera Creek (San Mateo County, California)|Corte Madera Creek]] and [[Bear Creek (San Francisquito Creek)|Bear Creek]] not far below [[Searsville Dam]]. Further downstream, [[Los Trancos Creek]]  is a tributary to San Francisquito Creek below Interstate 280.

===Environmental features===
Palo Alto has a number of significant natural habitats, including [[estuarine]], [[riparian]], and [[oak]] forest.  Many of these habitats are visible in [[Foothills Park, Palo Alto|Foothills Park]], which is owned by the city. The [[Charleston Slough]] contains a rich marsh and littoral zone, providing feeding areas for a variety of [[shorebird]]s and other estuarine wildlife.<ref>Jenks, 1976</ref>

===Climate===
Typical of the San Francisco Bay Area, Palo Alto has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Typically, in the warmer months, as the sun goes down, the fog bank flows over the foothills to the west and covers the night sky, thus creating a blanket that helps trap the summer warmth absorbed during the day.  Even so, it is rare for the overnight low temperature to exceed {{convert|60|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

In January, average temperatures range from {{convert|38.5|°F|°C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|57.4|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.  In July, average temperatures range from {{convert|54.9|°F|°C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|78.4|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.  The record high temperature was {{convert|107|°F|°C|abbr=on}} on June 15, 1961, and the record low temperature was {{convert|15|°F|°C|abbr=on}} on November 17, 2003.  Temperatures reach {{convert|90|°F|0|abbr=on}} or higher on an average of 9.9 days.  Temperatures drop to {{convert|32|°F|0|abbr=on}} or lower on an average of 16.1 days.

Due to the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] to the west, there is a "[[rain shadow]]" in Palo Alto, resulting in an average annual rainfall of only {{convert|15.32|in|mm}}.  Measurable rainfall occurs on an average of 57 days annually.  The wettest year on record was 1983 with {{convert|32.51|in|mm}} and the driest year was 1976 with {{convert|7.34|in|mm}}.  The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|12.43|in|mm}} in February 1998 and the most rainfall in one day was {{convert|3.75|in|mm}} on February 3, 1998.  Measurable snowfall is very rare in downtown Palo Alto, but {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} fell on January 21, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/summary/Climsmcca.html|title=Central California|work=dri.edu}}</ref> It is  more common in the higher but rural sections of the town.<ref name="snow">{{cite news |title=Snow-capped Palo Alto |url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2008/12/16/snow-capped-palo-alto |access-date=19 June 2018 |work=Palo Alto Online |date=15 December 2008 |language=en}}</ref>

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Palo Alto has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Csb)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=646640&cityname=Palo+Alto,+California,+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Palo Alto, California Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref>

==Local government==
Palo Alto was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1894. In 1909 a [[municipal charter]] created a local government consisting of a fifteen-member City Council, with responsibilities for various governmental functions delegated to appointed committees.  In 1950, the City adopted a [[Council–manager government]].  Several appointed committees continue to advise the City Council on specialized issues, such as land-use planning, utilities, and libraries, but these committees no longer have direct authority over City staff. Currently, the City Council has only seven members.

The mayor and vice-mayor serve one year at a time, with terms ending in January. General municipal elections are held in November of even-numbered years. Council terms are four years long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/cou/default.asp|title=City Council & Mayor|publisher=City of Palo Alto|access-date=March 13, 2015}}</ref>

==Housing==
Palo Alto, north of [[Santa Clara County Route G3|Oregon Expressway]], is filled with older homes, including [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]] and California Colonials, some of which date back to the 1890s but most of which were built in the first four decades of the 20th century.  South of Oregon Expressway, the homes, including many [[Joseph Eichler]]-designed or Eichler-style houses, were primarily built in the first 20 years after World War II.

While the city contains homes that now cost anywhere from $800,000 to well over $40 million, much of Palo Alto's housing stock is in the style of California mid-century middle-class suburbia. The median home sale price for all of Palo Alto was more than $1.2 million in 2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.corelogic.com/solutions/configurable-real-estate-data-reports.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715150718/https://www.dqnews.com/charts/monthly-charts/ca-city-charts/zipcar.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Configurable Real Estate Data Reports – CoreLogic|archive-date=July 15, 2008|website=www.corelogic.com}}</ref> and $1.4 million in July 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.corelogic.com/solutions/configurable-real-estate-data-reports.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724021906/https://www.dqnews.com/charts/monthly-charts/ca-city-charts/zipcar.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Configurable Real Estate Data Reports – CoreLogic|archive-date=July 24, 2010|website=www.corelogic.com}}</ref> Palo Alto ranked in as the 5th most expensive city in the United States {{As of|2007|lc=y}}, with an average home sales price of $1,677,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070926005351&newsLang=en|access-date=August 20, 2009|title=2007 Coldwell Banker Home Price Comparison Index Reveals That $2.1 Million Separates Beverly Hills from Killeen, Texas|date=2007-09-26}}</ref> In 2010, Palo Alto ranked as the 2nd most expensive city in the United States, with a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home listing for $1.48 million on average.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/ontheblock/2010/09/28/top-10-most-expensive-real-estate-markets-in-the-us-bay-area-on-the-list-again-and-again/|access-date=December 27, 2011|title=Top 10 most expensive real estate markets in the US | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> A primary driver of housing market values in Palo Alto is the political climate that is restricting new development in a city with a large jobs-to-housing imbalance and some of the most attractive jobs in the country.

==History of Housing==
{{Very long section|date=December 2020}}Palo Alto’s successful, expensive housing market does not exist by accident. It is a product of the benefits that wealthy, white cities and neighborhoods received from segregationist practices and policies that existed throughout the 20th century. Restrictive covenants  were used that banned “persons of African, Japanese, Chinese, or Mongolian descent” from purchasing homes in certain neighborhood. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Kenrick |first1=Chris |title=Not all neighborhoods were created equal in Palo Alto |url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/07/03/not-all-neighborhoods-were-created-equal-in-palo-alto |website=www.paloaltoonline.com |language=en}}</ref> Blockbusting strategies were also employed to instill fear in white neighborhoods and cause white flight out of areas on the outskirts of the city.Blockbusting refers to a practice realtors adopted in which they would advertise the incoming presence of a black family to a neighborhood, causing panic among the white residents who would consequently sell their houses at deflated prices very quickly.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gaspaire |first1=Brent |title=Blockbusting • |url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/blockbusting/ |date=7 January 2013}}</ref> One famous blockbusting event is responsible for the prevailing demographic divides between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

One of the most destructive policies at the time was redlining. Redlining was a policy put in place by the Federal Housing Association starting in 1937. Through the program, the association could rank neighborhoods from Type A, which was desirable, to Type D (outlined in red) which was deemed hazardous. Residents in Type D neighborhoods were ineligible for loans to buy or fix houses. The program was implemented in a completely racist way, so that neighborhoods with any kind of African American population were ranked type C or D.<ref>{{cite web|title=Palo Alto History|url=http://www.paloaltohistory.org/discrimination-in-palo-alto.php|website=www.paloaltohistory.org}}</ref> This was also the case in Palo Alto and the surrounding areas. Palo Alto’s white neighborhoods were ranked mostly Type A and B, allowing for wealth accumulation and eventually resulting in the high housing prices we see today. On the other hand, the surrounding areas were all marked Type C and D, and African Americans found themselves being driven to the outskirts of Palo Alto, what is now mostly East Palo Alto, where there was no money from loans in the economy, leading to a state of decay.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} 

Within Palo Alto, there were some movements that opposed the exclusionary policies such as the Palo Alto Fair Play Association which had some limited successes in open housing policy in the 1950s. In addition, the architect and developer Joseph Eichler, who designed many houses through Palo Alto proclaimed that he preferred to sell houses to minorities and refused to adhere to the guidelines of the real estate associations that only sold to white families.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kenrick|first1=Chris|title=Not all neighborhoods were created equal in Palo Alto|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/07/03/not-all-neighborhoods-were-created-equal-in-palo-alto|website=www.paloaltoonline.com|language=en}}</ref> However, for the most part, Palo Alto’s housing was built on segregationist policies that are still reflected in the current demographics.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

==Economy==
Palo Alto serves as a central economic focal point of the [[Silicon Valley]], and is home to more than 7,000 businesses employing more than 98,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/business/news/details.asp?NewsID=592&TargetID=9|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804055656/http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/business/news/details.asp?NewsID=592&TargetID=9|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-08-04|title=Page Not Found – City of Palo Alto|work=cityofpaloalto.org}}</ref> Many prominent technology firms reside in the [[Stanford Research Park]] on Page Mill Road, while nearby Sand Hill Road in the adjacent city of [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] is a notable hub of [[venture capitalists]].

==Utilities==
Palo Alto has a city-run and owned utility, City of Palo Alto Utilities (CPAU), which provides water, electric, gas service, and waste water disposal within city limits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/utl/default.asp|title=Utilities – City of Palo Alto|work=cityofpaloalto.org}}</ref> with the minor exception of a rural portion of the city in the hills west of Interstate 280, past the Country Club, which does not receive gas from the City. Almost all other communities in northern California depend on [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&E) for gas and electricity.

Water and Gas Services (WGS) operates gas and water distribution networks within the city limits.  The city operates both gas meters and the distribution pipelines. Water comes from city-operated watershed and wells and the City and County of San Francisco [[Hetch Hetchy]] system. The city is located in Santa Clara Valley Water District, North Zone. Hetch Hetchy pipeline #3 and #4 pass through the city.

The city operates its own electric power distribution network and telemetry cable network. Interconnection points tie the city into PG&E's electric transmission system, which brings power from several sources to the city. A claim to fame is the city's exemption from rolling blackouts during the summer 2000 power shortages. Palo Alto is a member of a joint powers authority (the [[Northern California Power Agency]]), which cooperatively generates electricity for government power providers such as the City of Santa Clara, the City of Redding, and the Port of Oakland. Roughly the same group of entities operate the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC). TANC transports power over its own lines from as far as British Columbia through an interconnection with the federal Bonneville Power Administration. A local oddity is a series of joint poles; those primary conductor cross arms are marked PGE and CPA (City of Palo Alto) to identify each utility's side of the shared cross arms.

Palo Alto has an ongoing community debate about the city providing [[fiber optic]] connectivity to all residences. A series of pilot programs have been proposed. One proposal called for the city to install [[dark fiber]], which would be made live by a contractor.

Services traditionally attributed to a cable television provider were sold to a regulated commercial concern. Previously the cable system was operated by a cooperative called Palo Alto Cable Coop.

The former [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] in Palo Alto was Pacific Telephone, now called [[AT&T Inc.]], and previously called SBC and Pacific Bell. One of the earliest [[telephone exchange|central office]] facilities switching Palo Alto calls is the historic Davenport central office (CO) at 529 Bryant Street. The building was sold and is now the home of the [[Palo Alto Internet Exchange]]. The former CO building is marked by a bronze plaque and is located on the north side of Bryant Street between University Avenue and Hamilton Avenue. It was called Davenport after the exchange name at the introduction of dial telephone service in Palo Alto. For example, modern numbers starting with 325- were Davenport 5 in the 1950s and '60s. The Step-by-Step office was scrapped and replaced by stored-program-controlled equipment at a different location about 1980. Stanford calls ran on a Step-by-Step Western Electric 701 PBX until the university purchased its own switch about 1980. It had the older, traditional Bell System 600&nbsp;Hz+120&nbsp;Hz dial tone. The old 497-number PBX, MDF, and battery string were housed in a steel building at 333 Bonair Siding. From the 1950s to 1980s, the bulk of Palo Alto calls were switched on [[Number Five Crossbar Switching System|Number 5 Crossbar systems]]. By the mid-1980s, these electromechanical systems had been junked. Under the Bell System's regulated monopoly, local coin telephone calls were ten cents until the early 1980s.

During the drought of the early 1990s, Palo Alto employed water waste patrol officers to enforce water saving regulations. The team, called "Gush Busters", patrolled city streets looking for broken water pipes and poorly managed irrigation systems. Regulations were set to stop restaurants from habitually serving water, runoff from irrigation, and irrigation during the day. The main goal of the team was to educate the public in ways to save water. Citations consisted of Friendly Reminder postcards and more formal notices. To help promote the conservation message, the team only used bicycles and mopeds.

==Fire and police departments==
[[File:Palo_Alto_California_public_building.jpg|thumb|Palo Alto's city hall]]
The city was among the first in Santa Clara County to offer advanced life support (ALS) paramedic-level (EMT-P) ambulance service. In an arrangement predating countywide paramedic service, Palo Alto Fire operates two paramedic ambulances which are theoretically shared with county EMS assets. The Palo Alto Fire Department is currently the only [[fire department]] in Santa Clara County that routinely transports patients. Rural Metro holds the Santa Clara County 911 contract and provides [[transportation]] in other cities. Enhanced 9-1-1 arrived in about 1980 and included the then-new ability to report emergencies from coin telephones without using a coin.  Palo Alto Fire also has a contract with Stanford University to cover most of the campus.<ref name="stanford-fire">{{cite news |last1=Frazier |first1=Greg |title=Palo Alto cuts 11 firefighter jobs after Stanford reduces contract |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/19/palo-alto-cuts-11-firefighter-jobs-after-stanford-reduces-contract/ |access-date=19 June 2018 |work=The Mercury News |date=19 October 2017}}</ref>  In all, the Fire Department has six regular stations plus one opened only during the summer fire season in the [[foothills]].<ref name="firestations">{{cite web |title=City of Palo Alto, CA – Fire Stations |url=https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/fir/overview/fire_stations.asp |website=www.cityofpaloalto.org |access-date=19 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

The ''[[Palo Alto Daily Post]]'' publishes six days a week. ''[[Palo Alto Daily News]]'', a unit of the [[San Jose Mercury News]], publishes five days a week.'' [[Palo Alto Weekly]]'' is published on Fridays. ''Palo Alto Times'', a daily newspaper, served Palo Alto and neighboring cities beginning in 1894.  In 1979, it became the ''Peninsula Times Tribune''.  The newspaper ceased publication in 1993.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DC1738F936A25750C0A965958260 THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Paper Closes In California], The New York Times, March 15, 1993.</ref>

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Palo Alto is served by two major [[freeway]]s, [[U.S. Route 101 in California|Highway 101]] and [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]], and is traversed by the Peninsula's main north-south boulevard, [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] ([[California State Route 82|SR 82]]). The city is also served indirectly by [[California State Route 84|State Route 84]] which traverses the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]] to the north and [[California State Route 85|State Route 85]] via [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] to the south.

There are no parking meters in Palo Alto, and all municipal parking lots and multi-level parking structures are free but limited to two or three hours per weekday 8am–5pm.<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Palo Alto, CA – Parking|url=https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/pln/transit/parking/default.asp|website=www.cityofpaloalto.org|access-date=23 April 2018|language=en}}</ref> Downtown Palo Alto has recently added many new lots to fill the overflow of vehicles.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sheyner|first1=Gennady|title=Commission pans parking meter plan|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2017/10/12/planning-commission-pans-parking-meter-plan|access-date=23 April 2018|work=Palo Alto Weekly|date=12 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Air===
Palo Alto is served by [[Palo Alto Airport of Santa Clara County]] (KPAO), one of the busiest single-runway [[general aviation]] airports in the country. It is used by many daily commuters who fly (usually in private single-engine aircraft) from their homes in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] to work in the Palo Alto area. The nearest commercial airport is [[San Jose International Airport]] (SJC), about {{convert|15|mi|0|abbr=out}} southeast. Nearby is [[San Francisco International Airport]] (SFO), about {{convert|21|mi|0|abbr=out}} north.

===Rail===
[[File:California_Avenue_station_building,_November_2008.jpg|thumb|California Avenue Station]]
Train service is available via [[Caltrain]] with service between San Francisco and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], extending to [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]].  Caltrain has two regular stations in Palo Alto, the main one at  the [[Palo Alto Station]] in downtown Palo Alto (local, limited, and express). The main Palo Alto station is the second busiest (behind 4th and King in San Francisco) on the entire Caltrain line. The other station is located at [[California Avenue (Caltrain station)|California Avenue]], (local and limited).<ref>{{cite web|title=Caltrain This station was the primary station for Mayfield before they were annexed. Timetable|url=http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html|website=www.caltrain.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011916/http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html|url-status=live|archive-date=September 3, 2014}}</ref>  A third, the [[Stanford (Caltrain station)|Stanford]] station, located beside Alma Street at Embarcadero Road, is used for occasional sports events (generally [[College football|football]]) at [[Stanford Stadium]].

===Bus===
The Palo Alto Transit Center adjacent to the Palo Alto Train Station is the major bus hub for northern Santa Clara county.  The [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA) provides primary bus service through Palo Alto with service to the south bay and Silicon Valley.  [[San Mateo County Transit District]] ([[SamTrans]]) provides service to [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] to the north but some lines include the Palo Alto Transit Center.  The [[Marguerite (free shuttle)|Stanford University Free Shuttle (Marguerite)]] provides a supplementary bus service between Stanford University and the Palo Alto Transit Center, and the Palo Alto Free Shuttle (Crosstown and Embarcadero), which circulates frequently, and provides service to major points in Palo Alto, including the main library, downtown, the Municipal Golf Course, the Palo Alto Transit Center, and both high schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/depts/pln/news/details.asp?NewsID=212&TargetID=87|title=Page Not Found – City of Palo Alto|work=cityofpaloalto.org|access-date=July 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505015117/http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/depts/pln/news/details.asp?NewsID=212&TargetID=87|archive-date=May 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Cycling===
[[File:Caltrain_bikes_palo_alto.jpg|thumb|Commuters at Palo Alto Station boarding [[Caltrain]]]]
Cycling is a popular mode of transportation in Palo Alto. 9.5% of residents bicycle to work,<ref name="US Census 2010-2012">[https://www.census.gov/acs/www/ "American Community Survey 2010 – 2012, Table S0801, ''Commuting Characteristics By Sex''"], U.S. Census Bureau.</ref> the highest percentage of any city in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], and third-highest in the United States, after [[Davis, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Since 2003, Palo Alto has received a Bicycle Friendly Community status of "Gold" from the [[League of American Bicyclists]].

The city's flat terrain and many quiet tree-shaded residential streets offer comfort and safety to cyclists, and the temperate climate makes year-round cycling convenient. Palo Alto pioneered the [[bicycle boulevard]] concept in the early 1980s, enhancing residential Bryant Street to prioritize it for cyclists by removing stop signs, providing special traffic signals, and installing traffic diverters, and a bicycle/pedestrian bridge over Matadero Creek. However, busy arterial streets which often offer the fastest and most direct route to many destinations, are dangerous for cyclists due to high volumes of fast-moving traffic and the lack of bicycle lanes. El Camino Real, Alma Street, and Embarcadero and Middlefield roads, all identified as "high priorities" for adding bicycle lanes to improve safety by the [[2003 Palo Alto Bicycle Transportation Plan]], still contain no provisions for cyclists.

The Palo Alto Police Department decided to stop using [[tasers]] to detain bicyclists after a 2012 incident in which a 16-year-old boy, who had bicycled through a stop sign, was injured after police officers pursued him, fired a taser at him and suddenly braked their patrol car in front of him, causing the boy to crash.<ref>{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jason|title=Palo Alto: Police no longer using Tasers to stop fleeing cyclists|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/peninsula/ci_24875516/palo-alto-police-no-longer-using-tasers-stop|access-date=January 11, 2014|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

===Walking===
Conditions for walking are excellent in Palo Alto except for crossing high-volume arterial streets such as El Camino Real and Oregon Expressway. Sidewalks are available on nearly every city street, with the notable exception of the Barron Park neighborhood, which was the last to be incorporated into the city. Palo Alto's street grid is well-connected with few dead-end streets, especially in the city's older northern neighborhoods. An extensive urban forest, which is protected by the city's municipal code, provides shade and visual diversity, and slows motor vehicle traffic. 4.8% of residents walk to work.<ref name="US Census 2010-2012"/>

In 1989, Palo Alto received a gift of a large, whimsical wooden sculpture called ''Foreign Friends'' (''Fjärran Vänner'')—of a man, woman, dog and bird sitting on a park bench—from Linköping. The sculpture was praised by some, called "grotesque" by others, and became a lightning rod for vandals. It was covered with a large addressed postcard marked "Return to Sender." A former Stanford University professor was arrested for attempting to light it on fire. It was also doused with paint.<ref name="palhis">{{cite web|title=Palo Alto History|url=http://www.paloaltohistory.org/foreign-friends-statue.php|website=www.paloaltohistory.org}}</ref> When the original heads were decapitated on Halloween, 1993, the statue became a shrine—flowers bouquets and cards were placed upon it. Following an anonymous donation, the heads were restored. Within weeks, the restored heads were decapitated again, this time disappearing. The heads were eventually replaced with new ones, which generated even more distaste, as many deemed the new heads even less attractive.<ref name="palhis" />

A few months later, the man's arm was chopped off, the woman's lap was vandalized, the bird was stolen, and the replacements heads were decapitated and stolen.<ref name="palhis" /> The sculpture was removed from its location on Embarcadero Road and Waverley Avenue in 1995, dismantled, and placed in storage until it was destroyed in 2000. Ironically, the statue was designed not as a lasting work of art, but as something to be climbed on with a lifespan of 10 to 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everyone's a critic (June 29, 2005)|url=https://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2005/2005_06_29.art29mb.shtml|website=www.paloaltoonline.com}}</ref>

==Litigation==

===Class-action lawsuit against battery makers===
Palo Alto was the first city in [[California]] to participate in a class action lawsuit against major [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] producers, and currently serves as a representative for various cities and public entities across the state. The [[lawsuit]] was filed against global manufacturers of [[lithium-ion batteries]], including [[Panasonic]], [[LG Chem]], [[Sony]], [[Hitachi]] and [[Sanyo]].

The companies were accused of [[unfair business practices]]. They were alleged to have fixed prices of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are commonly used in laptops, smartphones, and GPS devices, and Palo Alto has purchased a lot{{citation needed|reason=How many?|date=July 2015}} of such devices.

Palo Alto's case will be consolidated with many others brought against the batteries producers in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]]. The companies are also facing at least 10 lawsuits in [[New Jersey]]. The city is represented by Rene Sloan Holtzman & Sakai, LLP, and Green & Noblin, P.C.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Palo Alto to launch class-action lawsuit against battery makers | url = https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2013/05/07/palo-alto-to-launch-class-action-lawsuit-against-battery-makers}}</ref>
