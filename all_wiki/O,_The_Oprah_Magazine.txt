{{Expand section|date = March 2011}}

In a March 2001 article entitled "O Positive", Noreen O'Leary argued that Winfrey was well on her way to influencing the content of [[List of women's magazines|women's magazines]] beyond her own, just as she has helped reshape daytime TV and the world of book publishing.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_10_42/ai_71559754/?tag=content;col1 | work=Brandweek | first=Noreen | last=O'Leary | title=O Positive – O, The Oprah Magazine, profile – Statistical Data Included | year=2001}}</ref>

==Brockmeyer lawsuit==
In April 2001, Oprah Winfrey and the Hearst Corporation were sued for trademark infringement by Ronald Brockmeyer, the publisher of ''[[«O»|«O» Magazine]]'', a German [[erotic]] periodical that predated Winfrey's magazine by several years. In a March 2003 decision, Judge [[John Koeltl]] dismissed the suit, citing the different content of the two magazines in addition to the irregular publication schedule and minimal American sales of the German magazine.
