==2011 player of the year selection==

On November 1, 2011, ''Golf Magazine'' selected [[Rory McIlroy]] over [[Yani Tseng]] for its 2011 player of year. The magazine's editor, David Clarke wrote, “We are pleased to name Rory McIlroy as our inaugural Player of the Year.” Americans have embraced this young Northern Irishman, taking him into their hearts not just out of admiration for his amazing talent, but also for the grace he has shown in victory and defeat, his generosity of time with fans, and his commitments to causes beyond golf.”<ref>{{cite web| author= sigroup |url=http://insidesportsillustrated.com/2011/11/01/rory-mcilory-golf-magazines-2011-player-of-the-year/ |title=Rory McIlory: Golf Magazine’s 2011 Player of the Year |publisher=Insidesportsillustrated.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>

The McIlroy selection was heavily criticized by golf bloggers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waggleroom.com/2011/11/1/2530872/yani-tseng-is-not-golf-magazines-player-of-the-year |title=Yani Tseng is NOT Golf Magazine’s Player of the Year |publisher=Waggleroom.com |accessdate=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205172453/http://www.waggleroom.com/2011/11/1/2530872/yani-tseng-is-not-golf-magazines-player-of-the-year |archivedate=December 5, 2011 }}</ref> The #1 male player in the world at the time, [[Luke Donald]], tweeted, "So rude and disrespectful of Yani. Whoever had final decision just diminished your magazine."<ref>[https://twitter.com/LukeDonald/status/131433449377636353 @LukeDonald]</ref>
