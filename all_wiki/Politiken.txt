In 1904, the tabloid ''[[Ekstra Bladet]]'' was founded as a supplement to ''Politiken ''and was later spun off as an independent newspaper on 1 January 1905. The paper established its present location in central Copenhagen at The City Hall Square in 1912.

The newspaper also publishes an international edition named ''Politiken Weekly'' which compiles the most important stories of the week for Danes living abroad.

==Wartime reporting==
On 28 April 1940, three weeks after the German invasion of Denmark, ''Politiken'' ran an editorial in which [[Winston Churchill]] was called "a dangerous man". The editorial was written by foreign affairs editor Einard Schou after a conversation in the editor-in-chief's office with chairman of the board and soon-to-be-again Danish foreign minister [[Erik Scavenius]]. The aim is thought to have been to please the German occupation force, though no other Danish newspaper took such steps at the time. Usually, it was enough to keep within the newly introduced censorship. The article led to 15,000 readers, about 10% of subscribers, cancelling their subscriptions in protest.<ref>[http://politiken.dk/om_politiken/ECE600271/en-levende-avis-kommer-til-verden/ En levende avis kommer til verden] ''Politiken''. 19 November 2008.

In February 2010 the editor in chief at the time [[Tøger Seidenfaden]] apologized to anyone who was offended by the newspaper's decision to reprint the cartoon drawing by [[Kurt Westergaard]] depicting Muhammed with a bomb in his turban, which was originally published in ''[[Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten]]''. Seidenfaden explained that "''Politiken'' has never intended to reprint the cartoon drawing as a statement of editorial opinion or values but merely as part of the newspaper's news coverage".<ref>[http://politiken.dk/debat/fakta/article910939.ece Statement published by ''Politiken''] ''Politiken''. 26 February 2010.
