Primarily a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla force]] at its inception, the Partisans developed into a large fighting force engaging in [[conventional warfare]] later in the war, numbering around 650,000 in late 1944 and were organized in four [[Field army|field armies]] and 52 [[Division (military)|divisions]]. The main stated objectives of the Partisans were the liberation of Yugoslav lands from occupying forces and the creation of a federal, multi-ethnic communist state in Yugoslavia.

The Partisans were organized on the initiative of Tito following the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, and began an active guerrilla campaign against occupying forces after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded the Soviet Union]] in June. A [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|large-scale uprising]] was launched in July, later joined by [[Draža Mihailović]]'s [[Chetniks]], which led to the creation of the short-lived [[Republic of Užice]]. The Axis mounted a [[Seven Enemy Offensives|series of offensives]] in response but failed to completely destroy the highly mobile Partisans and their leadership. By late 1943 the Allies had shifted their support from Mihailović to Tito as the extent of Chetnik collaboration became evident, and the Partisans received official recognition at the [[Tehran Conference]]. In Autumn 1944, the Partisans and the Soviet [[Red Army]] liberated [[Belgrade]] following the [[Belgrade Offensive]]. By the end of the war, the Partisans had gained control of the entire country as well as [[Trieste]] and [[Carinthia]]. After the war, the Partisans were reorganized into the [[Yugoslav People's Army|regular armed force]] of the newly established [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]].

== Objectives ==
[[File:Zgrabimo oružje svi.jpg|thumb|right|"''To arms, everyone!''", a Partisan propaganda poster.]]
One of two objectives of the movement, which was the military arm of the [[Unitary National Liberation Front]] (UNOF) coalition, led by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ)<ref name="Sharon Fisher 2006, p. 27"/> and represented by the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] (AVNOJ), the Yugoslav wartime [[deliberative assembly]], was to fight the occupying forces. Until British supplies began to arrive in appreciable quantities in 1944, the occupiers were the only source of arms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/3_1_2.htm|title=Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE|access-date=4 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044520/http://www.znaci.net/00001/3_1_2.htm|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The other objective was to create a federal multi-ethnic [[communist state]] in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=96}} To this end, the KPJ attempted to appeal to all the various ethnic groups within Yugoslavia, by preserving the rights of each group.

The objectives of the rival resistance movement, the [[Chetniks]], were the retention of the [[House of Karađorđević|Yugoslav monarchy]], ensuring the safety of ethnic [[Serb]] populations,{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=30–31}}{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=48}} and the establishment of a [[Greater Serbia]]{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=166–178}} through the [[ethnic cleansing]] of non-Serbs from territories they considered rightfully and historically Serbian.<ref name="Banac 1996 p143">{{harvnb|Banac|1996|p=43}}: "From the summer of 1941, the Chetniks increasingly gained control over Serb insurgents and carried out gruesome crimes against Muslims of eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Massacres of Muslims, usually by cutting the throats of the victims and tossing the bodies into various water-ways, occurred especially in eastern Bosnia, in Foča, Goražde, Čajniče, Rogatica, Višegrad, Vlasenica, Srebrenica, all in the basin of the Drina river, but also in eastern Herzegovina, where individual villages resisted Serb encirclement with ferocious determination until 1942. Chetnik documents&nbsp;– for example the minutes of the Chetnik conference in Javorine, district of Kotor Varoš, in June 1942 – speak of a determination to 'cleanse Bosnia of everything that is not Serb'. It is difficult to estimate the number of Muslim victims of this original ethnic cleansing, but it can be counted in the tens of thousands."</ref>{{sfn|Hirsch|2002|p=76}}{{sfn|Mulaj|2008|p=71}}{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|p=166}} Relations between the two movements were uneasy from the start, but from October 1941 they degenerated into full-scale conflict. To the Chetniks, Tito's pan-ethnic policies seemed anti-Serbian, whereas the Chetniks' [[royalism]] was anathema to the communists.<ref name="BBC - History -      World Wars: Partisans: War in the Balkans 1941 - 1945" /> In the early part of the war Partisan forces were predominantly composed of Serbs.

After the German retreat forced by the Soviet-Bulgarian offensive in Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo in the autumn of 1944, the conscription of Serbs, Macedonians and Kosovar Albanians increased significantly. By late 1944, the total forces of the Partisans numbered 650,000 men and women organized in four [[field army|field armies]] and 52 [[Division (military)|divisions]], which engaged in [[conventional warfare]].<ref name=perica>{{cite book|last=Perica|first=Vjekoslav| title=Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|page=96|isbn=978-0-19-517429-8}}</ref> By April 1945, the Partisans numbered over 800,000.

==Name==
The movement was consistently referred to as the "Partisans" throughout the war. However, due to frequent changes in size and structural reorganizations, the Partisans throughout their history held four full official names:
*'''National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia'''<ref group="note">{{lang-sh|Narodnooslobodilački partizanski odredi Jugoslavije}} (NOPOJ), Народноослободилачки партизански одреди Југославије (НОПОЈ); {{lang-mk|Народноослободителни партизански одреди на Југославија (НПОЈ)}}; {{lang-sl|Narodnoosvobodilni partizanski odredi Jugoslavije}} (NOPOJ)</ref> (June 1941 – January 1942)
*'''National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia'''<ref group="note">{{lang-sh|Narodnooslobodilačka partizanska i dobrovoljačka vojska Jugoslavije}} (NOP i DVJ), Народноослободилачка партизанска и добровољачка војска Југославије (НОП и ДВЈ); {{lang-mk|Народноослободителна партизанска и волонтерска војска на Југославија (НОП и ВВЈ)}}; {{lang-sl|Narodnoosvobodilna partizanska in prostovoljna vojska Jugoslavije}} (NOP in PVJ)</ref> (January – November 1942)
*'''National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia''' (November 1942 – February 1945). Increasingly from November 1942, the Partisan military as a whole was often referred to simply as the '''National Liberation Army''' (''Narodnooslobodilačka vojska,'' NOV), whereas the term "Partisans" acquired a wider sense in referring to the entire resistance faction (including, for example, the [[AVNOJ]]).
*'''Yugoslav Army''' <ref group="note">{{lang-sh|Jugoslavenska armija}} (JA), Југословенска армија (ЈА); {{lang-mk|Југословенска армија (ЈА)}}; {{lang-sl|Jugoslovanska Armada}} (JA)</ref> – on 1 March 1945, the National Liberation Army was transformed into the regular armed forces of Yugoslavia and renamed accordingly.
The movement was originally named National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''Narodnooslobodilački partizanski odredi Jugoslavije,'' NOPOJ) and held that name from June 1941 to January 1942. Because of this, their short name became simply the "Partisans" (capitalized), and stuck henceforward (the adjective "Yugoslav" is used sometimes in exclusively non-[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] sources to distinguish them from other [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] movements).

Between January 1942 and November 1942, the movement's full official name was briefly National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia (''Narodnooslobodilačka partizanska i dobrovoljačka vojska Jugoslavije,'' NOP i DVJ). The changes were meant to reflect the movement's character as a "volunteer army".

In November 1942 the movement was renamed into the National Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (''Narodnooslobodilačka vojska i partizanski odredi Jugoslavije,'' NOV i POJ), a name which it held until the end of the war. This last official name is the full name most associated with the Partisans, and reflects the fact that the proletarian brigades and other mobile units were organized into the National Liberation Army (''Narodnooslobodilačka vojska''). The name change also reflects the fact that the latter superseded in importance the partisan detachments themselves.

Shortly before the end of the war, in March 1945, all resistance forces were reorganized into the regular armed force of Yugoslavia and renamed Yugoslav Army. It would keep this name until 1951, when it was renamed the [[Yugoslav People's Army]].

==Background and origins==

{{See also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}

On 6 April 1941, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] from all sides by the Axis powers, primarily by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, but also including Italian, Hungarian and Bulgarian formations. During the invasion, [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Belgrade was bombed]] by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. The invasion lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the [[Wehrmacht]], the Army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=64–70}}

The terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany occupied the northern part of [[Drava Banovina]] (roughly modern-day [[Slovenia]]),<ref name=britannica2>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia|title=Independent State of Croatia|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|access-date=15 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412145432/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia|archive-date=12 April 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> while maintaining [[German-occupied territory of Serbia|direct military occupation of a rump Serbian territory]] with a puppet government.{{sfn|Kroener|Müller|Umbreit|2000|p=94}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=78}} The [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) was established under German direction, which extended over much of the territory of today's [[Croatia]] and as well contained all the area of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Syrmia]] region of modern-day [[Serbia]]. Mussolini's [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] occupied the remainder of Drava Banovina (annexed and renamed as the [[Province of Ljubljana|Province of Lubiana]]), much of [[Zeta Banovina]] and large chunks of the coastal [[Dalmatia]] region (along with nearly all its [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]] islands). It also gained control over the newly created [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]], and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it.

The occupying forces instituted such severe burdens on the local populace that the Partisans came not only to enjoy widespread support but for many were the only option for survival. Early in the occupation, German forces would hang or shoot indiscriminately, including women, children and the elderly, up to 100 local inhabitants for every one German soldier killed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Glenny |first=Misha |author-link=Misha Glenny|page=485|date=1999 |title=The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804–1999}}</ref> Furthermore, the country experienced a breakdown of law and order, with collaborationist militias roaming the countryside terrorizing the population. The government of the puppet Independent State of Croatia found itself unable to control its territory in the early stages of the occupation, resulting in a severe crackdown by the [[Ustaše militia]]s and the German army.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Amid the relative chaos that ensued, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] moved to organize and unite anti-fascist factions and political forces into a nationwide uprising. The party, led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], was banned after its significant success in the post-World War I Yugoslav elections and operated underground since. Tito, however, could not act openly without the backing of the [[USSR]], and as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] was still in force, he was compelled to wait.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Formation and early rebellion==

During the April invasion of Yugoslavia, the leadership of the Communist Party was in [[Zagreb]], together with Josip Broz Tito. After a month, they left for [[Belgrade]]. While the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] between Germany and the Soviet Union was in effect, the Communists refrained from open conflict with the new regime of the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. In these first two months of occupation, they extended their underground network and began amassing weapons.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=140}} In early May 1941, a so-called [[May consultations]] of Communist Party officials from across the country, who sought to organize the resistance against the occupiers, was held in Zagreb. In June 1941, a meeting of the Central Committee of KPJ was also held, at which it was decided to start preparations for the uprising.<ref>Davor Marijan, The May Deliberations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Hrvatski institut za povijest, 2003, p. 325-331, {{ISBN|953-6324-35-0}}</ref>

[[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941.<ref name= higgins>{{cite book|title=Hitler and Russia|first=Trumbull|last=Higgins|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1966|pages=11–59, 98–151}}</ref>

The extent of support for the Partisan movement varied according to region and nationality, reflecting the existential concerns of the local population and authorities. The first Partisan uprising occurred in Croatia on 22 June 1941, when forty Croatian Communists staged an uprising in the Brezovica woods between Sisak and Zagreb, forming the [[1st Sisak Partisan Detachment]].<ref name="cohen94"/> This unit was ignored in official Yugoslav historiography as it was not related to the Partisan movement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The first uprising led by Tito occurred two weeks later, in Serbia.<ref name="cohen94">[[#refCohen1996|Cohen 1996]], p. 94.</ref> The [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day – a public holiday in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. One [[Žikica Jovanović Španac]] shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July in the [[Bela Crkva incident]].

[[File:Partisan youth execution.jpg|thumb|Sixteen blindfolded Partisan youth await execution by German forces in [[Smederevska Palanka]], 20 August 1941.]]

The first Zagreb-[[Sesvete]] partisan group was formed in [[Dubrava, Zagreb|Dubrava]] in July 1941. In August 1941, 7 Partisan Detachments were formed in [[Dalmatia]] with the role of spreading the uprising. On 26 August 1941, 21 members of the [[1st Split Partisan Detachment]] were executed by firing squad after being captured by Italian and Ustashe forces.{{sfn|Kovač|Vojnović|1976|pp=367–372}}{{sfn|Kvesić|1960|pp=135–145}} A number of other partisan units were formed in the summer of 1941, including in [[Moslavina]] and [[Kalnik, Koprivnica-Križevci County|Kalnik]]. An uprising occurred in Serbia during the summer, led by Tito, when the [[Republic of Užice]] was created, but it was defeated by the Axis forces by December 1941, and support for the Partisans in Serbia thereafter dropped.

It was a different story for Serbs in Axis occupied Croatia who turned to the multi-ethnic Partisans, or the Serb royalist Chetniks.<ref name="Cohen 95">[[#refCohen1996|Cohen 1996]], p. 95.</ref> The journalist [[Tim Judah]] notes that in the early stage of the war the initial preponderance of Serbs in the Partisans meant in effect a Serbian civil war had broken out.<ref>[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 119.</ref> A similar civil war existed within the Croatian national corpus with the competing national narratives provided by the Ustaše and Partisans.

On 10 August in Stanulović, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. The area they controlled, consisting of nearby villages, was called the "Miners Republic" and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on. 

At the September 1941 [[Stolice conference]], the unified name ''partisans'' and the [[red star]] as an identification symbol were adopted for all fighters led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.

===Resistance and retaliation===
{{See also|Seven anti-Partisan offensives}}
[[File:March of Time - Yugoslav Partisans.ogv|thumb|Yugoslav Partisans engaging in various activities.]]
The Partisans staged a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign which enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. These were managed via the "People's committees", organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country controlled by the communists, even limited arms industries were set up. At the very beginning, Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure. They had two major advantages over other military and paramilitary formations in former Yugoslavia:
#A small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans who, unlike anyone else at the time, had experience with modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those of World War II Yugoslavia
#They were founded on ideology rather than [[ethnicity]], which meant the Partisans could expect at least some levels of support in any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations whose support was limited to territories with Croat or Serb majorities. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.

Occupying and [[quisling]] forces, however, were quite aware of the Partisan threat, and attempted to destroy the resistance in what Yugoslav historiographers defined as seven major enemy offensives. These are:
*The [[First Enemy Offensive]], the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the "[[Republic of Užice]]", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western [[Serbia]]. In November 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=37}} It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist [[Chetnik]] movement broke down and turned into open hostility.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=151–155}}
*The [[Second Enemy Offensive]], the coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over [[Igman]] mountain near [[Sarajevo]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=55}}
*The [[Operation Trio|Third Enemy Offensive]], an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, [[Montenegro]], [[Sandžak]] and [[Herzegovina]] which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as ''Operation TRIO'' by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=56–57}} This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the [[Battle of Kozara]], which took place in the summer of 1942.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*The [[Fourth Enemy Offensive]], against "[[Republic of Bihać]]", also known as the Battle of the Neretva or ''Fall Weiss'' (Case White), a conflict spanning the area between western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and northern [[Herzegovina]], and culminating in the Partisan retreat over the [[Neretva]] river. It took place from January to April 1943.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=100–103}}
*The [[Fifth Enemy Offensive]], also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or ''Fall Schwarz'' (''Case Black''). The operation immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
*The [[Sixth Enemy Offensive]], a series of operations undertaken by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and the ''[[Ustaše]]'' after the [[capitulation of Italy]] in an attempt to secure the [[Adriatic]] coast. It took place in late 1943 and early 1944.
*The [[Seventh Enemy Offensive]], the final attack in western Bosnia in the second quarter of 1944, which included ''Operation Rösselsprung'' (Knight's Leap), an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] and annihilate the leadership of the Partisan movement.
 
{{quote|It was the nature of partisan resistance that operations against it must either eliminate it altogether or leave it potentially stronger than before. This had been shown by the sequel to each of the previous five offensives from which, one after another, the partisan brigades and divisions had emerged stronger in experience and armament than they had been before, with the backing of a population which had come to see no alternative to resistance but death, imprisonment, or starvation. There could be no half-measures; the Germans left nothing behind them but a trail of ruin. What in other circumstances might possibly have remained the purely ideological war that reactionaries abroad said it was (and German propaganda did their utmost to support them) became a war for national preservation. So clear was this that no room was left for provincialism; Serbs and Croats and Slovenes, Macedonians, Bosnians, Christian and Moslem, Orthodox and Catholic, sank their differences in the sheer desperation of striving to remain alive.<ref name="Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE">[http://www.znaci.net/00001/3_2_8.htm Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426114119/http://znaci.net/00001/3_2_8.htm |date=26 April 2013 }}, znaci.net; accessed 16 July 2015.</ref>|[[Basil Davidson]]}}

Partisans operated as a regular army that remained highly mobile across occupied Yugoslavia. Partisan units engaged in overt acts of resistance which led to significant reprisals against civilians by Axis forces.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=174}} The killing of civilians discouraged the Chetniks from carrying out overt resistance, however the Partisans were not fazed and continued overt resistance which disrupted Axis forces, but led to significant civilian casualties.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=175}}

Later in the conflict the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], who until then had supported General [[Draža Mihailović]]'s Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration fighting by many military missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tito|last=Barnett|first=Neil|author-link=Neil Barnett|year=2006|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-904950-31-8|pages=65–66}}</ref>

To gather [[military intelligence|intelligence]], agents of the western Allies were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the demise of the [[Chetniks]] and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, although supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. The new year would bring a change. The Germans were executing [[Operation Schwarz]] (the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when F.W.D. Deakin was sent by the British to gather information.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} On April 13th 1941, Winston Churchill sent his greetings to the Yugoslav people. In his greeting he stated:

{{quote| You are making a heroic resistance against formidable odds and in doing so you are proving true to your great traditions. Serbs, we know you. You were our allies in the last war and your armies are covered with glory. Croats and Slovenes, we know your military history. For centuries you were the bulwark of Christianity. Your fame as warriors spread far and wide on the Continent. One of the finest incidents in the history of Croatia is the one when, in the 16th Century, long before the French Revolution, the peasants rose to defend the rights of man, and fought for those principles which centuries later gave the world democracy. Yugoslavs, you are fighting for those principles today. The British Empire is fighting with you, and behind us is the great democracy of the U.S.A., with its vast and ever-increasing resources. However hard the fight, our victory is assured. <ref name="Basil Davidson: PARTISAN PICTURE" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=Martin |title=The Churchill War Papers: The ever-widening war, 1941 |date=1993 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=490}}</ref>|[[Winston Churchill]]}}

His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had traveled from Russia by railway through Chetnik-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. All in all, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy. In September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near Drvar to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=34}}

Thus, after the [[Tehran Conference]] the Partisans received official recognition as the legitimate national liberation force by the Allies, who subsequently set up the [[RAF]] [[Balkan Air Force]] (under the influence and suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces. During a meeting with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] of 24 November 1943, [[Winston Churchill]] pointed out that:{{quote|It was a lamentable fact that virtually no supplies had been conveyed by sea to the 222,000 followers of Tito.&nbsp;... These stalwarts were holding as many Germans in Yugoslavia as the combined Anglo-American forces were holding in Italy south of Rome. The Germans had been thrown into some confusion after the collapse of Italy and the Patriots had gained control of large stretches of the coast. We had not, however, seized the opportunity. The Germans had recovered and were driving the Partisans out bit by bit. The main reason for this was the artificial line of responsibility which ran through the Balkans. (...&nbsp;) Considering that the Partisans had given us such a generous measure of assistance at almost no cost to ourselves, it was of high importance to ensure that their resistance was maintained and not allowed to flag. |Winston Churchill, 24 November 1943<ref>Walter R.

On 20 October, the Red Army and the Partisans liberated [[Belgrade]] in a joint operation known as the [[Belgrade Offensive]]. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia – Serbia, [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]], as well as the [[Dalmatia]]n coast.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

 [[File:Flag of the Serbian Partisans.svg|thumb|right|Flag of Serbian and Montenegrin Partisans used in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]], [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]] and in areas of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] where Serbs lived.]]

The [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Axis invasion]] led to the division of Yugoslavia between the Axis powers and the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. The largest part of Serbia was organized into the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]] and as such it was the only example of military regime in occupied Europe.{{sfn|Petranović|1992}} The Military Committee of the [[Provincial Committee for Serbia|Provincial Committee of the Communist Party for Serbia]] was formed in mid-May 1941. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia arrived in Belgrade in late May, and this was of great importance for the development of the resistance in Yugoslavia. After their arrival, the Central Committee held conferences with local party officials. The decision for preparing the struggle in Serbia issued on June 23, 1941 at the meeting of the Provincial Committee for Serbia. On July 5, a communist party proclamation appeared that called upon the Serbian people to struggle against the invaders. Western Serbia was chosen as the base of the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|uprising]], which later spread to other parts of Serbia. A [[Republic of Užice|short-lived republic]] was created in the liberated west, the first liberated territory in Europe. The uprising was suppressed by German forces by 29 November 1941. The [[Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia]] is believed to have been founded in Užice on 17 November 1941. It was the body of the Partisan resistance in Serbian territory.

The [[Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Serbia]] was held 9–12 November 1944.

Tito's post-war government built numerous [[List of Yugoslav World War II monuments and memorials in Serbia|monuments and memorials]] in Serbia after the war.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Serbian Partisan detachments entered Bosnian territory after the [[Operation Uzice]] which saw the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Serbian uprising]] quelled. The Bosnian Partisans were heavily reduced during [[Operation Trio]] (1942) on the resistance in eastern Bosnia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Croatia===
<!-- [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia]] redirects here -->
[[File:Flag of the Federal State of Croatia.svg|thumb|right|Flag of the Federal State of Croatia, used by Croatian Partisans and National Liberation Movement.]]

The [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia]] was part of the anti-fascist National Liberational Movement in the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Axis-occupied Yugoslavia]] which was the most effective anti-Nazi [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]]<ref name="JJR2013_OxfordPress">[[Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones|Jeffreys-Jones, R.]] (2013): ''In Spies We Trust: The Story of Western Intelligence'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780199580972}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3gK7e8LpXvcC&pg=PA87 p. 87]</ref><ref name="AS_2005">Adams, Simon (2005): ''The Balkans'', Black Rabbit Books, {{ISBN|9781583406038}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmm4J2Ug4o8C&pg=PA1981 p. 1981]</ref> led by [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Revolutionary movement|revolutionary]] communists<ref name="Dennison I.

NOP was under the leadership of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ) and supported by many others, with [[Croatian Peasant Party]] members contributing to it significantly. NOP units were able to temporarily or permanently liberate large parts of Croatia from occupying forces. Based on the NOP, the Federal Republic of Croatia was founded as a constituent of the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

==Services==
[[File:BAF Vis Reviw.jpg|thumb|left|Aircraft and men of the [[Balkan Air Force]] during a review by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]].]]
Aside from ground forces, the Yugoslav Partisans were the only [[resistance movement]] in occupied Europe to employ significant air and naval forces.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Partisan Navy===
Naval forces of the resistance were formed as early as 19 September 1942, when Partisans in [[Dalmatia]] formed their first naval unit made of fishing boats, which gradually evolved into a force able to engage the Italian Navy and [[Kriegsmarine]] and conduct complex amphibious operations. This event is considered to be the foundation of the [[Yugoslav Navy]]. At its peak during World War II, the Yugoslav Partisans' Navy commanded 9 or 10 armed ships, 30 patrol boats, close to 200 support ships, six coastal batteries, and several Partisan detachments on the islands, around 3,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} On 26 October 1943, it was organized first into four, and later into six, Maritime Coastal Sectors (''Pomorsko Obalni Sektor'', POS). The task of the naval forces was to secure supremacy at sea, organize defense of coast and islands, and attack enemy sea traffic and forces on the islands and along the coasts.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Partisan Air Force===
The Partisans gained an effective air force in May 1942, when the pilots of two aircraft belonging to the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] (French-designed and Yugoslav-built [[Potez 25]], and [[Breguet 19]] [[biplane]]s, themselves formerly of the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]]), [[Franjo Kluz]] and [[Rudi Čajavec]], defected to the Partisans in Bosnia.<ref name= donlagic>{{cite book|last1=Đonlagić|first1=Ahmet|last2=Atanacković|first2=Žarko|last3=Plenča|first3=Dušan|title=Yugoslavia in the Second World War|publisher=Međunarodna štampa Interpress|page= 85|year=1967}}</ref> Later, these pilots used their aircraft against Axis forces in limited operations. Although short-lived due to a lack of infrastructure, this was the first instance of a resistance movement having its own air force. Later, the air force would be re-established and destroyed several times until its permanent institution. The Partisans later established a permanent air force by obtaining aircraft, equipment, and training from captured Axis aircraft, the British [[Royal Air Force]] (see [[Balkan Air Force|BAF]]), and later the [[Soviet Air Force]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Yugoslav Partisans were a predominantly Serb movement into 1943.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=186}}<ref name="Pinson1996"/> Also, it should be kept in mind that until the middle of the war the Partisans were in control of relatively large liberated areas only in parts of Bosnia.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=186}} Over the entirety of the war according to the records of recipients of Partisan pensions from 1977, the ethnic composition of the Partisans was 53 percent Serb, 18.6 percent Croat, 9.2 percent Slovene, 5.5 percent Montenegrin, 3.5 percent Bosnian Muslim, and 2.7 percent Macedonian.{{sfn|Hoare|2011|p=207}} Much of the remainder of the NOP's membership was made up of Albanians, Hungarians and those self-identifying as Yugoslavs.{{sfn|Hoare|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Calic|2019|p=463}}{{sfn|Hoare|2002|p=4}}<ref>Lenard J Cohen, Paul V Warwick (1983)

In regional terms, the Partisan movement was therefore disproportionately west Yugoslav, particularly from Croatia, while until the autumn of 1944, Serbia's contribution was disproportionately small.{{sfn|Hoare|2002|p=28}} During 1941 until September 1943 from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina 1,064 of Jews joined the Partisans, and largest part of Jews joined the Partisans after the capitulation of Italy in 1943. At the end of the war 2,339 of Jewish Partisans from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina survived while 804 were killed.<ref>https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/spasonosni-bijeg-u-antifasisticke-odrede-moj-tata-je-partizan-1267831 </ref> Most of the Jews who joined the Yugoslavian partisans were from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and according to Romano this number is 4,572 while them 1318 were killed.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=671}}

According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,
<blockquote>In partitioned Yugoslavia, partisan resistance developed among the Slovenes in German-annexed Slovenia, engaging mostly in small-scale sabotage. In Serbia, a cetnik resistance organization developed under a former Yugoslav Army Colonel, Draža Mihailovic. After a disastrous defeat in an uprising in June 1941, this organization tended to withdraw from confrontation with the Axis occupying forces. The Communist-dominated Partisan organization under the leadership of Josef Tito was a multi-ethnic resistance force – including Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, Bosniaks, Jews, and Slovenes. Based primarily in Bosnia and northwestern Serbia, Tito's Partisans fought the Germans and Italians most consistently and played a major role in driving the German forces out of Yugoslavia in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007332|title=Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|publisher=Ushmm.org|date=6 January 2011|access-date=19 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120214424/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007332|archive-date=20 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

According to Fabijan Trgo in the summer of 1944 National Liberation Army has about 350,000 soldiers in 39 divisions, which are grouped into 12 Corps. In September 1944 about 100,000 soldiers in 17 divisions was ready to enter the final phase of the battle for the liberation of Serbia, overall in all Yugoslavian areas National Liberation Army has about 400,000 armed soldiers. That is, 15 corps, ie 50 divisions, 2 operational groups, 16 independent brigades, 130 partisan detachments, the navy and the first aviation formations. At the beginning of 1945, the number of soldiers was about 600,000. On March 1, Yugoslav Army has more than 800,000 soldiers, grouped in 63 divisions.<ref>Fabijan Trgo; (1975) ''Oslobođenje Jugoslavije (1944-1945)'' Liberation of Yugoslavia (1944-1945) p. 30-36, [https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=315748]</ref>

The Chetniks were a mainly Serb-oriented group and their Serb nationalism resulted in an inability to recruit or appeal to many non-Serbs. The Partisans played down communism in favour of a [[Popular Front]] approach which appealed to all Yugoslavs. In Bosnia, the Partisan rallying cry was for a country which was to be neither Serbian nor Croatian nor Muslim, but instead to be free and brotherly in which full equality of all groups would be ensured.<ref>[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 120.</ref> Nevertheless, Serbs remained the dominant ethnic group in the Yugoslav Partisans throughout the war.<ref>''Century of genocide: critical essays and eyewitness accounts'', Samuel Totten, William S.

Chetnik attacks on [[Gata, Croatia|Gata]], near [[Split (city)|Split]], resulted in the slaughter of some 200 Croatian civilians.<ref>[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], p. 128.</ref>

In particular, Mussolini's policy of forced [[Italianization]] ensured the first significant number of Croats joining the Partisans in late 1941. In other areas, recruitment of Croats was hindered by some Serbs' tendency to view the organisation as exclusively Serb, rejecting non-Serb members and raiding the villages of their Croat neighbours.<ref name="Cohen 95"/> A group of Jewish youths from Sarajevo attempted to join a Partisan detachment in Kalinovnik, but the Serbian Partisans turned them back to Sarajevo, where many were captured by the Axis forces and perished.<ref>[[#refCohen1996|Cohen 1996]], p. 77.</ref> Attacks from Croatian [[Ustaše]] on the Serbian population was considered to be one of the important reasons for the rise of guerrilla activities, thus aiding an ever-growing Partisan resistance.<ref>[[#refJudah2000|Judah 2000]], pp.&nbsp;127–128.</ref> Following the capitulation of Italy and subsequent [[Belgrade Offensive]], many members of the Ustaše joined the partisans.{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=233}}

Until early 1942, the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were almost exclusively Serbs, cooperated closely with the Chetniks, and some Partisans in eastern Herzegovina and western Bosnia refused to accept Muslims into their ranks. For many Muslims, the behavior of these Serb Partisans towards them meant that there was little difference for them between the Partisans and Chetniks. However, in some areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Partisans were successful in attracting both Muslims and Croats from the beginning, notably in the [[Kozara (mountain)|Kozara]] Mountain area in north-west Bosnia and the [[Romanija]] Mountain area near Sarajevo. In the Kozara area, Muslims and Croats made up 25 percent of Partisan strength by the end of 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=506–07}}

According to Hoare, by late 1943, 70% of the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina were Serb and 30% were Croat and Muslim.<ref name="Hoare 10">[[#refHoare2006|Hoare 2006]], p. 10.</ref>  At the end of 1977, Bosnian recipients of war pensions were 64.1% Serb, 23% Muslim, and 8.8% Croat.{{sfn|Hoare|2002|p=}}

In 1941–42, the majority of Partisans in Croatia were Serbs, but by October 1943 the majority were Croats. This change was partly due to the decision of a key [[Croatian Peasant Party]] member, Božidar Magovac, to join the Partisans in June 1943, and partly due to the surrender of Italy.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=362–363}} At the moment of the capitulation of Italy to the Allies the Serbs and Croats were participating equally according to their respective population sizes in Yugoslavia as a whole.{{sfn|Hoare|2002|p=30}} According to Goldstein, among Croatian partisans at the end of 1941, 77% were Serbs and 21.5% were Croats, and others as well as unknown nationalities. The percentage of Croats in the Partisans had increased to 32% by August 1942, and 34% by September 1943. After the capitulation of Italy, it increased further. At the end of 1944 there were 60.4% Croats, 28.6% Serbs and 11% of other nationalities (2.8% Muslims, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Italians, Hungarians, Czechs, Jews and ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') in Croatian partisan units.<ref name="Ramet 153"/><ref>Goldstein.

Croatian Partisans were integral to overall Yugoslav Partisans with ethnic Croats in prominent positions in the movement since the very beginning of the war; According to some researchers writing during 1990s, like Cohen, by the end of 1943, Croatia proper, with 24% of the Yugoslav population, provided more Partisans than Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia and Macedonia combined (though not more than Bosnia and Herzegovina).<ref name="Cohen 95"/> In early 1943 Partisans took steps to establish [[ZAVNOH]] (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia) to act as a parliamentary body for all of Croatia – the only one of its kind in occupied Europe. ZAVNOH held three plenary sessions during the war in areas which remained surrounded by Axis troops. At its fourth and last session, held on 24–25 July 1945 in Zagreb, ZAVNOH proclaimed itself as the Croatian Parliament or [[Sabor]].<ref name=Jelic>{{cite book|last1=Jelic|first1=Ivan| title=Croatia in War and Revolution 1941–1945|location=Zagreb|publisher=[[Školska knjiga]]|year=1978}}</ref>

By the end of 1941 in the territory of the puppet Croatian State Serbs comprised approximately one-third of the population but about 95% of all Partisans. This numerical dominance lessened later, but until 1943 Serbs formed a majority of Partisans in Croatia (including Dalmatia). Territories in Croatia proper with a substantial number of Serb inhabitants (Lika, Banija, Kordun) formed the most important source of manpower for the Partisans. In May 1941 the Ustasha regime ceded northern Dalmatia to Fascist Italy, which caused increasingly massive support for the Partisans among the Croats of Dalmatia. In other parts of Croatia Croat support toward the Partisans gradually increased due to Ustasha and Axis violence and misrule, but much more slowly than in Dalmatia. There were only 1,492 Partisans from Serbia out of the 22,148 Partisans of Tito's Main Operational Group at the Battle of the River Sutjeska in June 1943, and 8,925 were from Croatia (of which 5,195 were from Dalmatia), but in ethnic terms, 11,851 were Serbs as against 5,220 Croats. At the end of 1943 all 13 Dalmatian Partisan brigades had a Croat majority, but among the 25 Partisan brigades from Croatian proper (without Dalmatia) only 7 had a Croat majority (17 had a Serb majority and one had a Czech majority).<ref>Marko Attila Hoare; (2002) ''Whose is the partisan movement?

According to Tito, one-quarter of [[Zagreb]]'s population ie more than 50,000 of citizens participated in the Partisan struggle during which over 20,000 of them were killed (half of them as active fighters).<ref>Institut za historiju radničkog pokreta Hrvatske (Institute for the History of the Croatian Workers' Movement) (1982)  ''Zbornik sjećanja Zagreb 1941-1945'' (Speech by President Tito on the occasion of the handover of the Order of the People's Hero to Zagreb, "Borba", September 1975) p. 6; [http://znaci.net/00001/126.pdf]</ref> As Partisan combatants 4,709 citizens of Zagreb were killed while 15,129 were killed in Ustasha and Nazi prisons and concentration camps, and another 6,500 were killed during anti-insurgency operations.{{sfn|Hoare|2002|p=28}}

In the final offensive for the liberation of Yugoslavia, from Croatia was engaged 165,000 soldiers mostly for the liberation of Croatia. On Croatian territory after 30 November 1944 in combat with the enemy participated 5 corps, 15 divisions, 54 brigades and 35 Partisan detachments, a total of 121,341 soldiers (117,112 men and 4239 woman) which at the end of 1944 made up about third of the entire armed forces of the National Liberation Army. At the same time, on the territory of Croatia there was 340,000 of German soldiers, 150,000 of Ustasha and Home Guard soldiers while the Chetniks at beginning of 1945 withdrew towards Slovenia. According to the ethnic composition of Partisans, most were Croats 73,327 or 60.40%, followed by Serbs 34,753 or 28.64%, Muslims 3,316 or 2.75%, Jews 284 or 0.25% and Slovenes, Montenegrins and others with 9,671 or 7.96%, (number of Partisans and ethnic composition does not include 9 brigades which were engaged outside of Croatia).<ref>Nikola Anić; (1985) ''Oružane snage NOP-a Hrvatske u vrijeme njezina oslobođenja potkraj 1944. i na početku 1945. godine'' p. 103-104, 136-138;

When the Soviets liberated Serbia at the end of 1944, mass Partisan mobilization of Serbians, Macedonians and eventually Kosovo Albanians began, which led to a balanced geographical contribution between the eastern and western Yugoslavian Partisan movements.

During World War II, Slovenia was in a unique situation in Europe.

At the very beginning the Partisan forces were small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure, but [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans amongst them had some experience with [[guerrilla warfare]]. The Partisan movement in Slovenia functioned as the military arm of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]], an Anti-Fascist resistance platform established in the [[Province of Ljubljana]] on 26 April 1941, which originally consisted of multiple groups of left wing orientation, most notable being Communist Party and Christian Socialists. During the course of the war, the influence of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] started to grow, until its supremacy was officially sanctioned in the [[Dolomiti Declaration]] of 1 March 1943.{{sfn|Gow|Carmichael|2010|p=48}} Some of the members of Liberation Front and partisans were ex-members of the [[TIGR]] resistance movement.

Representatives of all political groups in Liberation Front participated in Supreme Plenum of Liberation Front, which led the resistance efforts in Slovenia. Supreme Plenum was active until 3 October 1943 when, at the [[Kočevski zbor|Assembly of the Slovenian Nation's Delegates]] in Kočevje, the 120-member Liberation Front Plenum was elected as the supreme body of the Slovenian Liberation Front. The plenum also functioned as Slovenian National Liberation Committee, the supreme authority in Slovenia. Some historians consider the Kočevje Assembly to be the first Slovene elected parliament and Slovene Partisans as its representatives also participated on [[2nd session of the AVNOJ]] and were instrumental in adding the self-determination clause to the resolution on the establishment of a new federal Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front Plenum was renamed the [[SNOS|Slovenian National Liberation Council]] at the conference in Črnomelj on 19 February 1944 and transformed into the Slovenian parliament.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The Slovene Partisans retained their specific organizational structure and [[Slovene language]] as the commanding language until the last months of World War II, when their language was removed as the commanding language. From 1942 till after 1944, they wore the ''[[Triglavka]]'' cap, which was then gradually replaced with the ''[[Titovka (cap)|Titovka]]'' cap as part of their uniform.{{sfn|Vukšić|2003|p=21}} In March 1945, the Slovene Partisan Units were officially merged with the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] and thus ceased to exist as a separate formation.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The partisan activities in Slovenia started in 1941 and were independent of Tito's partisans in the south. In autumn 1942, Tito attempted for the first time to control the Slovene resistance movement. [[Arsa Jovanović]], a leading Yugoslav communist who was sent from Tito's Supreme Command of Yugoslav partisan resistance, ended his mission to establish central control over the Slovene partisans unsuccessfully in April 1943. The merger of the Slovene Partisans with Tito's forces happened in 1944.{{sfn |Stewart |2006 |p=15}}{{sfn |Klemenčič |Zagar |2004 |pp=167–168}}

In December 1943, [[Franja Partisan Hospital]] was built in difficult and rugged terrain, only a few hours from Austria and the central parts of Germany. The partisans broadcast their own radio program called ''Radio Kričač'', the location of which never became known to occupying forces, although the receiver antennas from the local population had been confiscated.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Rescue operations==
The Partisans were responsible for the successful and sustained evacuation of downed Allied airmen from the Balkans. For example, between 1 January and 15 October 1944, according to statistics compiled by the US Air Force Air Crew Rescue Unit, 1,152 American airmen were airlifted from Yugoslavia, 795 with Partisan assistance and 356 with the help of the Chetniks.{{sfn |Leary |1995|p=34}} Yugoslav Partisans in Slovene territory rescued 303 American airmen, 389 British airmen and prisoners of war, and 120 French and other prisoners of war and slave laborers.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=115}}

The Partisans also assisted hundreds of Allied soldiers who succeeded in escaping from German POW camps (mostly in southern Austria) throughout the war, but especially from 1943 to 1945. These were transported across Slovenia, from where many were airlifted from [[Semič]], while others made the longer overland trek down through Croatia for a boat passage to [[Bari]] in Italy. In the spring of 1944, the British military mission in Slovenia reported that there was a "steady, slow trickle" of escapes from these camps. They were being assisted by local civilians, and on contacting Partisans on the general line of the River [[Drava]], they were able to make their way to safety with Partisan guides.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Raid at Ožbalt===
{{Main|Raid at Ožbalt}}
A total of 132 Allied prisoners of war were rescued from the Germans by the Partisans in a single operation in August 1944 in what is known as the [[Raid at Ožbalt]]. In June 1944, the Allied escape organization began to take an active interest in assisting prisoners from camps in southern Austria and evacuating them through Yugoslavia. A post of the Allied mission in northern [[Slovenia]] had found that at [[Ožbalt]], just on the Austrian side of the border, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Maribor]], there was a poorly guarded working camp from which a raid by [[Slovene Partisans]] could free all the prisoners. Over 100 POWs were transported from [[Stalag XVIII-D]] at [[Maribor]] to Ožbalt each morning to do railway maintenance work, and returned to their quarters in the evening. Contact was made between Partisans and the prisoners with the result that at the end of August a group of seven slipped away past a sleeping guard at 15:00, and at 21:00 the men were celebrating with the Partisans in a village, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} away on the Yugoslav side of the border.{{sfn|Mason|1954|p=[https://web.archive.org/web/20181006052844/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz//tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Pris-_N95868.html#n383 383]}}

The seven escapees arranged with the Partisans for the rest of the camp to be freed the following day. Next morning, the seven returned with about a hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work-party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans, to quote a New Zealand eye-witness, "swooped down the hillside and disarmed the eighteen guards". In a short time prisoners, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted along the route used by the first seven prisoners the previous evening. At the first headquarters camp reached, details were taken of the total of 132 escaped prisoners for transmission by radio to England. Progress along the evacuation route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused the loss of two prisoners and two of the escort. Eventually they reached [[Semič]], in [[White Carniola]], Slovenia, which was a Partisan base catering for POWs. They were flown across to [[Bari]] on 21 September 1944 from the airport of [[Otok, Metlika|Otok]] near [[Gradac, Metlika|Gradac]].{{sfn|Mason|1954|p=[https://web.archive.org/web/20181006052844/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz//tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Pris-_N95868.html#n383 383]}}

==Post-war==
{{Main|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}
SFR Yugoslavia was one of only two European countries that were largely liberated by its own forces during World War II. It received significant assistance from the Soviet Union during the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of Serbia]], and substantial assistance from the [[Balkan Air Force]] from mid-1944, but only limited assistance, mainly from the British, prior to 1944. At the end of the war no foreign troops were stationed on its soil. Partly as a result, the country found itself halfway between the two camps at the onset of the [[Cold War]].

In 1947–48, the Soviet Union attempted to command obedience from Yugoslavia, primarily on issues of foreign policy, which resulted in the [[Tito-Stalin split]] and almost ignited an armed conflict. A period of very cool relations with the Soviet Union followed, during which the U.S. and the UK considered courting Yugoslavia into the newly formed [[NATO]]. This however changed in 1953 with the Trieste crisis, a tense dispute between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies over the eventual Yugoslav-Italian border (see [[Free Territory of Trieste]]), and with Yugoslav-Soviet reconciliation in 1956. This ambivalent position at the start of the Cold War matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] foreign policy which Yugoslavia actively espoused until its dissolution.

The Partisans massacred civilians during and after the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Jonassohn|Björnson|1998|p=285}}: "There is no doubt that Partisans participated in the massacre of civilians during and after the war"</ref> On 27 July 1941, Partisan-led units massacred around 100 Croat civilians in [[Bosansko Grahovo massacre|Bosansko Grahovo]] and 300 in [[Trubar massacre|Trubar]] during the [[Drvar uprising]] against the NDH.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Matkovich |first1=Blanka |title=Croatia and Slovenia at the End and After the Second World War (1944-1945): Mass Crimes and Human Rights Violations Committed by the Communist Regime |date=2017 |publisher=BrownWalker Press |isbn=978-1-62734-691-7 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrU4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA34}}</ref> Between 5-8 September 1941, some 1,000-3,000 Muslim civilians and soldiers, including 100 Croats were massacred by the Partisan Drvar Brigade.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=106–108}} A number of Partisan units, and the local population in some areas, engaged in [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Yugoslavia|mass murder]] in the immediate postwar period against [[POW]]s and other perceived Axis sympathizers, collaborators, and/or fascists along with their relatives, including children. These infamous massacres include the [[Foibe massacres]], [[Tezno massacre]], [[Macelj massacre]], [[Kočevski Rog massacre]], [[Barbara Pit massacre]] and the [[communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45]]. 

The [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriations at Bleiburg]] (although scholars disagree on how many people died and no number has been officially recognized or agreed upon) of retreating columns of [[Chetnik]] and [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops, and soldiers of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] and thousands of civilians heading or retreating towards Austria to surrender to western Allied forces, have been called a "massacre". The "foibe massacres" draw their name from the "foibe" pits in which Croatian Partisans of the [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] (often along with groups of angry civilian locals) shot Italian fascists, and suspected collaborationists and/or separatists. According to a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm|title=Slovene-Italian historical commission|publisher=Kozina.com|access-date=19 November 2011}}</ref> established in 1993, which investigated only on what happened in places included in present-day Italy and Slovenia, the killings seemed to proceed from endeavors to remove persons linked with fascism (regardless of their personal responsibility), and endeavors to carry out mass executions of real, potential or only alleged opponents of the Communist government. The [[1944-1945 killings in Bačka]] were similar in nature and entailed the killing of suspected Hungarian, German and Serbian fascists, and their suspected affiliates, without regard to their personal responsibility. During this purge, a large number of civilians from the associated ethnic group were also killed.{{sfn|Matuska|1991|p=}}{{pn|date=February 2020}}

The Partisans did not have an official agenda of liquidating their enemies and their cardinal ideal was the "[[brotherhood and unity]]" of all Yugoslav nations (the phrase became the motto for the new Yugoslavia). The country suffered between 900,000 and 1,150,000 civilian and military dead during the Axis occupation.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=737}} Between 80,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the partisan purges and at least 30,000 people were killed in the Bleiburg killings, according to Marcus Tanner in his work, ''Croatia: a Nation Forged in War''.

This chapter of Partisan history was a taboo subject for conversation in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] until the late 1980s, and as a result, decades of official silence created a reaction in the form of numerous data manipulation for nationalist propaganda purposes.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002|p=}}

==Equipment==
The first small arms for the Partisans were acquired from the defeated [[Royal Yugoslav Army]], like the [[M24 series|M24 Mauser rifle]]. Throughout the war the Partisans used any weapons they could find, mostly weapons captured from the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]], [[Royal Italian Army|Italians]], [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Army of the NDH]], [[Ustaše]] and the [[Chetniks]], such as the [[Karabiner 98k]] rifle, [[MP 40]] submachine gun, [[MG 34]] machine gun, [[Carcano]] rifles and carbines and [[Beretta]] submachine guns. The other way that the Partisans acquired weapons was from supplies given to them by the [[Soviet Union]] and the United Kingdom, including the [[PPSh-41]] and the [[Sten]] MKII submachine guns respectively. Additionally, Partisan workshops created their own weapons modelled on factory-made weapons already in use, including the so-called "Partisan rifle" and the anti-tank "Partisan mortar".
