Consistent with modern standards, neither she nor her family were compensated for their extraction or use.

Lacks grew up in rural Virginia. After giving birth to two of their children, she married her cousin David "Day" Lacks. In 1941 the young family moved to Turner Station, near [[Dundalk, Maryland]], in [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], so Day could work in [[Bethlehem Steel]] at [[Sparrows Point, Maryland|Sparrows Point]]. After Lacks had given birth to their fifth child, Joseph, she was diagnosed with cancer.<ref>{{citation|last=Skloot|first=Rebecca|author-link=Rebecca Skloot|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|year=2010|publisher=[[Random House]]|place=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_h0q7/page/17 17]|isbn=978-1-4000-5217-2|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_h0q7/page/17}}</ref> Tissue samples from her tumors were taken without consent during treatment and these samples were then subsequently cultured into the HeLa cell line.

Even though some information about the origins of HeLa's immortalized cell lines was known to researchers after 1970, the Lacks family was not made aware of the line's existence until 1975.  With knowledge of the cell line's genetic provenance becoming public, its use for medical research and for commercial purposes continues to raise concerns about privacy and patients' rights.

==Personal life==
Henrietta Lacks was born Loretta Pleasant on August 1, 1920,<ref name="vpbio"/>{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=18}} in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], to Eliza Pleasant (nee Lacks) (1886–1924) and John "Johnny" Randall Pleasant (1881–1969).<ref name="O">{{cite news |url= http://www.oprah.com/world/Excerpt-From-The-Immortal-Life-of-Henrietta-Lacks_1/3 |title=Excerpt From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks |first= Rebecca |last=Skloot |work=oprah.com |date= February 2010 |access-date=2013-08-09}}</ref> Her family is uncertain how her name changed from Loretta to Henrietta, but she was nicknamed Hennie.<ref name="vpbio"/> When Lacks was four years old in 1924, her mother died giving birth to her tenth child.<ref name="O"/> Unable to care for the children alone after his wife's death, Lacks' father moved the family to [[Clover, Virginia]], where the children were distributed among relatives. Lacks ended up with her maternal grandfather, Thomas "Tommy" Henry Lacks, in a two-story log cabin that was once the slave quarters on the plantation that had been owned by Henrietta's white great-grandfather and great-uncle.<ref name="vpbio"/> She shared a room with her nine-year-old first cousin (their mothers were sisters) and future husband, David "Day" Lacks (1915–2002).<ref name="O"/>

Like most members of her family living in Clover, Lacks worked as a tobacco farmer starting from an early age. In 1935, when Lacks was 14 years old, she gave birth to a son, Lawrence Lacks. In 1939, her daughter [[Elsie Lacks]] (1939–1955) was born. Both children were fathered by Day Lacks. Elsie had [[developmental disabilities]] and was described by the family as "different" or "deaf and dumb".<ref name="vpbio"/>

On April 10, 1941, Day and Henrietta Lacks were married in [[Halifax County, Virginia]].<ref name="vpbio" /> Later that year, their cousin, Fred Garrett, convinced the couple to leave the tobacco farm in Virginia and move to Maryland where Day Lacks could work at Bethlehem Steel in Sparrow's Point. Not long after they moved to Maryland, Garrett was called to fight in [[World War II]]. With the savings gifted to him by Garrett, Day Lacks was able to purchase a house at 713 New Pittsburgh Avenue in Turner Station. Now part of Dundalk, Turner Station was one of the oldest and largest African-American communities in Baltimore County at that time.<ref name="bcrecord">{{cite web|url=http://resources.baltimorecountymd.gov/Documents/Planning/historic/survey_districts/turners_station.pdf|title=Turner's Station African American Survey District, Dundalk, Baltimore County 1900–1950|publisher=[[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]]|access-date=2012-08-19}}</ref><ref name="aathematic">{{cite web|url=http://resources.baltimorecountymd.gov/Documents/Planning/historic/aathematic.pdf|title=Baltimore county architectural survey African American Thematic Study|publisher=Baltimore County Office of Planning and The Landmarks Preservation Commission|access-date=2012-08-19}}</ref>

Living in Maryland, Henrietta and Day Lacks had three more children: David "Sonny" Lacks Jr. (b. 1947), Deborah Lacks Pullum (born Deborah Lacks; 1949–2009), and Joseph Lacks (1950). Henrietta gave birth to her last child at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore in November 1950, four and a half months before she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.<ref name="vpbio"/> Around the same time, Elsie was placed in the Hospital for the Negro Insane, later renamed [[Crownsville Hospital Center]], where Elsie died in 1955 at the age of 15 years old.<ref name="vpbio"/>

==Illness==

===Diagnosis and treatment===
On January 29, 1951, Lacks went to Johns Hopkins, the only hospital in the area that treated black patients, because she felt a "knot" in her womb.{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=13}} She had previously told her cousins about the "knot" and they assumed correctly that she was pregnant. But after giving birth, Lacks had a severe [[hemorrhage]]. Her primary care doctor tested her for [[syphilis]], which came back negative, and referred her back to Johns Hopkins. There, her doctor, [[Howard W. Jones]], took a [[biopsy]] of a mass found on Lacks' [[cervix]] for laboratory testing. Soon after, Lacks was told that she had a malignant [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|epidermoid carcinoma]] of the cervix.{{efn|[[Squamous cell carcinoma]] is a cancer of the squamous cells, a type of epithelial cell, and is the second most-common type of skin cancer. They are found on the neck, head, cervix, anus as well as other body sites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squamous Cell Carcinoma|url=http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/squamous-cell-carcinoma|publisher=Skin Cancer Foundation|access-date=2016-12-31}}</ref>}}{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=27}} In 1970, physicians discovered that she had been misdiagnosed and actually had an [[adenocarcinoma]].{{efn|[[Adenocarcinoma]]s are a type of cancerous tumor or an abnormal growth of epithelial tissue. 10% to 15% of cancers of the cervix are adenocarcinomas, the rest more commonly being squamous cell carcinomas.<ref name=WCR2014>{{cite book|title=World Cancer Report 2014.|date=2014|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|isbn=978-92-832-0429-9|pages=Chapter 5.3}}</ref>}} This was a common mistake at the time, and the treatment would not have differed.{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=172}}

Lacks was treated with [[brachytherapy|radium tube inserts]] as an inpatient and discharged a few days later with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks' cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous.{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=33}} These samples were given to [[George Otto Gey]], a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the [[HeLa]] [[Cell culture#Concepts in mammalian cell culture|immortal cell line]], a commonly used [[cell line]] in contemporary [[biomedical research]].<ref name="vpbio"/>

===Death and burial===
On August 8, 1951, Lacks, who was 31 years old, went to Johns Hopkins for a routine treatment session and asked to be admitted due to continued severe abdominal pain. She received blood transfusions and remained at the hospital until her death on October 4, 1951.{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=86}} A partial [[autopsy]] showed that the cancer had [[metastasized]] throughout her entire body.<ref name="vpbio"/><ref name="Baltimore City News" />

Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave in the family cemetery in a place called Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given to the land in Clover, Virginia, that was originally owned by slave-owning members of the Lacks family in the [[antebellum South]]. 

Lacks's exact burial location is unknown, but the family believes that it is within a few feet of her mother's grave site, which for decades was the only one in the family to have been marked with a tombstone.<ref name="vpbio"/><ref name="Baltimore City News">{{cite news |first=Van |last=Smith |title=Wonder Woman: The Life, Death, and Life After Death of Henrietta Lacks, Unwitting Heroine of Modern Medical Science|url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814160109/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=3426|archive-date=2004-08-14|newspaper=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |date=2002-04-17 |access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref><ref name=JHM2000>{{cite journal |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/01.html | last=Skloot| first=Rebecca |title=Henrietta's Dance |access-date=2016-10-12 |journal=[[Johns Hopkins Magazine]]|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|date=April 2000}}</ref> In 2010, [[Roland Pattillo]], a faculty member of the [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] who had worked with George Gey and knew the Lacks family,<ref>Skloot, page 231</ref> donated a headstone for Lacks.<ref name="vpbio2"/> This prompted her family to raise money for a headstone for Elsie Lacks as well, which was dedicated on the same day.<ref name=vpbio2/> The book-shaped headstone of Henrietta Lacks contains an epitaph written by her grandchildren that reads:<ref name="vpbio"/>

George Otto Gey, the first researcher to study Lacks's cancerous cells, observed that her cells were unique in that they reproduced at a very high rate and could be kept alive long enough to allow more in-depth examination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=An Obsession With Culture|url=https://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/mar2001/culture.html|publisher=University of Pittsburgh/PITT Magazine|access-date=2016-12-31|date=March 2001|quote=By 1950, when Henrietta Lacks walked into Hopkins Hospital complaining of abnormal bleeding, George and Margaret Gey had spent almost thirty years trying to establish an immortal human cell line. ...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924174222/http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/mar2001/culture.html|archive-date=2018-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> Until then, cells cultured for laboratory studies survived for only a few days at most, which was not long enough to perform a variety of different tests on the same sample. Lacks's cells were the first to be observed that could be divided multiple times without dying, which is why they became known as "immortal". After Lacks's death, Gey had Mary Kubicek, his lab assistant, take further HeLa samples while Henrietta's body was at Johns Hopkins' autopsy facility.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Michael|title=A Conspiracy of Cells: One Woman's Immortal Legacy-And the Medical Scandal It Caused|year=1986|publisher=SUNY Press|page=20}}</ref> The roller-tube technique{{efn|The roller-tube technique was invented by George Gey in his lab at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. "And then there was the roller drum, the invention that churned in the enormous incubator room Gey built to keep the cell cultures warm. The huge metal drum with holes covering its inner surface gyrated like a cement mixer 24 hours a day. And tucked within each hole, at the bottom of Gey's home-blown-glass roller tubes, were tiny pieces of tissue bathed in nutrient-rich fluids, gathering the nourishment necessary for survival. As the drum rotated one turn every hour, the cells surfaced, free to breathe and excrete until the liquid bathed them again. If all went well, the cells adhered to the walls of the tubes and began to flourish." - Rebecca Skloot<br />
This method of growing tissue cultures was also used in the development of Jonas Salk's polio vaccine and by John Enders in his Nobel prize-winning polio research.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=An Obsession With Culture|url=https://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/mar2001/culture.html|publisher=University of Pittsburgh/PITT Magazine|access-date=2016-12-31|date=March 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924174222/http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/mar2001/culture.html|archive-date=2018-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>}} was the method used to culture the cells obtained from the samples that Kubicek collected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lucey|first1=Brendan P.|last2=Nelson-Rees|first2=Walter A.|last3=Hutchins|first3=Grover M.|date=2009-09-01|title=Henrietta Lacks, HeLa Cells, and Cell Culture Contamination|url=http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/10.1043/1543-2165-133.9.1463|journal=[[Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine]]|volume=133|issue=9|pages=1463–1467|doi=10.1043/1543-2165-133.9.1463|pmid=19722756|issn=0003-9985|doi-broken-date=2020-10-17}}</ref> Gey was able to start a cell line from Lacks's sample by isolating one specific cell and repeatedly dividing it, meaning that the same cell could then be used for conducting many experiments. They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey's standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient's first and last names.<ref name="vpbio"/>

The ability to rapidly reproduce HeLa cells in a laboratory setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, [[Jonas Salk]] was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the [[polio vaccine]].<ref name="Baltimore City News"/> To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory.{{sfn|Skloot|2010|p=96}} Additionally, [[Chester M. Southam]], a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe whether cancer could be transmitted as well as to examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|year=2010|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|location=New York|page=128}}</ref>

HeLa cells were in high demand and put into mass production. They were mailed to scientists around the globe for "research into [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], the effects of radiation and toxic substances, [[gene mapping]], and countless other scientific pursuits".<ref name="Baltimore City News"/> HeLa cells were the first human cells successfully cloned in 1955,<ref>^ Puck TT, Marcus PI. A Rapid Method for Viable Cell Titration and Clone Production With Hela Cells In Tissue Culture: The Use of X-Irradiated Cells to Supply Conditioning Factors.

URL: PNASJSTOR</ref> and have since been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products.<ref name="vpbio"/> Since the 1950s, scientists have grown as much as 50 million metric tons of her cells,<ref name="Margonelli">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/books/review/Margonelli-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | title=Eternal Life | work=New York Times | date=2010-02-05| access-date=2014-04-23 | author=Margonelli, Lisa | location=New York}}</ref> and there are almost 11,000 patents involving HeLa cells.<ref name="vpbio"/>

In the early 1970s, a large portion of other cell cultures became contaminated by HeLa cells. As a result, members of Henrietta Lacks's family received solicitations for blood samples from researchers hoping to learn about the family's genetics in order to differentiate between HeLa cells and other cell lines.<ref name=RitterSeattleTimes>{{cite news|last=Ritter|first=Malcolm|title=Feds, family reach deal on use of DNA information|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/feds-family-reach-deal-on-use-of-dna-information/|access-date=2016-12-31|newspaper=[[Seattle Times]]|date=August 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwab|first1=Abraham P.|last2=Baily|first2=Mary Ann|last3=Hirschhorn|first3=Kurt|last4=Rhodes|first4=Rosamond|last5=Trusko|first5=Brett|editor1-last=Rhodes|editor1-first=Rosamond|editor2-last=Gligorov|editor2-first=Nada|editor3-last=Schwab|editor3-first=Abraham Paul|title=The Human Microbiome: Ethical, Legal and Social Concerns|date=2013-08-15|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=98–99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jFX1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|quote=In 1973, researchers at Johns Hopkins contacted Lacks family members and asked them to provide blood samples|isbn=9780199829422}}</ref>

Alarmed and confused, several family members began questioning why they were receiving so many telephone calls requesting blood samples.  In 1975, the family also learned through a chance dinner-party conversation that material originating in Henrietta Lacks was continuing to be used for medical research.<ref name="Baltimore City News"/> The family had never discussed Henrietta's illness and death among themselves in the intervening years but with the increased curiosity about their mother and her genetics, they now began to ask questions.<ref name="vpbio" />

===Consent issues and privacy concerns===
Neither Henrietta Lacks nor her family gave her physicians permission to harvest her cells. At that time, permission was neither required nor customarily sought.<ref>{{citation|last=Washington|first=Harriet|title=Henrietta Lacks: An Unsung Hero|magazine=[[Emerge (magazine)|Emerge Magazine]]|date=October 1994}}</ref> The cells were used in medical research and for commercial purposes.<ref name="Baltimore City News"/><ref name="vpbio"/> In the 1980s, family medical records were published without family consent. A similar issue was brought up in the [[Supreme Court of California]] case of ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' in 1990. The court ruled that a person's discarded tissue and cells are not their property and can be commercialized.{{sfn|Skloot|2010|pages=203–206}}

In March 2013, researchers published the [[DNA]] sequence of the [[genome]] of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author [[Rebecca Skloot]] informed them.<ref name=RitterSeattleTimes/> There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was actually going to be out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line”. That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between the family and the NIH that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/science/after-decades-of-research-henrietta-lacks-family-is-asked-for-consent.html|title=A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2013-08-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-12|quote=The Lacks family and the N.I.H. settled on an agreement: the data from both studies should be stored in the institutes' database of genotypes and phenotypes.

We at Johns Hopkins are profoundly grateful to the Lacks family for their partnership as we continue to learn from Mrs. Lacks’s life and to honor her enduring legacy.” The building will adjoin the Berman Institute of Bioethics’ Deering Hall, located at the corner of Ashland and Rutland Avenues and "will support programs that enhance participation and partnership with members of the community in research that can benefit the community, as well as extend the opportunities to further study and promote research ethics and community engagement in research through an expansion of the Berman Institute and its work."<ref name=":0" />
