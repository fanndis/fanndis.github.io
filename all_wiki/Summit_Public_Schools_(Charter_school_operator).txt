==Summit Learning==
The pedagogy employed at Summit schools, dubbed "Summit Learning," is a personalized, project-based learning (PBL) curriculum that puts students "in charge" of their own learning.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gettingsmart.com/2017/03/summit-olympus-is-placing-learning-in-students-hands/ |title=Summit Olympus is Placing Learning in Students' Hands &#124; Getting Smart Podcast |website=Gettingsmart.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/us/news/breaking-news/mark-zuckerberg-and-his-plan-a-personalized-learning-revolution |title=Mark Zuckerberg and his plan for a personalized learning revolution &#124; News |website=Tes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/inside-silicon-valleys-big-money-push-to-remake-american-education/ |title=Inside Silicon Valley’s Big-Money Push to Remake American Education|website=[[Motherjones.com]]|accessdate=2017-11-04}}</ref>

Courses are built around projects done at students' own paces instead of traditional coursework modules, and teachers focus their energy on tutoring individual students as many grading functions are automated.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=McDermott, John|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/the-flaw-of-averages |title=The flaw of averages |magazine=[[1843 Magazine]]|date=August–September 2017|accessdate=2017-11-27}}</ref>
