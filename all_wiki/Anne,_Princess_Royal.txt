Anne is known for her high-profile charity work, which involves her [[patronage]] of more than 300 organisations – many of which aim to improve transport and health in developing countries, and the well-being and education of children. In her youth, Anne was known for her [[equestrianism]]: she won two silver medals (1975) and one gold medal (1971) at the [[European Eventing Championships]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Senior European Championship Results|work=[[British Eventing]] Governing Body|url=http://www.britisheventing.com/page.asp?section=264&sectionTitle=Senior..|accessdate=15 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211011225/http://www.britisheventing.com/page.asp?section=264&sectionTitle=Senior..|archive-date=11 December 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> She is the first member of the British royal family to have competed in the [[Olympic Games]].

In 1973, Anne married Captain [[Mark Phillips]], but they separated in 1989 and divorced in 1992. The couple have two children, [[Zara Tindall|Zara]] and [[Peter Phillips]], and four grandchildren. Within months of her divorce, Anne married Commander (now Vice Admiral) [[Timothy Laurence|Sir Timothy Laurence]], whom she had met while he served as her mother's [[equerry]] between 1986 and 1989.

At the time of her birth, she was third in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], behind her mother – at that time Princess Elizabeth – and older brother, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]].

A [[governess]], Catherine Peebles, was appointed to look after Anne and was responsible for her early education at Buckingham Palace;<ref name=BuckEarly>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5598.asp|title=HRH The Princess Royal> Early Life and Education|publisher=Buckingham Palace|accessdate=20 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022123243/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5598.asp|archivedate=22 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Peebles also served as early governess for Anne's older brother, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]]. After the death of George VI in February 1952, Anne's mother ascended the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. Given her young age at the time, Anne did not attend [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] in June 1953.

A [[Girl Guides]] company, the [[Girlguiding London and South East England#1st Buckingham Palace Company|1st Buckingham Palace Company]] to include the Holy Trinity Brompton Brownie pack, was re-formed in May 1959, specifically so that, as her mother and aunt had done as children, Anne could socialise with girls her own age.
