Although '''Internet censorship in Germany''' has traditionally been rated as low, it is practised directly and indirectly through various laws and court decisions.<ref name=ONICountryProfiles>[http://opennet.net/research/profiles "ONI Country Profiles"], Research section at the OpenNet Initiative web site, a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group, Ottawa</ref> German law provides for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]] with several exceptions, including what ''[[The Guardian]]'' has called "some of the world's toughest laws around [[hate speech]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/05/tough-new-german-law-puts-tech-firms-and-free-speech-in-spotlight|title=Tough new German law puts tech firms and free speech in spotlight|first=Philip|last=Oltermann|work=The Guardian|date=2018-01-05|accessdate=2018-06-09}}</ref> An example of content censored by law is the [[Censorship by Google#Germany and France|removal of web sites from Google search results]] that [[Holocaust Denial|deny the holocaust]], which is a [[felony]] under German law. According to the Google Transparency Report, the German government is frequently one of the most active in requesting user data after the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/362711-top-google-user-data-requests/|title=US, Germany, France top Google Transparency Report user data requests|publisher=RT|date=2016-10-14|accessdate=2018-06-09}}</ref>

Most cases of Internet censorship in Germany occur after [[Judiciary of Germany|state court]] rulings. One example is a 2009 court order, forbidding German Wikipedia to disclose the identity of [[Wolfgang Werlé and Manfred Lauber]], two criminals convicted of the murder of the Bavarian actor [[Walter Sedlmayr]]. In another case, Wikipedia.de (an Internet domain run by [[Wikimedia Deutschland]]) was prohibited from pointing to the actual Wikipedia content. The court order was as a temporary injunction in a case filed by politician [[Lutz Heilmann]] over claims in a German Wikipedia article regarding his past involvement with the former [[German Democratic Republic]]'s intelligence service [[Stasi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/5928 |title=German Court Orders to Block Wikipedia.de Due to Offending Article |author=Efroni, Zohar |work=Center for Internet and Society Blog |publisher=Stanford University Law School |date=16 November 2008 |accessdate=18 March 2010 }}</ref>

The first known case of Internet censorship in Germany occurred in 1996, when the [[Deutsches Forschungsnetz|Verein zur Förderung eines Deutschen Forschungsnetzes]] banned some IP addresses from [[Internet access]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/archiv/Medien/Zeitschriften/radikal/netzzensur/|title=Der Versuch einer Zensur im Internet|date=1997-04-23|accessdate=2018-06-05|language=de}}</ref>

==Relevant laws==
===Access Impediment Act===
In June 2009, the [[Bundestag]] passed the ''Access Impediment Act'' or [[Zugangserschwerungsgesetz]]<ref>Gesetz zur Erschwerung des Zugangs zu kinderpornographischen Inhalten in Kommunikationsnetzen {{in lang|de}} (Act for impeding access to child pornography content in communications networks).</ref> that introduced [[Internet blocking]] of sites found to distribute [[child pornography]].<ref>[http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=298564.html "Kabinett beschließt Netzsperren gegen Kinderpornos"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425145933/http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=298564.html |date=2009-04-25 }} {{in lang|de}} (Cabinet approves blocking against child pornography), Pressestelle Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie (Press Office Federal Ministry for Economics and Technology), 22 April 2009.

In talks between the new governing parties CDU and FDP, it was agreed that no blocking would be implemented for one year, focusing on take-down efforts instead. After one year the success of the deletion policy would be reviewed.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4794080,00.html "New German government reaches key internet security agreements"], Neil King, Deutsche Welle, 15 October 2009.</ref> The governing parties ultimately decided in April 2011 to repeal the law altogether.<ref>[https://edri.org/edrigramnumber9-7germany-internet-blocking-law/ German Internet blocking law to be withdrawn], EDRi-gram newsletter, [[European Digital Rights]], 6 April 2011.</ref>

===Ancillary copyright for press publishers===
{{main|Ancillary copyright for press publishers}}
After lobbying efforts by news publishers which began in 2009, the Bundesrat considered a law preventing search results from returning excerpts from news sites unless the search engine has paid a license for them. It passed in 2013 and was widely interpreted as an attempt to have [[Google]] subsidize German news.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theeuropean-magazine.com/till-kreutzer--2/7547-google-and-the-ancillary-copyright|title=Two front battle|publisher=The European|date=2013-10-19|accessdate=2018-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142118/https://www.theeuropean-magazine.com/till-kreutzer--2/7547-google-and-the-ancillary-copyright|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchengineland.com/german-ancillary-copyright-to-go-into-effect-imposes-limits-on-search-results-159843|title=German "Ancillary Copyright" Law To Go Into Effect, Imposes Limits On Search Results|first=Greg|last=Sterling|publisher=Search Engine Land|date=2013-05-16|accessdate=2018-06-07}}</ref> In response, Google modified search to only display headlines for certain sites. The publishing collective VG Media claimed in an unsuccessful lawsuit that removing the snippets rather than licensing them was an [[antitrust]] violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150922/09034032327/german-competition-authority-decides-to-take-no-action-over-googles-removal-snippets-google-news.shtml|first=Glyn|last=Moody|publisher=TechDirt|title=German Competition Authority Decides To Take No Action Over Google's Removal Of Snippets From Google News|date=2015-09-24|accessdate=2018-06-07}}</ref> Other supporters of the bill, including [[Axel Springer]], saw an overall decrease in their readership following its passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/24/eu-ancillary-copyright/|title=EU lawmakers are still considering this failed copyright idea|first=David|last=Meyer|publisher=Fortune|date=2016-03-24|accessdate=2018-06-07}}</ref>

===Network Enforcement Act===
The [[Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz]] or NetzDG was passed in June 2017 as a measure to require social media companies in Germany to censor extremism online, with significant [[hate speech]] provisions as well.<ref name="yale">{{cite web|url=https://law.yale.edu/mfia/case-disclosed/germanys-netzdg-and-threat-online-free-speech|title=Germany's NetzDG and the threat to online free speech|first=Diana|last=Lee|publisher=Yale Law School|date=2017-10-10|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> The law, which applies to for-profit websites with over 2 million users, demands the removal of offensive illegal content within 24 hours and allows for one week to review "more legally ambiguous content".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aicgs.org/2018/01/a-new-responsibility-for-internet-platforms-germanys-new-hate-speech-law/|title=A new responsibility for Internet platforms: Germany's new hate speech law|first=Mikayla|last=Appell|publisher=American Institute for Contemporary German Studies|date=2018-01-23|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> It was authored by [[Heiko Maas]] and went into full effect in January 2018.

Critics have questioned the feasibility of fining companies €50 million for failing to comply, and pointed to hundreds of new German content moderators hired by Facebook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/twitter-facebook-youtube-fake-news-hate-speech-germany-767337|title=Hate speech is going to cost Facebook and Twitter a fortune in 2018|first=Carlos|last=Ballesteros|publisher=Newsweek|date=2018-01-01|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> A report testing the amount of illegal content that could be removed within 24 hours found figures of 90% for [[YouTube]], 39% for [[Facebook]] and 1% for [[Twitter]].<ref name="politico">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-hate-speech-netzdg-facebook-youtube-google-twitter-free-speech/|title=Free speech vs censorship in Germany|publisher=Politico|first1=Mark|last1=Scott|first2=Janosch|last2=Delcker|date=2018-01-14|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> Purveyors of [[satire]] also criticized the law after the magazine ''[[Titanic (magazine)|Titanic]]'' and the comedian Sophie Passmann were both suspended from Twitter after attempting to mock anti-Muslim rhetoric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/germany-and-the-perils-of-online-censorship/21324#.WxseHTcpDxg|title=Germany and the perils of online censorship|first=Steve|last=Bremner|publisher=Spiked Online|date=2018-04-26|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> The [[United Nations special rapporteur]] on freedom of expression [[David Kaye (law professor)|David Kaye]] expressed a fear that NetzDG would lead to overly restrictive blocking and Cathleen Berger of [[Mozilla]] found evidence that it was inspiring other countries to do the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2018/01/as-german-hate-speech-law-sinks-titanics-twitter-p.php|first=Attila|last=Mong|title=As German hate speech law sinks Titanic's Twitter post, critics warn new powers go too far|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=2018-01-23|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> Some victims of harassment campaigns have supported increased restrictions and stated "I don't mind if other comments get deleted along with the bad ones."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41042266|title=Will Germany's new law kill free speech online?|first=Patrick|last=Evans|publisher=BBC|date=2017-09-18|accessdate=2018-06-05}}</ref>

Opposition politicians including [[Nicola Beer]] of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], [[Simone Peter]] of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Green Party]] and [[Sahra Wagenknecht]] of [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], have criticized the idea of putting decisions about online discourse in the hands of American companies, with the latter calling it "a slap in the face of all democratic principles".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-opposition-parties-call-to-replace-online-hate-speech-law/a-42058030|title=German opposition parties call to replace online hate speech law|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref> In what has been called the "first test case" of NetzDG, a German Internet user sued Facebook for deleting a post that was critical of Germany. In April 2018, the court obtained an injunction ordering that the comment be restored.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/german-court-facebook-censorship-910635|title=German court overturns Facebook 'censorship'|first1=Christof|last1=Kerkmann|first2=Johannes|last2=Steger|publisher=Handelsblatt|date=2018-04-13|accessdate=2018-06-08}}</ref>
