'''Sadiq Aman Khan''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|d|iː|k|_|ˈ|k|ɑː|n}}; born 8 October 1970) is a British politician serving as [[Mayor of London]] since 2016. He previously was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Tooting]] from 2005 until 2016. A member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Khan is on the party's [[soft left]] and has been ideologically characterised as a [[Social democracy|social democrat]]. 

Born in [[Tooting]], South London, to a working-class [[British Pakistanis|British Pakistani]] family with roots in modern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], Khan earned a law degree from the [[University of North London]]. He subsequently worked as a solicitor specialising in human rights issues and chaired the [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] advocacy group for three years. Joining the Labour Party, Khan was a [[Councillor]] for the [[London Borough of Wandsworth]] from 1994 to 2006 before being elected MP for [[Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Tooting]] at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. Under Labour Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], Khan was appointed [[Department for Communities and Local Government|Minister of State for Communities]] in 2008, later becoming [[Minister of State for Transport]]. A key ally of the next Labour leader, [[Ed Miliband]], he served in [[Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband|Miliband's Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Justice]], [[Shadow Lord Chancellor]] and [[Minister for London|Shadow Minister for London]].

As the [[London Labour Party|London Labour]] candidate, Khan was elected Mayor of London at the [[2016 London mayoral election|2016 mayoral election]], defeating [[London Conservatives]] rival [[Zac Goldsmith]] and then resigning as an MP. In office, he froze some [[Transport for London]] (TfL) fares{{efn|For [[London Buses|bus]], [[Tramlink|tram]] and single pay-as-you-go [[London Underground|Tube]] and [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]] travel}} until he offered [[HM Government]] a 1% above-inflation fare rise in return for a £1.6bn bailout for TfL amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic in London|COVID-19 pandemic]], introduced the Hopper fare for unlimited bus and tram journeys for an hour, the Toxicity Charge (T-Charge) on older and more polluting vehicles,<ref name="t-charge">{{cite web|author=Chapman, Ben |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/t-charge-what-is-it-london-emissions-charge-how-affect-will-pay-congestion-car-diesel-a8014976.html |title=T-charge: What is the new London emissions charge and how will it affect you? |work=The Independent |date=23 October 2017 |accessdate=18 January 2020}}</ref> and the 24/7 [[Ultra Low Emission Zone]] (ULEZ) fee on all but the cleanest vehicles in [[Central London]],<ref name="ulez">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/06/london-prepares-for-launch-of-ultra-low-emissions-zone|website=The Guardian|title=London prepares for launch of ultra-low emissions zone|date=6 April 2019|accessdate=18 January 2020|last=Topham|first=Gwyn}}</ref> and backed expansion at [[London City Airport]] and [[Gatwick Airport]]. He was a vocal supporter of the unsuccessful [[Britain Stronger in Europe]] and [[People's Vote]]{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} campaigns for [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the UK to remain]] in the [[European Union]] and a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|second referendum]] on [[Brexit]], respectively. As well as having a strained relationship with former Labour leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]], whose socialist platform Khan thought unelectable, he attracted international attention for his [[Twitter]] arguments with United States President [[Donald Trump]]. Khan claims "Trump 'singled out' me because of my faith."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=trump-singled-out-me-because-of-my-faith-london-mayor-says|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/trump-singled-out-me-because-of-my-faith-london-mayor-says/2037575|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=aa.com}}</ref>

A teacher recommended that he read law instead, as he had an argumentative personality. The teacher's suggestion, along with the American television programme ''[[L.A.

He read Law at the [[University of North London]] (now [[London Metropolitan University]]).<ref name="pugilist"/> His parents later moved out of their council flat and purchased their own home.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=15}} Like his brothers, Khan was a fan of sport, particularly enjoying football, cricket, and boxing.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=15}}

From his earliest years, Khan worked: "I was surrounded by my mum and dad working all the time, so as soon as I could get a job, I got a job. I got a paper round, a Saturday job—some summers I laboured on a building site."<ref name="pugilist"/> The family continues to send money to relatives in Pakistan, "because we're blessed being in this country."

==Parliamentary career==
===First term: 2005–2010===
[[File:Sadiq Khan, September 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Sadiq Khan in 2009]]
Before entering Parliament, Khan represented [[Tooting]] as a councillor on [[Wandsworth London Borough Council|Wandsworth Council]] from 1994 to 2006, and was granted the title of [[Title of honor|Honorary]] [[Alderman]] of [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] upon his retirement from local politics.<ref>[http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/sadiq-aman-khan http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/sadiq-aman-khan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604043218/http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/sadiq-aman-khan |date=4 June 2016 }}, politics</ref>

In 2003, [[Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Tooting]] [[Constituency Labour Party]] decided to open its parliamentary selection to all interested candidates, including the incumbent MP since 1974, [[Tom Cox (British politician)|Tom Cox]]. This prompted Cox, then in his mid-70s, to announce his retirement rather than risk de-selection. In the subsequent selection contest, Khan defeated five other local candidates to become Labour's candidate for the seat. He was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]].

Khan was one of the Labour MPs who led the successful opposition to Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s proposed introduction of 90 days' detention without charge for those suspected of terrorism offences.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=20}} In recognition of this, ''[[The Spectator]]''—a right-wing magazine then edited by [[Boris Johnson]]—awarded him the "Newcomer of the Year Award" at the 2005 Parliamentarian of the Year Awards.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=20}} The magazine's editorial board stated that he had received the award "for the tough-mindedness and clarity with which he has spoken about the very difficult issues of Islamic terror".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/14489/part_2/parliamentarian-of-the-year.thtml?SelectedIssueDate=19%20November%202005 |date=19 November 2005 |title=Parliamentarian of the Year |work=[[The Spectator]] |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616124012/http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/14489/part_2/parliamentarian-of-the-year.thtml?SelectedIssueDate=19%20November%202005 |url-status=dead |archivedate=16 June 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> In August 2006, he was a signatory of an open letter to [[Tony Blair]] that was signed by prominent Muslims and published in ''[[The Guardian]]''. The letter criticised [[Foreign policy of the United Kingdom|UK foreign policy]] and in particular the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stating that Blair's policies had caused great harm to civilians in the Middle East and provided "ammunition to extremists who threaten us all".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Minister criticises Muslim letter |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4787119.stm |date=12 August 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |work=[[BBC News]] |archivedate=8 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108143352/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4787119.stm |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

Khan had to repay £500 in [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|expenses]] in 2007 in relation to a newsletter sent to constituents featuring a 'Labour rose', which was deemed to be unduly prominent. While the content of the newsletter was not deemed to be party political, the rose logo was found to be unduly prominent which may have had the effect of promoting a political party. There was no suggestion that Khan had deliberately or dishonestly compiled his [[Expense management|expenses claims]], which were not explicitly disallowed under the rules at that time. The rules were retrospectively changed disallowing the claim, which had previously been approved by the House of Commons authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/182/182.pdf|title=Microsoft Word – Baker-Bruce-Khan – CRC Rep.doc|accessdate=7 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013064730/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/182/182.pdf|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7142779.stm |title=Minister's rose emblem broke rule |work=BBC News |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=15 December 2010 |url-status=live |archivedate=17 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017175350/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7142779.stm |df=dmy }}</ref>

The Home Secretary, [[Jacqui Smith]], then announced a further policy review and said the bugging of discussions between MPs and their constituents should be banned.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/22/uksecurity.police?gusrc=rss&feed=uknews |title=Bugging of MP on prison visit did not break the rules, inquiry finds |first=Vikram |last=Dodd |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2009 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831203539/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/22/uksecurity.police?gusrc=rss&feed=uknews |archivedate=31 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In June 2007, Blair stood down as both Prime Minister and Labour Party leader, to be replaced by [[Gordon Brown]]. Brown thought highly of Khan, who moved up the parliamentary ranks under Brown's Premiership.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}} Brown made Khan a party whip, who was therefore charged with ensuring that Labour-sponsored legislation made it through the parliamentary process to become law.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}} In July 2008, Khan helped push through a government proposal to permit the detention of those suspected of terror offenses for 42 days without charge.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}} For his part in this, Khan was criticised by Liberty's [[Shami Chakrabarti]] and others, who claimed that Khan had contravened his principles on civil liberties issues.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}}

In 2008, the [[Fabian Society]] published Khan's book, ''Fairness Not Favours''. In this work, Khan argued that the Labour Party had to reconnect with British Muslims, arguing that it had lost the trust of this community as a result of the [[Iraq War]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=27–28}} He also said that British Muslims had their own part to play in reconnecting with politicians, arguing that they needed to rid themselves of a [[victim mentality]] and take greater responsibility for their own community.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=28}} In the House of Commons in January 2009, Khan criticised [[Pope Benedict XVI]] for the rehabilitation of [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Bishop Richard Williamson]] following his remarks about [[the Holocaust]], a move he described as "highly unsavoury" and of "great concern".<ref>{{cite web|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/4388359/Minister-criticises-Pope-for-pardoning-Holocaust-denial-bishop.html |title=Minister criticises Pope for pardoning Holocaust denial bishop |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114024511/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/4388359/Minister-criticises-Pope-for-pardoning-Holocaust-denial-bishop.html |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>
