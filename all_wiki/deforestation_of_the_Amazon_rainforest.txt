The [[Amazon rainforest]] is the largest [[rainforest]] in the world, covering an area of {{convert|5,500,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It represents over half of the planet's rainforests, and comprises the largest and most [[biodiverse]] tract of [[tropical rainforest]] in the world. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained [[Brazilian Amazon|within Brazil]], with 60%, followed by [[Peruvian Amazon|Peru]] with 13%, [[Amazon Region of Colombia|Colombia]] with 10%, and with minor amounts in [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[France]] ([[French Guiana]]).

More than one-third of the Amazon forest belongs to more than 3,344 formally acknowledged [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]]. Until 2015, only 8% of Amazonian deforestation occurred in forests inhabited by indigenous peoples, while 88% of occurred in the less than 50% of the Amazon area that is neither indigenous territory nor protected area. Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines. The forest is also interconnected with their identity and cosmology. For this reason the deforestation rates are lower in indigenous territories, despite pressures encouraging deforestation being stronger.<ref name=":0" />

According to 2018 satellite data compiled by a deforestation monitoring program called Prodes, deforestation has hit its highest rate in a decade. About 7,900 km<sup>2</sup> (3,050 sq miles) of the rainforest was destroyed between August 2017 and July 2018. Most of the deforestation occurred in the states of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Pará]]. [[The BBC]] reported the environment minister, Edson Duarte, as saying illegal logging was to blame, but critics suggest expanding agriculture is also encroaching on the rainforest.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46327634|title=Amazon deforestation 'worst in 10 years'|date=2018-11-24|access-date=2019-05-10|language=en-GB}}</ref> It is suggested that at some point the forest will reach a tipping point, where it will no longer be able to produce enough rainfall to sustain itself.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Lovejoy|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Nobre|first2=Carlos|date=2019-12-20|title=Amazon tipping point: Last chance for action|journal=Science Advances|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=eaba2949|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aba2949|issn=2375-2548|doi-access=free|pmid=32064324|pmc=6989302}}</ref>

==History==
In the [[pre-Columbian era]], parts of the Amazon rainforest were densely populated regions with open agriculture. After the European colonization occurred in the 16th century due to the hunt for [[gold]] and later the [[rubber]] boom, the Amazon rainforest was depopulated due to [[Columbian exchange#Disease|European diseases]] and [[Slavery in South America|slavery]], so the forest grew larger.<ref>{{cite news | first=Romero | last=Simon | date=January 14, 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html | title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon's Lost World | work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

In parts of the Amazon, the poor soil made plantation-based agriculture unprofitable. The key turning point in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon was when colonists began to establish farms within the forest during the 1960s. Their farming system was based on crop cultivation and the [[slash-and-burn]] method. However, the colonists were unable to successfully manage their fields and the crops due to the loss of [[soil fertility]] and [[weed]] invasion due to this method.<ref name=watkins_griffiths>Watkins and Griffiths, J.

As of January 2019, the president of Brazil – [[Jair Bolsonaro]] – has made an executive order that allows the agriculture ministry to oversee some of the land in the Amazon.<ref name="Phillips">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/02/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-amazon-rainforest-protections|title=Jair Bolsonaro Launches Assault on Amazon Rainforest Protections|last=Phillips|first=Dom|date=January 2, 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Cattle ranchers and mining companies favor the president's decision. The Brazilian economic policy is influencing the government to condone development on tribal territory in order to accumulate exports and increase economic growth. That has been criticized because taking away tribal land will endanger the indigenous people who live there now. The deforestation of the Amazon leads the acceleration of [[climate change]].

Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest can be attributed to many different factors at local, national, and international levels. The rainforest is seen as a resource for cattle pasture, valuable hardwoods, housing space, farming space (especially for soybeans), road works (such as highways and smaller roads), medicines and human gain. Trees are usually cut down illegally.

A 2004 [[World Bank]] paper and a 2009 Greenpeace report found that the [[cattle]] sector in the Brazilian Amazon, supported by the international [[beef]] and [[leather]] trades, was responsible for about 80% of all deforestation in the region,<ref name="Liotta" /><ref name="cattle1" /> or about 14% of the world's total annual deforestation, making it the largest single driver of deforestation in the world.<ref name="slaughtering" /> According to a 2006 report by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], 70% of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock [[ranch|pasture]].<ref name="fao" /><ref>{{cite book

Additional deforestation in the Amazon has resulted from farmers clearing land for small-scale [[subsistence agriculture]]<ref name="subsistence" /> or for mechanized [[farm|cropland]]. Scientists using [[NASA]] satellite data found in 2006 that clearing for mechanized cropland had become a significant force in Brazilian Amazon deforestation. This change in land use may alter the region's climate. Researchers found that in 2004, a peak year of deforestation, more than 20 percent of the [[Mato Grosso]] state's forests were converted to cropland.<ref name="nasa"/> In 2005, soybean prices fell by more than 25 percent and some areas of Mato Grosso showed a decrease in large deforestation events, suggesting that the rise and fall of prices for other crops, beef and timber may also have a significant impact on future land use in the region.<ref name="nasa" />

Until 2006, a major driver of forest loss in the Amazon was the cultivation of [[soybean|soy]], mainly for export and production of [[Biodiesel by region#Brazil|biodiesel]] and [[animal feed]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0516-ethanol_amazon.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713153639/http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0516-ethanol_amazon.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |title=U.S. ethanol may drive Amazon deforestation |publisher=mongabay.com |date=May 17, 2007 |access-date=October 29, 2009 }}</ref> as soybean prices have risen, soy farmers pushed northwards into forested areas of the Amazon.<ref name="soy1">Kelly April Tyrrell (January 22, 2015). [http://news.wisc.edu/23435 "Study shows Brazil's Soy Moratorium still needed to preserve Amazon"]. '' the University of Wisconsin-Madison News''. Retrieved on October 21, 2015.</ref> However, a private sector agreement referred to as the Soy Moratorium has helped drastically reduce the deforestation linked to soy production in the region. In 2006, a number of major commodity trading companies such as [[Cargill]] agreed to not purchase soybeans produced in the Brazilian Amazon in recently deforested areas. Before the moratorium, 30 percent of soy field expansion had occurred through deforestation, contributing to record deforestation rates. After eight years of the moratorium, a 2015 study found that although soy production area had expanded another 1.3 million hectares, only about 1 percent of the new soy expansion had come at the expense of forest. In response to the moratorium, farmers were choosing to plant on already cleared land.<ref name="soy1"/>
The needs of soy farmers have been used to validate some controversial transportation projects that have developed in the Amazon.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> The first two highways, the [[Rodovia Belém-Brasília|Belém-Brasília]] (1958) and the Cuiaba-Porto Velho (1968), were the only federal highways in the [[Amazônia Legal|Legal Amazon]] to be paved and passable year-round before the late 1990s. These two highways are said to be "at the heart of the 'arc of deforestation'", which at present is the focal point area of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The Belém-Brasília highway attracted nearly two million settlers in the first twenty years. The success of the Belém-Brasília highway in opening up the forest was reenacted as paved roads continued to be developed, unleashing the irrepressible spread of settlement. The completion of the roads was followed by a wave of resettlement; these settlers had a significant effect on the forest as well.<ref name="autogenerated2">Williams, M. (2006). Deforesting the Earth: From Prehistory to Global Crisis. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press.</ref>

A 2013 paper found that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. Thus for Brazil as a whole, there is no economic gain to be made by logging and selling trees and using the logged land for pastoral purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whrc.org/news/pressroom/PR-2013-Coe-IOP-ERL_No-win_situation_for_agricultural_expansion_in_the_Amazon.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130803160638/http://www.whrc.org/news/pressroom/PR-2013-Coe-IOP-ERL_No-win_situation_for_agricultural_expansion_in_the_Amazon.html|url-status=dead|title=Research paper of Leydimere Oliveira on the Amazon|archive-date=August 3, 2013}}</ref>

In Brazil, the [[Brazilian National Institute for Space Research|Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais]] (INPE, or National Institute of Space Research) produces deforestation figures annually. Their deforestation estimates are derived from 100 to 220 images taken during the dry season in the Amazon by the [[Landsat program|Landsat]] satellite, and may only consider the loss of the Amazon rainforest – not the loss of natural fields or savannah within the [[Amazon biome]].<ref name="INPE 2005">National Institute for Space Research (INPE) (2005). The INPE deforestation figures for Brazil were cited on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060908011424/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/latin_america_and_caribbean/where/amazon/problems/amazon_deforestation/index.cfm WWF website] in April 2006.</ref>

[[File:Terra Indígena Porquinhos, Maranhão (25758143568).jpg|thumb|Amazon rainforest fire in Brazil's [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territory]] in 2017]]
Deforestation and loss of biodiversity have led to high risks of irreversible changes to the Amazon's tropical forests. It has been suggested by modelling studies that the deforestation may be approaching a "[[Tipping points in the climate system|tipping point]]", after which large-scale "[[Savannah|savannization]]" or [[desertification]] of the Amazon will take place, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate, due to a self-perpetuating collapse of the region's biodiversity and [[ecosystem]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=A.

In order to retain high biodiversity, research supports a threshold of 40% forest cover in the Amazon.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Biodiversity loss along a gradient of deforestation in Amazonian agricultural landscapes| journal=Conservation Biology| volume=32| issue=6| pages=1380–1391| date=December 2018| doi=10.1111/cobi.13206| pmid=30113727| last1=Decaëns| first1=Thibaud| last2=Martins| first2=Marlúcia B.| last3=Feijoo| first3=Alexander| last4=Oszwald| first4=Johan| last5=Dolédec| first5=Sylvain| last6=Mathieu| first6=Jérôme| last7=Arnaud De Sartre| first7=Xavier| last8=Bonilla| first8=Diego| last9=Brown| first9=George G.| last10=Cuellar Criollo| first10=Yeimmy Andrea| last11=Dubs| first11=Florence| last12=Furtado| first12=Ivaneide S.| last13=Gond| first13=Valérie| last14=Gordillo| first14=Erika| last15=Le Clec'h| first15=Solen| last16=Marichal| first16=Raphaël| last17=Mitja| first17=Danielle| last18=De Souza| first18=Izildinha Miranda| last19=Praxedes| first19=Catarina| last20=Rougerie| first20=Rodolphe| last21=Ruiz| first21=Darío H.| last22=Otero| first22=Joel Tupac| last23=Sanabria| first23=Catalina| last24=Velasquez| first24=Alex| last25=Zararte| first25=Luz Elena M.| last26=Lavelle| first26=Patrick| s2cid=52011503}}</ref>

=== Impacts on water supply ===
The deforestation of the Amazon rainforest has had a significant negative impact on Brazil's freshwater supply, harming, among others, the [[agriculture in Brazil|agricultural industry]] that has contributed to the clearing of the forests. In 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in more than a century.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/oct2005/2005-10-24-05.html| title=Amazon Drought Worst in 100 Years| journal=ENS Newswire| date=24 October 2005| access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref> This has been the result of two factors:

1. The rainforest provides much of the [[rainfall]] in Brazil, even in areas far from it. Deforestation increased the impacts of the droughts of 2005, 2010, and 2015–2016.<ref name="NGeo">{{cite journal |last1=Welch |first1=Craig |title=How Amazon forest loss may affect water—and climate—far away |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/11/how-cutting-the-amazon-forest-could-affect-weather/ |journal=National Geographic Magazine | date=19 November 2018 | access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="trees">{{cite journal |last1=Loomis |first1=Ilima |title=Trees in the Amazon make their own rain |journal=Science |date=August 4, 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aan7209 |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/trees-amazon-make-their-own-rain |access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref>

2. The rainforest, by inducing rainfall and helping with water storage, provides freshwater to the rivers that give water to Brazil and other countries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Joe |last2=Sanchez |first2=Erica |title=World's Water Could Become Scarce if the Amazon Rainforest Is Destroyed |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/amazon-rainforest-water-crisis/ |website=Global Citizen |access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Christina |last2=Savarese |first2=Mauricio |title=Scientists warn new Brazil president may smother rainforest |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-11-scientists-brazil-smother-rainforest.html |website=Fhys.org |publisher=Science X Network |access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref>

=== Impact on local temperature ===
In 2019, a group of scientists published research suggesting that in a "business as usual" scenario, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest will raise the temperature in Brazil by 1.45 degrees. They wrote: "Increased temperatures in already hot locations may increase [[Mortality rate|human mortality rates]] and [[electricity demand]]s, reduce [[agricultural yield]]s and [[water resources]], and contribute to [[Biodiversity|biodiversity collapse]], particularly in tropical regions. Furthermore, local warming may cause shifts in species distributions, including for species involved in [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease transmissions]]." The authors of the paper say that deforestation is already causing a rise in the temperature.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=A. Prevedello |first1=Jayme |last2=R. Winck |first2=Gisele |last3=M.

===Impact on indigenous people===
{{See also|Genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil}}

More than one-third of the Amazon forest belongs to over 4,466 formally acknowledged Indigenous Territories. Until 2015, only eight percent of Amazonian deforestation occurred in forests inhabited by indigenous peoples, while 88% occurred in the less than 50% of the Amazon area that is neither indigenous territory nor protected area. Historically, the livelihoods of indigenous Amazonian peoples have depended on the forest for food, shelter, water, fibre, fuel and medicines. The forest is also interconnected with their identity and cosmology. For this reason, the deforestation rates are lower in Indigenous Territories, despite pressures encouraging deforestation being stronger.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last1=Josse |first1=Carmen |title=Indigenous peoples are key stakeholders |url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/indispensable-role-local-communities-protection-amazonian-forests |website=D+C, Development and cooperation}}</ref>

The native tribes of the Amazon have often been abused during the Amazon's deforestation. Loggers have killed natives and encroached onto their land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/3433 |title=Uncontacted Indians killed by loggers |work=Survival International |access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref> Many [[uncontacted peoples]] have come out of the jungles to mingle with mainstream society after threats from outsiders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/27/world/cnnphotos-awa-guaja/ |title=Amazon tribe under threat |work=CNN |access-date=January 27, 2015}}</ref> Uncontacted peoples making [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] with outsiders are susceptible to diseases to which they have little immunity.

For many years, there has been a battle to conquer the territories that indigenous people live on in the Amazon, primarily from the Brazilian government. The demand for this land has originated partly from a desire to improve Brazil's economic status. Many people, including ranchers and land swindlers from the southeast, have wanted to claim the land for their own financial gain. As of the beginning of 2019, the new president of Brazil, [[Jair Bolsonaro]], has made an executive order that permits the agriculture ministry to regulate the land that tribal members inhabit in the Amazon. This act is essentially declaring war on the indigenous people in the fight for their territory.<ref name="Phillips"/>

In the past, mining locations were allowed to be constructed in the territory of an isolated tribal group called [[Yanomami]]. Because of the conditions that these indigenous people were subjected to, many of them developed health problems, including [[tuberculosis]]. If their land is used for new development, many of the tribal groups will be forced out of their homes and many may die. On top of the mistreatment of these people, the forest itself will be taken advantage of and many of the indigenous peoples' resources for daily life will be stripped from them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/brazilian|title=The Brazilian Indians|date=2019|website=Survival}}</ref>

Norwegian prime minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] announced on September 16, 2008, that Norway's government would donate US$1 billion to the newly established Amazon fund. The money from this fund would go to projects aimed at slowing down the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.<ref>[http://thenorwaymail.blogspot.com/2008/09/nok-58-billion-to-amazon-fund.html "NOK 5.8 billion to the Amazon fund"]. ''The Norwegian Mail''. September 17, 2008.</ref>

In September 2015, Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]] told the United Nations that Brazil had effectively reduced the rate of deforestation in the Amazon by 82 percent. She also announced that over the next 15 years, Brazil aimed to eliminate illegal deforestation, restore and reforest {{convert|120,000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and recover {{convert|150,000|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} of degraded pastures.<ref>Megan Rowling (September 30, 2015).
