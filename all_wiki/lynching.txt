'''Lynching''' is an [[extrajudicial killing]] by a group. It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor, punish a convicted transgressor, or intimidate. It can also be an extreme form of informal group social control, and it is often conducted with the display of a public spectacle (often in the form of hanging) for maximum intimidation.<ref>{{cite book | title=Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874–1947 | publisher=North Carolina University Press | author=Wood, Amy Louise | year=2009 | isbn=9780807878118|oclc = 701719807}}</ref> Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in every society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Manfred|last2=Wendt|first2=Simon|date=2011|title=Globalizing Lynching History: Vigilantism and Extralegal Punishment from an International Perspective|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-11588-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/globali_xxx_2011_00_2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Vigilantism and the state in modern Latin America : essays on extralegal violence | publisher=Praeger | author=Huggins, Martha Knisely | year=1991 | location=New York | isbn=0275934764|oclc = 22984858}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Lynching : American mob murder in global perspective | publisher=Ashgate | author=Thurston, Robert W. | year=2011 | location=Burlington, VT | isbn=9781409409083|oclc = 657223792}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The origins of the word ''lynch'' are obscure, but it likely originated during the [[American Revolution]]. The verb comes from the phrase ''Lynch Law'', a term for a [[Extrajudicial punishment|punishment without trial]]. Two Americans during this era are generally credited for coining the phrase: [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]] (1736–1796) and [[William Lynch (Lynch law)|William Lynch]] (1742–1820), both of whom lived in Virginia in the 1780s. Charles Lynch is more likely to have coined the phrase, as he was known to have used the term in 1782, while William Lynch is not known to have used the term until much later. There is no evidence that death was imposed as a punishment by either of the two men.<ref name=quinion>{{cite web |title=Lynch |author=Michael Quinion |work=World Wide Words |date=December 20, 2008 |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-lyn1.htm |access-date=August 13, 2014}}</ref>  In 1782, Charles Lynch wrote that his assistant had administered Lynch's law to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]] "for Dealing with the [[negro]]es &c".<ref name =EAAH1>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2006 |title=Lynching and Mob Violence |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History 1619–1895 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |last=Waldrep |first=Christopher |editor-last=Finkelman  |editor-first=Paul |volume=2 |page=308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCMbE4KKlX4C&q=lynch|isbn=9780195167771 }}</ref>

Charles Lynch was a Virginia [[Quakers|Quaker]],<ref name=" Cutler, James E. 1905">{{cite book |title=Lynch-law: An Investigation Into the History of Lynching in the United States |url=https://archive.org/details/lynchlawaninves03cutlgoog |first=James Elbert |last=Cutler |publisher=Longmans Green and Co. |year=1905}}</ref>{{rp|23''ff''}} planter, and American Revolutionary who headed a county court in Virginia which imprisoned Loyalist supporters of the British for up to one year during the war. Although he lacked proper jurisdiction for detaining these persons, he claimed this right by arguing wartime necessity. Subsequently, he prevailed upon his friends in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] to pass a law that exonerated him and his associates from wrongdoing. He was concerned that he might face legal action from one or more of those he had imprisoned, notwithstanding the American Colonies had won the war. This action by the Congress provoked controversy, and it was in connection with this that the term ''Lynch law'', meaning the assumption of extrajudicial authority, came into common parlance in the United States. Lynch was not accused of racist bias. He acquitted blacks accused of murder on three occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=atla;cc=atla;rgn=full%20text;idno=atla0088-6;didno=atla0088-6;view=image;seq=00732;node=atla0088-6%3A1 |title=The Atlantic Monthly Volume 0088 Issue 530 (Dec 1901) |website=Digital.library.cornell.edu |access-date=July 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=webstersabridged>[http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&word=lynch+law&resource=Webster%27s University of Chicago, ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913 + 1828)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523010101/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?action=search&word=lynch%20law&resource=Webster%27s |date=May 23, 2017 }}</ref>  He was accused, however, of ethnic prejudice in his abuse of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] miners.<ref name =EAAH1/>

==History==
[[File:1891 New Orleans Italian lynching.jpg|200px|thumb|Rioters breaking into a parish prison during [[March 14, 1891, lynchings|anti-Italian lynchings]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in 1891]]
Every society has had forms of extrajudicial punishments, including murder. The legal and cultural antecedents of American lynching were carried across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] by migrants from the [[British Isles]] to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial North America]]. Collective violence was a familiar aspect of the early modern Anglo-American legal landscape. Group violence in the British Atlantic was usually nonlethal in intention and result. In the seventeenth century, in the context of political turmoil in England and unsettled social and political conditions in the American colonies, there arose rebellions and riots that took multiple lives.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Roots of Rough Justice : Origins of American Lynching | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Pfeifer, Michael J. | year=2011 | location=Urbana, Illinois | isbn=9780252093098|oclc = 724308353}}</ref> In the United States, during the decades before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (sometimes called the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era .281781.E2.80.931860.29|Antebellum era]]), free Blacks, Mexicans in the South West, and runaways were the objects of racial lynching.<ref>{{cite book | title=Forgotten Dead : Mob Violence against Mexicans in the United States, 1848–1928 | publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Carrigan, William D. |author2=Clive Webb | year=2013 | location=Oxford | isbn=9780195320350|oclc = 815043342}}</ref>

But lynching attacks on [[African Americans|U.S. blacks]], especially in [[Southern United States|the South]], increased dramatically in the aftermath of Reconstruction, after [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] had been abolished and freed men gained the right to vote. The peak of lynchings occurred in 1892, after white [[Southern Democrats]] had regained control of state legislatures. Many incidents were related to economic troubles and competition. At the turn of the 20th century, southern states passed new constitutions or legislation which effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many [[Poor White|poor white]]s, established [[racial segregation|segregation]] of public facilities by race, and separated blacks from common public life and facilities through [[Jim Crow]] rules. Nearly 3,500 [[African Americans]] and 1,300 [[White Americans|whites]] were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched in the United States]] between 1882 and 1968.<ref name=tuskegee_umkc>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882–1968 |access-date=July 26, 2010 |quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute. |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |archive-date=June 29, 2010 }}</ref>

Lynching in the [[British Empire]] during the 19th century coincided with a period of violence which denied people participation in white-dominated society on the basis of race after the [[Emancipation Act]] of 1833.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Thomas E.|last=Smith|s2cid=162330208|title=The Discourse of Violence: Transatlantic Narratives of Lynching during High Imperialism|journal=[[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]]|volume=8|issue=2|date=Fall 2007|doi=10.1353/cch.2007.0040|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80ff2938b6eb92f66d849d0aad9b91c44279ce49}}</ref>

Lynchings took place in the United States both before and after the [[American Civil War]], most commonly in Southern states and Western frontier settlements and most frequently in the late 19th century.  They were often performed without [[due process]] of law by self-appointed commissions, [[Ochlocracy|mobs]], or [[vigilantes]] as a form of punishment for presumed criminal offences.<ref>The Guardian, 'Jim Crow lynchings more widespread than previously thought', Lauren Gambino, February 10, 2015</ref>  At the first recorded lynching, in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1835, a black man named McIntosh who killed a deputy sheriff while being taken to jail was captured, chained to a tree, and burned to death on a corner lot downtown in front of a crowd of over 1,000 people.<ref>William Hyde and Howard L. Conrad (eds.), [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhi04hyde ''Encyclopedia of the History of St. Louis: A Compendium of History and Biography for Ready Reference: Volume 4.''] New York: Southern History Company, 1899; pg. 1913.</ref>

In [[Southern United States|the South]] in the [[Antebellum South|antebellum era]], members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] or other people who opposed [[slavery]] were sometimes victims of mob violence. The largest lynching during the war and perhaps the largest lynching in all of U.S. history, was the lynching of 41 men in the [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas]] in October 1862. Most of the victims were hanged after an extrajudicial "trial" but at least fourteen of them did not receive that formality.<ref>McCaslin, Richard B. ''Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas 1862'', Louisiana State University Press, 1994, p. 81</ref>  The men had been accused of [[insurrection]] or [[treason]].  Five more men were hanged in [[Decatur, Texas]] as part of the same sweep.<ref>McCaslin, p. 95</ref>

After the war, southern whites struggled to maintain their social dominance. Secret vigilante and insurgent groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) instigated extrajudicial assaults and killings in order to keep whites in power and discourage [[freedmen]] from voting, working and getting educated. They also sometimes attacked Northerners, teachers, and agents of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]. A study of the period from 1868 to 1871<!-- which? needs cite --> estimates that the KKK was involved in more than 400 lynchings. The aftermath of the war was a period of upheaval and social turmoil, in which most white men had been war veterans. Mobs usually alleged crimes for which they lynched blacks. In the late 19th century, however, journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] showed that many presumed crimes were either exaggerated or had not even occurred.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Lynching |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576853/Lynching.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028112646/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576853/Lynching.html |archive-date=October 28, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the Ku Klux Klan and others used lynching as a means to control Black people, forcing them to work for planters and preventing them from exercising their right to vote.<ref name="New South 1993"/><ref name="Barry A. Crouch 1868"/><ref name="Foner1988p119-123" /><ref name="J.C.A. Stagg 1871"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> Federal troops and courts enforcing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] largely broke up the Reconstruction-era Klan.

By the end of Reconstruction in 1877, with fraud, intimidation and violence at the polls, white Democrats regained nearly total control of the state legislatures across the South. They passed laws to make voter registration more complicated, reducing black voters on the rolls. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven Southern legislatures ratified new constitutions and amendments to effectively [[disenfranchise]] most African Americans and many poor whites through devices such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], property and residency requirements, and [[literacy tests]]. Although required of all voters, some provisions were selectively applied against African Americans. In addition, many states passed [[grandfather clauses]] to exempt white illiterates from literacy tests for a limited period. The result was that black voters were stripped from registration rolls and without political recourse. Since they could not vote, they could not serve on juries. They were without official political voice.

The [[ideology]] behind lynching, directly connected with the denial of political and social equality, was stated forthrightly in 1900 by [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Benjamin Tillman]], who was previously [[governor of South Carolina]]:

Lynchings declined briefly after the takeover in the 1870s. By the end of the 19th century, with struggles over labor and disenfranchisement, and continuing agricultural depression, lynchings rose again. The number of lynchings peaked at the end of the 19th century, but these kinds of murders continued into the 20th century. [[Tuskegee Institute]] records of lynchings between the years 1880 and 1951 show 3,437 African-American victims, as well as 1,293 white victims.

Due to the high rate of lynching, racism, and lack of political and economic opportunities in the South, many black southerners fled the South to escape these conditions. From 1910 to 1940, 1.5&nbsp;million southern blacks migrated to urban and industrial Northern cities such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Boston]], and [[Pittsburgh]] during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. The rapid influx of southern blacks into the North changed the ethnic composition of the population in Northern cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white Northerners. Many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward blacks, while many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous regions, a process known as [[white flight]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Amanda|title=Block by block : neighborhoods and public policy on Chicago's West Side|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-74663-0|pages=213–14}}</ref> Overall, blacks in Northern cities experienced [[Racism in the United States|systemic discrimination]] in a plethora of aspects of life.<ref name="Emerson">Michael O.

African Americans resisted through protests, marches, lobbying Congress, writing of articles, rebuttals of so-called justifications of lynching, organizing women's groups against lynching, and getting integrated groups against lynching. African-American playwrights produced 14 anti-lynching plays between 1916 and 1935, ten of them by women.

After the release of the movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), which glorified lynching and the Reconstruction-era Klan, the Klan re-formed. Unlike its earlier form, it was heavily represented among urban populations, especially in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. In response to a large number of mainly Catholic and Jewish immigrants from [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], the Klan espoused an [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]], [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] stance, in addition to exercising the oppression of blacks.

Members of mobs that participated in lynchings often took photographs of what they had done to their victims in order to spread awareness and fear of their power. Souvenir taking, such as pieces of rope, clothing, branches and sometimes [[Human trophy collecting|body parts]] was not uncommon. Some of those photographs were published and sold as postcards. In 2000, [[James Allen (collector)|James Allen]] published a collection of 145 lynching photos in book form as well as online,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://withoutsanctuary.org/|author=Allen, James|title=Musarium: ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America''|access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref> with written words and video to accompany the images.

===Dyer Bill===
The [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]] was first introduced to the [[United States Congress]] in 1918 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Leonidas C. Dyer]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The bill was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1922, and in the same year it was given a favorable report by the [[United States Senate]] Committee. Its passage was blocked by white Democratic senators from the [[Solid South]], the only representatives elected since the southern states [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|had disenfranchised African Americans]] around the start of the 20th century.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000]. Accessed March 10, 2008.</ref> The Dyer Bill influenced later anti-lynching legislation, including the [[Costigan-Wagner Bill]], which was also defeated in the US Senate.<ref>Zangrando, NAACP Crusade, pp. 43–44, 54.</ref>

As passed by the House, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill stated: 
<blockquote>"To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every State the equal protection of the laws, and to punish the crime of lynching.... Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the phrase 'mob or riotous assemblage,' when used in this act, shall mean an assemblage composed of three or more persons acting in concert for the purpose of depriving any person of his life without authority of law as a punishment for or to prevent the commission of some actual or supposed public offense."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm |title="Anti-Lynching Bill," 1918 |work=Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217081129/http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/lynch/doc1.htm |archive-date=2009-02-17 |access-date=2017-05-23 }}</ref></blockquote>

While the frequency of lynching dropped in the 1930s, there was a spike in 1930 during the Great Depression. For example, in North Texas and southern Oklahoma alone, four people were lynched in separate incidents in less than a month. In his book ''Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?'' (1934), Sherwood Eddy wrote: "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked what they are going to do to the [[Scottsboro boys|Scottsboro Negro boys]] and why they lynch Negroes."<ref name=sherwoodeddy>{{citation|first=Sherwood|last=Eddy|title=Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?|pages=73, 151|publisher=Farrar & Rinehar|year=1934|location=New York|oclc=1617454}}</ref> A spike in lynchings occurred after [[World War II]], as tensions arose after veterans returned home. Whites tried to re-impose white supremacy over returning black veterans. The last documented mass lynching occurred in Walton County, Georgia, in 1946, when two war veterans and their wives were killed by local white landowners.

By the 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was gaining new momentum. It was spurred by the lynching of [[Emmett Till]], a 14-year-old youth from Chicago who was killed while visiting an uncle in Mississippi. His mother insisted on having an open-casket funeral so that people could see how badly her son had been beaten. The black community throughout the U.S. became mobilized.<ref name="Atlantic"/> Vann R.

===Civil rights law===
Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241, is the civil rights conspiracy statute, which makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States (or because of his/her having exercised the same) and further makes it unlawful for two or more persons to go in disguise on the highway or premises of another person with intent to prevent or hinder his or her free exercise or enjoyment of such rights. Depending upon the circumstances of the crime, and any resulting injury, the offense is punishable by a range of fines and/or imprisonment for any term of years up to life, or the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/miami|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224144931/http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm|url-status=dead|title=Miami|archive-date=December 24, 2007|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref>

===Felony lynching===
The term 'felony lynching' was used in California law. It described the act of taking someone out of the custody of a police officer by "means of riot". It does not refer to the act of lynching, or murder by physical violence. This statute has been used to charge individuals who have tried to free someone from police custody. There have been several notable cases in the twenty-first century, some controversial, when a black person has attempted to free another black person from police custody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-murrieta-protesters-charged-20140904-story.html|title=Murrieta immigration protesters charged with obstructing officers|first=James|last=Barragan|date=September 4, 2014|website=Latimes.com|access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2016/06/03/pasadena-black-lives-matter-activist-convicted-of-felony-lynching-could-spend-four-years-behind-bars/|title=Pasadena Black Lives Matter Activist Convicted of 'Felony Lynching', Could Spend Four Years Behind Bars|first=Tanasia|last=Kenney|date=June 3, 2016|website=Atlantablackstar.com|access-date=September 3, 2017}}</ref> In 2015, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation by Senator [[Holly Mitchell]] removing the word "lynching" from the state's criminal code without comment after it received unanimous approval in a vote by state lawmakers.

===Effects===
A 2017 study found that exposure to lynchings in the post-Reconstruction South "reduced local black voter turnout by roughly 2.5 percentage points."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Troesken|first2=Werner|last3=Walsh|first3=Randall|date=August 4, 2017|title=Political participation in a violent society: The impact of lynching on voter turnout in the post-Reconstruction South|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=129|pages=29–46|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2017.08.001}}</ref> There was other violence directed at blacks, particularly in campaign season. Most significantly for voting, from 1890 to 1908, southern states passed new constitutions and laws that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] due to barriers to voter registration. These actions had major effects, soon reducing black voter turnout in most of the South to insignificant amounts.

Another 2017 study found supportive evidence of Stewart Tolnay and E. M. Beck's claim that lynchings were "due to economic competition between African American and white cotton workers".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Cornelius|title=Lynchings, Labour, and Cotton in the US South: A Reappraisal of Tolnay and Beck|journal=Explorations in Economic History|volume=66|pages=106–116|doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2017.08.005|year=2017}}</ref> The study found that lynchings were associated with greater black out-migration from 1920 to 1930, and higher state-level wages.<ref name=":0" />

In Britain, a series of [[race riots]] broke out in several cities in 1919 between whites and black sailors. In [[Liverpool]], after a black sailor had been stabbed by two whites in a pub, his friends attacked the pub in revenge. In response, the police raided lodging houses with black occupants, accompanied by an "enraged lynch mob". Charles Wootton, a young black seaman who had not been involved in the attacks, was chased into the river [[Mersey]] and drowned after being pelted with missiles thrown by the mob, who chanted "Let him drown!"<ref>[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/liverpool-campaigns/anthony-walker/2005/08/03/the-roots-of-racism-in-city-of-many-cultures-100252-15813753/ "Roots of racism in City of Many Cultures"], ''Liverpool Echo'', August 3, 2005.</ref> The Charles Wootton College in Liverpool was named in his memory.<ref>Brown, Jacqueline Nassy (2005).

The situation is less clear with regards to reported "lynchings" in Germany. Nazi propaganda sometimes tried to depict state-sponsored violence as spontaneous lynchings. The most notorious instance of this was "[[Kristallnacht]]", which the government portrayed as the result of "popular wrath" against Jews, but it was carried out in an organised and planned manner, mainly by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men. Similarly, the approximately 150 confirmed murders of surviving crew members of crashed Allied aircraft in revenge for what Nazi propaganda called [[Strategic bombing during World War II|"Anglo-American bombing terror"]] were chiefly conducted by German officials and members of the police or the [[Gestapo]], although civilians sometimes took part in them. The execution of enemy aircrew without trial in some cases had been ordered by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] personally in May 1944. Publicly it was announced that enemy pilots would no longer be protected from "public wrath". There were secret orders issued that prohibited policemen and soldiers from interfering in favor of the enemy in conflicts between civilians and Allied forces, or prosecuting civilians who engaged in such acts.<ref>"Hamm 1944". polizeihistorischesammlung-paul.de.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-20794719.html|title=KRIEGSVERBRECHEN: Systematischer Mord - DER SPIEGEL 47/2001|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|journal=Spiegel Online|volume=47|access-date=September 3, 2017|date=November 19, 2001}}</ref> In summary,

:"the assaults on crashed allied aviators were not typically acts of revenge for the bombing raids which immediately preceded them.

"Die Übergriffe auf abgestürzte alliierte Flieger waren im Regelfall keine Racheakte für unmittelbar vorangegangene Bombenangriffe.

The incident was covered by the media almost from the beginning, including their pleas for help and their murder.

By the time police rescue units arrived, two of the agents were reduced to charred corpses and the third was seriously injured. Authorities suspect that the lynching was provoked by the persons who were being investigated.
Both local and federal authorities had abandoned the agents, saying that the town was too far away for them to try to intervene. Some officials said they would provoke a massacre if the authorities tried to rescue the men from the mob.

==South Africa==
{{Main|Necklacing}}

The practice of whipping and [[necklacing]] offenders and political opponents evolved in the 1980s during the [[apartheid]] era in [[South Africa]]. Residents of black townships formed "people's courts" and used whip lashings and deaths by necklacing in order to terrorize fellow blacks who were seen as collaborators with the government. Necklacing is the [[torture]] and execution of a victim by igniting a kerosene-filled rubber tire that has been forced around the victim's chest and arms. Necklacing was used to punish victims who were alleged to be traitors to the black liberation movement along with their relatives and associates. Sometimes the "people's courts" made mistakes, or they used the system to punish those whom the anti-Apartheid movement's leaders opposed.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/southafrica1/6.htm |chapter=4.

On October 18, 2015, an Eritrean asylum seeker, Haftom Zarhum, was lynched by a mob of vengeful Israeli soldiers in [[Be'er Sheva]]'s central bus station. Israeli security forces misidentified Haftom as the person who shot Israeli police bus and shot him. Moments after, other security forces joined shooting Haftom when he was bleeding helplessly on the ground. Then, a soldier hit him with a bench nearby when two other soldiers approached the victim then forcefully kicked his head and upper body. Another soldier threw a bench over him to prevent his movement.

In [[India]], lynchings may reflect internal tensions between ethnic communities. Communities sometimes lynch individuals who are accused or suspected of committing crimes. An example is the 2006 [[Kherlanji massacre]], where four members of a [[Dalit]] family were slaughtered by [[Kunbi]] caste members in Khairlanji, a village in the [[Bhandara district]] of [[Maharashtra]]. Though this incident was reported as an example of "upper" caste violence against members of a "lower" caste, it was found to be an example of communal violence. It was retaliation against a family who had opposed the Eminent Domain seizure of its fields so a road could be built that would have benefitted the group who murdered them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/age-old-rivalry-behind-khairlanji-violence/9290 |title=Age old rivalry behind Khairlanji violence Video |website=Ndtv.com |date=November 21, 2006|access-date=July 27, 2013}}</ref> The women of the family were paraded naked in public, before being mutilated and murdered.

He said that the photograph "haunted me for days" and inspired him to write the poem "[[Strange Fruit]]".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cross and the Lynching Tree|url=https://archive.org/details/crosslynchingtre0000cone|url-access=registration|last=Cone|first=James H.|publisher=Oribis Books|year=2011|location=Maryknoll, New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/crosslynchingtre0000cone/page/134 134]}}</ref> It was published in the ''New York Teacher'' and later in the magazine ''[[New Masses]]'', in both cases under the pseudonym Lewis Allan. This poem was set to music, also written by Meeropol, and the song was performed and popularized by [[Billie Holiday]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/strangefruit/film.html|website=Pbs.org|title=Strange Fruit}} PBS ''Independent Lens'' credits the music as well as the words to Meeropol, though Billie Holiday's autobiography and the Spartacus article credit her with co-authoring the song.</ref> The song reached 16th place on the charts in July 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The song has been performed by many other singers, including [[Nina Simone]].
