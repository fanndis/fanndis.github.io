'''Devin Gerald Nunes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|n|ɛ|s}};<ref>{{YouTube|JsB3Nuo-4Zg|"New Day—Devin Nunes"}}</ref> born October 1, 1973) is an American politician and former [[dairy farmer]] serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|22}} since 2003. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Nunes was [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Chair of the House Intelligence Committee]] from 2015 to 2019.

In March 2017 the U.S. House intelligence committee, which Nunes chaired at the time, launched an investigation into possible [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. On April 6, 2017, he temporarily stepped aside from leading that investigation while the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] investigated allegations (which Nunes denied) that he had improperly disclosed [[classified information]] to the public.<ref name="LAT_2017-04-06">{{cite news |title=Devin Nunes says he's temporarily stepping aside from Russia probe |author=Cloud, David S.|date=April 6, 2017|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-devin-nunes-says-he-s-temporarily-1491486690-htmlstory.html |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Cbs2017-04-06 /> In December 2017 the Republican-majority [[United States House Committee on Ethics|U.S. House Committee on Ethics]] closed its investigation without taking any action against Nunes.<ref name=cleardec />

Nunes is of three-quarters [[Portuguese Americans|Portuguese]] descent, with ancestors emigrating from the [[Azores]] to California.<ref name="thehill-cows">{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/23845-i-broke-so-many-tractors-they-made-me-work-with-the-cows|title=I broke so many tractors, they made me work with the cows|first=Charles|last=Case|date=September 6, 2005|work=The Hill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Megan Smolenyak |url=https://medium.com/s/story/why-hasnt-devin-nunes-assimilated-yet-7feb3a170f02 |title=Why Hasn't Devin Nunes Assimilated Yet? |work=Medium.com |date= August 9, 2018}}</ref> He has one younger brother, Anthony III. In 2009, Nunes wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that he became an entrepreneur at age 14 when he bought seven head of young cattle, learning quickly how to profit from his investment.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nunes|first=Devin|date=January 10, 2009|title=California's Gold Rush Has Been Reversed|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123154816733469917|access-date=December 16, 2015}}</ref>

After receiving his [[Associate degree|Associate of Arts]] degree from the [[College of the Sequoias]] in 1993, Nunes graduated from [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] with a bachelor's degree in agricultural business in 1995, and a [[master's degree]] in agriculture in 1996.<ref name=":8" /> After finishing school, Nunes returned to farming.<ref name=":8" />

In 1996, at age 23, Nunes was elected to the College of the Sequoias Board, making him one of California's youngest community college trustees in state history. He served on the board until 2002. 

In 2001 President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Nunes to serve as California State Director for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s Rural Development section.<ref>{{cite news |title=Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/devin-nunes-r-calif/gIQAt1EGAP_print.html#path-to-power |work=The Washington Post |date=2018 |access-date=January 27, 2018}}</ref>

===Elections===

In 1998, Nunes entered the "top two" primary race for [[California's 20th congressional district]] seat held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Cal Dooley]].<ref name=":8" /><ref>https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc225/pdf/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc225-3-14.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Tau|first=Byron|date=March 29, 2018|title=Behind the Political Rise of Devin Nunes|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-political-rise-of-devin-nunes-1522315800|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref> He finished in third place.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Campaigns—CA District 20—All-Party Primary Race—Jun 02, 1998|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=360652|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

In 2002, Nunes ran for the Republican nomination in the 21st congressional district, a new district created by [[Apportionment (politics)|reapportionment]] after the [[2000 United States Census]]. His principal opponents in the crowded seven-way primary were former Fresno mayor [[Jim Patterson (California politician)|Jim Patterson]] and [[California State Assembly|state Assemblyman]] [[Mike Briggs (politician)|Mike Briggs]]. Nunes was the only major candidate from Tulare County; Patterson and Briggs were both from Fresno. This was critical, as 58% of the district's population was in Tulare County.<ref name="nj">{{cite magazine|title=(Title is lost)|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2008/people/ca/rep_ca21.htm|magazine=National Journal}}{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> 

Patterson and Briggs split the vote in Fresno County, allowing Nunes to win by a four-point margin over Patterson, his nearest competitor. Nunes won 46.5% of the vote in Tulare County and 28.1% of the vote in Fresno County. Nunes was also helped by a strong showing in the rural part of the district.<ref name="Primary2002" /> He was endorsed by the California Farm Bureau and ''[[The Fresno Bee]]''.<ref name="nj" /> The district is solidly Republican, and Nunes coasted to victory in November 2002. He was 29 years old.

Nunes faced token Democratic opposition in 2004, 2006, and 2008. He ran unopposed in the 2010 general election.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States Congress Election Results, 2010|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-primary/pdf/85-95-cd.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321104908/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-primary/pdf/85-95-cd.pdf|archive-date=March 21, 2012|access-date=March 21, 2012|website=California Secretary of State}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=July 6, 2010|title=Election Summary Report, Statewide Direct Primary Election, June 8, 2010, Summary For Jurisdiction Wide, All Counters, All Races, Final Official Report|publisher=Fresno County Clerk/Registrar of Voters|url=http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/DepartmentPage.aspx?id=43518|url-status=dead|access-date=January 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109051133/http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/DepartmentPage.aspx?id=43518|archive-date=November 9, 2010}}</ref>

After the 2010 census, Nunes's district was renumbered the 22nd. It lost most of eastern Tulare County to the neighboring 23rd District, and now has a small plurality of Hispanic voters. Despite these changes, it is no less Republican than its predecessor. Nunes was reelected with 62% of the vote in 2012, 72% in 2014, and 68% in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Debra|date=November 2012|title=Statement of Vote, November 6, 2012, General Election|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf|access-date=January 22, 2018|website=California Secretary of State|publisher=State of California|page=31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Debra|date=November 2014|title=Statement of Vote, November 4, 2014, General Election|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2014-general/pdf/2014-complete-sov.pdf|access-date=January 22, 2018|website=California Secretary of State|publisher=State of California|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Padilla|first=Alex|date=November 2016|title=Statement of Vote, November 8, 2016, General Election|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2016-general/sov/2016-complete-sov.pdf|access-date=January 22, 2018|website=California Secretary of State|publisher=State of California|page=6}}</ref>

===Energy===

On July 28, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 5899, "A Roadmap for America's Energy Future", which would have accelerated the exploration and production of [[fossil fuel]], supported the rapid development of market-based alternative energy supplies, and expanded the number of nuclear reactors from 104 to 300 over the next thirty years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nunes.house.gov/_files/NUNES_038_xml.pdf|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803224353/http://nunes.house.gov/_files/NUNES_038_xml.pdf|archive-date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=August 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Kimberley Strassel]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote, "It's a bill designed to produce energy, not restrict it" with "no freebies", and "offers a competitive twist to government support of renewable energy."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703578104575397652539348486|title=A GOP Energy Alternative|last1=Strassel|first1=Kimberley A.|date=July 30, 2010|work=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

===Environment===

Nunes wrote in his nonfiction book that members of the environmental lobby were "followers of neo-Marxist, socialist, Maoist or Communist ideals".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24592231.html|title=California lawmaker's book pounds environmentalists|author=Michael Doyle |work=mcclatchydc.com}}</ref>

In February 2014, during a [[2012–13 North American drought|drought in California]], Nunes rejected any link to [[global warming]], claiming "Global warming is nonsense."<ref name="Onishi">{{cite news|last1=Onishi|first1=Norimitsu|last2=Davenport|first2=Coral|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/politics/obama-to-announce-aid-for-drought-racked-california.html|title=Obama Announces Aid for Drought-Stricken California|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 2014|access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> He has said it was a "man-made drought" due to water restrictions from the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] and other environmental regulations that have seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years.<ref>http://www.kmjnow.com/pages/landing_news?Valley-GOP-Reps-Introduce-Water-Legislat=1&blockID=520842&feedID=806 {{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref>

He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California's system of water irrigation and storage and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon and the delta smelt.<ref name="Onishi" /> Nunes co-sponsored the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act]] to stop a project designed to restore a dried-up section of the [[San Joaquin River]]. He also co-sponsored the California Emergency Drought Relief Act. The bills passed the House of Representatives in February 2014 and December 2014 respectively, but were not voted on by the Senate.

In an April 2015 ''[[National Review]]'' article, Nunes responded—as a third-generation dairy farmer—to criticism that California farmers were making the state's drought worse. He claimed that half of California's water is actually used for environmental causes while farmers use only forty percent. Nunes added that the problem is worse because California lacks adequate water storage facilities due to environmentalist opposition, but California is still prepared for five years of drought.<ref name="nationalreview.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416918/no-farmers-dont-use-80-percent-californias-water-devin-nunes|title=No, Farmers Don't Use 80 Percent of California's Water|author=Nunes, Devin|date=April 14, 2015|work=National Review}}</ref>

===Healthcare===

In 2009, Nunes co-authored the "Patients' Choice Act" with Paul Ryan (R-WI) in the House, and [[Tom Coburn]] (R-OK) and [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC) in the Senate.

===Intelligence Committee===

Nunes opposed the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], an international agreement that [[P5+1|the U.S. and other major world powers]] negotiated with [[Iran]], under which Iran was granted partial [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]] relief in exchange for limits and monitoring of its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear activities]].<ref>Ken Dilanian, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/house-intelligence-chair-calls-for-new-iran-assessment/ House intelligence chair calls for new Iran assessment], Associated Press (July 29, 2015).</ref><ref>Eli Lak, [https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-14/house-intelligence-chairman-deal-paves-way-for-iranian-bomb House Intelligence Chairman: Deal Paves Way for Iranian Bomb], Bloomberg (July 14, 2015).</ref>

As House Intelligence Committee chairman, Nunes oversaw the Republican-controlled committee's two-year-long investigation into the U.S. response to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]]. The committee's final report found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] or any other Obama administration officials, and concluded that the response of CIA and U.S. military to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound was correct.<ref name="Dilanian">Ken Dilanian, [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/house-intelligence-committee-investigation-debunks-many-benghazi-theories/ House Intelligence Committee investigation debunks many Benghazi theories], Associated Press (November 21, 2014).</ref> The committee's report debunked "a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies" about the attack, determining that "there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria", but found "that the State Department facility where [Christopher] Stevens and [Sean] Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack".<ref name="Dilanian" />

Paul Ryan vacated the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee when he replaced [[John Boehner]] as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

===Surveillance===

In January 2019, Congress passed a bill Nunes supported, which extends Section 702 of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) until 2023, and Trump signed it into law that month. FISA Section 702 allows the National Security Agency to conduct searches of foreigners' communications without a warrant. The process incidentally collects information from Americans. Nunes lauded the bill's passing: "The House of Representatives has taken a big step to ensure the continuation of one of the Intelligence Community's most vital tools for tracking foreign terrorists".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krieg |first1=Gregory |title=Why are GOP surveillance hawks so excited to 'release the memo'? |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/republicans-nunes-memo-fisa-surveillance/index.html |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=June 27, 2019 |date=January 31, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Volz |first1=Dustin |title=Trump signs bill renewing NSA's internet surveillance program |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cyber-surveillance/trump-signs-bill-renewing-nsas-internet-surveillance-program-idUSKBN1F82MK |website=[[Reuters]] |access-date=June 27, 2019 |date=January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Matishak |first1=Martin |title=Trump signs surveillance extension into law |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/19/trump-surveillance-extension-351136 |website=[[Politico]] |access-date=June 27, 2019 |date=January 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Haynes |first1=Danielle |title=Trump signs FISA law amid speculation over intelligence memo |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/01/19/Trump-signs-FISA-law-amid-speculation-over-intelligence-memo/4291516400093/ |website=[[UPI]] |access-date=June 27, 2019}}</ref>

===Transportation===

[[California State Route 99]] is a highway running north–south that branches from [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate&nbsp;5]] at the community of [[Wheeler Ridge, California|Wheeler Ridge]] in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and continues northward through the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] until it connects with Interstate&nbsp;5 again at [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]] in [[Tehama County, California|Tehama County]]. In 2005 Nunes introduced H.R. 99, which designated State Route 99 as a congressional [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act|High Priority Corridor]]. The bill also provided federal authorization for Highway 99 to become part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. On February 17, 2011, Nunes introduced H.R. 761, the "San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act", which would give the State of California the option to redirect federal high-speed rail funds to finance improvements to Highway 99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-761|title=San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act of 2011 (2011—H.R. 761) |work=[[GovTrack]]}}</ref> H.R. 761 was cosponsored by [[Jeff Denham]] (R-CA) and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] (R-CA).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=John|title=McCarthy backs plan to redirect bullet train money to improve Highway 99|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/economy/x1248562259/McCarthy-backs-plan-to-redirect-bullet-train-money-to-improve-Highway-99|publisher=Bakersfield.com|date=February 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426115920/http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/economy/x1248562259/McCarthy-backs-plan-to-redirect-bullet-train-money-to-improve-Highway-99|archive-date=April 26, 2011}}</ref>

Nunes's criticisms have not been limited to liberals or the Obama administration.

==Role in Trump impeachment inquiry==

{{Trump–Ukraine scandal}}

As the top Republican ("Ranking Member") on the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes was a key player in the [[Trump impeachment inquiry]]. During the November 2019 public hearings, he delivered the opening statement for the GOP minority. Nunes used most of the allotted Republican time for questioning himself instead of deferring to the Minority Counsel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guide-to-the-public-impeachment-hearings-11573593458|title=A Guide to the Public Impeachment Hearings|last=Andrews|first=Siobhan Hughes and Natalie|date=November 12, 2019|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> Nunes has tried to identify the whistle-blower whose complaint played a part in launching the impeachment inquiry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Panetta |first1=Grace |title=Devin Nunes used all his time in the impeachment hearing to try to out the Ukraine whistleblower |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/nunes-tried-to-out-the-ukraine-whistleblower-in-impeachment-hearing-2019-11 |website=Business Insider |publisher=Insider Inc. |access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> Further, during the hearings, Nunes repeatedly claimed that Ukraine had attempted to influence the [[2016 United States presidential election]], one of the [[conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/nunes-opening-statement-focuses-on-gop-conspiracy-theories.html|title=Nunes to Sondland: Let's Talk About My Conspiracy Theories|last=Kilgore|first=Ed|date=November 20, 2019|newspaper=[[New York Magazine]]|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/21/fiona-hill-will-tell-devin-nunes-his-face-that-his-ukraine-conspiracy-theory-is-harmful/|title=Fiona Hill tells Devin Nunes to his face that his Ukraine conspiracy theory is 'harmful'|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=November 21, 2019|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>

In November 2019, [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s associate [[Lev Parnas]] said he had helped Nunes arrange meetings with Ukrainian officials in efforts to procure politically embarrassing "dirt" on former Vice President [[Joe Biden]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/politics/nunes-vienna-trip-ukrainian-prosecutor-biden/index.html|title=Exclusive: Giuliani associate willing to tell Congress Nunes met with ex-Ukrainian official to get dirt on Biden|last=Ward|first=Vicky|date=November 22, 2019|website=CNN|access-date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> Parnas said he would be willing to testify to Congress about his own role as well as Nunes's in the events, which included meeting with disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor-general [[Viktor Shokin]].<ref name=":2" />

Parnas's attorney Joseph A. Bondy has said that Nunes and his staffer former U.S. Army colonel [[Derek Harvey]] met with Parnas several times for updates on claims against Biden and the CrowdStrike/2016 U.S. election conspiracy theory. Parnas's attorney said, "Mr. Parnas learned through Nunes's investigator, Derek Harvey, that the congressman had sequenced this trip to occur after the mid-term elections yet before Congress' return to session, so that Nunes would not have to disclose the trip details to his Democrat colleagues in Congress."<ref name=":2" />

When asked by CNN to comment on his trips overseas to solicit dirt on Biden, Nunes responded, "I don't talk to you in this lifetime or the next lifetime. At any time. On any question."<ref name=":2" />

On November 24, 2019, Nunes alleged in an interview with Fox News that CNN and the Daily Beast had committed crimes reporting on his trips to Europe and that he would pursue legal action against the news organizations for reporting the stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/devin-nunes-cnn-daily-beast-suit-parnas-ukraine-a6cc319b-c791-47dd-a1b2-ee5a396688ca.html|title=Nunes suggests CNN, Daily Beast committed crimes with reporting on Ukraine prosecutor|website=Axios|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/6108328579001/|title=Nunes: We are going to take CNN and Daily Beast to court|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> In the interview, he did not answer the host Maria Bartiromo's question about whether he had met with disgraced former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2018, saying he would be detailing all the facts in federal court filings.

That same day, CNBC reported that Lev Parnas was willing to testify under oath in Congress that Nunes's aides called off a 2019 trip to Ukraine to dig up more dirt on Joe Biden when they realized he would have to report the trip to Intelligence Committee Chairman [[Adam Schiff]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/24/giuliani-ally-would-testify-that-nunes-staffers-hid-ukraine-meetings-from-schiff.html|title=Giuliani associate wants to testify that Nunes's aides hid Ukraine meetings on Biden dirt from Schiff|last=Wilkie|first=Christina|date=2019-11-25|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> CNBC reported that Parnas's allegations "potentially implicate Nunes and his committee staff in the same events the committee is currently investigating.

In September 2019, Nunes sued the liberal nonprofit [[Campaign for Accountability]] (CfA) and the opposition research firm [[Fusion GPS]].

The research was compiled into the [[Steele dossier]]. In 2018 CfA filed three ethics complaints against Nunes.
