'''''Little Women''''' is a novel by American author [[Louisa May Alcott]] (1832–1888) which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. Alcott wrote the book over several months at the request of her publisher.<ref name="longest">{{cite book|last=Longest|first=David |title=Little Women of Orchard House: A Full-length Play |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alE2cBz3jiIC&q=little+women+setting&pg=PA115|year=1998|publisher=Dramatic Publishing|isbn=0-87129-857-0|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Sparknotes: literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlzwgasGc2oC&q=little+women|year=2004 |publisher=Spark Educational Publishing|isbn=1-4114-0026-7 |page=465}}</ref> The story follows the lives of the four March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—and details their passage from childhood to womanhood.

''Little Women'' was an immediate commercial and critical success, with readers demanding to know more about the characters. Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled '''''Good Wives''''' in the United Kingdom, although this name originated from the publisher and not from Alcott), and it was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled ''Little Women.''

Alcott wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886). The novel addresses three major themes: "domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity."<ref name=Elbert>{{cite book |author=Elbert, Sarah |title=A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott's Place in American Culture |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick |year=1987 |isbn=0-8135-1199-2}}</ref>{{rp|200}} According to [[Sarah Elbert]], Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format. Elbert argues that within ''Little Women'' can be found the first vision of the "[[Girl next door|All-American girl]]" and that her various aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.<ref name=Elbert />{{rp|199}}

The book has been translated into numerous languages, and frequently adapted for stage and screen.

==Development history==
In 1868, Thomas Niles, the publisher of Louisa May Alcott's works, recommended that she write a book about girls that would have widespread appeal.<ref name=Cheever>{{cite book|last=Cheever|first=Susan |title=Louisa May Alcott: A Personal Biography |year=2011 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4165-6992-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4PYzxTQVAcC&q=little+women}}</ref>{{rp|2}} At first, she resisted, preferring to publish a collection of short stories. Niles pressed her to write the girls' book first, and he was aided by her father [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], who also urged her to do so.<ref name=Cheever />{{rp|207}} Louisa confided to a friend, “I could not write a girls' story knowing little about any but my own sisters and always preferring boys”, as quoted in Anne Boyd Rioux's ''Meg Jo Beth Amy'', a condensed biographical account of Alcott's life and writing.

In May 1868, Alcott wrote in her journal: "Niles, partner of Roberts, asked me to write a girl's book. I said I'd try."<ref name=Madison>Author {{cite book |author=Madison, Charles A. |title=Irving to Irving: Author-Publisher Relations 1800–1974 |location=New York |publisher=R. R.

==Explanation of the novel's title==
According to literary critic Sarah Elbert, when using the term "little women", Alcott was drawing on its [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] meaning; it represented the period in a young woman's life where childhood and elder childhood were "overlapping" with young womanhood. Each of the March sister heroines had a harrowing experience that alerted her and the reader that "childhood innocence" was of the past, and that "the inescapable woman problem" was all that remained.<ref name=Elbert/>{{page needed|date=August 2019}}

Other views suggest that the title was meant to highlight the unfair social inferiority, especially at that time, of women as compared to men, or, alternatively, describe the lives of simple people, "unimportant" in the social sense.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alcott|first=Louisa May|title=Little Women|contribution=Foreword|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWG7o0CJM-kC&q=little+women+reason+for+the+title&pg=PR6|year=2010|series=Collins Classics|publisher=HarperCollins UK|isbn=978-0-00-738264-4|page=vi}}</ref>

==Plot summary== 
{{Cleanup book|date=December 2019}}
===Part One===
Four sisters and their mother, whom they call Marmee, live in a new neighborhood (loosely based on [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]]) in [[Massachusetts]] in genteel poverty. Having lost all his money, their father is serving as a [[pastor|chaplain]] in the [[American Civil War]], far from home. The mother and daughters face their first Christmas without him. When Marmee asks her daughters to give their Christmas breakfast away to an impoverished family, the girls venture into town laden with baskets to feed the hungry children and their mother. When they return, they discover their elderly neighbor Mr. Laurence has sent over a decadent surprise dinner to make up for their breakfast. The two families become acquainted following these acts of kindness.

Meg and Jo must work to support the family: Meg tutors a nearby family of four children; Jo assists her aged [[great-aunt]] March, a wealthy widow living in a [[mansion]], Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; and Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes; Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist; and Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society. The sisters strive to help their family and improve their characters as Meg is vain, Jo is hotheaded, Beth is cripplingly shy, and Amy is materialistic. The neighbor boy Laurie, orphaned grandson of Mr. Laurence, becomes close friends with the sisters, particularly the tomboyish Jo. 

The girls keep busy as the war goes on. Jo writes a novel that gets published but is frustrated to have to edit it down and can't comprehend the conflicting critical response. Meg is invited to spend two weeks with rich friends, where there are parties for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Laurie is invited to one of the dances, and Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor.

Word comes that Mr. March is very ill with [[pneumonia]] and Marmee is called away to nurse him in [[Washington, DC|Washington]]. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany her but she declines, knowing travel would be uncomfortable for the old man. Mr. Laurence instead sends John Brooke to do his business in Washington and help the Marches. While in Washington, Brooke confesses his love for Meg to her parents. They are pleased, but consider Meg too young to marry, so Brooke agrees to wait. 

While Marmee is in Washington, Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] after spending time with a poor family where three children die. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March and replaces Jo as her companion and helper. Jo, who already had scarlet fever, tends to Beth. After many days of illness, the family doctor advises that Marmee be sent for immediately. Beth recovers, but never fully regains her health and energy. 

While Brooke waits for Meg to come of age to marry, he joins the military and serves in the war. After he is wounded, he returns to find work so he can buy a house and be ready when he marries Meg. Laurie goes off to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns home.

===Part Two===
(Published separately in the United Kingdom as ''Good Wives'')

Three years later, Meg and John marry and learn how to live together. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel neglected and left out. Meg seeks advice from Marmee, who helps her find balance in her married life by making more time for wifely duties and encouraging John to become more involved with child rearing. 

Laurie graduates from college, having put in the effort to do well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy is chosen over Jo to go on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak due to complications from scarlet fever and her spirits are down. While trying to uncover the reason for Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it's with Beth, but soon senses it's with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie like a brother and that she could not love him in a romantic way.

Jo decides she wants a bit of adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will forget his feelings. She spends six months with a friend of her mother who runs a boarding house in New York City, serving as [[governess]] for her two children. Jo takes German lessons with another boarder, Professor Bhaer. He has come to America from Berlin to care for the orphaned sons of his sister. For extra money, Jo writes salacious romance stories anonymously for sensational newspapers. Professor Bhaer suspects her secret and mentions such writing is unprincipled and base. Jo is persuaded to give up that type of writing as her time in New York comes to an end. When she returns to Massachusetts, Laurie proposes marriage and she declines.

Laurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's health has seriously deteriorated. Jo devotes her time to the care of her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe, and he slowly falls in love with her as he begins to see her in a new light. She is unimpressed by the aimless, idle, and forlorn attitude he has adopted since being rejected by Jo, and inspires him to find his purpose and do something worthwhile with his life. With the news of Beth's death, they meet for consolation and their romance grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return unchaperoned with Laurie and his grandfather, so they marry before returning home from Europe.

Professor Bhaer is in Massachusetts on business and visits the Marches' daily for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo and the two become engaged. Because the Professor is poor, the wedding must wait while he establishes a good income by going out west to teach. A year goes by without much success, when Aunt March dies and leaves her large estate Plumfield to Jo. Jo and Bhaer marry and turn the house into a school for boys. They have two sons of their own, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and her five grandchildren.

==Characters==
===Margaret "Meg" March===
Meg, the eldest sister, is 16 when the story starts. She is referred to as a beauty and manages the household when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and has particularly beautiful hands, and is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters. Meg fulfills expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect "little woman" in the eyes of the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hermeling |first=Ines |title=The Image of Society and Women in Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7f6hHD8a9REC&q=little+women+meg&pg=PA8|year= 2010 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |isbn= 978-3-640-59122-0 |page=8}}</ref> Before her marriage to John Brooke, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of "little women".<ref>{{cite book|last=Caspi|first=Jonathan|title=Sibling Development: Implications for Mental Health Practitioners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJ3E03ShScsC&q=little+women+meg&pg=PA147|year=2010|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8261-1753-3|page=147}}</ref>

Meg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Because of their father's family's social standing, Meg makes her [[debutante|debut]] into high society, but is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore "Laurie" Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Meg marries John Brooke, Laurie's tutor. They have twins, Margaret "Daisy" Brooke and John Laurence "Demi" Brooke. The sequel, ''Little Men,'' mentions a baby daughter, Josephine "Josie" Brooke,<ref>{{cite book|quote=Baby Josy had a flannel petticoat beautifully made by Sister Daisy|title=Little Men|last=Alcott|first=Louisa May|page=Chapter 2}}</ref> who is 14 at the beginning of the final book.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jo's Boys|page=Chapter 1|last=Alcott|first=Louisa May}}</ref>

Critics have portrayed Meg as lacking in independence, reliant entirely on her husband, and "isolated in her little cottage with two small children".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|204}} From this perspective, Meg is seen as the compliant daughter. According to Sarah Elbert, "democratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all a secure identity that Meg lacks".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|204}} Others believe that Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life, and portrays her in loving detail, suffused in a sentimental light.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/p5qb4mj4/Characters-Margaret-Meg-March-Meg-the-eldest-sister-is-sixteen-when-the-story/|title=Characters Margaret Meg March Meg the eldest sister is sixteen when the story|website=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>

===Josephine "Jo" March===
The principal character, Jo, 15 years old at the beginning of the book, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her fiery temper and stubborn personality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alcott|first=Louisa|title=Little Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na4yAAAAQBAJ&q=little+women+jo+march&pg=PT526|work=search of mentions of Jo March|date=August 1, 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-8597-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/how-little-women-got-big|title=How "Little Women" Got Big|last=Acocella|first=Joan|journal=The New Yorker (Serial)|date=2018-08-20|access-date=2019-02-25|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

Second oldest of the four sisters, Jo is boyish, the smartest and most creative one in the family; her father has referred to her as his "son Jo," and her best friend and neighbor, Theodore "Laurie" Laurence, sometimes calls her "my dear fellow," while she alone calls him Teddy. Jo has a "hot" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it. It has been said that much of Louisa May Alcott shows through in these characteristics of Jo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/louisa-may-alcott-the-character-of-jo-march/1312/ |title= Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women, The Character of Jo March |work=American Masters |date=December 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref>

Jo loves literature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters whom she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor. On her return home, Jo rejects Laurie's marriage proposal, confirming her independence.

After Beth dies, Professor Bhaer woos Jo at her home, when "They decide to share life's burdens just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition." <ref name=Elbert />{{rp|210}} She is 25 years old when she accepts his proposal. The marriage is deferred until her unexpected inheritance of her Aunt March's home a year later. According to critic Barbara Sicherman, "The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality."<ref name=Sicherman>{{cite book |author=Sicherman, Barbara |title=Well Read Lives: How Books Inspired A Generation of American Women |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8078-3308-7}}</ref>{{rp|21}} They have two sons, Robert "Rob" Bhaer and Theodore "Ted" Bhaer. Jo also writes the first part of ''Little Women'' during the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, "her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence".<ref name=Elbert />{{rp|199}}

===Elizabeth "Beth" March===
Beth, 13 when the story starts, is described as kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet , honest and musical. She is the shyest March sister and the pianist of the family.<ref name=Keith>{{cite book |last=Keith |first=Lois |title=Take Up Thy Bed and Walk: Death, Disability and Cure in Classic Fiction for Girls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xStr_6m1gRMC&q=little+women+ |year=2001 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-93740-5}}</ref>{{rp|53}} Infused with quiet wisdom, she is the peacemaker of the family and gently scolds her sisters when they argue.<ref name="Apter">{{cite book |last=Apter |first=T.

W. Norton & Company |isbn= 978-0-393-06058-4 |page=137}}</ref> As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She is especially close to Jo: when Beth develops [[scarlet fever]] after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute disease but her health is permanently weakened.

As she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew "heavy." Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone. The main loss during ''Little Women'' is the death of beloved Beth. Her "self-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning."<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|206–207}}

===Amy Curtis March===
Amy is the youngest sister and baby of the family, aged 12 when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a "regular snow-maiden" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, "pale and slender" and "always carrying herself" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family.<ref name="Little Women">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/littlewomenorme00alcogoog |title=Little Women: or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy |accessdate=2010-05-31 |author=Alcott, Louisa May |publisher=John Wilson and Son |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1880}}</ref> Often coddled because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way.<ref name=Saxton>{{cite book |last=Saxton |first=Martha |title=Louisa May Alcott: A Modern Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OB_2sFqYtsC&q=little+women+amy+march+fight+jo&pg=PA4 |year=1977 |publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-374-52460-9 }}</ref>{{rp|5}} She has the middle name Curtis, and is the only March sister to use her full name rather than a diminutive.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/littlewomenorme00alcogoog |quote=Curtis. |title=Little Women, or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy |author=Alcott, Louisa May |page=[https://archive.org/details/littlewomenorme00alcogoog/page/n241 213] |year=1880 |publisher=John Wilson and Son |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |accessdate=May 13, 2015}}</ref>

She is chosen by her aunt to travel in Europe with her, where she grows and makes a decision about the level of her artistic talent and how to direct her adult life. She encounters "Laurie" Laurence and his grandfather during the extended visit. Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. She behaves well in good society, at ease with herself. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development and her success in life seemed relatively accidental.<ref name=Saxton/> However, Amy's morality does appear to develop throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she is able to confidently and justly put Laurie in his place when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work very hard to gain what she wants in life, and to make the most of her success while she has it.

Due to her early selfishness and attachment to material things, Amy has been described as the least likable of the four sisters, but she is also the only one who strives to excel at art purely for self-expression, in contrast to Jo, who sometimes writes for financial gain.<ref name="Hollander">{{cite book |last=Hollander |first=Anne |title=Feeding the Eye |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp2T9MX15IkC&q=Little+women+minor+characters&pg=PA233 |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-22659-3 |page=233}}</ref>

===Additional characters===
[[File:The March Sisters.png|thumb|''The March Sisters'' by [[Pablo Marcos]]]]

* Aunt March - Sister of Robert March, she is a wealthy older woman whom Jo March is a companion to at first. Later in the novel Aunt March takes in Amy March to prevent her from getting scarlet fever after the youngest of the March girls catches the disease. Aunt March takes a liking to Amy, this pays off in the end as she is asked by Aunt Carroll in accompanying her and her husband to Europe. Unlike many of the characters in the novel that have to do with Alcott's "real-life inspiration" there is no evidence to confirm inspiration for this character in Alcott's life.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Matteson|first=John|title=The Annotated Little Women|publisher=W.W Norton & Company, Inc.|year=2016|isbn=978-0-393-07219-8|location=500 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10110|pages=19}}</ref>

*Margaret "Marmee" March – The girls' mother and head of household while her husband is away. She engages in charitable works and lovingly guides her girls' morals and their characters.

*Robert March – Formerly wealthy, the father is portrayed as having helped a friend who could not repay a debt, resulting in his family's genteel poverty. A scholar and a minister, he serves as a [[chaplain]] in the Union Army during the Civil War and is wounded in December 1862. After the war he becomes minister to a small congregation.
*Professor Friedrich Bhaer – A middle-aged, "philosophically inclined", and penniless German immigrant in New York City who had been a noted professor in Berlin. Also known as Fritz, he initially lives in Mrs. Kirke's boarding house and works as a language master.<ref name=Keith/>{{rp|61}} He and Jo become friends, and he critiques her writing. He encourages her to become a serious writer instead of writing sensational stories for weekly tabloids. "Bhaer has all the qualities Bronson Alcott lacked: warmth, intimacy, and a tender capacity for expressing his affection—the feminine attributes Alcott admired and hoped men could acquire in a rational, feminist world."<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|210}} They eventually marry and raise his two orphaned nephews, Franz and Emil, and their own sons, Rob and Ted.<ref name="Masse">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Masse |first=Michelle |editor=Alberghene, Janice M. |editor2=Clark, Beverly Lyon |title=Songs to Aging Children: Alcott's March Trilogy |encyclopedia=Little Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1999 |page=338 |isbn=978-0-8153-2049-4}}</ref>

When Laurie leaves for college, Brooke continues his employment with Mr. Laurence as a bookkeeper. When Aunt March overhears Meg accepting John's declaration of love, she threatens Meg with disinheritance because she suspects that Brooke is only interested in Meg's future prospects. Eventually, Meg admits her feelings to Brooke, they defy Aunt March (who ends up accepting the marriage), and they are engaged.

Lonely in his mansion, and often at odds with his high-spirited grandson, he finds comfort in becoming a benefactor to the Marches. He protects the March sisters while their parents are away. He was a friend to Mrs. March's father, and admires their charitable works. He develops a special, tender friendship with Beth, who reminds him of his late granddaughter. He gives Beth the girl's piano.
*Theodore "Laurie" Laurence – A rich young man who lives opposite the Marches, older than Jo but younger than Meg. Laurie is the "boy next door" to the March family and has an overprotective paternal grandfather, Mr. Laurence. After eloping with an Italian pianist, Laurie's father was disowned by his parents. Both  Laurie's mother and father died young, so as a boy Laurie was taken in by his grandfather. Preparing to enter Harvard, Laurie is being tutored by John Brooke. He is described as attractive and charming, with black eyes, brown skin, and curly black hair. He later falls in love with Amy and they marry; they have one child, a little girl named after Beth: Elizabeth "Bess" Laurence. Sometimes Jo calls Laurie "Teddy". Though Alcott did not make Laurie as multidimensional as the female characters, she partly based him on Ladislas Wisniewski, a young [[Poland|Polish]] émigré she had befriended, and Alf Whitman, a friend from [[Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref name=Cheever/>{{rp|202}}<ref name=Reisen/>{{rp|241}}<ref name=Saxton/>{{rp|287}} According to author and professor Jan Susina, the portrayal of Laurie is as "the fortunate outsider", observing Mrs. March and the March sisters. He agrees with Alcott that Laurie is not strongly developed as a character.<ref name="Susina">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Susina|first=Jan |editor=Alberghene, Janice M. |editor2=Clark, Beverly Lyon|title=Men and Little Women Notes of a Resisting (Male) Reader|encyclopedia=Little Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|pages=161–70|isbn=978-0-8153-2049-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eTPG_UXEbgC&q=susina}}</ref>

*Aunt Josephine March – Mr. March's aunt, a rich widow. Somewhat temperamental and prone to being judgmental, she disapproves of the family's poverty, their charitable work, and their general disregard for the more superficial aspects of society's ways. Her vociferous disapproval of Meg's impending engagement to the impoverished Mr. Brooke becomes the proverbial "last straw" that actually causes Meg to accept his proposal. She appears to be strict and cold, but deep down, she's really quite soft-hearted. She dies near the end of the first book, and Jo and Friedrich turn her estate into a school for boys.
*Annie Moffat – A fashionable and wealthy friend of Meg and Sallie Gardiner.
*Ned Moffat – Annie Moffat's brother, who marries Sallie Gardiner.
*Hannah Mullet – The March family maid and cook, their only servant. She is of Irish descent and very dear to the family. She is treated more like a member of the family than a servant.

Rivalry with the much richer Fred for Amy's love inspires the dissipated Laurie to pull himself together and become more worthy of her. Amy will eventually reject Fred, knowing she does not love him and deciding not to marry out of ambition.<ref name="Journeys">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Seelinger Trites|first=Roberta|authorlink= Roberta Seelinger Trites |editor=Betsy Gould Hearne |editor2=Roberta Seelinger Trites|title=Journeys with Little Women|encyclopedia=A Narrative Compass: Stories that Guide Women's Lives|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2009|page=15|isbn=978-0-252-07611-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5uE2BizLKMC&q=Fred+Vaughan+little+women&pg=PA236}}</ref>

For her books, Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements. The characters in ''Little Women'' are recognizably drawn from family members and friends.<ref name=Alberghene/><ref name=Cheever/>{{rp|202}} Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott's beloved sister who died at the age of twenty-three, was the model for Beth, and May, Alcott's strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose pretentious affectations cause her occasional downfalls.<ref name=Cheever/>{{rp|202}} Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. Alcott readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as "Miss March" or "Jo", and she did not correct them.<ref name="SichermanEncyc">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Sicherman|first=Barbara |editor=Linda K.

However, Alcott's portrayal, even if inspired by her family, is an idealized one. For instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of the [[American Civil War]], a gainfully employed [[chaplain]], and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel.<ref name=Keyser/>{{rp|51}} In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family's household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters.<ref name=Keyser/>{{rp|51}} The March family is portrayed living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121831612|title=Alcott: 'Not The Little Woman You Thought She Was'|date=December 28, 2009|work=NPR|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> In addition to her own childhood and that of her sisters, scholars who have examined the diaries of Louisa Alcott's mother, Abigail Alcott, have surmised that ''Little Women'' was also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott's own early life.<ref name=LaPlante/>{{rp|6}}

Also, ''Little Women'' has several textual and structural references to [[John Bunyan|John Bunyan’s]] novel ''[[The Pilgrim’s Progress]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Seppänen, Mirva | title=Uudelleenkääntämishypoteesi ja lasten- ja nuortenkirjallisuus: Tarkastelussa Louisa M.

Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times to ''The Pilgrim’s Progress'' and liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. A number of chapter titles directly reference characters and places from ''The Pilgrim’s Progress''.

==Publication history==
The first volume of ''Little Women'' was published in 1868 by Roberts Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Cheney, Ednah Dow|title=Louisa May Alcott: Her Life, Letters, and Journals|location=Boston|publisher=Applewood Books|year=1889|page=190|isbn=978-1-4290-4460-8}}</ref>

The first printing of 2,000 copies sold out quickly, and the company had trouble keeping up with demand for additional printings. They announced: "The great literary hit of the season is undoubtedly Miss Alcott's ''Little Women'', the orders for which continue to flow in upon us to such an extent as to make it impossible to answer them with promptness."<ref name=Madison/>{{rp|37}} The last line of Chapter 23 in the first volume is "So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women."<ref name=Gutenberg>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/514/514-h/514-h.htm|title=Little Women |author=Alcott, Louisa May|publisher=ProjectGutenberg|accessdate=April 9, 2015|date=August 19, 2010|orig-year=1868}}</ref> Alcott delivered the manuscript for the second volume on New Year's Day 1869, just three months after publication of part one.<ref name=Matteson/>{{rp|345}}

Versions in the late 20th and 21st centuries combine both portions into one book, under the title ''Little Women'', with the later-written portion marked as Part 2, as this Bantam Classic paperback edition, initially published in 1983 typifies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553212753?ie=UTF8&isInIframe=1&n=283155&redirect=true&ref_=dp_proddesc_0&s=books&showDetailProductDesc=1#iframe-wrapper|title=Little Women|author=Alcott, Louisa May|isbn=978-0-553-21275-4|date=April 1, 1983|origyear=1868|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> There are 23 chapters in Part 1 and 47 chapters in the complete book. Each chapter is numbered and has a title as well. Part 2, Chapter 24 opens with "In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches."<ref name=Gutenberg/> Editions published in the 21st century may be the original text unaltered, the original text with illustrations, the original text annotated for the reader (explaining terms of 1868–69 that are less common now), the original text modernized and abridged, or the original text abridged.<ref name=FF1868/>

The British influence, giving Part 2 its own title, ''Good Wives'', has the book still published in two volumes, with ''Good Wives'' beginning three years after ''Little Women'' ends, especially in the UK and Canada, but also with some US editions. Some editions listed under ''Little Women'' appear to include both parts, especially in the audio book versions.<ref name=FF1868/> Editions are shown in continuous print from many publishers, as hardback, paperback, audio, and e-book versions, from the 1980s to 2015.<ref name=FF1868>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/louisa-may-alcott/little-women.htm |title=Little Women |edition=Part 1 |author=Louisa May Alcott |publisher=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/louisa-may-alcott/good-wives.htm |title=Good Wives (Little Women) (1869) |edition=Part 2 |author=Louisa May Alcott |publisher=Fantastic Fiction |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> <!-- was the book available continuously from 1868-69?

==Reception==
[[G. K. Chesterton]] believed Alcott in ''Little Women'', "anticipated [[Literary realism|realism]] by twenty or thirty years", and that Fritz's proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, "is one of the really human things in human literature."<ref>{{cite book|author=Chesterton, G. K.|authorlink=G. K. Chesterton|chapter=Louisa Alcott|title=A Handful of Authors|year=1953}}</ref> Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott's use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children's guides which provide background for the game of "pilgrims progress" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jackson, Gregory S.|title=The Word and Its Witness: The Spiritualization of American Realism|location=Chicago|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2009|pages=125–56|isbn=978-0-226-39004-8}}</ref>

''Little Women'' was well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a "scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood", which led more women to look toward "literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence."<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|2}} ''Little Women'' became "the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured."<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3}} Adult elements of women's fiction in ''Little Women'' included "a change of heart necessary" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|199}}

In the late 20th century, some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of "a decline in the radical power of women's fiction", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a "hearth and home" children's story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|197}} Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of this "downward spiral". But Elbert says that ''Little Women'' did not "belittle women's fiction" and that Alcott stayed true to her "Romantic birthright".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|198–199}}

''Little Women''{{'}}s popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown "within the familiar construct of domesticity".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|220}} While Alcott had been commissioned to "write a story for girls", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a "new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3–4}}

One reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3–4}} "Both the passion ''Little Women'' has engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability."<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|35}}

At the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her "who the little women marry".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} The unresolved ending added to the popularity of ''Little Women''. Sicherman said that the unsatisfying ending worked to "keep the story alive" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} "Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writing ''Little Women''."<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd, Anne E.|title=Writing for Immortality: Women Writers and the Emergence of High Literary Culture in America|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|year=2004|page=72|isbn=0-8018-7875-6}}</ref> Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband. Alcott used Friedrich to "subvert adolescent romantic ideals" because he was much older and seemingly unsuited for Jo.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}}

In 2003 ''Little Women'' was ranked number 18 in [[The Big Read]], a survey of the British public by the [[BBC]] to determine the "Nation's Best-loved Novel" (not children's novel); it is fourth-highest among novels published in the U.S. on that list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml|title=BBC – The Big Read|publisher=BBC|date=April 2003|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. [[National Education Association]] listed it as one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children".<ref name=NEA2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/grants/13154.htm|title=Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children|author=National Education Association|year=2007|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> In 2012 it was ranked number 48 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]'', a monthly with primarily US audience.<ref name=SLJChapter2012>{{cite web|url=http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results|title=Top 100 Chapter Book Poll Results|author=Bird, Elizabeth|publisher=[[School Library Journal]] "A Fuse No. 8 Production" blog|date=July 7, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713031015/http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/07/07/top-100-chapter-book-poll-results|archive-date=July 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Influence==
''Little Women'' has been one of the most widely read novels, noted by Stern from a 1927 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and cited in ''Little Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays''.<ref name="Alberghese3">{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Alberghese, Janice M. |editor2=Clark, Beverly Lyon|title=Little Women Leads Poll: Novel Rated Ahead of Bible for Influence on High School Pupils|encyclopedia=Little Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1999|page=xliv|isbn=978-0-8153-2049-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ad9QAwAAQBAJ&q=Little+Women+Leads+Poll%3A+Novel+Rated+Ahead+of+Bible+for+Influence+on+High+School+Pupils&pg=PR44}}</ref> <!-- is there a more recent source than 1927 to make the point about widely read? --> Ruth MacDonald argued that "Louisa May Alcott stands as one of the great American practitioners of the girls' novel and the family story."<ref>{{cite book|author=MacDonald, Ruth M.|title=Louisa May Alcott|url=https://archive.org/details/louisamayalcott00macd|url-access=registration|location=Boston|publisher=Twayne Publishers|year=1983 |page=[https://archive.org/details/louisamayalcott00macd/page/95 95]}}</ref>

In the 1860s, gendered separation of children's fiction was a newer division in literature. This division signaled a beginning of polarization of gender roles as social constructs "as class stratification increased".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|18}} Joy Kasson wrote, "Alcott chronicled the coming of age of young girls, their struggles with issues such as selfishness and generosity, the nature of individual integrity, and, above all, the question of their place in the world around them."<ref>{{cite book|author1=Alcott, Louisa May|chapter=Introduction|author2=Kasson, Joy S.|title=Work: A Story of Experience|location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1994|page=ix|isbn=014039091X}}</ref> Girls related to the March sisters in ''Little Women'', along with following the lead of their heroines, by assimilating aspects of the story into their own lives.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|22}}

After reading ''Little Women,'' some women felt the need to "acquire new and more public identities", however dependent on other factors such as financial resources.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|55}} While ''Little Women'' showed regular lives of American middle-class girls, it also "legitimized" their dreams to do something different and allowed them to consider the possibilities.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|36}} More young women started writing stories that had adventurous plots and "stories of individual achievement—traditionally coded male—challenged women's socialization into domesticity."<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|55}} ''Little Women'' also influenced contemporary European immigrants to the United States who wanted to assimilate into middle-class culture.

In the pages of ''Little Women'', young and adolescent girls read the normalization of ambitious women. This provided an alternative to the previously normalized gender roles.<ref name=Sicherman />{{rp|35}} ''Little Women'' repeatedly reinforced the importance of "individuality" and "female vocation".<ref name=Sicherman />{{rp|26}} ''Little Women'' had "continued relevance of its subject" and "its longevity points as well to surprising continuities in gender norms from the 1860s at least through the 1960s."<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|35}} Those interested in domestic reform could look to the pages of ''Little Women'' to see how a "democratic household" would operate.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|276}}

While  "Alcott never questioned the value of domesticity", she challenged the social constructs that made spinsters obscure and fringe members of society solely because they were not married.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|193}} "''Little Women'' indisputably enlarges the myth of American womanhood by insisting that the home and the women's sphere cherish individuality and thus produce young adults who can make their way in the world while preserving a critical distance from its social arrangements." As with all youth, the March girls had to grow up. These sisters, and in particular Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|199}}

Alcott's Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse as [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], [[Margaret Atwood]], and [[J.K. Rowling]] have noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development. Even other fictional portraits of young women aspiring to authorship often reference Jo March.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Isaac|first=Megan Lynn|date=2018|title=A Character of One's Own: The Perils of Female Authorship in the Young Adult Novel from Alcott to Birdsall|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/695858/summary|journal=Children's Literature|volume=46|pages=133–168|doi=10.1353/chl.2018.0007|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

Alcott "made women's rights integral to her stories, and above all to ''Little Women''."<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|193}} Alcott's fiction became her "most important feminist contribution"—even considering all the effort Alcott made to help facilitate women's rights."<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|193}} She thought that "a democratic household could evolve into a feminist society". In ''Little Women'', she imagined that just such an evolution might begin with Plumfield, a nineteenth century feminist utopia.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|194}}

<blockquote>''Little Women'' has a timeless resonance which reflects Alcott's grasp of her historical framework in the 1860s. The novel's ideas do not intrude themselves upon the reader because the author is wholly in control of the implications of her imaginative structure. Sexual equality is the salvation of marriage and the family; democratic relationships make happy endings. This is the unifying imaginative frame of ''Little Women''.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|276}}</blockquote>
