==History==
Hendersonville was settled ''circa'' 1784 by [[Daniel Smith (surveyor)|Daniel Smith]] when he began work on his [[Rock Castle (Hendersonville, Tennessee)|Rock Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicrockcastle.com/meetthefamily.html |title=Family History of General Daniel Smith|accessdate=2012-05-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424211243/http://www.historicrockcastle.com/meetthefamily.html|archive-date=2012-04-24}}</ref>

In 1790, William Henderson settled in [[Sumner County, Tennessee|Sumner County]] and later became the namesake of the town. It was a trading center for the county, which was devoted to the production of tobacco and hemp as commodity crops, and blood livestock: both horses and cattle. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Monthaven]] was used as a field hospital.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In the late 20th century, this historic home was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

In 1901, when the small city was incorporated, it had roughly 250 residents and was led by L.H. "Dink" Newman.<ref name="hvilletn.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.hvilletn.org/|title=City of Hendersonville - Home|website=www.hvilletn.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308183703/http://www.hvilletn.org/|archive-date=8 March 2018}}</ref>

With the completion of the [[Old Hickory Lock and Dam|Old Hickory Dam]] in 1954, Hendersonville started to develop more rapidly, <!--Why"  -->as the lake attracted sportsmen and people seeking recreation. Since the late 20th century, it has become the most-populous city of Sumner County, and one of the most populous suburbs of Nashville, along with [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]] and [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]].<ref name="hvilletn.org"/> The city contains around 0.7% of the population of Tennessee.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Government===
Hendersonville is governed by a board of 12 aldermen and a mayor, known as the Board of Mayor and Aldermen (BOMA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hvilletn.org/mayor|website=City of Hendersonville Tennessee|accessdate=December 7, 2015|title=Mayor|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116034816/http://www.hvilletn.org/mayor|archive-date=2015-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hvilletn.org/aldermen|website=City of Hendersonville Tennessee|accessdate=December 7, 2015|title=List of Hendersonville Aldermen|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116033426/http://www.hvilletn.org/aldermen|archive-date=2015-11-16}}</ref> The aldermen are elected by district for staggered terms of four years. The mayor is elected once every four years by the whole city.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Flood scare===
In 2007 a risk was identified that the trouble-prone [[Wolf Creek Dam#Recent events|Wolf Creek Dam]] in the neighboring state of [[Kentucky]] might break, which could have resulted in a complete inundation for the lower lying parts of Hendersonville.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Since then, extensive repairs have been performed on the dam, and the maximum level of water behind it has been lowered, thus reducing the pressure of water on the structure and resolving the identified flood risk.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Board of Education===
Hendersonville's [[school]]s are governed by the Sumner County Board of Education. The twelve-member group consists of an elected representative from each of the eleven educational districts in the county, plus the Director of Schools, Del Phillips. The members serve staggered four-year terms; the Director serves under contract with the Board of Education. The board conducts monthly meetings that are open to the public. The school system's General Purpose School Fund budget during the 2013â€“14 school year was approximately $203 million.

As of 2008, the county-wide school system consisted of approximately 1,950 teacher-licensed employees and
approximately 1,800 non-teacher employees.<ref name=schoolnumbers>[http://www.sumnerschools.org/content/view/21/97/ "About Sumner County Schools."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723144159/http://www.sumnerschools.org/content/view/21/97/ |date=2010-07-23 }} Sumner County Schools.
