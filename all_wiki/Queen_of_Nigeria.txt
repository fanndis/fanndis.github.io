From 1960 to 1963, [[Elizabeth II]] was '''Queen of Nigeria''': [[Federation of Nigeria|Nigeria]] was an independent [[constitutional monarchy]]. She was also the monarch of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the [[United Kingdom]].

The [[Federation of Nigeria]] had superseded the [[Colonial Nigeria|Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]] within the [[British Empire]] on 1 October 1954. The Federation was initially a quasi-federal British colony. It became independent as a [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 1 October 1960 under the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s ''Nigeria Independence Act''. The Queen was [[head of state]], though her constitutional roles in Nigeria were mostly delegated to the [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor-General of Nigeria]].<ref name=onwuekwe>{{cite book|title=The Foundations of Nigeria: Essays in Honor of Toyin Falola|editor=Adebayo Oyebade|author=Chika B.

The retention of the monarchy was unpopular with Nigerians, and all political parties in Nigeria agreed that the country should be a republic.<ref name=onwuekwe/> Nigeria severed its relationship with the British monarchy, and adopted the [[President of Nigeria]] as head of state, on 1 October 1963,<ref name=onwuekwe/> when the [[Federation of Nigeria]] became the [[Federal Republic of Nigeria]], a republic within [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]].
