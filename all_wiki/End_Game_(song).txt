==Critical reception==
The song received positive reviews from critics, who praised its production, as well as Future's verses and his appearance. 

In a review by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', one critic wrote that "End Game" is "a song that capably absorbs and regurgitates the hybridized sounds of 2017 [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]." but also noted "there's something deeply uninspired in tasking Martin with assembling a bland composite, rather than going straight to the source—who wouldn't be at least a little curious as to what a Taylor Swift and [[Metro Boomin]] track would sound like?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/taylor-swift-end-game-ft-future-and-ed-sheeran/|title="End Game" [ft.

On January 10, 2018, Swift revealed through her social media app "The Swift Life" that the music video for the song would be released on January 12 and that the video's teaser would premiere on ''[[Good Morning America]]''. She also posted a few pictures from the video as well. The next day, Swift posted the teaser for the video on social media.<ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=A. B.

On January 12, 2018, the video debuted on Swift's [[Vevo]] channel. It is Swift's seventh video directed by [[Joseph Kahn]].

In a Miami scene, Future is seen driving a [[Lamborghini Aventador]] worth $500,000. In one of the London scenes, Swift is seen sitting on a bar playing ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]'' on a [[handheld game console]], riding a motorcycle through Tokyo while wearing a [[snakeskin]] suit, and sipping drinks through a snake straw, all references to her "snake" reputation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.clevver.com/taylor-swift-end-game-music-video-snakes/|title=Taylor Swift Made a Ton of Snake References in the "End Game" Video|last=D'Aluisio|first=Alexandra|work=Clevver|date=January 12, 2018|access-date=January 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115224813/http://www.clevver.com/taylor-swift-end-game-music-video-snakes/|archive-date=January 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The video gained 14.4&nbsp;million views within 24 hours of upload on [[YouTube]].

===Synopsis===
The music video starts off slowly with Swift looking out the window of a high-rise building, but the video picks up speed as soon as the song does. Throughout the video, Swift goes to different cities, such as Miami, Tokyo and London. In all the cities, she parties with her co-singers Future and Ed Sheeran. As she moves from city to city, she also moves from being with Future to hanging out with Ed Sheeran. Swift dresses in all black when she is with Future, and when she is filmed with Ed Sheeran, she wears a flannel shirt and shorts. The video ends by Swift and Sheeran acting playfully towards each other, with Swift stealing Sheeran's glasses and the two dancing together under the night sky of London.
