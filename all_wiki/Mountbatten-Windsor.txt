'''Mountbatten-Windsor''' is the personal surname used by some of the male-line descendants of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. Under a declaration made in Privy Council in 1960, the name ''[[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]]-[[House of Windsor|Windsor]]'' applies to male-line descendants of the Queen without royal styles and titles.<ref name="royal">{{cite web |title=The Royal Family name |url=https://www.royal.uk/royal-family-name |publisher=The British Monarchy |accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref> Individuals with royal styles do not usually use a surname, but some descendants of the Queen with royal styles have used ''Mountbatten-Windsor'' when a surname was required.

==Current use==
The British monarchy asserts that the name ''Mountbatten-Windsor'' is used by members of the Royal Family who do not have a surname, when a surname is required.<ref name=royal/> For example, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal]], children of the Queen, used the surname ''Mountbatten-Windsor'' in official marriage registry entries in 1986 and 1973 respectively.<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Mountbatten: The Official Biography'', 1985, p.682</ref> Likewise, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], used the name when filing a French lawsuit related to the topless pictures of his wife published by the French magazine ''Closer''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/william-and-kate-win-legal-battle--but-lose-war-to-keep-topless-photos-under-wraps-8153383.html|title=William and Kate win legal battle – but lose war to keep topless|last=Lichfield|first=John|date=19 September 2012|work=The Independent|access-date=28 February 2017}}</ref>

At the time of the 1960 declaration, palace officials claimed in private communications that it created a hidden surname that would emerge several generations later when some of Queen Elizabeth II's descendants were further removed from the throne.<ref> http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/TNA/HO_290_72.htm (see, in particular, the article by Edward F. Iwi).</ref> On the [[wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones]] in 1999, the Queen decided, with their agreement, that any children they might have should not be styled His or Her [[Royal Highness]].<ref>Even though such children would theoretically be a Prince or Princess under the 1917 letters patent which changed the name of the Royal House to Windsor.</ref> Consequently, the birth of their daughter in 2003 marked the first emergence of the Mountbatten-Windsor surname. Their daughter was named Louise Alice Elizabeth Mary Mountbatten-Windsor, although she goes by the courtesy title of [[Lady Louise Windsor]], her father being the [[Earl of Wessex]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1447876/Lady-Louise-heralds-return-for-Mountbattens.html|title=Lady Louise heralds return for Mountbattens|date=27 November 2003|work=The Telegraph}}</ref>

Mountbatten-Windsor differs from the official name of the [[British royal family]], which remains the [[House of Windsor]].<ref name="royal"/> In accordance with law and custom in the English-speaking world, the surname ''Mountbatten-Windsor'' belongs to all male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and is used by them if and when a surname is needed. Other male-line descendants of [[George V|King George V]], the first monarch of the House of Windsor, use ''Windsor'' as their surname if and when a surname is needed.  The surviving male-line descendants are all descendants of the King's sons [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], because King George VI had only daughters (of whom only Queen Elizabeth II is alive) and no sons, and King George V's other two sons, [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] and [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|Prince John]], left no descendants.  After the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was renamed Windsor, other descendants of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] could also use the name Windsor.  For example, [[Alastair Arthur Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], was descended from [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], but none do today because the only surviving male-line descendants are the descendants of King George V and the descendants of [[Charles Edward|Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], whose descendants use the surname Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (English) or von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha (German).
