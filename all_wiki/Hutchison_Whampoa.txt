'''Hutchison Whampoa Limited''' ('''HWL''') was an investment holding company based in Hong Kong. It was a [[Fortune Global 500]] company and one of the largest companies listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]]. HWL was an international corporation with a diverse array of holdings which included the world's biggest port, and telecommunication operations in 14 countries that were run under the '''[[Hutchison 3G|3]]''' brand. Its businesses also included retail, property development and infrastructure. 

It was 49.97% owned by the [[Cheung Kong Holdings|Cheung Kong Group]] until 3 June 2015, when the company merged with the Cheung Kong Group as part of a major reorganisation of the group's businesses. The combined business was renamed [[CK Hutchison Holdings]] Limited.

==History==
Hutchison Whampoa originated as two separate companies, both founded in the 19th century.  {{clarify|text=''[[Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock]]'' was established in 1863, by British merchant John Duflon Hutchison,|date=August 2018}} and ''Hutchison International'' was formed in 1877.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/eng/about/milestones/1828.htm |title=Hutchison-Whampoa: Milestones 1828–1959 |access-date=30 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624154722/http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/eng/about/milestones/1828.htm#1828 |archive-date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=January 2018}}

In the 1960s, Hutchison International – under [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] [[Douglas Clague|Sir Douglas Clague]] (1917–1981) – gained a controlling interest of Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/eng/about/milestones/1960.htm |title=Hutchison-Whampoa: Milestones 1960–1969 |access-date=30 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630012747/http://www.hutchison-whampoa.com/eng/about/milestones/1960.htm#1960 |archive-date=30 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and in 1977 Hutchison acquired all of that company, creating ''Hutchison Whampoa Limited''.

Although Hutchison Whampoa had a large portfolio of valuable real estate interests, in docks and retail ventures, the company eventually ran into trouble.  It was rescued by [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]], with HSBC taking a 22% stake in the company and ensuring that Clague was replaced.<ref name=otherhandover>Stephen Vines, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090780,00.html?iid=chix-sphere The Other Handover], [[Time magazine]], 6 August 2005</ref>

On 25 September 1979, at the close of trade in [[London Stock Exchange|London]], HSBC announced that it was selling its stake in Hutchison Whampoa to [[Cheung Kong Holdings|Cheung Kong]] for HK$639 million.<ref name=otherhandover/>

In March 2011, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT) announced that the company would [[Initial public offering|IPO]] through Singapore Exchange for about US$5.4 billion. This would be the largest offering in South East Asia and surpass [[Petronas Chemicals]]' offering of about $4.1 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/11/us-hutchisonport-ipo-idUKTRE72A0EE20110311|title=Hutchison ports unit prices $5.4 billion Singapore IPO: sources|first=Fiona|last=Lau}}</ref>

In January 2015, [[Li Ka-shing]] entered into talks with [[Telefónica]] to buy its British mobile division [[O2 (UK)|O2]] for around $15.4 billion<ref>{{cite news|title=Li Ka-shing in talks to buy O2 for £10bn|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30946005|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=BBC News|date=23 January 2015}}</ref> but the deal was blocked in 2016 by the EU's [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36266924|title=EU blocks Three's takeover of O2|date=11 May 2016|newspaper=BBC News: Business|access-date=5 February 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In January 2015, Li Ka Shing confirmed plans for Cheung Kong Holdings to purchase the remaining shares in Hutchison Whampoa that it did not already own, and merge the two companies as CK Hutchison Holdings. The merger is part of a larger reorganisation of Li's businesses, which will involve the spin-off of property assets into Cheung Kong Property.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yun|first1=Michelle|last2=Chan|first2=Vinicy|title=Cheung Kong to Buy Out Hutchison in $24 Billion Restructuring|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-09/cheung-kong-to-buy-out-hutchison-whampoa-spin-off-property-arm|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=Bloomberg Business|date=9 January 2015}}</ref> The new holding company has been incorporated in the [[Cayman Islands]], rather than Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sito|first1=Peggy|last2=Li|first2=Sandy|title=Li Ka-shing's two firms set for merger as Cheung Kong shareholders approve revamp|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/1722910/cheung-kong-shares-suspended-shareholders-meet-talk-revamp|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=South China Morning Post|date=25 February 2015}}</ref>

In May 2015, Hutchison revealed plans to sell one-third of its stake in its British-based mobile phone businesses for a potential fee of $4.3 billion to five investors including [[GIC Private Limited]], [[Canada Pension Plan Investment Board]], [[Abu Dhabi Investment Authority]], [[BTG Pactual]] and [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Elzio Barreto |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/08/hutchisonwhampoa-uk-idUSL4N0XZ18A20150508 |title=Hutchison to sell one-third stake in UK mobile unit for $4.3 bln |publisher=Reuters |date=7 May 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref>
