'''Antonio Palocci Filho''' (born 4 October 1960) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]] and [[politician]], and formerly [[Chief of Staff of Brazil]] under President [[Dilma Rousseff]]. He was the [[finance minister]] of the [[Brazil]]ian federal government from 1 January 2003 to 27 March 2006, when he resigned in the wake of reports of conduct unbecoming of his office during the presidency of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. He resigned as Chief of Staff on 7 June 2011.

==Early life and career==
Palocci was raised in [[Ribeirão Preto]], in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. His father was an [[artist]] and [[teacher]]. During his youth as a medical student at the [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto|University of São Paulo’s Ribeirão Preto Medical School]], Palocci took part in several radical movements. He was one of the founders of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] and was its president in [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] from 1997 to 1998.

After graduation, Palocci worked for five years as a [[civil servant]] at the [[Ribeirão Preto]] regional office of the São Paulo State Public Health Secretariat. He implemented the Workers’ Health Ward and was the director of the regional office of the public health service.

When Palocci was 28 years old, after occupying positions in various [[labour union]]s, including the [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores|CUT]] (linked to the Workers Party) he ran for election as a city councilman (''[[:wikt:vereador|vereador]]'') for the first time. Since then, Palocci has never lost an election. However, he completed only one of his terms (as [[mayor]] of Ribeirão Preto, from 1993 to 1996.

==Political career==
Palocci was elected [[City council|councilman]] in Ribeirão Preto in 1988. He did not finish his term but stepped down to for the office of state deputy and won. In 1992, he resigned his term as deputy to become mayor of [[Ribeirão Preto]], after winning the local election. It is during his administrations as mayor that Palocci is alleged to have led a major [[slush fund]] operation (see below) for the Workers' Party, a scheme denounced by a former secretary, {{ILL|Rogério Buratti|pt}}.

In 1995, he received the [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]’s ''Child and Peace'' prize for his work for the rights of infants and adolescents. In 1996, he received the ''Juscelino Kubitscheck Award'' from [[Serviço Brasileiro de Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas|SEBRAE]]-SP, the São Paulo chapter of the ''Serviço Brasileiro de Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas'' (Brazilian Service for Assistance to Small Businesses), for being the mayor of the city in São Paulo state who offered the best support to small business. In 2002, he received the ''Mário Covas Award'' from SEBRAE again for his work on behalf of local small businesses.

Palocci was elected federal deputy in 1998. In 2000, he resigned his office so that he could run again in the mayoral election in Ribeirão Preto. He won the election, and was again mayor of Ribeirão Preto from 2001 to 2002. He resigned in 2002 to work on [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s campaign for the Brazilian presidency. In 2003, when Lula was elected, Palocci officially resigned as the mayor of Ribeirão Preto, was nominated the Finance Minister of Brazil and became a key figure in the new government.

Along with former minister [[José Dirceu]] (who resigned and subsequently lost his political rights due to involvement with the [[Mensalão scandal]]), Palocci was considered one of the most influential and strong ministers of Lula’s government.

On 1 January 2011, President [[Dilma Rousseff]] appointed him Chief of Staff. He resigned in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13691401 |title=Brazil's chief minister Antonio Palocci resigns |date=8 June 2011 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

==Ministerial abuse of power ==
{{See also|Abuse of power|Lava Jato}}
A new scandal began to unfold in 2006 after a parliamentary inquiry heard testimony from two witnesses who claimed that the minister might have visited a [[manor house]] in Brasília suspected of functioning as a hub for fraudulent operations within the government, with the participation of some of his closest aides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n07/perry-anderson/lulas-brazil|title=Lula's Brazil |author=Perry Anderson Palocci |publisher=London Review of Books|date=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Palocci had previously claimed that he had never been to that house. 

The main witness in the case was Francenildo Costa, the groundskeeper of the property. He believed the minister had visited the house "on at least ten occasions" and said he recognized Palocci as the man he had seen in the meetings of governmental officials at the house.

A few days after Costa's deposition, his bank statement (from government-run [[Caixa Econômica Federal]]) was leaked to the press. It indicated that the groundskeeper had a balance of R$38,860 (about US$18,000.00), which would be incompatible with his income. Congressmen argued that this questionable balance implies bribery potential for contradicting the minister, apparently in an attempt to tarnish the Minister's credibility as a [[witness]]. The groundskeeper justified the figures by claiming that the money had been deposited by his alleged biological father, a relatively well-off businessman from the state of [[Piauí]], in order to prevent a legal dispute over [[Paternity (law)|paternity]]. 

Costa's explanation was promptly accepted but not further investigated. The court, the Right wing opposition, and the corporate media turned their full attention to the leaking of the bank statement as a breach of Costa's financial [[privacy]] rights. The Right wing opposition and a great part of the corporate media called the release of Costa's bank statement state-orchestrated harassment. The [[Federal Police of Brazil]] began an investigation into the case, which soon spiraled into a media circus for the Labor Party: officials and directors at the Caixa Econômica Federal confessed to releasing Costa's bank statement. The alleged chain of command went up as far as the [[Ministry of Finance (Brazil)|Ministry of Finance]], and the bank's chairman said that he handed the details of the account to Palocci personally. The minister denied this, but resigned on March 27, 2006, and was replaced by economist [[Guido Mantega]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u77004.shtml|title=Ententa o chamado "caseirogate" e a cronologia dos fatos que derubbaram Palocci|language=pt|trans-title=Understand the so-called "caseirogate"and the chronology of the facts that demolished Paloccio|date=27 March 2008|accessdate=12 April 2017}}</ref>
