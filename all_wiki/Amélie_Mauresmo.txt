'''Amélie Simone Mauresmo''' ({{IPA-fr|ameli simɔn moʁɛsmo}}; born 5 July 1979) is a French retired professional [[tennis]] player and former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]]. Mauresmo won two [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, at the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and at [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], and also won the silver medal in singles at the [[Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]].

Mauresmo first attained the top ranking on 13 September 2004, holding it for five weeks on that occasion. She was the fifteenth World No. 1 in women's tennis since the computer rankings began. She is well known for her powerful one-handed backhand and strong net play. She officially announced her retirement from professional tennis on 3 December 2009, ending a career of fifteen years. In 2010 she started her career as a coach for several [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] and [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] players, including [[Andy Murray]].

Mauresmo was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 2015.

==Early life==
Mauresmo was born in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], slightly northwest of [[Paris]]. She began playing tennis at the age of four, after being inspired by [[Yannick Noah]]'s win in the [[1983 French Open]] on television. It was after his win that Mauresmo's parents bought her her first tennis racket. Later on in 1998 Yannick Noah picked her on the [[France Fed Cup team|French team]] for the [[Fed Cup]]. Her mother Françoise is a housewife and her father Francis, who died in March 2004, was an engineer. She has a brother, Fabien, who is an engineer.

In 1996, Mauresmo captured both the junior [[1996 French Open|French Open]] and [[1996 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] women's singles titles. She was named 1996 Junior World Champion by the [[International Tennis Federation]].

==Player career==
The unseeded Mauresmo reached the [[1999 Australian Open|Australian Open final in 1999]] with wins over three seeded players, including world no. 1 [[Lindsay Davenport]], before falling to world no. 2 [[Martina Hingis]]. Mauresmo was only the second Frenchwoman ever to reach the Australian Open final; ([[Mary Pierce]] was the first, winning the championship in 1995). She was only the third Frenchwoman to reach any [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] final during the [[Tennis Open Era|Open Era]].

Mauresmo defeated Hingis later in the year, en route to the final of the [[Open Gaz de France|Paris indoor]] event.

After the defeat of Davenport at the Australian Open, Mauresmo, 19 at the time, [[coming out|came out]] as [[gay]] to the international press.<ref name=cobio>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaysports.com/page.cfm?Sectionid=31&typeofsite=storydetail&ID=642&storyset=yes |title=GaySports - Gay Tennis - Lesbian Tennis - gay and lesbian sports site, for sports enthusiasts and athletes worldwide.

===2004: Olympic Silver, world No.1===
Mauresmo reached the semifinals at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where she lost to [[Serena Williams]] in three sets after winning the first set and up a break in the second set. She reached the quarterfinals of the three other [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments and won three [[Tier I]] titles in [[Rome Masters|Rome]], [[Qatar Telecom German Open|Berlin]], and [[Canada Masters|Montreal]].

Mauresmo won a silver medal in singles at the [[2004 Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in Athens, where she was defeated by Belgian [[Justine Henin]] in the final.

On 13 September 2004, Mauresmo became the first French tennis player to become world no. 1 since the computer rankings began in the 1970s. She held that ranking for five weeks and was the second woman, after [[Kim Clijsters]], to have attained the top spot without having won a Grand Slam title.

===2005: WTA Tour Championship crown===
Mauresmo reached the quarter-finals of the [[2005 Australian Open|Australian Open]], but was defeated there by eventual champion [[Serena Williams]].

At the [[2005 French Open|French Open]], seeded third, Mauresmo was upset in the third round by the then little-known 17-year-old [[Ana Ivanovic]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia]] in three sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4590387.stm |title=Serbian starlet shocks Mauresmo |work=BBC News |date=28 May 2005 |access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref> Mauresmo had, at the Australian Open earlier in the year, become the first player to defeat the Serb in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, winning in straight sets also in the third round.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-01-21/mauresmo-through-after-second-set-tussle/623340 Mauresmo through after second set tussle], ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)</ref>

At the [[2005 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Mauresmo lost in the quarterfinals to [[Mary Pierce]] in straight sets. That followed a semifinal loss to [[Lindsay Davenport]] at [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]].
[[File:Amelie Mauresmo Australian Open 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mauresmo at the [[2005 Australian Open]]]]

Mauresmo claimed her first singles title at the [[2005 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]]. She defeated Pierce in the final after losing to Pierce in a round-robin match at that tournament, in three sets.

===2006: Two Grand Slam titles, back to No. 1===
At the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Mauresmo captured her first [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title, defeating Belgian former world No. 1 players [[Kim Clijsters]] and [[Justine Henin]] en route. Both opponents retired from their respective matches, Clijsters with a right ankle sprain in the third set of their semifinal and Henin from [[gastroenteritis]] in the final. Mauresmo was leading in both matches at the time of the retirements, by 6–1, 2–0 against Henin.

Mauresmo then won her next two tournaments, the [[Open Gaz de France]] tournament in Paris (defeating [[Mary Pierce]] in the final) and the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in Antwerp (defeating Clijsters in the final).

At the [[Qatar Total Open]] in [[Doha]], Mauresmo defeated [[Martina Hingis]] in a semifinal, 6–2, 6–2, but lost to [[Nadia Petrova]] in the final. Had she won the final, she would have immediately regained the world no. 1 ranking from Clijsters. Nonetheless, the outcome was sufficient to ensure Mauresmo's return to the world number-one ranking on 20 March 2006.

Mauresmo then reached the semifinals of the [[Sony Ericsson Open]] in [[Key Biscayne, Florida]], where she lost to the eventual champion [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]].

Mauresmo lost in the fourth round of the [[2006 French Open|French Open]] to [[Czechs|Czech]] teenager [[Nicole Vaidišová]], 6–7, 6–1, 6–2. Mauresmo next suffered a first-round loss at the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] [[The Hastings Direct International Championships|warm-up tournament in Eastbourne]]. However, Mauresmo and Kuznetsova won the doubles title there, their first as a team and Mauresmo's second overall.

Mauresmo was the top seed at [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]. She defeated [[Anastasia Myskina]] in a quarterfinal and [[Maria Sharapova]] in a semifinal, and then came back from one set down to defeat Henin in the final 2–6, 6–3, 6–4. The victory was Mauresmo's second Grand Slam singles title and the first on grass. She was also the first Frenchwoman since [[Suzanne Lenglen]] to win Wimbledon. She remains the most recent woman to win Wimbledon with a single-handed backhand. The [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] final was notable because it was the first and only time in the decade that neither Williams sister qualified for the final.

She then pulled out of the [[Fed Cup]] World Group I playoff tie against the [[Czech Republic Fed Cup team|Czech Republic]] due to a groin injury sustained during Wimbledon. She also withdrew from the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] in Montreal.

Her next tournament was the [[Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], where she lost in the quarterfinals to [[Lindsay Davenport]], 4–6, 5–7.

At the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Mauresmo lost to Sharapova in the semifinals 0–6, 6–4, 0–6. This was the first time in the open era that a female had lost two sets at love in a US Open semifinal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/open/2006-09-08-day-12_x.htm?POE=SPOISVA |title=Sharapova stops No. 1 Mauresmo, will meet Henin-Hardenne in U.S. Open final |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=8 September 2006 |access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref>

Mauresmo then reached the final of the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]], losing to Kuznetsova. During the tournament, Mauresmo won 137 ranking points to help preserve her world no. 1 ranking and ended a nine-match losing streak to Davenport stretching back to January 2000 in Sydney.

To conclude the year, Mauresmo reached the final of the [[WTA Tour Championships]] in Madrid, losing to Henin, 4–6, 3–6. Mauresmo finished the year ranked world No. 3, behind Henin and Sharapova.

===2007: Out of the top 5===
Mauresmo started the year in Australia with a quarterfinal loss to [[Jelena Janković]] [[Medibank International|at the tournament in Sydney]]. At the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], Mauresmo lost in the fourth round to [[Lucie Šafářová]], 4–6, 3–6, after winning her first three matches in straight sets.
[[File:Mauresmo Wimbledon 2007 003.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Mauresmo at Wimbledon 2007]]

Mauresmo's next tournament was the [[Open Gaz de France]], where she lost in the semifinals to [[Nadia Petrova]], 7–5, 4–6, 6–7, after Mauresmo led 4–1 in the final set and had a match point in the tiebreak. This was Mauresmo's third loss in the last four matches with Petrova. In her next tournament at the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in [[Antwerp, Belgium]], Mauresmo defeated [[Kim Clijsters]] in the final.

She also withdrew from the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]] in [[Amelia Island, Florida]] for the same reason. Although she had resumed training, she was not fit enough to compete at the [[J & S Cup]] in [[Warsaw, Poland]].

At the [[Qatar Telecom German Open]] in Berlin, Mauresmo lost in the third round to [[Julia Vakulenko]] of [[Ukraine]], and at the [[Rome Masters|Internazionali d'Italia]] in Rome, she lost in the second round to Australian [[Samantha Stosur]], 7–5, 7–6<sup>(4)</sup>, 6–7<sup>(7)</sup>, after Mauresmo led 5–3 in the third set.

Mauresmo lost to Czech [[Lucie Šafářová]] in the third round, 3–6, 6–7<sup>(4)</sup>, committing eight double faults and 49 unforced errors.

After losing to Henin in the final of the [[International Women's Open]] in [[Eastbourne]], 5–7, 7–6, 6–7, after being up 4–1 in the deciding set, defending champion Mauresmo went into [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] saying that she was ready to win another major title. However, she lost her fourth round match against Czech teen [[Nicole Vaidišová]], 6–7, 6–4, 1–6. The loss dropped her to world No. 6, her first time outside the top five since November 2003.

Mauresmo withdrew from the last [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament of the year, the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], because of a lack of fitness.

At [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], Mauresmo lost in the third round to two-time former champion [[Serena Williams]], 6–7, 1–6.

On 9 May 2016, Mauresmo announced that she had stepped down as Murray's coach.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matias |last=Grez |title=Andy Murray and coach Amelie Mauresmo 'mutually agree' to end partnership |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/09/tennis/andy-murray-splits-coach-amelie-mauresmo/ |website=CNN |date=9 May 2016 |access-date=23 May 2016}}</ref>

Simultaneously, she had captained the [[France Fed Cup team]] since 2013. After the [[2016 Fed Cup|2016 final]], which they lost to the Czech Republic, she announced she was quitting that post due to her pregnancy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Amelie Mauresmo steps down as France's Fed Cup captain |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/11/mauresmo-steps-down-as-frances-fed-cup-captain/62417/ |work=tennis.com |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=14 November 2016}}</ref>

===2018===
In June 2018 she was appointed captain of the [[France Davis Cup team]] for the following season. Nevertheless, she never came to fulfill this position, since at the end of the year she renounced in order to coach French player [[Lucas Pouille]] during the 2019 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Amelie Mauresmo withdraws as France Davis Cup captain to coach Lucas Pouille |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/46476492 |work=[[BBC]] |date=6 December 2018}}</ref>

===2019===
Under Mauresmo's coaching, Pouille, who had never previously won a match at the [[Australian Open]], reached the semifinals of the [[2019 Australian Open|2019 edition]], where he lost to eventual champion [[Novak Djokovic]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Australian Open 2019: Lucas Pouille praises coach Amelie Mauresmo |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/46974980 |work=[[BBC]] |date=23 January 2019}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Mauresmo was an aggressive player with an all-court game, who was noted for her technical mastery. Her strongest groundstroke was her one-handed backhand, which was one of the most effective on the WTA tour. Mauresmo could hit her backhand flat and with depth, with topspin, or with slice; her backhand was responsible for most of the winners she accumulated on court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/nov/26/tennis.features1|title=Tennis: How Amelie Mauresmo overcame the jibes about her sexuality|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 November 2006|access-date=16 July 2020}}</ref> Her forehand was more erratic, and players acquainted with Mauresmo's game would hit relentlessly to her forehand to try to force an error. Throughout her career, however, Mauresmo made improvements to her forehand, and, by 2005, it became a stroke she utilised more frequently and with more success. Her serve was powerful, with her first serve averaging 107 mph (172 km/h), and being recorded as high as 116 mph (186 km/h), enabling her to serve aces regularly. A reliable second serve, typically delivered at 92 mph (148 km/h), meant that double faults were uncommon. Mauresmo was one of the strongest net players on the WTA tour, and would frequently choose to finish points at the net. An exceptional volleyer, she had deft touch at the net, and had a complete repertoire of shots to perform there. Although not a net-rusher like [[Martina Navratilova]] or [[Billie Jean King]], Mauresmo was a proficient [[serve-and-volley|serve and volleyer]]; this tactic was especially effective on grass courts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/270291-amelie-mauresmo-leaving-tennis-behind|title=Amelie Mauresmo: Leaving Tennis Behind?|work=Bleacher Report|date=11 October 2009|access-date=16 July 2020}}</ref> She was an aggressive returner, standing on the baseline to receive first serves, neutralising them effectively with a backhand down-the-line or an inside-out forehand. She would stand several feet within the baseline to receive second serves, and could hit return winners frequently. Despite her exceptional skill, Mauresmo's greatest weakness was her lack of confidence, nerves, and inconsistency; these were discussed at length by the media throughout her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/mauresmo-settles-the-nerves-1.1028532|title=Mauresmo settles the nerves|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=10 July 2006|access-date=16 July 2020}}</ref> Mauresmo's game was effective on all surfaces, and she won tournaments on all four surfaces.

==Performance at Grand Slam tournaments==
Although Mauresmo had been one of the top singles players for several years, she did not have success in winning [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments until 2006. Mauresmo was criticized for her mental strength after succumbing to nerves in those events. In consecutive [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] semifinals, she lost to [[Serena Williams]] and [[Lindsay Davenport]] after leading comfortably. Before her [[2006 Australian Open]] title, Mauresmo was often touted as "the greatest women's player never to win a Grand Slam."<ref>{{cite news|last=Robson |first=Douglas |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/open/2006-08-27-mauresmo_x.htm |title=Mauresmo's stock can rise, fall in NYC |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=27 August 2006 |access-date=4 June 2012}}</ref> After winning the [[2006 Wimbledon]] title, Mauresmo openly joked, "I don't want anyone to talk about my nerves any more."{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Mauresmo is one of several tennis players, male or female, to have reached the top ranking without first winning a Grand Slam singles title. Other players who had done so were [[Kim Clijsters]], [[Ivan Lendl]], [[Marcelo Ríos]], [[Jelena Janković]], [[Dinara Safina]], [[Caroline Wozniacki]], [[Karolina Pliskova]] and [[Simona Halep]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Personal life==
On 16 August 2015, Mauresmo announced that she had given birth to a baby boy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/17/tennis/tennis-djokovic-murray-bencic-duplicate-2/ |title=Andy Murray: Scot dedicates win to new Mum Amelie Mauresmo |work=CNN |date=17 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2015/08/amelie-mauresmo-gives-birth-first-child/55948/#.VdKCvvlViko |title=Mauresmo gives birth to first child, a boy |last1=Tennis.com |date=17 August 2015}}</ref> She gave birth to her daughter, Ayla, in April 2017.<ref>{{cite news|work=ESPN.com|title=Amelie Mauresmo announces birth of second child|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/19247477/amelie-mauresmo-announces-birth-second-child|date=26 April 2017}}</ref>

==Equipment and endorsements==
Mauresmo's apparel and footwear on court was manufactured by [[Nike Inc.|Nike]], and later [[Reebok]]. In the early 2000s, she used [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] 200G+1.00 racquet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2001/06/20010625/This-Weeks-Issue/What-Theyre-Wearing-And-Hitting-With-At-Wimbledon.aspx |title=What they're wearing (and hitting with) at Wimbledon|publisher=SportsBusiness Journal |date=25 June 2001 |access-date=10 September 2014 }}</ref>
