'''Anti-Americanism''' (also called '''anti-American sentiment''' and '''Americanophobia''')<ref>Denis Lacorne, "Anti-Americanism and Americanophobia: A French Perspectives." (2005).</ref> is a sentiment which espouses dislike of the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]] or opposes its policies, especially its [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]], or espouses dislike or hatred of the [[Americans|American people]] and the [[United States]] in general.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chiozza |first=Giacomo |title=Anti-Americanism and the World Order |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore, Maryland |date=2009}}</ref>

Political scientist Brendon O'Connor of the [[United States Studies Centre]] in [[Australia]] suggests that "anti-Americanism" cannot be isolated as a consistent phenomenon, since the term originated as a rough composite of [[stereotype]]s, [[prejudice]]s, and criticisms which evolved into more politically-based criticisms. French scholar Marie-France Toinet says that use of the term "anti-Americanism" is "only fully justified if it implies systematic opposition – a sort of allergic reaction – to America as a whole."<ref name="OConnor">{{cite journal |last=O'Connor |first=Brendan |title=A Brief History of Anti-Americanism from Cultural Criticism to Terrorism |pages=77–92 |journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies |volume=23 |number=1 |publisher=[[The University of Sydney]] |date=July 2004 |url= http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/1_04/OConnor.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130521145809/http://www.anzasa.arts.usyd.edu.au/a.j.a.s/Articles/1_04/OConnor.pdf |archive-date=21 May 2013 |jstor=41053968}}</ref>

Discussions on anti-Americanism have in most cases lacked a precise explanation of what the sentiment entails (other than a general disfavor), which has led the term to be used broadly and in an impressionistic manner, resulting in the inexact impressions of the many expressions described as anti-American.<ref>O'Connor, Brendan, p 89.</ref> Author and [[expatriate]] William Russell Melton described that criticism for the United States largely originates from the perception that the U.S. wants to act as a "world policeman".<ref>William Russell Melton.

==Etymology==
In the online [[Oxford Dictionaries]] the term "anti-Americanism" is defined as "Hostility to the interests of the United States".<ref name="Oxforddictionaries.com">{{cite web |title=anti-americanism: definition of anti-Americanism in English by Oxford dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=11 August 2014 |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anti-americanism |access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref>

In the first edition of Webster's [[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language]] (1828) the term "anti-American" was defined as "opposed to America, or to the true interests or government of the United States; opposed to the revolution in America".<ref>{{cite web |title=The ARTFL Project – Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913+1828) |publisher=Machaut.uchicago.edu |url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&word=antiamerican&use1913=on&use1828=on |access-date=11 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120305190842/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&word=antiamerican&use1913=on&use1828=on |archive-date=5 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In France the use of the noun form ''antiaméricanisme'' has been cataloged from 1948,<ref name="ReferenceA">Le Petit Robert {{ISBN|2-85036-668-4}}</ref> entering ordinary political language in the 1950s.<ref name="introductory excerpt">Roger, Phillipe.

Some have attempted to recognize both positions. French academic Pierre Guerlain has argued that the term represents two very different tendencies: "One systematic or essentialist, which is a form of prejudice targeting all Americans. The other refers to the way criticisms of the United States are labeled 'anti-American' by supporters of U.S. policies in an ideological bid to discredit their opponents".<ref>{{cite web |title=Pierre Guerlain, ''A Tale of Two Anti-Americanisms'' |publisher=European Journal of American Studies, ejas.revues.org |year=2007 |url=http://ejas.revues.org/document1523.html |access-date=11 May 2012}}</ref> Guerlain argues that these two "ideal types" of anti-Americanism can sometimes merge, thus making discussion of the phenomenon particularly difficult.

The theory originated with [[Comte de Buffon]], a leading French naturalist, in his ''[[Histoire Naturelle]]'' (1766).<ref name=Goldstein/> The French writer [[Voltaire]] joined Buffon and others in making the argument.<ref name=Meunier/> [[Dutch Republic|Dutchman]] [[Cornelius de Pauw]], court philosopher to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] became its leading proponent.<ref name=Ceaser/> While Buffon focused on the American biological environment, de Pauw attacked people native to the continent.<ref name=Popkin/> James Ceaser has noted that the denunciation of America as inferior to Europe was in part motivated by the German government's fear of mass [[emigration]]; de Pauw was called on to convince the Germans that the new world was inferior. De Pauw is also known to have influenced the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in a similar direction.<ref>{{cite book|first1= Brendan|last1 = O'Connor|last2=Griffiths|first2=Martin|title = Anti-Americanism – Historical Perspectives|year = 2007|page =8 |isbn = 9781846450259|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KF0pySH-ozsC&pg=PA8}}</ref>

De Pauw said that the New World was unfit for human habitation because it was, "so ill-favored by nature that all it contains is either degenerate or monstrous". He asserted that, "the earth, full of putrefaction, was flooded with lizards, snakes, serpents, reptiles and insects". Taking a long-term perspective he announced that he was, "certain that the conquest of the New World...has been the greatest of all misfortunes to befall mankind".<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''The Old World's New World'' (1991) p 6</ref>

The theory made it easier to argue that the natural environment of the United States would prevent it from ever producing true culture. Echoing de Pauw, the [[Encyclopédie|French Encyclopedist]] [[Abbé Raynal]] wrote in 1770, "America has not yet produced a good poet, an able mathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single science".<ref>{{cite book|author=James W.

One critic, citing Raynal's ideas, suggests that it was specifically extended to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would become the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Danzer | first =Gerald A. |date=February 1974 | title =Has the Discovery of America Been Useful or Hurtful to Mankind?

Roger suggests that the idea of degeneracy posited a symbolic, as well as a scientific, America that would evolve beyond the original thesis. He argues that Buffon's ideas formed the root of a "stratification of negative discourses" that has recurred throughout the two countries' relationship (and has been matched by persistent [[Francophobia]] in the United States).<ref name=Granthem/>

According to Brendan O'Connor, some Europeans criticized Americans for lacking "taste, grace and civility," and having a brazen and arrogant character.<ref name="OConnor"/> British author [[Frances Trollope]] observed in her 1832 book ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'', that the greatest difference between the [[English people|English]] and [[Americans]] was "want of refinement", explaining: "that polish[,] which removes the coarser and rougher parts of our nature[,] is unknown and undreamed of" in America.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trollope|first=Fanny|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10345/pg10345-images.html|title=Domestic Manners of the Americans|date=2003-11-30|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|access-date=2019-06-28}}<br />

==== Politics and ideology ====
The young United States also faced criticism on political and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of [[reason]] and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] American project. The German poet [[Nikolaus Lenau]] commented: "With the expression ''Bodenlosigkeit'' (absence of ground), I think I am able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme". Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada nor Mexico.<ref name="Ceaser"/> Lenau had [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated]] to the United States in 1833 and found that the country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the U.S. were the subject of a novel titled ''The America-exhaustion'' (''Der Amerika-Müde'') (1855) by fellow German [[Ferdinand Kürnberger]].<ref>''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1974) edited by William Rose Bennet: 556</ref>

The nature of American [[democracy]] was also questioned. The sentiment was that the country lacked "[a] monarch, aristocracy, strong traditions, official religion, or rigid class system," according to Judy Rubin, and its democracy was attacked by some Europeans in the early nineteenth century as degraded, a travesty, and a failure.<ref name="Rubin"/> The [[French Revolution]], which was loathed by many European conservatives, also implicated the United States and the idea of creating a constitution on abstract and universal principles.<ref name="Ceaser"/> That the country was intended to be a bastion of liberty was also seen as fraudulent given that it had been established with [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].<ref name="Schama"/> "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?" asked [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1775.<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Brent |title=Give Us Liberty |work=The New York Times |date=4 June 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/books/review/04staples.html |access-date=26 May 2008}}</ref> He famously stated, that "I am willing to love all mankind, except an American".<ref name="Rubin"/>

=== 20th century ===

==== Intellectuals ====
[[File:Vreeswijk Akerstrom Cervin 1965.jpg|thumb|Protest march against the [[Vietnam War]] in Stockholm, Sweden, 1965]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] was vehemently anti-American. Historian [[Peter Gay]] says that in "slashing away at Americans wholesale; quite indiscriminately, with imaginative ferocity, Freud was ventilating some inner need". Gay suggests that Freud's anti-Americanism was not really about the United States at all.<ref>{{cite book|author=C.

Numerous authors went on the attack. French writer [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]] denounced the United States. German poet [[Rainer Marie Rilke]] wrote, "I no longer love Paris, partly because it is disfiguring and [[Americanization|Americanizing]] itself".<ref name="C. Vann Woodward 1992 34">{{cite book|author=C. Vann Woodward|title=The Old World's New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gW64cHXNrRsC&pg=PA33|year=1992|page=34|isbn=9780199879144}}</ref>

==== Communist critiques ====
Until its demise in 1991, the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Communist state|communist nations]] emphasized [[capitalism]] as the great enemy of [[communism]], and identified the United States as the leader of capitalism. They sponsored anti-Americanism among followers and sympathizers. Russell A. Berman notes that in the mid-19th century, "[[Karl Marx|Marx]] himself largely admired the dynamism of American capitalism and democracy and did not participate in the anti-Americanism that came to be the hallmark of Communist ideology in the twentieth century".<ref>{{cite book|author=Russell A. Berman|title=Anti-Americanism in Europe: A Cultural Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8687I9FjRm8C&pg=PT58 |year=2004 |publisher=Hoover Press|page=58|isbn=9780817945121}}</ref> O'Connor argues that, "communism represented the starkest version of anti-Americanism – a coherent world view that challenged the [[free market]], private property, [[limited government]], and [[individualism]]".<ref>{{cite book|author=Brendan O'Conner|title=The Rise of Anti-Americanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=au8edbGaTGQC&pg=PA183|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|page=183|isbn=9780203028780}}</ref>

Authors in the [[Western world|West]], such as [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] criticized the U.S. and reached a large audience on the [[Far-left politics|far left]].<ref name="C. Vann Woodward 1992 34"/> In his ''Anti-Americanism'' (2003), French writer [[Jean François Revel]] argues that anti-Americanism emerges primarily from [[anti-capitalism]], and this critique also comes from non-communist, totalitarian regimes.

The [[East Germany|East German]] regime imposed an official anti-American ideology that was reflected in all its media and all the schools. Anyone who expressed support for the west would be investigated by the [[Stasi]] (secret police).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The official line followed [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] theory of [[imperialism]] as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov's]] theory of [[fascism]] as the dictatorship of the most [[reactionary]] elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering for the benefit of the "terrorist international of murderers on [[Wall Street]]".<ref>Rainer Schnoor, "The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR," in Detlef Junker, et al. eds. ''The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945–1968: A Handbook, Vol. 2: 1968–1990''  (2004)  pp 618–626, quotation on page 619.</ref>

East Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the Americans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} However Schnoor argues that few East Germans believed it. They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945—a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American [[Radio Free Europe]] broadcasts, and [[West Germany|West German]] media. The official communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and [[rock and roll]]. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched for any sign of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, the latter of which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the [[Berlin Wall|Berlin wall]] in 1961.<ref>Schnoor, "The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR," 2:618-26</ref>

==== Fascist critiques ====
{{Further|Melting pot}}
Drawing on the ideas of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882), [[Fascism in Europe|European fascists]] decried the supposed degenerating effect of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] on the [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial mix]] of the American population. The [[Nazism|Nazi]] philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]] argued that race mixture in the United States made it inferior to racially pure nations.<ref name=hatingamerica/>{{rp|91–2}}

[[Anti-Semitism]] was another factor in these critiques. The view that the U.S. was controlled by a [[Zionist Occupied Government|Jewish conspiracy]] through a [[Jewish lobby]] was common in countries ruled by fascists before and during [[World War II]].<ref name=hatingamerica/>{{rp|91–7}} Jews, the assumed puppet masters behind supposed American plans for world domination, were also seen as using jazz in a crafty plan to eliminate racial distinctions;<ref name=hatingamerica/>{{rp|91–7}} [[Adolf Hitler]] dismissed the threat of the United States as a credible enemy of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] because of its incoherent racial mix; he saw Americans as a "mongrel race", "half-Judaized" and "half-Negrified".<ref name=hatingamerica/>{{rp|94–7}}

In an address to the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] on 11 December 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States and lambasted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]:

{{quote|He [Roosevelt] was strengthened in this [political diversion] by the circle of Jews surrounding him, who, with Old Testament-like fanaticism, believe that the United States can be the instrument for preparing another [[Purim]] for the European nations that are becoming increasingly [[anti-Semitic]]. It was the Jew, in his full Satanic vileness, who rallied around this man [Roosevelt], but to whom this man also reached out.<ref>Saul Friedlander (2008) ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939–1945''.

===== "Liberators" poster =====
[[File:Liberators-Kultur-Terror-Anti-Americanism-1944-Nazi-Propaganda-Poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|1944]] [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|German propaganda]] poster aimed at the Dutch, from a Norwegian World War II poster by [[Harald Damsleth]]]]

The "Liberators" poster that was distributed by the Nazis to a Dutch audience in 1944 displays multiple elements of anti-American attitudes promoted by the Nazis. The title ''Liberators'' refers to a common Allied justification for attacking Germany (and possibly the American [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers as well), and the poster depicts this "liberation" as the destruction of European cities. The artist was [[Harald Damsleth]], a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] who worked for the [[Nasjonal Samling|NS]] in [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]].

Motifs contained in this poster include:

* The decadence of [[beauty pageant]]s (scantily-clad "[[Miss America]]" and "Miss Victory", "The World's Most Beautiful Leg") – or more generally, the putative sexual laxness of American women. The "[[Miss America]]" beauty pageant in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] had expanded during the war and was used to sell [[war bond]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Susan Dworkin|title=Miss America, 1945: Bess Myerson and the Year That Changed Our Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ifd8I17iWbgC&pg=PA97|year=1999|publisher=Newmarket Press|pages=97–98|isbn=9781557043818}}</ref>
* Gangsterism and [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] (the arm of an escaped convict holding a [[Thompson submachine gun|submachine gun]]).

* Anti-black violence (a [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] noose, a [[Ku Klux Klan]] hood).

* General violence of American society, in addition to the above (boxing-glove which grasps the money-bag). The theme of a violent American frontier was well known in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jason Pierce|title=Making the White Man's West: Whiteness and the Creation of the American West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PG4siz5bDCIC&pg=PA91|year=2008|page=91|isbn=9780549963516}}</ref>
* Americans as Indian savages and as a mockery of American genocide over Natives as well as land-theft, since it is a chieftain symbol here used as a fashion trinket. ("Miss America" wears plains-Indian head-dress).
* The capitalism, pure [[materialism]] and [[commercialism]] of America, to the detriment of any spirit or soul (money bag with "$" symbol). The materialism of America contrasted with the spiritual depth of European high culture is a common trope, especially in [[Scandinavia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Ekman Jørgensen|title=Transformations and Crises: The Left and the Nation in Denmark and Sweden, 1956–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dS3lKQJkxYC&pg=PA66|year=2008|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=66–67|isbn=9781845453664}}</ref>
* Anti-semitism appears in most Nazi-generated images of America. A Jewish banker is seen behind the money.
* The presence of [[African Americans|blacks in America]] equals its "mongrelization", adding undesirably "primitive" elements to American popular culture, and constituting a potential danger to the white race (strongly muscular arms of a black male, a stereotypically-caricatured black couple dancing the "[[Jitterbug]] – Triumph of Civilization" in birdcage, which is portrayed as a degraded animalistic ritual). The degradation of culture, especially through [[miscegenation]], resonated with European anxieties, especially in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank Trommler|author2=Elliott Shore|title=The German-American Encounter: Conflict and Cooperation Between Two Cultures, 1800–2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0703VRj7tUC&pg=PA275|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=275|isbn=9781571812902}}</ref>
* Decadence of American popular culture, and its pernicious influence on the rest of the world (dancing of jitterbug, hand holds phonograph record, figure of a European gullible "all-ears" dupe in lower foreground). The growing popularity of American music and dancing among young people had ignited a "[[moral panic]]" among conservative Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1950, prosperity and welfare. 4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZfvCVndvXoC&pg=PA406|year=2004|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|page=406|isbn = 9789023239666}}</ref>
* Indiscriminate [[United States war crimes|U.S. military violence]] (bloodied bomb for foot, metal legs, military aircraft wings), threatening the European cultural landmarks at lower right.
** Hence the suggested falsity of American claims to be "Liberators" (the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] was also the name of a U.S. bomber plane).

==== September 11 attacks ====
[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|right|[[9/11]]: [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] twin towers on fire]]
In a book called ''The Rise of Anti-Americanism'', published in 2006, Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths said that the [[September 11 attacks]] were "quintessential anti-American acts, which satisfy all of the competing definitions of Anti-Americanism".<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lJLIIZN8szYC&pg=PA21 21]}}</ref> They ask, "If 9/11 can be construed as the exemplar of anti-Americanism at work, does it make much sense to imply that all anti-Americans are complicit with terrorism?"<ref>{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Griffiths|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lJLIIZN8szYC&pg=PA3 3]}}</ref> Most leaders in Islamic countries, including Afghanistan, condemned the attacks. [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq]] was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that "the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their [[crimes against humanity]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=Attacks draw mixed response in Mideast |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=12 September 2001 |access-date=30 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813060324/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/index.html |archive-date=13 August 2007 }}</ref>

Europe was highly sympathetic to the United States after the 9/11 attack. [[NATO]] unanimously supported the United States, treating an attack on the U.S. as an attack on all of them after [[NATO Article 5|Article 5]] of the [[North Atlantic Treaty|NATO treaty]] was invoked for the very first (and, {{As of|2019|01|25|lc=y|post=,}} last) time. NATO and American troops [[American occupation of Afghanistan|entered Afghanistan]] ({{As of|alt=and remain there in 2018|2018|07|post=,}} despite various schedules for withdrawals and surges). When the United States decided to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade and overthrow the Iraqi regime in 2003]], it won some support in Europe, especially from the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], but also intense opposition, led by the [[Government of Germany|German]] and [[Government of France|French governments]]. [[Konrad Jarausch]] argues that there was still fundamental agreement on such basic issues of support for democracy and [[human rights]]. However, there emerged a growing gap between an American "[[Libertarianism|libertarian]], individualistic, market outlook, and the more [[Statism|statist]], [[Collectivism|collectivist]], [[welfare]] mentality in Europe."<ref>{{Cite book|first=Konrad|last=Jarausch|title=Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century|date=2015|pages=759–60}}</ref>

==== U.S. computer technology ====
A growing dimension of anti-Americanism is fear of the pervasiveness of U.S. Internet technology. This can be traced from the very first computers which were either British ([[Colossus computer|Colossus]]) or German ([[Z1 (computer)|Z1]]) through to the [[World Wide Web]] itself (invented by Englishman [[Tim Berners-Lee]]). In all these cases the U.S. has commercialized all these innovations.

Americanization has advanced through widespread [[high speed Internet]] and smart phone technology since 2008 and a large fraction of the new apps and hardware were designed in the United States. In Europe, there is growing concern about excessive Americanization through Google, Facebook, Twitter, the iPhone and Uber, among many other U.S. Internet-based corporations. European governments have increasingly expressed concern regarding privacy issues, as well as antitrust and taxation issues regarding the new American giants. There is fear that they are significantly [[Tax evasion|evading taxes]], and posting information that may violate European privacy laws.<ref>See "Google under fire in Europe over user privacy concerns" [https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/04/08/google-under-fire-in-europe-over-user-privacy-concerns.html ''Toronto Star '' 8 April 2015]</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2015 reported "deep concerns in Europe's highest policy circles about the power of U.S. technology companies."<ref>Tom Fairless, "Europe's Digital Czar Slams Google, Facebook," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-digital-czar-slams-google-facebook-over-selling-personal-data-1424789664 ''Wall Street Journal'' 24 Feb. 2015]</ref>

==== Mitigation of anti-Americanism ====
Sometimes developments help neutralize anti-Americanism. In 2015, the [[United States Department of Justice]] went on the attack against corruption at [[FIFA]], arresting many top world [[Association football|soccer]] leaders long suspected of bribery and corruption. In this case the U.S. government's self-defined role as "policeman of the world" won widespread international support.<ref>Noah Barkin, "World's policeman wins rare applause for FIFA crackdown," [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/28/us-soccer-fifa-usa-power-idUSKBN0OD1Z720150528 ''Reuters'' 28 May 2015]</ref>

[[File:Yankee go home.jpg|thumb|Banner expressing anti-American sentiments in [[Stockholm]], Sweden in 2006]]
In a 2003 article, historian David Ellwood identified what he called three great roots of anti-Americanism:
* Representations, images and stereotypes (from the birth of the Republic onwards)
* The challenge of economic power and the American model of modernization (principally from the 1910s and 1920s on)
* The organized projection of U.S. political, strategic and ideological power (from World War II on)
He went on to say that expressions of the phenomenon in the last 60 years have contained ever-changing combinations of these elements, the configurations depending on internal crises within the groups or societies articulating them as much as anything done by American society in all its forms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1426.html |title=Anti-Americanism: Why Do Europeans Resent Us? |author=David Ellwood  |publisher=George Mason university : History News Network |date=5 May 2003}}</ref>

In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini wrote that the perceived post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] unilateralism of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fabbrini |first=Sergio |title=Layers of Anti-Americanism: Americanization, American Unilateralism and Anti-Americanism in a European Perspective |journal=European Journal of American Culture |date=September 2004 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=79–94 |doi=10.1386/ejac.23.2.79/0 }}</ref> Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion. Thus it is the unilateral policy process and the arrogance of policy makers, not the specific policy decisions, that are decisive.<ref>Sergio Fabbrini, "Anti-Americanism and US foreign policy: Which correlation?," ''International Politics'' (Nov 2010) 47#6 pp. 557–573.</ref>

During the [[George W. Bush]] administration, public opinion of America declined in most European countries. A [[Pew Research Center]] Global Attitudes Project poll showed "favorable opinions" of America between 2000 and 2006 dropping from 83% to 56% in the United Kingdom, from 62% to 39% in France, from 78% to 37% in Germany and from 50% to 23% in Spain. In Spain, unfavorable views of Americans rose from 30% in 2005 to 51% in 2006 and positive views of Americans dropped from 56% in 2005 to 37% in 2006.<ref>{{cite web

Ruth Hatlapa, a PhD candidate at the [[University of Augsburg]], and Andrei S. Markovits, a professor of Political Science at the [[University of Michigan]], describe President Obama's image as that of an angel – or more precisely, a rock star – in Europe in contrast to Bush's devilish image there; they argue, however, that "Obamamania" masks a deep-seated distrust and disdain of America.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hatlapa | first1 = Ruth | last2 = Markovits | first2 = Andrei | year = 2010 | title = Obamamania and Anti-Americanism as Complementary Concepts in Contemporary German Discourse | journal = German Politics and Society | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 69–94 | doi=10.3167/gps.2010.280105}}</ref>

=====France=====
In France, the term [[Anglo-Saxon world|"Anglo-Saxon"]] is often used in expressions of anti-Americanism or [[Anglophobia]].

In her contribution to the seminal book ''Anti-Americanisms in World Politics'' edited by Peter Katzenstein and Robert Keohane in 2006, [[Sophie Meunier]] writes about French anti-Americanism. She contends that although it has a long history (older than the U.S. itself) and is the most easily recognizable anti-Americanism in Europe, it may not have had real policy consequences on the United States and thus may have been less damaging than more pernicious and invisible anti-Americanism in other countries.<ref>[http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/cup_detail.taf?ti_id=4604 Book Review: Anti-Americanisms in world politics], Cornell University Press.</ref>

Richard Kuisel, an American scholar, has explored how France partly embraced American consumerism while rejecting much of American power and values. He writes in 2013:

{{quote|America functioned as the "other" in configuring French identity. To be French was not to be American. Americans were conformists, materialists, racists, violent, and vulgar. The French were individualists, idealists, tolerant, and civilized. Americans adored wealth; the French worshiped [sic] ''la douceur de vivre.'' This caricature of America, which was already broadly endorsed at the beginning of the century, served to reinforce French national identity. At the end of the twentieth century, the French strategy [was to use] America as a foil, as a way of defining themselves as well as everything from their social policies to their notion of what constituted culture.<ref>Richard Kuisel, "The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power," ''H-France Forum'' (Spring 2013) 8#4 pp 41–45 [http://www.h-france.net/forum/forumvol8/Kuisel5.pdf online], referencing his major book, ''The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power'' (2012) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sm7n online]</ref>}}

German naval planners in the 1890–1910 era denounced the [[Monroe Doctrine]] as a self-aggrandizing legal pretension to dominate the West hemisphere. They were even more concerned with the [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty|possible American canal in Panama]], because it would lead to full American hegemony in the Caribbean. The stakes were laid out in the German war aims proposed by the Navy in 1903: a "firm position in the West Indies," a "free hand in South America," and an official "revocation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]" would provide a solid foundation for "our trade to the [[West Indies]], [[Central America|Central]] and South America."<ref>{{cite book|author=Dirk Bönker|title=Militarism in a Global Age: Naval Ambitions in Germany and the United States before World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Nhk1cMHoYC&pg=PA61|year=2012|publisher=Cornell U.P.|page=61|isbn=978-0801464355}}</ref>

During the Cold War, anti-Americanism was the official government policy in [[East Germany]], and dissenters were punished.

China has a history of anti-Americanism beginning with the general disdain for foreigners in the early 19th century that culminated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1900, which the U.S. helped in militarily suppressing.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and World War II, the U.S. provided economic and military assistance to the [[Chiang Kai-shek]] government against the Japanese invasion. In particular, the "[[China Hands]]" (American diplomats known for their knowledge of China) also attempted to establish diplomatic contacts with [[Mao Zedong]]'s communist regime [[Dixie Mission|in their stronghold in Yan'an]], with a goal of fostering unity between the Nationalists and Communists.<ref>John Service, ''The Amerasia Papers: Some Problems in the History of US – China Relations'' (Berkeley, CA: Center for Chinese Studies, U of California Press, 1971), 191 – 192.</ref> However, relations soured after communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the relocation of the Chiang government to [[Taiwan]], together with the start of the [[Cold War]] and rise of [[McCarthyism]] in U.S. politics. The newly communist China and the U.S. fought a major undeclared [[Korean War|war in Korea, 1950–53]] and, as a result, President [[Harry S. Truman]] began advocating a policy of containment and sent the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] to deter a possible communist invasion of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry S Truman, "Statement on Formosa," January 5, 1950|url=http://china.usc.edu/harry-s-truman-%E2%80%9Cstatement-formosa%E2%80%9D-january-5-1950|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> The U.S. signed the [[Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty]] with Taiwan which lasted until 1979 and, during this period, the communist government in Beijing was not diplomatically recognized by the U.S. By 1950, virtually all American diplomatic staff had left mainland China, and one of Mao's political goals was to identify and destroy factions inside China that might be favorable to capitalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Qiu Xu | first1 = Guang | year = 2000 | title = U.S. Air Aid and the CCP's Anti-American Campaign, 1945–1949 | journal = Air Power History | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 24–39}}</ref><ref>Michael M.

In the 1990s, incidents like the [[Yinhe incident]] or the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]], has significantly increased anti-Americanism in China, with many people protesting when the latter happened.

In 2001, diplomatic relations and impression were further damaged by the [[Hainan Island incident]], where a collision between a U.S. and Chinese aircraft resulted in the death of the Chinese pilot.

In 2013, 53% of Chinese respondents in a [[Pew Research Center|Pew]] survey had a "very unfavorable" or "somewhat unfavorable" view of the U.S.<ref name="pew"/> Relations improved slightly near the end of Obama's term in 2016, with 44% of Chinese respondents expressing an unfavorable view of the U.S compared to 50% of respondents expressing a favorable view.<ref name=":1" />

While protests have arisen because of specific incidents, they are often reflective of deeper historical resentments.

In modern times, the controversial [[Visiting Forces Agreement (Philippines – United States)|Visiting Forces Agreement]] provides a further increase to anti-American sentiment, especially among [[Muslim Filipinos]]

Although right-wing scholars (e.g. [[Paul Hollander]]) have given prominence to the role that religiosity, culture and backwardness play in inflaming anti-Americanism in the region, the poll noted that radicalism among Arabs or Muslims isn't correlated with poverty, backwardness or religiosity. Radicals were in fact shown to be better educated and wealthier than 'moderates'.<ref name=gallup937 />

There is also, however, a cultural dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative groups in the Middle East. It may have its origins with [[Sayyid Qutb]]. Qutb, an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] who was the leading intellectual of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], studied in [[Greeley, Colorado]] from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, ''The America I Have Seen'' (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts.<ref>David Von Drehle, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822102733/http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/february/presence.php A Lesson In Hate] ''Smithsonian Magazine''</ref> Wrote Qutb, "They danced to the tunes of the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests.

She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it".<ref name="Siegel2003-05-06" /> He was particularly disturbed by [[jazz]], which he called the American's preferred music, and which "was created by [[Negro]]es to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ..."<ref>''Amrika allati Ra'aytu'' (The America that I Have Seen) quoted on Calvert (2000)</ref> Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially with respect to the relations between the sexes.

In 2002 and in mid-2004 [[Zogby International]] polled the favorable/unfavorable ratings of the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Zogby's 2002 survey, 76% of Egyptians had a negative attitude toward the United States, compared with 98% in 2004. In Morocco, 61% viewed the country unfavorably in 2002, but in two years, that number had jumped to 88 percent. In Saudi Arabia, such responses rose from 87% in 2002 to 94% in 2004.

The [[Iran hostage crisis]] that lasted from 1979 to 1981, in which fifty-two [[Americans]] were held hostage in [[Tehran]] for 444 days, was also a demonstration of anti-Americanism, one which considerably worsened mutual perceptions between the U.S. and Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguy.com/iran-us_hostage_crisis.html|title=Iran–U.S. Hostage Crisis (1979–1981)|access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref>

====Jordan====
Anti-Americanism is felt very strongly in [[Jordan]] and has been on the rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the [[Government of Jordan]] is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of [[Jordanians]] is among the highest in the world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], when a United States-led coalition invaded Iraq to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although 2017 data indicates negative attitudes towards the U.S. and American people have gone down to 82% and 61% respectively, rates of anti-Americanism in Jordan are still among the highest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/database/?indicator=1&country=223&response=Favorable|title=Opinion of the United States|date=22 April 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref>

====Palestine====
In July 2013, Palestinian Cleric Ismat Al-Hammouri, a leader of the Jerusalem-based [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], called for the destruction of America, France, Britain and Rome to conquer and destroy the enemies of the "Nation of Islam". He warned: "We warn you, oh America: Take your hands off the Muslims. You have wreaked havoc in Syria, and before that, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now in Egypt. Who do you think we are, America? We are the nation of Islam — a giant and mighty nation, which extends from east to west. Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar.

===The Americas===
All the countries of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (including Canada, the United States of America, and Latin American countries) are often referred to as "The Americas" in the [[Anglosphere]]. In the U.S. and most countries outside Latin America, the terms "America" and "American" typically refer only to the United States of America and its citizens respectively. In the 1890s Cuban writer [[José Martí]] in an essay, "Our America," alludes to his objection to this usage.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mauricio Augusto Font|author2=Alfonso W.

=====Mexico=====
In Mexico during the regime of liberal [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876-1911), policies favored foreign investment, especially American, who sought profits in agriculture, ranching, mining, industry, and infrastructure such as railroads. Their dominance in agriculture and their acquisition of vast tracts of land at the expense of Mexican small holders and indigenous communities was a cause for peasant mobilization in the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20). The program of the [[Liberal Party of Mexico]] (1906), explicitly called for policies against foreign ownership in Mexico, with the slogan "Mexico for the Mexicans." [[Land reform in Mexico]] in the postrevolutionary period had a major impact on these U.S. holdings, where many were expropriated.<ref>Dwyer, John J.

In 2015, the Obama administration signed an executive order which imposed targeted sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials whom the White House argued were instrumental in human rights violations, persecution of political opponents and significant public corruption and said that the country posed an "unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States."<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven Venezuelan officials targeted by US |publisher=BBC |date=10 March 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31804925 |ref=BBC}}</ref> [[Nicolás Maduro]] responded to the sanctions in a couple of ways. He wrote an open letter in a full page ad in ''The New York Times'' in March 2015, stating that Venezuelans were "friends of the American people" and called President Obama's action of making targeted sanctions on the alleged human rights abusers a "unilateral and aggressive measure".<ref name="FOXson">{{cite news |title=Venezuelan president's son, Nicolas Maduro Jr., showered in dollar bills as economy collapses |publisher=[[Fox News Latino]] |location=United States |date=19 March 2015 |url= http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/03/19/venezuelan-president-son-nicolas-maduro-jr-showered-in-dollar-bills-as-economy/ |access-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054912/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/03/19/venezuelan-president-son-nicolas-maduro-jr-showered-in-dollar-bills-as-economy/ |archive-date=21 March 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Venezuela launches anti-American, in-your-face propaganda campaign in the U.S. |publisher=[[Fox News Latino]] |location=United States |date=18 March 2015 |url= http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/03/18/venezuela-launches-anti-american-in-your-face-propaganda-campaign-in-us/ |access-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402175059/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/03/18/venezuela-launches-anti-american-in-your-face-propaganda-campaign-in-us/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Examples of accusations of human rights abuses from the United States to Maduro's government included the murder of a political activist prior to legislative elections in Venezuela.<ref>{{cite news |title=Venezuela lashes U.S., opposition amid blame over activist's slaying |work=Reuters |date=27 November 2015 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/27/us-venezuela-election-idUSKBN0TG1IB20151127 |access-date=30 November 2015}}</ref>

====Canada====
{{See also|Canada–United States relations#Anti-Americanism|label 1=Canada–United States relations}}
Anti-Americanism in Canada has unique historic roots. When the [[Continental Congress]] was called in 1774, an invitation was sent to [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. However Canadians expressed little interest in joining the Congress, and the following year the [[Continental Army]] [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invaded Canada]], but was defeated at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]]. Although the American [[Articles of Confederation]] later pre-approved Canada as a U.S. state, public opinion had turned against them. Soon 40,000 [[United Empire Loyalists|loyalist refugees]] arrived from the United States, including 2,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s, many of whom had fought for [[the Crown]] against the American revolutionaries. To them, the republic they left behind was violent and anarchic, [[Plutocracy|ruled by money]] and [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]].<ref>Nossal, Kim Richard, "Anti-Americanism in Canada", ''Anti-Americanism: comparative perspectives'' (2007), ed. Brendon O'Connor, pp. 62–66</ref>

Canadian imperialists repeatedly warned against [[Republicanism in the United States|American-style republicanism]] and [[Politics of the United States|democracy]] as little more than mob rule.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sara Jeannette Duncan|author2=Misao Dean|title=The Imperialist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54osezQz_eQC&pg=PA19|year=2005|publisher=Broadview Press|page=19}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, Canadian textbooks portrayed the United States in a negative fashion. The United States had abandoned the [[British Empire]], and as a result, America was supposedly disorderly, greedy, and selfishly individualistic. By the 1930s, there was less concern with the United States, and more attention given to Canada's peaceful society, and its efforts on behalf of civilization in the World Wars. Close cooperation in the [[World War II|Second World War]] led to much more favorable image. In the 1945-1965 era, the friendly and peaceful border was stressed. Textbooks emphasized the role of the United States as an international power and champion of freedom with Canada as its influential partner.<ref>Amy Von Heyking, "Talking about Americans: The image of the United States in English-Canadian schools, 1900–1965." ''History of Education Quarterly'' 46.3 (2006): 382-408.</ref>

In 1945-65, there was wide consensus in Canada on foreign and defense policies 1948 to 1957. Bothwell, Drummond and English state:
:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M. Drummond|author3=John English|title=Canada Since 1945: Power, Politics, and Provincialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMaS5cb7s8QC&pg=PA131|year=1989|publisher=U of Toronto Press|page=131|isbn=9780802066725}}</ref>

However the consensus did not last. By 1957 the [[Suez Crisis]] has alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. "Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one."<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref> Apart from the far left, which admired the USSR, anti-Americanism was first adopted by a few leading historians. As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, [[Harold Innis]] grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. "We are indeed fighting for our lives," he warned, pointing especially to the "pernicious influence of American advertising....We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises."<ref>{{cite book|author=Harold A. Innis|title=Changing Concepts of Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuO00eQGdXUC&pg=PA13|year=2004|pages=13–14|isbn=9780742528185}}</ref> His anti-Americanism influenced some younger scholars, including [[Donald Creighton]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Wright|title=Donald Creighton: A Life in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CSSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT239|year=2015|pages=174–75|isbn=9781442620308}}</ref>

The [[presidency of Donald Trump]] correlated with a resurgence in anti-American attitudes among the Canadian population. In 2017, [[Pew Research]] found that 30% of Canadians viewed [[Americans]] negatively, and that 58% of Canadians opposed the spread of American ideas and customs.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|date=2017-06-26|title=The tarnished American brand|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/06/26/tarnished-american-brand/|access-date=2019-12-08|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew Research Center|page=2}}</ref>

In 2018, a [[Trump tariffs|trade war]] and inflammatory comments by Trump provoked substantial backlash within Canada.

The shooting down of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] by [[Iran]] in January 2020, which killed 57 Canadians, was widely viewed in Canada as unnecessary collateral damage amidst deteriorating [[Iran–United States relations|Iran-US relations]], a view echoed by prime minister [[Justin Trudeau]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Connolly |first=Amanda |date=2020-01-13 |title=Without recent escalations, Iran plane crash victims would be 'home with their families': Trudeau |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6404191/justin-trudeau-iran-plane-crash-2020/ |work=Global News |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gilmore |first=Scott |date=2020-01-09 |title=Donald Trump gets impeached—57 Canadians die |url=https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/donald-trump-gets-impeached-63-canadians-die/ |work=Maclean's |access-date=2020-01-26 }}</ref> An [[Ekos Research Associates|EKOS Research]] poll found that 29% of Canadians viewed the United States as wholly responsible for the attack by means of instigation, with 48% saying that they shared the blame with Iran and only 19% blaming Iran alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2020/01/directional-outlook-and-public-response-to-growing-iran-u-s-tensions/ |title=Directional Outlook and Public Response to Growing Iran-U.S. Tensions |date=2020-01-16 |website=EKOS Politics |publisher=EKOS Research Associates |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>

As a result of the 2020 [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 Pandemic]], Canada closed its border with the United States on March 21 of that year, and crossing the border was restricted to essential travel. However, US travelers may cross the border if they claim to be driving to the American state of [[Alaska]]. By June, there were multiple reports of Americans using this as a false pretext to enter Canada and stay for vacation.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cecco|first=Leyland|date=2020-06-17|title=Americans reportedly find 'loophole' to violate Canada's Covid-19 border closure|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/17/americans-reportedly-find-loophole-violate-canadas-covid-19-border-closure|access-date=2020-08-25|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> This led to instances of verbal and physical attacks on drivers with U.S. license plates. Physical attacks typically consisted of damage to cars with these plates, sometimes with a threatening note left behind. Some of these attacks occurred in resort towns such as [[Muskoka Lakes]], [[Ontario]]; its Mayor, Phil Harding, suggested these incidents stem from ‘Canadians’ fear of contracting COVID-19 from Americans as a result of the situation in the United States’.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Aguilar|first=Bryann|date=2020-06-17|title='Go home': Drivers with U.S. licence plates harassed in Muskoka|url=https://www.cp24.com/news/go-home-drivers-with-u-s-licence-plates-harassed-in-muskoka-1.4989231|access-date=2020-08-25|website=CP24|language=en}}</ref> In August 2020, a poll found that 80% of Canadians wanted the border to remain closed for the rest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Al-Arshani|first=Sarah|title=Poll finds that 80% of Canadians want the US-Canada border to stay closed for the rest of the year, as the coronavirus pandemic rages on in the US|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/canadians-want-border-us-to-stay-closed-end-2020-2020-8|access-date=2020-08-25|website=Business Insider}}</ref> A separate poll conducted by Leger and the [[Association for Canadian Studies]] found that only 34% of respondents expressed trust in Americans, compared to 72.5% for the inverse.

=====Canadian political rhetoric=====
Anti-Americanism, as a political tactic, was sometimes used by the Conservatives to attack the supposed Liberal Party affinity for Americans, as in [[1911 Canadian federal election|the 1911 elections]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Richard | last2 = Percy | first2 = Michael B. | year = 1980 | title = Reciprocity, Imperial Sentiment, and Party Politics in the 1911 Election | journal = Canadian Journal of Political Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 711–729 | jstor=3230240 | doi=10.1017/s0008423900034004}}</ref> Canada's first prime minister, [[John A. Macdonald]], viewed American politicians as greedy and exploitative. He staunchly opposed free trade with the United States, calling it "veiled treason" in his manifesto for the [[1891 Canadian federal election|1891 election]], which occurred during trade disagreements with the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/election-1891-a-question-of-loyalty-feature |title=Election 1891: A Question of Loyalty |last=Marsh |first=James |date=2011-02-01 |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref>

Anti-Americanism thus remained a fixture in Canadian partisan politics, as employed by such leaders as prime minister [[John G. Diefenbaker]] in the 1950s. He was aided in his attacks by the prominent historian [[Donald Creighton]], who also wrote ''The Take-Over'' (1978), a novel about an American takeover.<ref>J.L. Granatstein. ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997) pp. 121–45</ref>

Canadian intellectuals who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century identified the United States as the world center of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest, with its rejection of tradition, its worship of "progress" and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and social harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891–1967).<ref>Damien-Claude Bélanger, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891–1945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 16, 180</ref>

Brendon O'Connor and Martin Griffiths state in their book ''Anti-Americanism'' that they would at first glance think that Canadians seem as likely as others to embrace characteristics that are characterized as anti-American. O'Conner and Griffiths include such actions as criticizing Americans as a people, or the U.S. as a country as being anti-American often demonizing, denigrating and resorting to stereotypes.
They have also written that the anti-Americanism found in Canada had unique qualities: nowhere else has it been so entrenched for so long, nor so central to the political culture as in Canada.<ref name="Brendon O'Connor 2007 https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&pg=PA71 71">{{cite book|author=Brendon O'Connor|title=Anti-Americanism: Comparative perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-026-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&pg=PA71 71]}}</ref> Canadian historian [[Kim Richard Nossal]] thinks that a low level attenuated form of anti-Americanism permeates Canadian political culture, though "designed primarily as a means to differentiate Canadians from Americans".<ref name="Brendon O'Connor 2007 https://books.google.com/books?id=Jq4FMb47AnEC&pg=PA71 71" /> Although [[Jack Granatstein]] has suggested that anti-Americanism was dead in Canada, John Herd Thompson and Stephen J. Randall in their book ''Canada and the United States'' (2002) states that there is anecdotal evidence that it still flourishes, and that it continues to nourish the Canadian sense of identity.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Herd Thompson|author2=Stephen J.

[[Margaret Atwood]] is a leading Canadian author. In her [[dystopia]]n novel [[The Handmaid's Tale|''The Handmaid's Tale'' (1986)]] all the horrible developments take place in the United States near Boston, while Canada is portrayed as the only hope for an escape.

Liberal Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] was opposed to the Iraq War and refused to allow Canada to participate in it. A 2003 poll found that 71% of Canadians approved of this decision, while 27% disapproved. Conservative Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] initially supported the Iraq War when elected in 2006 but by 2008, he had changed his mind and stated that the war was "a mistake".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/19/canada-iraq-war_n_2902305.html|title=Canada's 'No' To Iraq War a Defining Moment for Prime Minister}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekospolitics.com/articles/torstar-24-03-2003c.html|title=Canadians Back Chrétien on War, Poll Finds|newspaper=Toronto Star|first=Tim|last=Harper|date=22 March 2003|access-date=21 December 2017}}</ref>

United States President [[George W. Bush]] was "deeply disliked" by a majority of Canadians according to the ''Arizona Daily Sun''. A 2004 poll found that more than two-thirds of Canadians favored Democrat [[John Kerry]] over Bush in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], with Bush's lowest approval ratings in Canada being in the province of [[Quebec]], where just 11% of the population supported him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://azdailysun.com/poll-deep-anti-bush-sentiment-in-canada/article_1c8749cf-9704-5e02-9c7c-159214c9a5f5.html|title=Poll: Deep Anti-Bush Sentiment in Canada|newspaper=Arizona Daily Sun|date=19 October 2004 | agency=Associated Press |access-date=21 December 2017}}</ref> Canadian public opinion of [[Barack Obama]] was more positive. A 2012 poll found that 65% of Canadians would vote for Obama in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]] "if they could", while only 9% of Canadians would vote for his Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]]. The same study found that 61% of Canadians felt that the Obama administration had been "good" for America, while only 12% felt that it had been "bad". The study also found that a majority of members of all three major Canadian political parties supported Obama, and that Obama had slightly higher approval ratings in Canada in 2012 than he did in 2008. John Ibbitson of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' stated in 2012 that Canadians generally supported Democratic presidents over Republican candidates, citing how President [[Richard Nixon]] was "never liked" in Canada and that Canadians generally did not approve of Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]'s friendship with President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/who-do-canadians-want-to-vote-for-barack-obama/article4219652/|title=Who Do Canadians Want to Vote For?
