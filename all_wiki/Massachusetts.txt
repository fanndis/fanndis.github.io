The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] was named after the [[indigenous peoples| indigenous]] population, the [[Massachusett]], whose name likely derived from a [[Wôpanâak language | Wôpanâak]] word ''muswachasut'', segmented as ''mus(ây)'' "big" + ''wach8'' "mountain" + ''-s'' "diminutive" + -''ut'' "locative" (the '8' in these words refers to the 'oo' sound according to the Wôpanâak orthographic chart).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8740|title= Introduction to Wampanoag Grammar|last= Fermino|first= Jessie Little Doe|hdl= 1721.1/8740}}</ref> It has been translated as "near the great hill",<ref>{{cite book| first= William Wallace| last= Tooker| url= https://archive.org/details/jstor-533961| page= [https://archive.org/details/jstor-533961/page/n5 175]| title= Algonquian Names of some Mountains and Hills| publisher= American Folk-lore Society| year= 1904| access-date= June 10, 2015}}</ref> "by the blue hills", "at the little big hill", or "at the range of hills", referring to the [[Blue Hills Reservation |Blue Hills]], or in particular the [[Great Blue Hill]], which is located on the boundary of [[Milton, Massachusetts |Milton]] and [[Canton, Massachusetts |Canton]].<ref>Salwen, Bert, 1978.

Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language family]] such as the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]], [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]], [[Nipmuc]], [[Pocomtuc]], [[Mahican]], and [[Massachusett]].{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=6–7}}<ref name=Mohican>{{cite web |title=Origin & Early Mohican History |publisher=Stockbridge-Munsee Community—Band of Mohican Indians |access-date=October 21, 2009 |url=http://mohican-nsn.gov/Departments/Library-Museum/Mohican_History/origin-and-early.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912122346/http://mohican-nsn.gov/Departments/Library-Museum/Mohican_History/origin-and-early.htm |archive-date=September 12, 2009 }}</ref> While cultivation of crops like [[Cucurbita|squash]] and [[maize|corn]] supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing for most of their food.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=6–7}} Villages consisted of lodges called [[wigwam]]s as well as [[longhouse]]s,<ref name=Mohican/> and tribes were led by male or female elders known as [[sachem]]s.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=7}}

Currency was another issue in the colonies. In 1652 the [[Massachusetts legislature]] authorized [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]] to produce coinage ([[Moneyer|mintmaster]]). "The Hull Mint produced several denominations of silver coinage, including [[the pine tree shilling]], for over 30 years until the political and economic situation made operating the mint no longer practical." Mostly political for [[Charles&nbsp;II of England]] deemed the "Hull Mint" [[high treason in the United Kingdom]] which had a punishment of [[Hanging, drawing and quartering]]. "On April 6, 1681, Randolph petitioned the king, informing him the colony was still pressing their own coins which he saw as high treason and believed it was enough to void the charter. He asked that a writ of Quo warranto (a legal action requiring the defendant to show what authority they have for exercising some right, power, or franchise they claim to hold) be issued against [[Massachusetts]] for the violations."<ref>https://historyofmassachusetts.org/massachusetts-bay-colony-charter-revoked

In 1691, the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth were united (along with present-day [[Maine]], which had previously been divided between Massachusetts and [[Province of New York|New York]]) into the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=66}} Shortly after the arrival of the new province's first governor, [[William Phips]], the [[Salem witch trials]] took place, where a number of men and women were hanged for alleged [[witchcraft]].{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=50}}

During the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national leader in the American [[Industrial Revolution]], with factories around cities such as [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Boston]] producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=129}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=211}} The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the [[steam engine]] to power factories.

Although Massachusetts was the first slave-holding colony dating back to the early 1600s, in the years leading up to the [[American Civil War]], Massachusetts was a center of [[progressivism|progressivist]] and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] activity. [[Horace Mann]] made the state's school system a national model.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=251}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] made major contributions to American philosophy.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=254}} Members of the [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist movement]] emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=254}}

Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837,{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=185}} opposition to slavery gradually increased throughout the next few decades.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|pp=187–93}} Abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and [[Sojourner Truth]] lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while [[Frederick Douglass]] lived in Boston and [[Susan B.

===20th century===

With the departure of several manufacturing companies, the area's industrial economy began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the [[Great Depression]], led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics.<ref>Brown and Tager, p. 246.</ref> This decline would continue into the latter half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=276}} The 1969 closure of the [[Springfield Armory]], in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] |url=http://www.uml.edu/com/cita/05paperforrantmuckensturm.pdf |title=Job Loss, Shrinking Revenues, and Grinding Decline in Springfield, Massachusetts: Is A Finance Control Board the Answer? |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref>

On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first state in the U.S. to legalize [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|same-sex marriage]] after a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the right to a civil marriage was unconstitutional.<ref name=CNNmarriage /> This decision was eventually superseded by the U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation of [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] in 2015.

In 2004, Massachusetts senator [[John Kerry]] who won the Democratic nomination for President of the United States narrowly lost to incumbent [[George W. Bush]]. Eight years later, former Massachusetts governor [[Mitt Romney]] (Republican nominee) lost to [[Barack Obama]] in 2012. Another eight years later, Massachusetts Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] was a frontrunner in the Democratic primaries for the 2020 Presidential Election, but suspended her campaign and then endorsed presumptive nominee [[Joe Biden]].

[[File:East_South_East_View,_Mt_Sugarloaf,_South_Deerfield_MA.jpg|thumb|A portion of the north-central [[Pioneer Valley]] in [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts|South Deerfield]]]]

Massachusetts is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|7th-smallest state in the United States]]. It is located in the [[New England]] region of the northeastern United States and has an area of {{convert|10555|sqmi|km2}}, 25.7% of which is water. Several large bays distinctly shape its coast. Boston is the largest city, at the inmost point of [[Massachusetts Bay]], and the mouth of the [[Charles River]].

Despite its small size, Massachusetts features numerous [[topography|topographically]] distinctive regions. The large [[coastal plain]] of the Atlantic Ocean in the eastern section of the state contains [[Greater Boston]], along with most of the state's population,<ref name=GreaterBoston /> as well as the distinctive [[Cape Cod]] [[peninsula]]. To the west lies the hilly, rural region of [[Central Massachusetts]], and beyond that, the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]]. Along the western border of [[Western Massachusetts]] lies the highest elevated part of the state, [[the Berkshires]].

===Climate===

[[File:MA koppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Köppen climate]] types in Massachusetts]]

Most of Massachusetts has a [[humid continental climate|humid continental climate]], with cold winters and warm summers. Far southeast coastal areas are the broad transition zone to [[Humid Subtropical]] climates. The warm to hot summers render the [[oceanic climate]] rare in this transition, only applying to exposed coastal areas such as on the peninsula of [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. The climate of [[Boston]] is quite representative for the commonwealth, characterized by summer highs of around {{convert|81|F|C}} and winter highs of {{convert|35|F|C}}, and is quite wet. Frosts are frequent all winter, even in coastal areas due to prevailing inland winds. Due to its location near the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], Massachusetts is vulnerable to [[nor'easters]], [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes and tropical storms]].

===Religion===

Massachusetts was founded and settled by [[Brownist]] [[Puritans]] in 1620<ref name=puritans/> and soon after by other groups of [[Ecclesiastical separatism|Separatists]]/[[English dissenters|Dissenters]], [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] from [[17th-century denominations in England|17th century England]].{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|pp=29–30}} A majority of people in Massachusetts today remain [[Christians]].<ref name=qcensus/> The descendants of the Puritans belong to many different churches; in the direct line of inheritance are the various [[Congregational church]]es, the [[United Church of Christ]] and congregations of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]. The headquarters of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], long located on [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], is now located in [[South Boston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/headquarters |title=Headquarters of the Unitarian Universalist Association |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association |access-date=April 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/news/press-release/uua-sell-its-beacon-hill-properties-move-innovation-district |title=The UUA to Sell its Beacon Hill Properties, Move to Innovation District |publisher=[[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |access-date=April 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417012851/http://www.uua.org/news/press-release/uua-sell-its-beacon-hill-properties-move-innovation-district |archive-date=April 17, 2015 }}</ref> Many Puritan descendants also dispersed to other Protestant denominations. Some disaffiliated along with Roman Catholics and other Christian groups in the wake of modern [[secularization]].

Today, Christians make up 57% of the state's population, with [[Protestantism|Protestants]] making up 21% of them. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] make up 34% and now predominate because of massive immigration from primarily Catholic countries and regions—chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities have been in decline since the late 20th century, due to the rise of [[irreligion]] in [[New England]]. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along with the [[Western United States]]. A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. [[Jews]] currently make up 3% of the population. [[Mary Baker Eddy]] made the [[Christian Science Center|Boston Mother Church]] of [[Christian Science]] serve as the world headquarters of this [[new religious movement]]. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Paganism|Pagans]], [[Hindu]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Muslim]]s, and [[Mormons]] may also be found. [[Kripalu Center]] in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts|Stockbridge]], the Shaolin Meditation Temple in Springfield, and the Insight Meditation Center in [[Barre, Massachusetts|Barre]] are examples of non-Abrahamic religious centers in Massachusetts. According to 2010 data from The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], (ARDA) the largest single denominations are the [[Catholic Church]] with 2,940,199 adherents; the [[United Church of Christ]] with 86,639 adherents; and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] with 81,999 adherents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/25/rcms2010_25_state_family_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &#124; State Membership Report |publisher=[[Association of Religion Data Archives]] |access-date=November 22, 2013}}</ref> 32% of the population identifies as having no religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/massachusetts/ |title=Adults in Massachusetts |date=May 11, 2015 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project}}</ref>

[[Amtrak]] operates several [[inter-city rail]] lines connecting Massachusetts. Boston's [[South Station]] serves as the terminus for three lines, namely the high-speed ''[[Acela Express]]'', which links to cities such as [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[New York City]], and eventually Washington DC; the ''[[Northeast Regional]]'', which follows the same route but includes many more stops, and also continues further south to [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] in Virginia; and the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'', which runs westward to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and eventually [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].<ref name = "amtrak">{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/northeast-train-routes|title=Northeast Train Routes|website=Amtrak|access-date=June 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Routes |title=Acela Express |publisher=[[Amtrak]] |access-date=May 22, 2010 |url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer/AM_Route_C/1241245664867/1237405732511 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523233021/http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer/AM_Route_C/1241245664867/1237405732511 |archive-date=May 23, 2010 }}</ref> Boston's other major station, [[North Station]], serves as the southern terminus for Amtrak's ''[[Downeaster (train)|Downeaster]]'', which connects to [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]] in Maine.<ref name = "amtrak"/>

Outside of Boston, Amtrak connects several cities across Massachusetts, along the aforementioned ''Acela'', ''Northeast Regional'', ''Lake Shore Limited'', and ''Downeaster'' lines, as well as other routes in central and western Massachusetts. The ''[[Hartford Line (Amtrak)|Hartford Line]]'' connects [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], operated in conjunction with the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], and the ''[[Valley Flyer (Amtrak_train)|Valley Flyer]]'' runs a similar route but continues further north to [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]].

A great majority of interstates in Massachusetts were constructed during the mid-20th century, and at times were controversial, particularly the intent [[Southwest Corridor (Massachusetts)|to route I-95 northeastwards from Providence, Rhode Island, directly through central Boston]], first proposed in 1948. Opposition to continued construction grew, and in 1970 Governor [[Francis W. Sargent]] issued a general prohibition on most further freeway construction within the I-95/Route 128 loop in the Boston area.<ref>Brown and Tager, pp. 283–284.</ref> A massive undertaking to bring I-93 underground in downtown Boston, called the [[Big Dig]], brought the city's highway system under public scrutiny for its high cost and construction quality.<ref name=BigDig1/>

Massachusetts has a long political history; earlier political structures included the [[Mayflower Compact]] of 1620, the separate [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]] and [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] colonies, and the combined colonial [[Province of Massachusetts]]. The [[Massachusetts Constitution]] was ratified in 1780 while the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was in progress, four years after the [[Articles of Confederation]] was drafted, and eight years before the present [[United States Constitution]] was ratified on June 21, 1788.

Massachusetts has gradually shifted from a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning state to one [[red states and blue states|largely dominated]] by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]; the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952 victory]] of [[John F.

Kennedy]] held that seat until his death from a brain tumor in 2009.{{sfn|Brown|Tager|2000|p=310}} Since the 1950s, Massachusetts has gained a reputation as being a politically liberal state and is often used as an archetype of [[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]], hence the phrase "[[Massachusetts liberal]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-07-25-mass-liberal_x.htm |title=Does 'Massachusetts liberal' label still matter? |first1=Susan |last1=Page |first2=Jill |last2=Lawrence |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=July 11, 2004 |access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

Massachusetts routinely votes for the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations in the Boston metro area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County.

Democrats have an absolute grip on the Massachusetts congressional delegation; there are no Republicans elected to serve at the federal level. Both Senators and all nine Representatives are Democrats; only one Republican (former Senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]) has been elected to either house of Congress from Massachusetts since 1994. Massachusetts is the most populous state to be represented in the [[United States Congress]] entirely by a single party.

Massachusetts has contributed to American arts and culture. Drawing from its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Yankee]] roots, along with later immigrant groups, Massachusetts has produced several writers, artists, and musicians. Some major museums and important historical sites are also located there, and events and festivals throughout the year celebrate the state's history and heritage.<ref>{{cite web |title=History Museums |url=http://www.massvacation.com/explore/history/history-museums/ |publisher=Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

Massachusetts was an early center of the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] movement, which emphasized intuition, emotion, human individuality and a deeper connection with nature.{{sfn|Goldfield|Abbott|Anderson|Argersinger|1998|p=254}} [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who was born in Boston but spent much of his later life in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], largely created the philosophy with his 1836 work [[Nature (essay)|''Nature'']], and continued to be a key figure in the movement for the remainder of his life. Emerson's friend, [[Henry David Thoreau]], who was also involved in Transcendentalism, recorded his year spent alone in a small cabin at nearby [[Walden Pond]] in the 1854 work ''[[Walden; or, Life in the Woods]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walden Pond State Reservation |url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dcr/massparks/region-north/walden-pond-state-reservation.html |publisher=[[Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]] |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>
