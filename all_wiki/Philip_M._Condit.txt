{{short description|American engineer and businessman|bot=PearBOT 5}}
'''Philip Murray Condit''' (born August 2, 1941) is an American engineer and businessman who was [[Chair]] and [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Boeing]] company from 1996 to 2003. He dramatically reshaped the company by acquiring Boeing's long-time rival [[McDonnell Douglas]] and relocating Boeing headquarters from [[Seattle]] to [[Chicago]]. He resigned to take symbolic responsibility for a military procurement scandal, although he was not accused of any ethical breaches. <ref name="shake up">{{cite news |last1=Bowermaster |first1=David |title=Boeing shake-up aims to stop ethics damage - Condit out, Stonecipher takes over|work=Seattle Times |date=December 2, 2003}}</ref>

==Education ==
He was born in [[Berkeley, California]], and became an aviation enthusiast at an early age, earning his pilot's certificate at age 18. He earned a bachelor's degree in [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1963, a [[master's degree]] in [[aeronautical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1965, a Master's in Management from the [[Sloan Fellows]] program of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in 1975, and a [[Ph.D.]] in engineering from the [[Tokyo University of Science]]<ref>{{Cite web | url= https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/500000151772| title=Technology applications in design of commercial aircraft : from materials and processes to manufacturing and operations | lang=Japanese | accessdate=29 October 2019 }}</ref> . (He is the first [[Western world|Westerner]] to earn such a degree from that institution.)

== Boeing career==
Phil Condit joined the Boeing company in 1965 as an aerodynamics engineer, and worked on the since-canceled [[Supersonic transport|Supersonic Transport]] program (SST). The same year he was awarded a [[patent]] for a flexible wing design called a "[[sailwing]]." In 1968, he became a lead engineer on the [[Boeing 747]] high-speed configuration. He advanced into management within a year, then became manager of the [[Boeing 727]] marketing in 1973.

In 1974, he entered the [[Sloan Fellows]] program at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], where he completed his [[MIT Sloan School of Management#History|Master's degree in Management]] a year later. He returned to Boeing as manager of new-program planning. He then advanced to director of program management for the [[Boeing 707|707]]/727/[[Boeing 737|737]] division in 1976, and [[Boeing 757|757]] chief program engineer in 1978, then director of 757 engineering in 1981.

Condit later became vice president and general manager of the 757 division in 1983; vice president of the [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] division the same year, and vice president of sales and marketing for Boeing Commercial Aircraft Company (BCAC) in 1984. In 1986, he was named as executive vice president and general manager of BCAC, then executive VP and general manager of the [[Boeing 777|777]] program division.

=== Chairman and retirement===
In 1992, he was elected president of Boeing and a member of the board of directors. Four years later he became CEO as well. In 1997, he was elected chairman, becoming the seventh chairman since the company was founded. He remained in this position until resigning on 1 December 2003, followed by retirement in March 2004. He resigned one week after firing Chief Financial Officer [[Michael M. Sears]] and Vice President [[Darleen Druyun]] when an internal investigation determined that the two had discussed a job for Druyun while she was still an Air Force procurement officer helping pass judgment on proposed Boeing contracts. Condit resigned to take symbolic responsibility, and Sears and Druyan served prison terms.<ref>Palmer, Kimberly, [http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1005/100305k2.htm "Former Air Force acquisition official released from jail,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119113645/http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1005/100305k2.htm |date=2011-11-19 }} ''Government Executive.com'', 3 October 2005.</ref> <ref>Cahlink, George, [http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1004/100104g1.htm "Ex-Pentagon procurement executive gets jail time"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194756/http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1004/100104g1.htm |date=2007-03-10 }}.

{{Details|United States Air Force tanker contract controversy}} A member of the Boeing board, [[Lewis E. Platt]], said the Boeing initially declined Condit's offer to step down, but relented after agreeing with Condit that his departure would help give the company a fresh start with its biggest customer, the U.S. government.<ref name="shake up"/> Many Boeing workers were unhappy Condit left, according to the ''[[Seattle Times]]''.<ref name="shake up"/>

=== Mergers and acquisitions===
Condit utterly transformed Boeing during his seven-year tenure as CEO, making numerous space and defense acquisitions and growing annual revenue from $23 billion to $54 billion.<ref name="transform">{{cite news |last1=Gates |first1=Dominic |title=Under Condit, defense took charge - But Boeing fell to No. 2 in commercial airplanes|work=Seattle Times |date=December 2, 2003}}</ref> It was also during his tenure, however, that [[Airbus]] reached rough parity with Boeing's commercial airplane division and in some years exceeded Boeing in jetliner orders or deliveries. <ref name="transform"/> Boeing acquired [[Rockwell International|Rockwell Aerospace]] and [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes Space & Communications]], then performed a merger with the McDonnell Douglas company in 1997. These acquisitions consolidated much of the nation's aerospace capacity into Boeing. After the [[September 11 attacks]] there was a nearly 20% decline in North American air travel, which created severe financial problems for both Boeing and the [[Airline|U.S. airline industry]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bhadra |first1=Dipasis |last2=Texter |first2=Pamela |title=Airline Networks: An Econometric Framework to Analyze Domestic U.S. Air Travel |publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/journal_of_transportation_and_statistics/volume_07_number_01/html/paper_06/ |accessdate=October 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050330035744/http://www.bts.gov/publications/journal_of_transportation_and_statistics/volume_07_number_01/html/paper_06/ |archive-date=March 30, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the time of his retirement, Condit told a reporter that the defense acquisitions had been intended to reduce the company's reliance on commercial airplanes: "We knew that commercial airplanes was going to be a capital goods, cyclic industry. We needed breadth."<ref name="transform"/>

== Personal life ==
Condit has been married four times. For his fourth (and current) marriage, he wed Geda Maso.

Condit is a member of the [[National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America]], the organization's governing body.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121114024453/http://www.scouting.org/filestore/media/324-168.pdf Boy Scouts of America Annual Report 2011]</ref>
