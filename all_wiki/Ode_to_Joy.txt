"'''Ode to Joy'''" (German: {{Lang|de|"An die Freude"|italic=no}} {{IPA-de|an diː ˈfʁɔʏdə|}}) is an [[ode]] written in the summer of [[1785 in literature|1785]] by German poet, playwright, and historian [[Friedrich Schiller]] and published the following year in ''[[Thalia (magazine)|Thalia]]''. A slightly revised version appeared in 1808, changing two lines of the first and omitting the last stanza.

"Ode to Joy" is best known for its use by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in the final (fourth) movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], completed in 1824. [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)#Text of the fourth movement|Beethoven's text]] is not based entirely on Schiller's poem, and introduces a few new sections. His tune<ref>The usual name of the [[Hymn tune]] is "Hymn to Joy" {{cite web|title=Hymnary – Hymn to Joy|url=http://www.hymnary.org/tune/hymn_to_joy_beethoven|access-date=11 October 2013}}</ref> (but not Schiller's words) was adopted as the "[[Anthem of Europe]]" by the [[Council of Europe]] in 1972 and subsequently by the [[European Union]]. [[Rhodesia]]'s national anthem from 1974 until 1979, "[[Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia]]", used the tune of "Ode to Joy".

Schiller wrote the first version of the poem when he was staying in [[Gohlis]], [[Leipzig]]. In the year 1785 from the beginning of May till mid September, he stayed with his publisher [[Georg Joachim Göschen]] in Leipzig and wrote "An die Freude" along with his play ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.stadtgeschichtliches-museum-leipzig.de/site_english/schillerhaus/geschichte.php |title= History of the Schiller House| website= stadtgeschichtliches-museum-leipzig.de}}</ref>

Schiller later made some revisions to the poem which was then republished posthumously in [[1808 in literature|1808]], and it was this latter version that forms the basis for Beethoven's setting. Despite the lasting popularity of the ode, Schiller himself regarded it as a failure later in his life, going so far as to call it "detached from reality" and "of value maybe for us two, but not for the world, nor for the art of poetry" in an 1800 letter to his long-time friend and patron [[Christian Gottfried Körner]] (whose friendship had originally inspired him to write the ode).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.wissen-im-netz.info/literatur/schiller/briefe/koerner/1800/571.htm| title= [Untitled letter] | first= Friedrich |last= Schiller| date=    October 21, 1800| website= wissen-im-netz.info| language= de| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200958/http://www.wissen-im-netz.info/literatur/schiller/briefe/koerner/1800/571.htm| archive-date= 2016-03-04| access-date= 2019-05-29}}</ref>

|<poem>{{Lang|de|Freude, schöner Götterfunken,
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken,
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!
Deine Zauber binden wieder
Was die Mode streng geteilt*;
Alle Menschen werden Brüder*
Wo dein sanfter Flügel weilt.

Wem der große Wurf gelungen
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein;
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen
Mische seinen Jubel ein!
Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund!

Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Brüsten der Natur;
Alle Guten, alle Bösen
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.
Küsse gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, geprüft im Tod;
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben
und der Cherub steht vor Gott.

Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels prächt'gen Plan
Laufet, Brüder, eure Bahn,
Freudig, wie ein Held zum siegen.

Seid umschlungen, Millionen!
Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!
Brüder, über'm Sternenzelt
Muß ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muß er wohnen.|italic=no}}</poem>
|<poem style="margin-left: 2em;">Joy, beautiful spark of Divinity [or: of gods],
Daughter of [[Elysium]],
We enter, drunk with fire,
Heavenly one, thy sanctuary!
Thy magic binds again
What custom strictly divided;*
All people become brothers,*
Where thy gentle wing abides.

Whoever has succeeded in the great attempt,
To be a friend's friend,
Whoever has won a lovely woman,
Add his to the jubilation!
Yes, and also whoever has just one soul
To call his own in this world!
And he who never managed it should slink 
Weeping from this union!

All creatures drink of joy
At nature's breasts.
All the Just, all the Evil
Follow her trail of roses.
Kisses she gave us and grapevines,
A friend, proven in death.
Salaciousness was given to the worm 
And the cherub stands before God.

Gladly, as His suns fly
through the heavens' grand plan 
Go on, brothers, your way,
Joyful, like a hero to victory.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss to all the world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
There must dwell a loving Father.
Are you collapsing, millions?
Do you sense the creator, world?
Seek him above the starry canopy!
Above stars must He dwell.</poem>

|-{{18/11/2018, ErwanK2: correct translation is 'it is to the soul that you steal yourself, away from this union', because 'der' is a feminine dative referring to the Soul, not the masculine-only subject of the sentence and 'stehle' has been confused with 'stelle'. When ausstellen would translate into 'exhibit oneself' -not to split apart, 'stehlen aus' is to steal from. Also understand the tense 'stehle' not 'stehlt' that refers to a conditional supporting the idea of: 'you'd be stealing a soul's chance if you went away'}} {{5/8/2019, Wegesrand: Sorry Erwan, but the antecedent of that "der" is the preceding "wer", which refers not to the soul, but "who" or "whoever" has never been able to call a soul his own. And the "stehle" is an optative subjunctive, not a conditional. Knowledge of German grammar is like marmalade: the less you have, the more you have to spread it around.}}

==== Ode to freedom ====
Academic speculation remains as to whether Schiller originally wrote an "Ode to Freedom" (''Ode an die Freiheit'') and changed it to an "Ode to Joy".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Wacław|last= Kubacki|author-link=:pl:Wacław Kubacki|title=Das Werk [[Juliusz Słowacki|Juliusz Slowackis]] und seine Bedeutung für die polnische Literatur|language=de|journal=Zeitschrift für Slawistik|volume=5|number=1|date=January 1960|doi=10.1524/slaw.1960.5.1.545|s2cid= 170929661}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|quote=Das 'Alle Menschen werden Brüder', das Schiller in seiner Ode an die Freude (eigentlich Ode an die Freiheit) formuliert, ...|first=Alexander|last=Görlach|author-link=Alexander Görlach|url=https://www.theeuropean.de/alexander-goerlach/3925-der-glaube-an-die-freiheit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026163222/https://www.theeuropean.de/alexander-goerlach/3925-der-glaube-an-die-freiheit|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 October 2016|title=Der Glaube an die Freiheit – Wen darf ich töten?|journal=[[The European (2009 magazine)|The European]]|date=4 August 2010}}</ref> [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer|Thayer]] wrote in his biography of Beethoven, "the thought lies near that it was the early form of the poem, when it was still an 'Ode to Freedom' (not 'to Joy'), which first aroused enthusiastic admiration for it in Beethoven's mind".<ref>[[Alexander Wheelock Thayer|Thayer, A. W.]](1817–97), rev. and ed. [[Elliot Forbes]]. ''Thayer's Life of Beethoven''.
