'''John Edward Poynder Grigg''' (15 April 1924 – 31 December 2001) was a British writer, historian and politician. He was the '''2nd Baron Altrincham''' from 1955 until he disclaimed [[Baron Altrincham|that title]] under the [[Peerage Act 1963|Peerage Act]] on the day it received the [[Royal Assent]] in 1963.

Grigg edited the ''[[National and English Review]]'' (1954–1960) as [[Edward Grigg, 1st Baron Altrincham|his father]] had done. He was a [[Liberal conservatism|liberal Tory]] but was defeated at the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]] and [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general elections]]. In an article for the ''National and English Review'' in August 1957, Grigg argued that Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s court was too upper-class and British, and instead advocated a more "[[classless]]" and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] court. His article caused a furore and was attacked by the majority of the press, with a minority, including the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and [[Ian Gilmour]]'s ''[[The Spectator]]'', agreeing with some of Grigg's ideas.

He left the Conservative Party for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) in 1982.

==Early years==
Born in [[Westminster]], Grigg was the son of [[Edward Grigg, 1st Baron Altrincham|Edward Grigg]], and his wife, Joan Dickson-Poynder. Edward Grigg was a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' journalist, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of parliament|MP]], Governor of [[Kenya]], and member of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=BACx8cjyrbyMCXIyKCk%2FPQ&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=11 December 2017|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref>

From [[Eton College|Eton]], Grigg joined the [[British Army]] and was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into his father's regiment, the [[Grenadier Guards]], in 1943 during the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–1945). While in the British Army, Grigg served as an officer of the Guard at [[St James's Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]], [[Berkshire]], and saw action as a [[platoon]] commander in the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards, part of the [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade]] of the [[Guards Armoured Division]], against the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|France and Belgium]]. Towards the end of the war, he became an [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] officer.

After the war, Grigg read Modern History at [[New College, Oxford]]. While at Oxford University, he gained a reputation for academic excellence, winning the University Gladstone Memorial Prize in 1948. In the same year, after graduating with second-class honours,<ref name=":6">Geoffrey Wheatcroft, 'Grigg, John Edward Poynder, second Baron Altrincham (1924–2001)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2005; online edn, Jan 2011</ref> Grigg joined the ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'', which was owned and edited by his father.

==Political career==
A liberal Tory, and later a supporter of the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], Grigg sought election to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. He stood for election for the recently created [[Oldham West (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West]] at the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], but was defeated by the sitting member [[Leslie Hale, Baron Hale|Leslie Hale]]. Grigg contested the seat again in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]] but was similarly unsuccessful. With his father's death in December 1955, Grigg inherited the title of [[Baron Altrincham]], which seemingly ended any hope of him being able to stand again as a candidate. Nonetheless, Grigg refused to apply for a [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]], [[abjuring]] his right to a seat in the [[House of Lords]].

When [[Tony Benn]] (the Viscount Stansgate) succeeded in obtaining passage of the [[Peerage Act 1963|Peerage Act]], Grigg was the second person (after Benn himself) to take advantage of the new law and disclaim his peerage. In 1997, he wrote that he was "entirely opposed to hereditary seats in Parliament" and added that at that time in 1963 he "felt honour-bound to disclaim, though it was a bore to have to change my name again".<ref name=":1">{{cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-august-1997/13/punched-abused-challenged|title=Punched, Abused, Challenged|last=Grigg|first=John|date=16 August 1997|work=The Spectator|accessdate=21 December 2017|page=3}}</ref> Grigg never achieved his ambition of election to the Commons, and he subsequently left the Conservative Party for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] in 1982.

== Journalism ==
As his father's health failed during the first few years of the 1950s, Grigg assumed most of the managerial and editorial duties of the now-renamed ''National and English Review''. By the time of his father's death in December 1955, Grigg had taken over the editorship formally, and began to edit the ''Review'' into a publication more reflective of his views.<ref name="teleobit"/>

In 1956, Grigg attacked [[Anthony Eden]]'s Conservative government for its handling of the [[Suez Crisis]], and pressed for an immediate withdrawal of British forces from [[Port Said]]. He followed his father in championing [[reform of the House of Lords]], although he added that, in lieu of reform, abolition might be the only alternative. He also advocated the [[ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests into the Anglican Church]].<ref name="teleobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1380108/John-Grigg.html |title=John Grigg |work=The Telegraph |date=2 January 2002 |accessdate=2017-12-10}}</ref>

=== Monarchy ===
In an August 1957 article, "The Monarchy Today",<ref name=":1" /> Grigg argued that the court of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was too upper-class and British, and instead advocated a more "classless" and Commonwealth court. More personally, he attacked the Queen's style of public speaking as "a pain in the neck": <blockquote>"Like her mother, she appears to be unable to string even a few sentences together without a written text – a defect which is particularly regrettable when she can be seen by her audience."<ref name=":3"/></blockquote>

Grigg also criticised the Queen's speeches, normally written for her by her advisers: <blockquote>"The personality conveyed by the utterances which are put into her mouth is that of a priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team, a prefect, and a recent candidate for Confirmation."<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SBS19570804.1.2|title=San Bernardino Sun 4 August 1957 — California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref></blockquote>

Grigg's article caused a furore and was attacked by the majority of the press, with a minority agreeing with some of his opinions. [[Henry Fairlie]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' accused Grigg of "daring to pit his infinitely tiny and temporary mind against the accumulated experience of centuries".<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=The Queen|last=Pimlott|first=Ben|author-link= Ben Pimlott|pages=280, 281}}</ref> [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Baron Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'' defended the Queen, and condemned Grigg's article as a "vulgar" and "cruel" attack.<ref name=":3" /> [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]]'s ''[[The Spectator]]'', whilst agreeing with Grigg's view that the Monarchy leant too heavily on the upper class, accused him of "monarcho-mysticism": exaggerating the influence of the Monarchy, and seeking to elevate the Queen to the position of a "life-force".<ref name=":4" /> The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]], also attacked Grigg.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/video/archbishop-of-canterbury-reaction-to-anti-queen-article-news-footage/815591096|title=Video: Archbishop of Canterbury reaction to anti-Queen article|work=Getty Images|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Whilst the [[BBC]] censured his views on the Monarchy,<ref name=":4" /> Grigg was invited by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] to discuss his article with [[Robin Day]] on the programme ''Impact''.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/video/lord-altrincham-interviewed-about-his-controversial-news-footage/860553634|title=Video: Lord Altrincham interviewed about his controversial article|work=Getty Images|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-GB}}</ref> As he was leaving [[Television House]] having given the interview, a member of the [[League of Empire Loyalists]] came up to him and slapped his face,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/video/lord-altrincham-gets-slapped-england-tv-house-down-tv-news-footage/803263032|title=Video: Lord Altrincham gets slapped|work=Getty Images|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> saying: <blockquote>"Take that from the League of Empire Loyalists."<ref>'Ld. Altrincham Slapped', ''The Times'' (7 August 1957), p. 8.</ref></blockquote> The man, Philip Kinghorn Burbidge, was fined 20 shillings and said: <blockquote>"Due to the scurrilous attack by Lord Altrincham I felt it was up to a decent Briton to show resentment. What I feared most was the overseas repercussions and publication in American newspapers. I thought our fortunes were at a low ebb and such things only made them more deplorable."<ref name=":4" /></blockquote>

Burbidge added that the court fine was the best investment he had ever made.<ref>'Lord Altrincham's Assailant Fined', ''The Times'' (8 August 1957), p. 3.</ref>

[[Robert Menzies]], prime minister of Australia, was publicly critical of Grigg,<ref name=":1" /> describing his article as "disgusting and shocking criticism": <blockquote>"I think it a very great pity...that it should have been lifted out of a journal with not a very great circulation and given an audience of many millions in the world Press. I think the Queen performs her duties in the Royal office with perfection...If it is now to be said that she reads a speech I might say that many of the great statesmen in the world will have to face the same charge and had better be criticised for it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/125956702/|title=The Sydney Morning Herald - 8th Aug 1957 Page 3|date=1957-08-08|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>

Grigg responded, by attacking Menzies for his "disgusting" and "stuffily subservient" attitude towards the Queen, in a front-page interview with the ''[[Melbourne Herald]]'': <blockquote>"Mr Menzies ... is typical of the very worst attitude towards the Crown. He simply blindly worships the Sovereign as someone above criticism...puts her on a pedestal and genuflects."{{fact|date=March 2020}}</blockquote>

Grigg alleged that Menzies had given the Queen poor advice during her 1954 tour of Western Australia, when there had been a mild epidemic of [[poliomyelitis]]. He said that the risk of the Queen catching polio was minute, when compared to that for the thousands of people who crowded into the streets to see her, but that: <blockquote>"...as a result of Mr Menzies advice, the Queen did not shake hands with anyone during the entire visit. She remained remote, aloof and isolated without contact with the people. Bouquets brought to her by little children were taken by her ladies-in-waiting and then thrown in dustbins. The Queen did not spend one night on Western Australian soil and ate only food brought from the liner ''Gothic''. I feel that if the situation was put to her properly she would have seen that it wasn't the way a Sovereign acts".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000378/19570808/021/0002|title=Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail - Thursday 08 August 1957|last=Archive|first=The British Newspaper|website=www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/41248574/|title=The Winona Daily News from Winona, Minnesota on August 9, 1957 · Page 2|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Page/freepress19570809-1.1.3?ST=1&AT=&K=menzies+altrincham&ddlNewspapers=&ddlYears=&ddlMonths=&KA=it+wasn't+the+way+a+sovreign+acts&FL%5B0%5D.Sel=false&FL%5B0%5D.L=English&FL%5B1%5D.Sel=false&FL%5B1%5D.L=Chinese&FL%5B2%5D.Sel=false&FL%5B2%5D.L=Malay&FCTA%5B1%5D.Sel=false&FCTA%5B1%5D.CTA=Article&FCTA%5B0%5D.Sel=false&FCTA%5B0%5D.CTA=Advertisement&FCTA%5B2%5D.Sel=false&FCTA%5B2%5D.CTA=Illustration&FCTA%5B3%5D.Sel=false&FCTA%5B3%5D.CTA=Letter&FCTA%5B4%5D.Sel=false&FCTA%5B4%5D.CTA=Miscellaneous&FCTA%5B5%5D.Sel=false&FCTA%5B5%5D.CTA=Obituary&DF=&DT=&filterState=0|title=The Singapore Free Press, 9 August 1957, Page 3|date=1957-08-09|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref></blockquote>

Grigg also received police protection for his appearance on another Granada broadcast, ''Youth Wants To Know'': this time from [[Granada Studios]] in [[Manchester]].<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/brandishing-a-fist-and-umbrella-lord-altrincham-critic-of-news-photo/805968648#/brandishing-a-fist-and-umbrella-lord-altrincham-critic-of-the-queen-picture-id805968648|title=Television Programmes - ITV - Youth Wants To Know - Lord Altrincham - Manchester|work=Getty Images|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-GB}}</ref> During the broadcast, he criticised the Queen for taking what he considered to be too many holidays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-aug-08-1957-lord-altrincham-criticizes-the-queens-holidays-during-69347242.html|title=Stock Photo - Aug. 08, 1957 - Lord Altrincham Criticizes The Queen's Holidays During His Appearance On Television.|last=Limited|first=Alamy|website=Alamy|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref> The ''Daily Express'', having earlier attacked Grigg for his article, began itself to criticise Royal procedure; although it did not criticise the Queen herself.<ref name=":5" />

''[[Reynold's News]]'' praised Grigg for "saying out loud what many people are thinking". [[Kingsley Martin]]'s ''[[New Statesman]]'' said Grigg had broken the unassailable [[Fleet Street]] law: <blockquote>"...that the Queen is not only devoted, hardworking and young – but also a royal paragon of wit, wisdom and grace."<ref name=":4" /></blockquote>

Grigg always contended that his criticism was meant as constructive, from one who was a reformer and who was a strong believer in [[constitutional monarchy]]: <blockquote>"It is too precious an institution to be neglected. And I regard servile acceptance of its faults as a form of neglect."<ref name="teleobit" /></blockquote>

Grigg also commented specifically of the Queen: <blockquote>"She will know that it is easier to be polite to those in high places than to tell them hard truths in a straightforward manner... Wherever she goes, she has the power to help people and to make them happy, simply by being herself. She does not have to pretend to be a Queen: she is the Queen. And the perfect modern Queen is no haughty paragon, but a normal affectionate human being, sublimated through the breadth and catholicity of her experience and the indestructible magic of her office."<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

Speaking some decades on, Grigg clarified: <blockquote>"I was rather worried by the general tone of comment, or the absence of comment really in regards to the monarchy – the way we were sort of drifting into a kind of Japanese Shintoism, at least it seemed to me, in which the monarchy was not so much loved as it should be and cherished, but worshipped in a kind of quasi-religious way. And criticism of the people who were actually embodying it at the time was completely out."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1619027.htm|title=The World Today - Queen's 80th Birthday marked by popularity|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref></blockquote>

In spite of the initial backlash, several of Grigg's recommended reforms for making the monarchy more relevant were accepted by the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]],<ref name="obit">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/02/guardianobituaries.humanities|title=John Grigg|last=Wheatcroft|first=Geoffrey|date=3 January 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a14273687/lord-altrincham-john-grigg-role-british-history/ |title=How Lord Altrincham Changed the Monarchy Forever |last=Halleman |first=Caroline |date=8 December 2017 |accessdate=2017-12-21 |work=Town & Country Magazine}}</ref> after Grigg's meeting with [[Martin Charteris]], the Queen's assistant private secretary.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUa-P74h-nEC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA225&dq=lord+altrincham+robert+menzies#q=to%20arrange%20a%20private%20meeting%20with%20Martin%20Charteris|title=Monarch: The Life and Reign of Elizabeth II|last=Lacey|first=Robert|date=2008-06-24|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439108390|language=en}}</ref> [[Debutante]]s' Parties were ended in 1958,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTJjXDA-AlYC&pg=PA23|title=Last Curtsey: The End of the Debutantes|last=MacCarthy|first=Fiona|date=2011-07-07|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=9780571265817|language=en}}</ref> whilst the Queen received help in order to improve her diction before making her [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas Speech]] in December 1957.<ref name=":0" /> During a meeting at [[Eton College]] some decades later, Charteris praised Grigg for his article: <blockquote>"You did a great service to the monarchy, and I'm glad to say so publicly."<ref name="ultimate">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuacWNk3oTwC|title=The Ultimate Family: The Making of the Royal House of Windsor|last=Pearson|first=John|publisher=A&C Black|year=2011|isbn=9781448207848}}</ref></blockquote>

=== After 1960 ===
The ''National and English Review'' closed in June 1960, with its 928th and last issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/10th-june-1960/4/monthlies|title=Monthlies|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref> At the same time, Grigg started working at ''[[The Guardian]]'', which had just relocated to London from its original home in Manchester. For the rest of the decade he wrote a column, entitled ''A Word in Edgeways'', which he shared with Tony Benn.<ref name=":6" />

==Work as a biographer and historian==
At that same time, in late 1960s, Grigg turned his attention to the project that would occupy him for the remainder of his life: a multi-volume biography of the British prime minister [[David Lloyd George]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571277490-lloyd-george.html|title=Lloyd George|date=April 2011|publisher=[[Faber & Faber]]|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01|isbn=9780571277490}}</ref> The first volume, ''The Young Lloyd George'', was published in 1973.  The second volume, ''Lloyd George: The People's Champion'', which covered Lloyd George's life from 1902 to 1911, was released in 1978 and won the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread Award]] for biography for that year.  In 1985 the third volume, ''Lloyd George, From Peace To War 1912–1916'', was published and subsequently received the [[Wolfson History Prize|Wolfson prize]]. When he died in 2001 Grigg had nearly completed the fourth volume, ''Lloyd George: War Leader, 1916–1918''; the final chapter was subsequently finished by historian [[Margaret MacMillan]] (Lloyd George's great-granddaughter) and the book published in 2002. In all the volumes, Grigg showed a remarkable sympathy, and even affinity, for the "Welsh Wizard", despite the fact that their domestic personalities were very different. Historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]] judged the result to be "a fascinating story and is told with panache, vigour, clarity and impartiality by a great biographer."<ref>Blake, Robert (28 October 2002). ''The Evening Standard''.</ref>

Grigg also wrote a number of other books, including: ''Two Anglican Essays'' (discussing [[Anglicanism]] and changes to the [[Church of England]]),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/42788716|title=Two Anglican essays|last=Grigg|first=John|date=1958|publisher=London : Secker & Warburg|language=en}}</ref> ''Is the Monarchy Perfect?''

==Personal life==
Grigg married [[Belfast]] native Patricia Campbell, who worked at ''National and English Review'', on 3 December 1958 at St Mary Magdalene Church, [[Tormarton]], Gloucestershire. They later adopted two boys.<ref>[http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-2nd-baron-altrincham-weds-patricia-campbell-69351582.html "2nd Baron Altrincham weds Patricia Campbell"] ''alamy.com'' retrieved 27 April 2017</ref><ref>[http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/altrincham1945.htm "Altrincham, Baron (UK, 1945)"] ''Cracroft's Peerage'' retrieved 27 April 2017</ref>
