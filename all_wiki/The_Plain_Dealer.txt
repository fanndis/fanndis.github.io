==History==
[[File:Cleveland Plain Dealer 8-07-1945.jpg|thumb|right|Front page of the ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' dated August 7, 1945 featuring the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].]]
===Founding===
The newspaper was established in January 1842 when two brothers, Joseph William Gray and Admiral Nelson Gray, took over ''The Cleveland Advertiser'' and changed its name to ''The Plain Dealer''.  ''The Cleveland Advertiser'' had been published from 1831 to 1841.<ref name="CLE-ENCYC-ADVERTISER">{{cite web |title=CLEVELAND ADVERTISER |url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/cleveland-advertiser |website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History - Case Western Reserve University |accessdate=12 May 2020 |language=en |date=11 May 2018}}</ref>  Some sources attribute the current spelling of the city name to ''The Cleveland Advertiser's'' dropping the first "a" from the name of the city's founder, [[Moses Cleaveland]], so the newspaper's name would fit on the masthead, but others dispute that story.<ref name="CLE-OH-HIST">{{cite web |title=Cleveland, Ohio |url=https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Cleveland,_Ohio |website=Ohio History Central |accessdate=12 May 2020}}</ref><ref name="MYTHS-CLE-MAG">{{cite news |title=30 Myths That Define Cleveland: The "A" In Cleaveland |url=https://clevelandmagazine.com/in-the-cle/articles/cle-myths-the-a-in-cleaveland |accessdate=12 May 2020 |work=Cleveland Magazine |issue=December 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

===Name===
When the Gray brothers began publishing their newspaper in 1842, they wrote an explanation of their choice of name; after reviewing several other possibilities, they wrote, "but our democracy and modesty suggest the only name that befits the occasion, the PLAIN DEALER.”<ref name="AmHer">{{cite journal |last1=Mcvicker |first1=Mary Frech |title=Courants, Messengers, And A Plain Dealer: How your paper got its name |journal=American Heritage |date=October 1994 |volume=45 |issue=6 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/courants-messengers-and-plain-dealer#1 |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="CLE-Hist-Encyc-PD">{{cite web |title=PLAIN DEALER |url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/p/plain-dealer |website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History (Case Western Reserve University) |accessdate=22 April 2020 |language=en |date=18 November 2019}}</ref> The phrase means "someone who interacts or does business straightforwardly and honestly."<ref name="Your Dictionary">{{cite web |title=Plain-dealer dictionary definition {{!}} plain-dealer defined |url=https://www.yourdictionary.com/plain-dealer |website=www.yourdictionary.com |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>  (This name might seem ironic for the twenty-first century version of the newspaper, given how its management is characterized by some staff.<ref name="EP-2013-08-01">{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Jay |title=Plain Dealer Staffers Claim Newspaper Lied About Planned Newsroom Cuts |url=https://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/plain-dealer-staffers-claim-newspaper-lied-about-planned-newsroom-cuts/ |accessdate=25 May 2020 |work=Editor and Publisher |date=1 August 2013}}</ref>)  Their choice of name was probably inspired by ''The Plaindealer'', a weekly paper described as Jacksonian or radical, published in New York City by [[William Leggett (writer)|William Leggett]] from 1836 to either 1837 or 1839.<ref name="CLE-Hist-Encyc-PD"/><ref name="PD-175">{{cite news |title=Telling Cleveland's story for 175 years: The Plain Dealer |url=https://www.cleveland.com/business/2017/01/telling_clevelands_story_for_1.html |accessdate=22 April 2020 |work=cleveland |date=9 January 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Bryant-letters">{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=William Cullen |title=The Letters of William Cullen Bryant: 1836-1849 |date=1975 |publisher=Fordham Univ Press |isbn=978-0-8232-0992-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lettersofwilliam03will/page/n76 63] |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofwilliam03will |url-access=registration |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Leggett">{{cite book |last1=Leggett |first1=William |title=Plaindealer: Equal Rights |date=1836 |publisher=proprietors. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-o9PHS7XpMC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=1836+plain+dealer+new+york&source=bl&ots=ABzmMOcI-3&sig=ACfU3U0_vKnQevKQ4eMdfpWotgaeo1A9Og&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjSgqqowvzoAhXnlHIEHcZdDKwQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=1836%20plain%20dealer%20new%20york&f=false |language=en}}</ref>  Several other newspapers in Iowa,<ref name="LOC-Iowa-0">{{cite web |title=Weekly New Oregon Plain Dealer (New Oregon, Howard County, Iowa) 1866-1867 |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn87058043/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="LOC-Iowa-1">{{cite web |title=The Iowa Plain Dealer (New Oregon, Howard County, Iowa) 1867-1895 |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2018218985/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="LOC-Iowa-2">{{cite web |title=Cresco Plain Dealer (Cresco, Howard County, Iowa) 1913-1945 |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/sn87058075/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> Indiana,<ref name="W-PD-about">{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.wabashplaindealer.com/site/about.html |website=Wabash Plain Dealer |language=en}}</ref> Montana,<ref name="LOC-Montana">{{cite web |title=The Montana Plaindealer (Helena, Montana) 1906-1911 |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2013218808/ |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref> Manitoba,<ref name="Souris-PD">{{cite web |title=About us |url=https://www.sourisplaindealer.ca/about-us |website=Souris Plaindealer |accessdate=9 May 2020}}</ref> and South Australia<ref name="Australia-PD">{{cite web |title=Plain dealer |url=https://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=6882 |website=SA Memory, South Australia State Library |access-date=1 December 2020 |language=en-au}}</ref> later adopted versions of the same name in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Since the late 20th century, like other media organizations business, the newspaper has faced reductions in circulation and revenue, restructuring, and layoffs.

===Declining circulation===
The paper's circulation declined from the 1980s through about the first decade of the twenty-first century, then dropped precipitously in the following decade or so; the following figures (using circulation numbers derived from the same source, though made public only in other sources and in a patchwork fashion) show that in the 24 years between 1983 and 2007 the paper's circulation dropped by 33% (daily) and 11% (Sunday), while in the next 12 years between 2007 and 2019, it lost a further 79% and 62% of its daily and Sunday circulation.

===Reductions in newspaper size and delivery===
On December 18, 2005, ''The Plain Dealer'' ceased publication of its weekly ''Sunday Magazine'', which had been published since 1919. Its demise was attributed to rising expenses and the poor economy. The editor of ''The Plain Dealer'', Doug Clifton, stated that stories that would formerly have appeared in the ''Sunday Magazine'' would be integrated into other areas of the paper.<ref name="sunday">{{cite news |title=‘Plain Dealer’ Kills Off Sunday Magazine |url=https://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/plain-dealer-kills-off-sunday-magazine/ |accessdate=25 May 2020 |work=Editor & Publisher Magazine |date=9 November 2005}}</ref><ref name="Poynter-Sunday">{{cite news |last1=Romenesko |first1=Jim |title=Cleveland Plain Dealer Sunday Magazine ends run Dec. 18 |url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2005/cleveland-plain-dealer-sunday-magazine-ends-run-dec-18/ |accessdate=25 May 2020 |work=Poynter |date=9 November 2005}}</ref>

In April 2013 ''The Plain Dealer '' announced it would reduce [[home delivery]] from seven days a week to three, while continuing to publish an edition seven days a week that is available in electronic form at cleveland.com, and in print at stores, [[newspaper vending machine|newsracks]] and newsstands.<ref name="CJR-4-4-13"/><ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2013/04/northeast_ohio_media_group_to.html|title=Northeast Ohio Media Group to launch in summer: Press Release|first=Plain Dealer|last=Staff|date=April 4, 2013<!--updated January 12, 2019-->|website=cleveland.com|access-date=6 Dec 2019|publisher=Advance Local}}</ref>  This change went into effect on August 5, 2013; starting then, the paper delivered "premium" (full) editions on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, as well as a bonus version on Saturday.<ref name="Plain Dealer Dear Readers">{{cite news|title=Dear Readers: Information about The Plain Dealer's delivery schedule|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/dear_readers_information_about.html|access-date=May 27, 2013|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> Subscribers to the three print editions have access to the digital edition seven days a week.<ref name="Plain Dealer Dear Readers"/>

===Closure and transfer of bureaux===
''The Plain Dealer'' formerly operated a variety of news bureaux. By the middle of 2014, both the state capital bureau in Columbus and the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] bureau were shifted to the Northeast Ohio Media Group, as shown by the affiliations of their bureau chiefs.

===Elimination of staff, 2006-2020===
In the early 2000s, ''The Plain Dealer'' employed nearly 350 reporters and editors;<ref name="Scene-4-9-20">{{cite news |last1=Allard |first1=Sam |title=Plain Dealer Editor Tim Warsinskey is a Liar and Advance Publications Doesn't Give a Shit About Cleveland |url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2020/04/09/plain-dealer-editor-tim-warsinskey-is-a-liar-and-advance-publications-doesnt-give-a-shit-about-cleveland |accessdate=22 April 2020 |work=Cleveland Scene |date=9 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> their number is now zero.

Between October and November 2006, about 64 employees, or 1/6 of those in the newsroom, accepted a buyout offer to leave the newspaper, reducing the newsroom staff from 372 to 308.<ref name="clevemag"/>

====2013 cuts====
In December 2012, members of the [[Newspaper Guild]] reported that ''The Plain Dealer'' management had told them that, after the January 2013 expiration of a no-layoffs provision in the union's contract, it planned to eliminate about one-third of the newspaper's staff, cutting 58 of 168 union positions.<ref name="Poynter-12-4-12">{{cite news |last1=Moos |first1=Julie |title=Cleveland Plain Dealer tells Guild it plans to cut about one-third of newsroom staff |url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2012/cleveland-plain-dealer-tells-guild-it-plans-to-cut-about-one-third-of-newsroom-staff/ |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=Poynter |date=4 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="CJR-11-27-12">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=T.C. |title='Resetting' The Plain Dealer |url=https://archives.cjr.org/united_states_project/resetting_the_plain_dealer.php?page=all |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=27 November 2012 |language=en}}</ref> 

Later in December 2012, the Newspaper Guild endorsed an agreement with ''Plain Dealer'' management accepting the expected layoffs of 58 journalists starting in May 2013, but restoring some of the pay cut union members had accepted in 2009, setting a severance package, and minimizing future layoffs through 2019 (to "just one more modest downsizing").<ref name="auto2">{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Robert L. |title=Newspaper Guild endorses labor agreement with The Plain Dealer |url=https://www.cleveland.com/business/2012/12/the_plain_dealer_and_its_news.html |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=cleveland.com |date=12 December 2012 |language=en}}</ref> The agreement also allowed work to "flow freely" between ''The Plain Dealer'' and cleveland.com, in particular changing the rules to allow work of non-union staff of cleveland.com to be published in ''The Plain Dealer''.<ref name="auto2"/>  Following the agreement, about two dozen newsroom employees departed voluntarily.<ref name="auto8">{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Robert L. |title=The Plain Dealer executes newsroom layoffs as era of daily delivery nears end |url=https://www.cleveland.com/business/2013/07/plain_dealer_executes_newsroom.html |accessdate=26 May 2020 |work=cleveland.com |date=1 August 2013 |language=en}}</ref>

On the morning of Wednesday, July 31, 2013, after having been told in April that layoffs expected for May were "on hold" until the summer,<ref name="CJR-4-4-13"/> nearly one third of the newsroom staff was eliminated through [[layoff]]s and voluntary resignations.

These layoffs were the culmination of a drop over 20 years in membership in the United States' first News Guild (Local 1 of that union) from 340 members to zero.<ref name="BJD-4-11-20"/>

==Politifact Ohio==
In July 2010, ''The Plain Dealer'' launched PolitiFact Ohio,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/ohio/|title=Fact-checking Ohio politics - PolitiFact Ohio|website=PolitiFactOhio|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> a website that analyzes political issues relevant to Ohio and the greater Cleveland area. It also conducted fact-checking and was produced in conjunction with its creator, the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''. Four years later, the relationship was ended. Although the operation had generated criticism, the decision to drop it was attributed instead to a desire to keep all content on cleveland.com rather than the separate PolitiFact Ohio site, which remains available as an archive.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Plain Dealer drops PolitiFact, but keeps on factchecking|url=https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/cleveland_plain_dealer_politifact_factchecking.php?page=all|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref>

==Pricing, distribution, circulation==
The daily paper costs $2 and the Sunday/Thanksgiving Day final is $3 at newsstands/newsracks. The full subscription weekly price is $4.65. These prices only apply to ''The Plain Dealer'''s home delivery area, which are the [[Northeast Ohio]] counties of [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga]], [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake]], [[Geauga County, Ohio|Geauga]], [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage]], [[Erie County, Ohio|Erie]], [[Ottawa County, Ohio|Ottawa]], [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit]], [[Ashtabula County, Ohio|Ashtabula]], [[Medina County, Ohio|Medina]] and [[Lorain County, Ohio|Lorain]].

The newspaper reported daily readership of 543,110 and Sunday readership of 858,376 as of October, 2013.<ref name="neohiomediagroup.com"/>

==Cleveland.com criticism and controversies==
===Removal of debate video===
In October 2014, the Northeast Ohio Media Group hosted the three Ohio candidates for governor in what would be their only joint appearance. The debate was held before the NEOMG's editorial board (which also serves as the editorial board of ''The Plain Dealer'') and NEOMG reporters. Incumbent Gov. [[John Kasich]], a Republican, largely ignored his main rival, Democrat [[Ed FitzGerald]]. Kasich refused to admit he could hear the questions of FitzGerald, who was sitting next to him, and insisted that a reporter repeat them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gomez|first1=Henry|title=Gov. John Kasich ignores Ed FitzGerald in their only meeting of election season: 5 observations|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/10/gov_john_kasich_ignores_ed_fit.html|publisher=Northeast Ohio Media Group|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref>

During the debate, a video camera was positioned eight feet in front of the candidates. The resulting video was posted on cleveland.com. A few days later, however, it was removed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mismas|first1=Joseph|title=PD Pulls Video Of Kasich Refusing To Answer Editorial Board Questions|url=http://www.plunderbund.com/2014/10/27/pd-pulls-video-of-kasich-refusing-to-answer-editorial-board-questions/|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref> When other sites posted copies of the now-deleted video, the NEOMG sent letters threatening legal action. TechDirt reported that the owner of the Cleveland ''Plain Dealer'' had demanded that the unflattering video be taken down.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cushing|first1=Tim|title=Cleveland Plain Dealer Owner Demands Takedown Of Unflattering Video Featuring Candidate It Endorsed In Governor's Race|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141028/16323728972/cleveland-plain-dealer-owner-demands-takedown-unflattering-video-featuring-candidate-it-endorsed-governors-race.shtml|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref> The NEOMG's actions were covered by other media organizations<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Tom|title=PD silent on debate video|url=http://www.sanduskyregister.com/opinion/tom-jackson/6350031|publisher=Sandusky Register|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Castele|first1=Nick|title=The Only Video of Kasich and FitzGerald Debating Isn't Online Anymore.

Chris Quinn, the NEOMG vice president who sent the letters, declined all requests for comment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Jay|title=Chris Quinn, vice president for content at the Northeast Ohio Media Group… What's up?|url=http://pressthink.org/2014/11/chris-quinn-vice-president-for-content-at-the-northeast-ohio-media-group-whats-up/|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Marx|first1=Greg|title=News executives need to explain why video of an Ohio campaign interview disappeared|url=https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/john_kasich_video_northeast_ohio_media_group_chris_quinn.php?page=all|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref>

At 7 a.m. on the day after the election, which Kasich—endorsed by the NEOMG—won easily, the news organization posted online an explanation of events written by its reader representative. The column cited this as Quinn's explanation: 
<blockquote>Shortly after the video was posted, the Kasich campaign contacted him and said it had not been aware a video would be posted online. Quinn eventually decided that his failure to explicitly explain the presence of a video camera was unfair. Further, "I thought that if I stated my reasons, the obvious next step would be people going to the candidates and asking them if they had any objection to putting the video back up," Quinn is quoted as saying. "That would mean my error could put people into an uncomfortable situation."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Diadiun|first1=Ted|title=Here's why Chris Quinn took down the interview video of John Kasich, Ed FitzGerald and Anita Rios: Ted Diadiun |url=http://www.cleveland.com/readers/index.ssf/2014/11/heres_why_chris_quinn_took_dow.html|publisher=Northeast Ohio Media Group|access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

===Tamir Rice coverage===

As part of NEOMG's coverage of the 2014 [[shooting of Tamir Rice]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2014/11/cleveland_police_officers_wait.html|title=Cleveland police officers waited minutes to give first aid to Tamir Rice|date=November 27, 2014|website=cleveland.com}}</ref> by Cleveland Police, NEOMG published a stories explaining that Rice's parents had criminal backgrounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2014/11/lawyer_representing_tamir_rice.html|title=Lawyer representing Tamir Rice's family defended boy's mom in drug trafficking case|date=November 25, 2014|website=cleveland.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2014/11/tamir_rices_father_has_history.html|title=Tamir Rice's father has history of domestic violence|date=November 26, 2014|website=cleveland.com}}</ref> NEOMG Vice President of Content Chris Quinn attempted to justify reporting on the criminal backgrounds of Rice's parents in a follow-up piece,<ref name="cleveland.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2014/11/the_killing_of_tamir_rice_and.html|title=Our stories on Tamir Rice are the latest in the Northeast Ohio Media Group's examination of how Cleveland police use force|date=November 27, 2014|website=cleveland.com}}</ref> pointing out that Rice was playing with a toy gun that officers mistook for a real one at the time of the shooting. As a result, Quinn noted, many people asserted that the shooting was justified.

"One of the questions these people raise is why a 12-year-old was walking about in a public place, randomly aiming what looks like a real gun in various directions, to the point where a witness called 9-1-1 in fear," Quinn wrote<ref name="cleveland.com"/> in a piece defending his organization's reporting on the incident.

Quinn went on to postulate that "One way to stop police from killing any more 12-year-olds might be to understand the forces that lead children to undertake behavior that could put them in the sights of police guns." Cleveland Scene Magazine compared Quinn's explanation to "digging himself a hole the exact width and depth of a coffin"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2014/11/28/city-officials-could-care-less-about-neomg-lawyers-chris-quinns-ex-post-facto-rationalizing-leaves-a-sour-ass-taste|title=City Officials "Could Care Less" about NEOMG Lawyers; Chris Quinn's Ex Post Facto Rationalizing Leaves a Sour-ass Taste|first=Sam|last=Allard|website=Cleveland Scene}}</ref> in a piece asserting that the narrative regarding Rice's parents' criminal histories "is absent any context whatsoever."

==PD criticism and controversies==

===Political leanings===

In the [[1864 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1864]], the paper was strongly opposed to the reelection of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. An editorial dated 5 November, asked rhetorically, "Do you want four more years of war? Vote for Lincoln. Do you want the Constitution destroyed? Vote for Lincoln. … Do you want the degraded Negros made your social and political equals? Vote for Lincoln."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Achorn |first1=Edward |title=Every Drop of Blood: Hatred and Healing at Abraham Lincoln's Second Inauguration |date=3 March 2020 |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |isbn=978-0802148742 |pages=859 |edition=Kindle }}</ref>

''The Plain Dealer'' has been criticized in the past by liberal columnists for staking out generally conservative positions on its editorial page, despite serving a predominantly Democratic readership base. In 2004, the editorial board voted to endorse Democratic US Senator [[John Kerry]]; after publisher Alex Machaskee overruled it, ordering the board to write an endorsement of Republican [[George W. Bush]], editorial page editor Brent Larkin persuaded Machaskee to withhold any endorsement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2004/10/27/cleveland_plain_dealer/|title=The power of a publisher|date=October 27, 2004|website=Salon}}</ref> The news coverage is generally more neutral, with national and international news often culled from [[wire service]]s, including the ''[[New York Times]]''.

The paper had been criticized as being too soft in its coverage of Senator [[George Voinovich]] from Ohio and, in the 2004 election cycle for the U.S. Senate, not providing fair coverage, if any, to Voinovich's opponent, State Sen. [[Eric Fingerhut]], a Democrat.<ref name="voinovich">{{cite web|url=https://coolcleveland.com/|title=Home|website=CoolCleveland|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>

===Publishing concealed weapons permit holder lists===
In 2005, the newspaper twice published lists of concealed weapon permit holders from the five counties around Cleveland. Editor Doug Clifton defended the paper's decision, sparking a feud with a pro-carry lobbyist group. State Senator Steve Austria called it abuse of the media access privilege, saying publishing these names would threaten the safety of the men and women who obtain these permits. An Ohio [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] group then published Clifton's home address and phone number.<ref name="ohiocc">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohioccw.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2273|title=Ohio for Concealed Carry|website=ohioccw.org|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>

==="Held stories" controversy===
{{wikinews|Newspaper refuses to utilize leaked documents in article}}
''The Plain Dealer'' made national headlines in summer 2005, when editor Douglas Clifton announced that the newspaper was withholding two stories "of profound importance" after [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' were ordered to reveal confidential sources who had provided information on [[Valerie Plame]], Joseph Wilson's wife, being a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative. Wilson was a prominent critic of the administration. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants. It was considered a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as "having no backbone" and he admitted that people could refer to him as "chickenshit". Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. "Talking isn't an option and jail is too high a price to pay", Clifton said.<ref name="clifton2">"WHO HAS YOUR BACK? Journalism in the Corporate Age", ''Columbia Journalism Review'', September 2005.</ref>

The controversy ended when the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'', an [[alternative weekly]] Cleveland newspaper, published a similar story. ''The Plain Dealer'' then printed the withheld story. It was a report of a federal corruption probe of former [[List of mayors of Cleveland|Mayor]] [[Michael R. White]], which was leaked to the press by an attorney on the case. The second withheld story has yet to be revealed.<ref name="held">"Keeping reporters' notes out of court", ''The American Editor,'' August 2005 – October 2005, FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.

===Music critic sidelining===
On September 17, 2008, [[Donald Rosenberg]], ''The Plain Dealer'''s music critic of sixteen years, was told by the paper's editor, [[Susan Goldberg]], that he would no longer be covering performances of the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. Rosenberg had criticized its performances under its conductor [[Franz Welser-Möst]], although his reviews of Welser-Möst as a conductor of operas had been positive. Terrance C. Z. Egger, president and publisher of the paper, was on the orchestra's board.<ref name=DR>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/arts/music/25crit.html?_r=1&ref=music&pagewanted=print|title=Music Critic vs. Maestro: One Loses His Beat|accessdate=2008-09-28|last=Wakin|first=Daniel J.|date=September 25, 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Shirley Strickland Saffold===
In March 2010, the ''Plain Dealer'' reported that about eighty comments had been posted to articles on its web site by an account registered to the email address of Shirley Strickland Saffold, a judge sitting on the [[Cuyahoga County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]].<ref name="PD20100327">{{cite news|last=McCarty|first=James F. |title=Anonymous online comments are linked to the personal e-mail account of Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Shirley Strickland Saffold|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/03/post_258.html|access-date=January 4, 2011|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=March 27, 2010}}</ref> Several of the comments, posted under the pseudonym ''lawmiss'', discussed matters that were or had been before the judge.<ref name="PD20100327"/> Although the judge's 23-year-old daughter Sydney Saffold took responsibility for the postings, the paper was able to use a public records request and determine that the exact times and dates of some of the postings corresponded to the times that the corresponding articles were being viewed on the judge's court-issued computer.<ref name="PD20100327"/> The revelation led one attorney, who had been criticized in the postings, to request the judge [[recuse]] herself from a [[homicide]] trial in which he represented the defendant.<ref name="PD20100408"/> [[Ohio Supreme Court]] Acting Chief Justice [[Paul E.
