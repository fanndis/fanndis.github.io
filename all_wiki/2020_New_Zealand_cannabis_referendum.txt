The '''2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum''' was a non-binding [[referendums in New Zealand|referendum]] held on 17 October 2020 in conjunction with the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]] and a [[2020 New Zealand euthanasia referendum|euthanasia referendum]], on the question of whether to legalise the sale, use, possession and production of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name="Cooke">{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |title=Explainer: The cannabis referendum and why it isn't binding |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/112525322/explainer-the-cannabis-referendum-and-why-it-isnt-binding |accessdate=9 May 2019 |work=Stuff |date=7 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=":0"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=About the 2020 General Election {{!}} Vote NZ|url=https://vote.nz/voting/get-ready-to-vote/about-the-2020-general-election/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=vote.nz}}</ref> The form of the referendum was a vote for or against the proposed "Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill".<ref name=":5"/> Preliminary results for the referendum were released by the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] on 30 October 2020.

=== Current laws ===
{{see also|Cannabis in New Zealand}}
Possession of any amount of cannabis is currently illegal in New Zealand. Cannabis use is currently controlled under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1975]] and the maximum sentence for possession of cannabis is 3 months' imprisonment or a $500 fine; although there is a presumption against imprisonment.<ref>Section 7(2)(b) Misuse of Drugs Act 1975</ref> The [[Presumption of supply in New Zealand|presumption of supply threshold]] is 28 grams or 100 joints; above this threshold it is presumed any cannabis possessed is for supply. Cultivation of cannabis carries a maximum penalty of 7 years' imprisonment, while dealing of cannabis carries a maximum penalty of 8 years' imprisonment.<ref name="MoDA72">{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/drugs-and-alcohol/cannabis-and-law|title=Possession and use of controlled drugs|date=8 September 2011|work=Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 No 116 (as at 08 September 2011), Public Act|publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|New Zealand Parliamentary Counsel Office/Te Tari Tohutohu Pāremata]]|location=[[Wellington|Wellington, New Zealand]]|at=Section 7(2)|accessdate=26 February 2012|ref=MoDANZ311}}</ref> Per the tariff case ''R v Terewi'' [1999], cultivating cannabis for personal use warrants a community sentence or, if there are aggravating factors, a short-term prison sentence.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=R v Terewi|court=|reporter=NZCA|vol=1999|opinion=92|date=25 May 1999|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/cases/NZCA/1999/92.html}}</ref>

=== Reasons for reform ===
==== Prohibition is ineffective ====
The [[New Zealand Drug Foundation]] says that 80% of New Zealanders have tried cannabis by age 21, but only 10% of the population become heavy users.<ref>[https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/info/drug-index/cannabis/ Cannabis], NZDF</ref> Kiwis consume around 74 tonnes of cannabis a year, so clearly, the current law doesn't stop people using it. Each year, the Police spend over 330,000 hours on cannabis enforcement which costs the taxpayer almost $200 million. Legalisation would free up Police to focus on more serious drug crimes.<ref name="drugfoundation.org.nz">[https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/policy-and-advocacy/vote-yes/ Vote Yes: Support the Cannabis Control Bill], NZ Drug Foundation</ref>

==== Disproportionate impact on Māori ====
At the moment, there is a significant underground market for cannabis and prohibition disproportionately criminalizes Māori. Māori are three times more likely to get a cannabis conviction than non-Māori for the same level of cannabis use, and are twice as likely as non-Māori to suffer a substance use disorder.<ref>[https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/policy-and-advocacy/vote-yes/why-legalise/ Why legalise.] Drug Foundation</ref> Māori also find it harder to access health and treatment services. Legalisation would largely eliminate the black market for cannabis and reduce the number of young Māori receiving convictions. The Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill would have addressed some of these harms, by enabling Māori participation in a regulated legal market, and providing for Māori representation on the body charged with developing national cannabis policy. 79% of Māori supported the Bill.<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/cannabis-referendum/300157652/why-referendums-are-never-likely-to-advance-mori-interests Why referendums are never likely to advance Māori interests], Stuff, 14 November 2020</ref>

==== Employment & tax intake ====
If legalised, the cannabis industry could employ about 5000 people and allow the government to regulate and tax the sale and distribution.<ref name="Why are we having this referendum"/> Studies conducted by BERL indicate the annual tax intake from cannabis, if it was legalised, would be more than $1 billion.<ref>[https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/09/cannabis-referendum-annual-tax-take-of-more-than-1-billion-if-legalised-report.html Cannabis referendum: Annual tax-take of more than $1 billion if legalised - report], Newshub 8 September 2020</ref> This could be put into health (including more addiction treatment facilities), schools, education programmes and other infrastructure that will benefit all New Zealanders.<ref name="drugfoundation.org.nz"/>

=== Opposition to reform ===
==== Impact on health ====
Cannabis smoke irritates the lungs, and people who smoke it frequently can have the similar breathing problems to those who smoke tobacco. These problems include daily cough and phlegm, more frequent lung illness, and a higher risk of lung infections. A succession of clinical studies have found it increases the risk of chronic bronchitis,  inflammation of the throat, and impaired immune function.<ref>[https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/matters-of-substance/november-2013/reducing-cannabis-health-harms/ Reducing cannabis health harms], NZDF</ref> However, it has not been shown to cause lung cancer.<ref>[https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana Marijuana Drug Facts], National Institute on Drug Abuse</ref>

==== Risk of psychosis ====
Some studies have found that cannabis contributes to depression, although better-quality studies have found cannabis use is more likely to increase the risk of psychosis among vulnerable individuals more than the risk of depression or anxiety.<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/smoking-cannabis-in-your-teens-linked-to-higher-risk-of-depression-study/QD4HFSBQPNF7EDKEDRQZBZX3OQ/ Smoking cannabis in your teens linked to higher risk of depression - study], NZ Herald 14 February 2019</ref> However, cannabis does not cause schizophrenia or psychosis,<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7442038/ The Association Between Cannabis Use and Schizophrenia: Causative or Curative? A Systematic Review], Cureus. July 2020. Vol. 12(7): e9309.</ref> but interacts with pre-existing genetic and environmental factors that can lead to early schizophrenia. In other words, it may precipitate schizophrenia in individuals who are vulnerable because of a personal or family history of schizophrenia.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2424288/ Cannabis use and the risk of developing a psychotic disorder], World Psychiatry. 2008 Jun; 7(2): 68–71.</ref>

The age at which teenagers start using cannabis is an important factor. Frequent use in early teens doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia in the future.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> Opponents of legalisation are concerned that  making cannabis legal might encourage more people, especially young people, to use it.<ref name="Why are we having this referendum"/>

==== Impact on brain development ====

Cannabis can also affect brain development in teenagers. When young people begin using marijuana, it may impair thinking, memory, and learning functions and impedes the development of neural connections between the areas necessary for these functions. A study from New Zealand, in conjunction with Duke University, found that heavy use by teens led to an average loss of 8 IQ points between ages 13 and 38. Even if these individuals quit as adults, those lost mental abilities didn't fully return. Those who started smoking cannabis as adults didn't show notable IQ declines.<ref>[https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana Marijuana Drug facts], National Institute on Drug Abuse</ref>

Concerns have also been raised that if more people start smoking it, this might lead to more road accidents and workplace injuries.

=== For medical use ===
Approved cannabis-based pharmaceuticals can be prescribed by a specialist doctor, but requires patients to meet strict criteria. As of April 2016, only [[Sativex]] is approved for use in New Zealand; it is not subsidised, so patients must pay the full retail cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/consumers/cmi/s/sativex.pdf |title=New Zealand Consumer Medical Information – Sativex, Oral spray |work=New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> However, the medicinal cannabis scheme significantly modifies the medical access to psychoactive cannabis products.<ref>{{cite web |title= Medicinal Cannabis Background  |url= https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/medicinal-cannabis-agency/medicinal-cannabis-agency-background-information |accessdate=23 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Medicinal Cannabis Agency Regulation |url= https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/medicinal-cannabis-agency |accessdate=23 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Medsafe Medical Cannabis Scheme Update |url= https://medsafe.govt.nz/profs/PUArticles/March2020/Medicinal-Cannabis-Scheme-Update.html |accessdate=23 July 2020}}</ref> Auditing of medicinal cannabis products under the scheme opened in April 2020.

Terminally ill patients have a legal defence against prosecution for possessing and consuming [[cannabis]] since the passing of the [[Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Act]] in December 2018.<ref name="NZH 11 Dec 2018">{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Lucy |title=Medicinal cannabis bill passes third reading |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12175064 |accessdate=28 December 2018 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=11 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bateman |first1=Sophie |title=Parliament passes medicinal cannabis Bill, promises regulated market and legal defence |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/12/parliament-passes-medicinal-cannabis-bill-promises-regulated-market-and-legal-defence.html |accessdate=30 December 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=11 December 2018}}</ref>

== Referendum structure ==
[[File:Sample ballot for the 2020 New Zealand referendums.jpg|thumb|A sample ballot for the 2020 referenda.]]
In May 2020 the final legislation was made available and it was confirmed that the question put to voters would be:<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill released|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/cannabis-legalisation-and-control-bill-released|last=Little|first=Andrew|date=1 May 2020|website=Beehive.govt.nz|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-05-01|title=Govt reveals final cannabis legislation to be voted on in referendum|work=Radio New Zealand|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/415566/govt-reveals-final-cannabis-legislation-to-be-voted-on-in-referendum}}</ref>
Do you support the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill?

The two options were: 
* ''"Yes, I support the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill"'' and
*''"No, I do not support the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill"''.

=== Proposed legislation ===
If passed into law, the proposed "Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill" would have served as the new regulatory framework for the production, sale, purchase and consumption of non-medical cannabis in New Zealand. A new regulatory body, the Cannabis Regulatory Authority would have been established with the primary objectives of promoting the well-being of New Zealanders, reducing cannabis-related harm and reducing the overall use of cannabis over time.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=Summary of the proposed Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill |url=https://www.referendums.govt.nz/cannabis/summary.html |publisher=NZ Government |accessdate=1 May 2020}}</ref>

The bill includes provisions for the following:
* Minimum purchase and possession age of 20 years old.
* Allowing an eligible person to purchase and possess up to 14 grams of dried cannabis (or its equivalent) per day.
* Allowing each eligible person to grow up to two cannabis plants for personal use on their own property, up to a maximum of four plants per household.
* A ban on marketing and advertising cannabis products
* Requirement to include harm minimisation messaging on cannabis products
* Confining use to private homes and licensed premises, and only in compliance with the [[Smoke-free Environments Act 1990]].
* Limiting the sale of recreational cannabis to physical stores (i.e. no remote or online sales)
* Control over the potency of recreational cannabis being sold
* State licensing regime for recreational cannabis 
* Applying an [[Excise|excise tax]] and a harm-reduction levy to cannabis products (in addition to the 15% [[Goods and Services Tax (New Zealand)|GST]] which applies to all goods sold in New Zealand)
* Establishing the Cannabis Regulatory Authority to license and authorise supply
The full text of the bill is available, along with a guide, from the New Zealand government's referendums website.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|title=Exposure Draft of the Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill|url=https://www.referendums.govt.nz/materials/Cannabis-Legalisation-and-Control-Bill-Exposure-Draft-for-Referendum.pdf|last=Parliamentary Counsel|accessdate=1 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A guide to the exposure draft Bill for referendum |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108050956/https://www.referendums.govt.nz/materials/Cannabis-Legalisation-and-Control-Bill-Exposure-Draft-for-Referendum.pdf |publisher=NZ Government |accessdate=1 May 2020}}</ref>

== Public opinion ==
Many polling organisations ask New Zealanders questions related to cannabis legislation. The results have been inconsistent, with "different companies producing wildly different results".<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/cannabis-referendum/123075813/cannabis-referendum-teens-overwhelmingly-support-legalising-cannabis--but-what-could-it-mean-for-them Cannabis referendum: Teens overwhelmingly support legalising cannabis - but what could it mean for them?] Stuff, 15 October 2020</ref> However, every poll has shown a clear split along age lines. Voters aged 18 to 29, Green and Labour party supporters and Māori people were more likely to support cannabis legalisation, while voters aged 50 and over and National party supporters were more likely to oppose cannabis legalisation.<ref>{{Cite news|title=1 NEWS Colmar Brunton Poll: Support for cannabis legalisation dropping, End of Life Choice remains steady|language=en-NZ|work=TVNZ|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/1-news-colmar-brunton-poll-support-cannabis-legalisation-dropping-end-life-choice-remains-steady-v1|access-date=2020-10-19}}</ref>

Overall, support for decriminalisation reached a peak of around 65% three years before the referendum,<ref name=Newshub>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/support-for-cannabis-reform-getting-higher.html |title=Support for cannabis reform getting higher |author=Newshub |date=20 August 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=1 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015019/http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/08/support-for-cannabis-reform-getting-higher.html |archive-date=7 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=NZHerald>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11906718|title=National voters, wider public back cannabis law reform: poll |author=Jones, Nicholas |date=19 August 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=NZDF>{{cite web |url=https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/news-media-and-events/support-for-cannabis-law-reform-remains-high/|title=Support for cannabis law reform remains high in 2017 |date=19 August 2017 |work=NZ Drug Foundation |accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref> but declined from 54% in February 2020<ref>[https://www.horizonpoll.co.nz/page/569/cannabis-referendum-vote-lead-builds-for-reform Cannabis referendum vote: lead builds for reform], Horizon Poll</ref> to around 45% in polls taken a month or so before the referendum. A 2020 study of Twitter users who tweeted about cannabis between July 2009 to August 2020 found that 62% had a positive view of cannabis, with tweets in 2020 having a slightly higher proportion of positive views on cannabis (65.3%), while 53.5% of those who talked about the cannabis referendum were in support of the bill.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Riordan |first1=Benjamin |last2=Raubenheimer |first2=Jacques |last3=Ward |first3=Rose Marie |last4=Merrill |first4=Jennifer |last5=Winter |first5=Taylor |last6=Scarf |first6=Damian |title=Monitoring the sentiment of cannabis‐related tweets in the lead up to New Zealand's cannabis referendum |journal=Drug and Alcohol Review |date=6 October 2020 |doi=10.1111/dar.13184 |pmid=33022132}}</ref>

Most polling conducted prior to September 2020 asked about opinions on the legalisation of cannabis for personal use, or in some cases, about government control of use and sale of cannabis, rather than about the Legalisation and Control Bill, which was released for public consultation in May 2020. Polls asking about the specific bill showed mixed opinion, from 35% for / 53% against to 49% for / 45% against.<ref>{{Cite news|title=1 NEWS Colmar Brunton Poll: Support for cannabis legalisation dropping, End of Life Choice remains steady|language=en-NZ|work=TVNZ|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/1-news-colmar-brunton-poll-support-cannabis-legalisation-dropping-end-life-choice-remains-steady-v1|access-date=2020-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-05|title=Cannabis reform would pass if referendum held today: Poll|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/122990847/cannabis-reform-would-pass-if-referendum-held-today-poll|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

Opinion poll numbers tend to trend higher around support for medicinal use of cannabis.<ref name=NZHerald/> When voting age New Zealanders were asked in July 2017 if they supported "growing and/or using cannabis for medical reasons if you have a terminal illness", 59% responded that it should be legal, 22% supported decriminalisation, while 15% responded it should be illegal. However, when they were asked their thoughts on "Possessing a small amount of cannabis for personal use", 37% responded that it should be decriminalised, 31% responded that it should be illegal, and 28% responded that it should be fully legal.<ref name=NZHerald/>

== Campaigning and endorsements ==
<!-- Endorsements must be notable. Individuals and organisations with Wikipedia articles are notable. Alternatively, endorsements with coverage from independent, reliable sources are also notable.  Scoop-posted press releases are not independent, and should only be used as citation for notable (blue-linked) individuals or orgs (an independent citation is still preferable). (See WP:GNG.) -->
The rules regarding campaigning for the referendum are generally the same as for the general election. All advertisements must carry a promoter statement, stating the name and physical address of the promoter. It is illegal to campaign on polling day, or within a 10-metre radius of an advance polling booth. Nine organisations registered as third-party promoters (both for and against) for the cannabis referendum.<ref name="stuff.co.nz">[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/cannabis-referendum/122141917/cannabis-referendum-the-arguments-for-and-against-legalising-recreational-cannabis Cannabis referendum: The arguments for and against legalising recreational cannabis], Stuff 23 July 2020</ref>

During the regulated period, which runs from 18 August to 16 October 2020, promoters have to declare their campaign expenses and there are limits on how much they may spend on referendum campaigning. The maximum expense limit is $338,000 per referendum for those promoters registered with the Electoral Commission, and $13,600 per referendum for unregistered promoters.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Change in regulated period {{!}} Elections|url=https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2020/change-in-regulated-period/|access-date=2020-08-22|website=elections.nz|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

As each polling place had only one ballot box for ordinary referendum votes, ordinary votes were broken down by the general electorate where the polling place was located. Special votes were broken down by electorate. Both ordinary and special votes have been combined in the following table.<ref>{{Cite web|date=6 November 2020|title=2020 Referendum Results by electorate|url=https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020/referendums-statistics/ElectorateReferendumResults.xlsx|website=Electoral Commission}}</ref>

==Public response==
In response to the release of the preliminary results on 31 October, Green Party Member of Parliament [[Chlöe Swarbrick]], a vocal campaigner for drug reform, vowed to continue the fight for decriminalising cannabis. She criticised the "Say Nope to Dope" campaign for allegedly spreading misinformation about drug reform.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Chlöe Swarbrick's message to cannabis haters after failed referendum: 'Well done - it still exists' |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/10/chl-e-swarbrick-s-message-to-cannabis-haters-after-failed-referendum-well-done-it-still-exists.html |accessdate=31 October 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=31 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031103458/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/10/chl-e-swarbrick-s-message-to-cannabis-haters-after-failed-referendum-well-done-it-still-exists.html |archive-date=31 October 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> She also labelled as hypocrites the majority of parliamentarians, who refused to publicly state they supported decriminalisation.<ref>[https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/10/chl-e-swarbrick-s-message-to-cannabis-haters-after-failed-referendum-well-done-it-still-exists.html Chlöe Swarbrick's message to cannabis haters after failed referendum: 'Well done - it still exists'], Newshub 31 October 2020</ref> Jacinda Ardern had, since the election, acknowledged she had voted in favour of legalising cannabis during the referendum, but had explicitly not endorsed a Yes or a No vote for the cannabis bill.<ref name="1 News 30 Oct 2020" />

Several "No" campaigners welcomed the preliminary result. National MP Nick Smith described the result as a victory for "common sense." Family First Director [[Bob McCoskrie]] of the "Say Nope to Dope" campaign said that he was "pretty stoked" with the referendum results, and fellow activist Aaron Ironside said that he was happy that New Zealand younger people would not be enlisted in a "social experiment."<ref name="1 News 30 Oct 2020">{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=Chlöe Swarbrick optimistic in light of unsuccessful cannabis referendum |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/chl-e-swarbrick-optimistic-in-light-unsuccessful-cannabis-referendum |accessdate=31 October 2020 |work=[[1 News]] |date=30 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031103147/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/chl-e-swarbrick-optimistic-in-light-unsuccessful-cannabis-referendum |archive-date=31 October 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Writing on Stuff, Damien Grant points out that previous governments have ignored referendum results and the new Labour Government should do the same.  He says: "Not only is the idea that the electorate should decide any particular issue impracticable, the closeness of the cannabis vote means that the prohibition of the drug is now unworkable" and argues that Parliament should, "consider the ethical merits of subjecting the minority of otherwise law-abiding citizens to criminal sanctions for smoking dried leaves at the behest of a puritan majority".<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/300157699/defying-cannabis-referendum-result-the-right-thing-to-do--and-pm-knows-it Defying cannabis referendum result the right thing to do - and PM knows it], Stuff, 15 November 2020</ref>

==Speculation on outcome==
Many public figures who supported the bill, and a vote for Yes, were surprised that the referendum did not pass in favour of the bill. Speculation about what caused this outcome included a lack of endorsement from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and campaigning from those who opposed the bill—including claims of "misinformation," as well as an early opposition message from the New Zealand Medical Association.

Associate Professor of Criminology, Dr Fiona Hutton, said the advertisements promoted by the No campaign were based on outdated moralised notions about people who use drugs, influenced by rightwing religious groups from the US: "The playing field was never level, (and) that absolutely fantastic academics, community groups, organisations and campaigners... sought to educate, to inform, to circulate evidence, to give people clear and balanced information, fought to get their voices heard amongst swirling misinformation and misdirection".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/09/new-zealands-rejection-of-legalising-cannabis-is-a-triumph-for-fear-mongering New Zealand's rejection of legalising cannabis is a triumph for fear-mongering], The Guardian, 9  November 2020</ref>

=== Opposition from NZMA ===
One factor may have been a statement opposing decriminalisation by the New Zealand Medical Association, published on 31 July 2020.<ref>[https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/new-zealands-cannabis-legalisation-and-regulation-bill-an-evidence-based-assessment-and-critique-of-essential-regulatory-components-towards-policy-outcomes New Zealand's ‘Cannabis Legalisation and Regulation Bill’: an evidence-based assessment and critique of essential regulatory components towards policy outcomes], NZMA</ref> The NZMA stated that "cannabis is a harmful drug that causes a range of health and social harms at the individual and community level".<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|date=13 October 2020|title=NZ Medical Association's U-turn on cannabis causes backlash from doctors|work=One News|publisher=TVNZ|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/nz-medical-associations-u-turn-cannabis-causes-backlash-doctors}}</ref>

It was subsequently revealed that the NZMA relied on outdated information and had not consulted any of its 5,000 doctors before making this statement public. Many GPs were upset by this and subsequently, more than 100 doctors publicly supported cannabis legalisation. Dr Emma Clare said many doctors thought the referendum would pass, and so did not speak up about the NZMA's anti legislation stance.<ref>[https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/428421/cannabis-referendum-more-than-100-doctors-back-legalising-recreational-use Cannabis referendum: More than 100 doctors back legalising recreational use], RNZ 15 October 2020</ref> The NZMA was also criticised by former Prime Minister Helen Clark, who said it had given "a false impression to voters of what doctors think". Less than two weeks before election day, when early voting had been going on for over a week, the NZMA  sent a letter of apology to its members which said: "The NZMA will have no position regarding the cannabis referendum."<ref>[https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/helen-clark-criticises-medical-association-after-very-late-clarification-cannabis-stance Helen Clark criticises Medical Association after 'very late' clarification on cannabis stance], One News 12 October 2020</ref><ref name="rnz.co.nz"/><ref name="Strang"/>

=== Lack of support from Jacinda Ardern ===
Another possible factor was the refusal by Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, to state publicly that she supported decriminalisation prior to the referendum.<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/election-2020-jacinda-ardern-refuses-to-say-how-she-will-vote-in-cannabis-referendum/TEGNX5MAYUWRU2ZCN4T5JXE4AU/ Election 2020: Jacinda Ardern refuses to say how she will vote in cannabis referendum], NZ Herald 11 August</ref> She voted in favour of legalising cannabis but only disclosed her position after preliminary results for the referendum were released. She defended this stance arguing that she wanted New Zealanders to form their own views.<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/123261775/pm-defends-no-comment-stance-on-cannabis-referendum PM defends no comment stance on cannabis referendum], NZ Herald, 31 October 2020</ref> On the other hand, she publicly announced that she backed the Bill legalising assisted dying, offering the same justification for her opposite stance - "I ultimately want people to make their own individual decisions".<ref>[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/i-want-people-to-make-their-own-choice-ardern-on-backing-euthanasia-bill/W64Y2YILOZYOF4FPJWTSMFGCCE/ I want people to make their own choice: Ardern on backing euthanasia bill]. NZ Herald, 25 June 2020</ref>

According to a Newshub-Reid Research poll, Ardern is New Zealand's most popular prime minister in a century, thanks to her success in dealing with [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand|the COVID-19 virus]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-politics-poll-idUSKBN22U0PI Ardern becomes New Zealand's most popular PM in a century: poll], Reuters 18 May 2020</ref> Given her popularity, if she had revealed that she supported legalisation, this may well have swung the vote by a few percentage points. Reporting for [[Stuff (website)|Stuff]], Henry Cooke wrote: "the one thing that could possibly save the cannabis yes vote would be an intervention from the prime minister." <ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300117812/election-2020-if-jacinda-ardern-supports-cannabis-legalisation-she-should-say-so Election 2020: If Jacinda Ardern supports cannabis legalisation, she should say so], Stuff 28 September 2020</ref>
