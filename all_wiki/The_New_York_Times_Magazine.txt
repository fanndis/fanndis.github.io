'''''The New York Times Magazine''''' is a [[Sunday magazine]] [[Supplement (publishing)|supplement]] included with the Sunday edition of ''[[The New York Times]]''. It is host to feature articles longer than those typically in the newspaper and has attracted many notable contributors. The magazine is also noted for its photography, especially relating to fashion and style.

The magazine also includes various puzzles, which have been popular features since their introduction.

==History==
Its first issue was published on September 6, 1896, and contained the first photographs ever printed in the newspaper.<ref name="time">The New York Times Company. [http://www.nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1881.html New York Times Timeline 1881-1910] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313111252/http://nytco.com/company/milestones/timeline_1881.html |date=2009-03-13 }}. Retrieved on 2009-03-13.</ref> In the early decades, it was a section of the broadsheet paper and not an insert as it is today. The creation of a "serious" Sunday magazine was part of a massive overhaul of the newspaper instigated that year by its new owner, [[Adolph Ochs]], who also banned [[fiction]], [[comic strips]] and [[gossip column]]s from the paper, and is generally credited with saving ''The New York Times'' from financial ruin.<ref name="seventy">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915282,00.html "The Kingdom and the Cabbage"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 1977-08-15. Retrieved on 2007-05-07.</ref> In 1897, the magazine published a 16-page spread of photographs documenting [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]], a "costly feat" that resulted in a wildly popular issue and helped boost the magazine to success.<ref name="fivethou">{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Jack |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE6DD1139F937A25757C0A960958260 |title= 5000 Sundays: Letter From the Editor |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-04-14 |accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

In its early years, ''The New York Times Magazine'' began a tradition of publishing the writing of well-known contributors, from [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Albert Einstein]] to numerous sitting and future [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]].<ref name="fivethou"/> Editor [[Lester Markel]], an "intense and [[autocratic]]" journalist who oversaw the Sunday ''Times'' from the 1920s through the 1950s, encouraged the idea of the magazine as a forum for ideas.<ref name="fivethou"/> During his tenure, writers such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Tennessee Williams]] contributed pieces to the magazine. When, in 1970, ''The New York Times'' introduced its first [[Op-Ed]] page, the magazine shifted away from publishing as many editorial pieces.<ref name="fivethou"/>

In 1979, the magazine began publishing [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist [[William Safire]]'s "[[On Language]]", a column discussing issues of English grammar, use and [[etymology]]. Safire's column steadily gained popularity and by 1990 was generating "more mail than anything else" in the magazine.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317950,00.html "Language Maven Strikes Again"], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', 1990-08-10. Retrieved on 2007-05-22.</ref> The year 1999 saw the debut of "The Ethicist", an advice column written by humorist [[Randy Cohen]] that quickly became a highly contentious part of the magazine.  In 2011, [[Ariel Kaminer]] replaced Cohen as the author of the column, and in 2012 [[Chuck Klosterman]] replaced Kaminer. Klosterman left in early 2015 to be replaced by a trio of authors—[[Kenji Yoshino]], [[Amy Bloom]], and [[Jack Shafer]]—who used a conversational format; Shafer was replaced three months later by [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]], who assumed sole authorship of the column in September 2015. "Consumed", [[Rob Walker (journalist)|Rob Walker]]'s regular column on consumer culture, debuted in 2004. The Sunday ''Magazine'' also features a [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|puzzle page]], edited by [[Will Shortz]], that features a [[crossword puzzle]] with a larger grid than those featured in the ''Times'' during the week, along with other types of puzzles on a rotating basis (including [[Crossword#Diagramless crosswords|diagramless]] crossword puzzles and [[anacrostic]]s).

In September 2010, as part of a greater effort to reinvigorate the magazine, ''Times'' editor [[Bill Keller]] hired former staff member and then-editor of ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', [[Hugo Lindgren]], as the editor of ''The New York Times Magazine''.<ref name="LindgrenEditor">{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/hugo-lindgren-named-editor-of-the-times-magazine/ |title= Hugo Lindgren Named Editor of The Times Magazine |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref>  As part of a series of new staff hires upon assuming his new role, Lindgren first hired then–executive editor of ''O: The Oprah Magazine'' [[Lauren Kern]] to be his deputy editor<ref name="Kern">{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/times-names-deputy-magazine-editor/?pagemode=print |title= Times Names Deputy Magazine Editor |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> and then hired then-editor of TNR.com, ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine's website, [[Greg Veis]], to edit the "front of the book" section of the magazine.<ref name="VeisFront">{{cite news |url= http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/10/tnrs_greg_veis_to_the_new_york.html |title= TNR's Greg Veis to The New York Times Magazine |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> In December 2010, Lindgren hired Joel Lovell, formerly story editor at ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, as deputy editor.<ref>Summers, Nick. [http://www.observer.com/2011/media/inside-media-hiring-bubble "Inside the Media Hiring Bubble"]. ''[[The New York Observer]]'', January 4, 2011</ref>

In January 2012, humorist [[John Hodgman]], who hosts his comedy court show podcast ''[[Judge John Hodgman]]'', began writing a regular column "Judge John Hodgman Rules" (formerly "Ask Judge John Hodgman") for "The One-Page Magazine".<ref name="JUDGE JOHN HODGMAN'S VEST POCKET ARGUMENT SETTLER ">{{cite web |author=[[John Hodgman]]|url=http://www.johnhodgman.com/post/16723109678/judge-john-hodgmans-vest-pocket-argument-settler |title=Judge John Hodgman's Vest Pocket Argument Settler |publisher=JohnHodgman.com |date=29 January 2012 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}</ref>

==Supplements==

In 2004, ''The New York Times Magazine'' began publishing an entire supplement devoted to style. Titled ''[[T (New York Times)|T]]'', the supplement is edited by [[Deborah Needleman]] and appears 14 times a year.
In 2009, it launched a Qatari Edition as a standalone magazine.

In 2006, the magazine introduced two other supplements: ''PLAY'', a sports magazine published every other month, and ''KEY'', a real estate magazine published twice a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.whsites.net/mediakit/pages/m_ed_highlight.html |title=Media Kit 2007: Magazine Highlights|author=The New York Times Company|date=2006 |accessdate = 2007-05-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070503075148/http://www.nytimes.whsites.net/mediakit/pages/m_ed_highlight.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-03}}</ref>

==Poetry==
US Poet Laureate [[Natasha Trethewey]] selects and introduces poems weekly, including from poets [[Tomas Transtromer]], [[Carlos Pintado]], and [[Gregory Pardlo]].

==Puzzles==
The magazine features the Sunday version of the [[crossword puzzle]] along with other puzzles.  The puzzles have been very popular features since their introduction.  The Sunday crossword puzzle has more clues and squares and is generally more challenging than its counterparts featured on the other days of the week.  Usually, a second puzzle is included with the crossword puzzle.  The variety of the second puzzle varies each week.  These have included [[acrostic]] puzzles, [[diagramless]] crossword puzzles, and other puzzles varying from the traditional crossword puzzle.

The puzzles are edited by [[Will Shortz]], the host of the on-air puzzle segment of [[NPR]]'s ''[[Weekend Edition Sunday]]'' (introduced as "the puzzlemaster").

==''The Funny Pages''==
{{External links|section|date=March 2013}}

In the September 18, 2005, issue of the magazine, an editors' note announced the addition of ''The Funny Pages'', a literary section of the magazine intended to "engage our readers in some ways we haven't yet tried—and to acknowledge that it takes many different types of writing to tell the story of our time".<ref name="funny intro">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E5D91031F93BA2575AC0A9639C8B63 "From the Editors; The Funny Pages"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2005-09-18. Retrieved on 2007-05-05.</ref> Although ''The Funny Pages'' is no longer published in the magazine, it was made up of three parts: the Strip (a multipart [[graphic novel]] that spanned weeks), the Sunday Serial (a [[genre fiction]] [[serial novel]] that also spanned weeks), and True-Life Tales (a humorous personal [[essay]], by a different author each week).  On July 8, 2007, the magazine stopped printing True-Life Tales.

The section has been criticized for being unfunny, sometimes nonsensical, and excessively [[highbrow]]; in a 2006 poll conducted by [[Gawker.com]] asking, "Do you now find—or have you ever found—''The Funny Pages'' funny?", 92% of 1824 voters answered "No".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gawker.com/news/new-york-times-magazine/is-the-times-magazine-funny-154425.php | title = Is the 'Times Magazine' Funny? | publisher = [[Gawker.com]] | accessdate = 2007-05-07 | date = 2006-02-13 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809132847/http://www.gawker.com/news/new-york-times-magazine/is-the-times-magazine-funny-154425.php | archivedate = 2007-08-09 }}</ref>
