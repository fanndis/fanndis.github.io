'''Te Aroha''' ({{lang-mi|Te Aroha-a-uta}}) is a rural town in the [[Waikato]] region of [[New Zealand]] with a population of 3,906 people in the 2013 census, an increase of 138 people since 2006.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|13693}}</ref> It is {{convert|53|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]]. It sits at the foot of {{convert|952|m}} '''Mount Te Aroha''', the highest point in the [[Kaimai Range]].

== History ==
The name Te Aroha derives from the [[Māori language|Māori]] name of Mount Te Aroha. In one version, [[Rāhiri]], the [[Myth of origins|eponymous ancestor]] of [[Ngāti Rāhiri Tumutumu]], climbed the mountain and saw his homeland in the distance and felt a sense of love ({{lang|mi|aroha}}) for it. The town is properly named {{lang|mi|Te Aroha-a-uta}}; {{lang|mi|uta}} meaning 'inland', so the town is named "love flowing inland".<ref name="NZHistory">{{cite web |title=Te Aroha |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/keyword/te-aroha |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=8 May 2020}}</ref>

The European settlement was established in the late 1870s. The population grew quickly during the 1880s as a result of a [[gold rush]]. A spa was founded in 1883 but popularity had declined by the 1930s.<ref name="NZHistory"/>

== Geography ==
[[File:Waterfall at Te Aroha. ATLIB 285876.png|thumb|Waterfall at Te Aroha]]
The [[Waihou River]] runs through Te Aroha. Close by to the east is the base of the [[Kaimai Range]], and the town is overlooked by the 952-metre Mount Te Aroha. To the north of the town is the low-lying, swampy land of the [[Hauraki Plains]].  
[[hot spring|Thermal]] and [[mineral spring]]s are both found close to the centre of the town, as is the world's only hot soda water [[geyser]].

== Economy ==
Te Aroha is at the centre of a [[dairy farming]] community and much of its economic activity is in serving that community. Tourism is increasing in Te Aroha. The mineral baths are a very popular spot for tourists and locals alike.
