'''Repatriation''' is the process of returning an asset, an item of symbolic value, or a person—voluntarily or forcibly—to its owner or their place of origin or citizenship. The term may refer to non-human entities, such as converting a foreign currency into the currency of one's own country, as well as to the process of returning [[military personnel]] to their place of origin following a [[war]]. It also applies to diplomatic envoys, international officials as well as [[expatriates]] and [[Human migration|migrants]] in time of international crisis. For [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|illegal migrants]], repatriation can mean either [[voluntary return]] or [[deportation]].

==Repatriation of humans==

===Overview and clarification of terms===

====Voluntary vs. forced return====
[[Voluntary return]] is the return of eligible persons, such as refugees, to their [[country of origin]] or citizenship on the basis of freely expressed willingness to such return. Voluntary return, unlike expulsion and deportation, which are actions of sovereign states, is defined as a personal right under specific conditions described in various international instruments, such as the [[OAU Convention]], along with customary international law.

Some countries offer financial support to refugees and immigrants in order to facilitate the process of starting a new life in their country of origin. Examples of 21st century voluntary return include the Danish government, which in 2009 began offering £12,000 each to immigrants to return,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/6533845/Denmark-offers-immigrants-12000-to-return-home.html "Denmark offers immigrants £12,000 to return home"], The Telegraph.

Swiss Info. June 6, 2014. Retrieved 9 Feb 2017</ref> This financial support may also be considered as residency buyouts.

Two countries may have a re-admission agreement, which establishes procedures, on a reciprocal basis, for one state to return irregular non-nationals to their country of origin or a country through which they have transited.<ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/> [[Illegal immigrant]]s are frequently repatriated as a matter of government policy. Repatriation measures of [[voluntary return]], with financial assistance, as well as measures of [[deportation]] are used in many countries.

As repatriation can be voluntary or forced, the term is also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to their country of origin under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected from [[refoulement]] and given, if possible, temporary or permanent [[Political asylum|asylum]].<ref name="Perruchoud 2011">Perruchoud, Richard and Jillyanne Redpath-Cross (eds.), Glossary on Migration, Second Edition, International Organisation for Migration, International Migration Law, No. 25, Geneva, 2011.</ref> The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as [[refoulement]], which is against international law.

====Repatriation vs. return====
While repatriation necessarily brings an individual to his or her territory of origin or citizenship, a return potentially includes bringing the person back to the point of departure. This could be to a third country, including a country of transit, which is a country the person has traveled through to get to the country of destination. A return could also be within the territorial boundaries of a country, as in the case of returning [[internally displaced persons]] and demobilized combatants. The distinction between repatriation and return, voluntary or involuntary, is not always clear.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Julien|last=Brachet|title=Policing the Desert: The IOM in Libya Beyond War and Peace|journal=Antipode|volume=48|number=2|date=2016|pages=272–292|doi=10.1111/anti.12176}}</ref>

===Types of human repatriation===

====Medical repatriation====
Repatriation is linked with health care due to the costs and resources associated with providing medical treatment to travelers and immigrants pursuing citizenship. For example, if a foreign national is in the United States with a visa and becomes ill, the insurance that the visa holder has in his or her native country may not apply in the United States, especially if it is a country with [[universal health care]] coverage. This scenario forces hospitals to choose one of three options:  
* Limit their services to emergency care only (as per the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]])  
* Offer charity care free of charge or at a reduced rate  
* Repatriate the patient back to his or her native country where he or she will be covered according to that country's policy<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wack|first=Kevin J.|author2=Toby Schonfeld |title=Patient Autonomy and the Unfortunate Choice between Repatriation and Suboptimal Treatment|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2012|volume=12|issue=9|pages=6–7|doi=10.1080/15265161.2012.692444|pmid=22881843}}</ref>
Determining which option is the most ethical is often very challenging for hospital administrators.

In some cases, a traveler's personal insurance company is required to repatriate the patient for medical treatment. The method of repatriation could be via regular flight, by ground, or by air ambulance. Medical repatriation is different from the act of [[medical evacuation]].

====Post–World War II====
In the 20th century, following all European wars, several repatriation commissions were created to supervise the return of war refugees, [[displaced person]]s, and [[prisoners of war]] to their country of origin. Repatriation [[hospital]]s were established in some countries to care for the ongoing medical and health requirements of returned military personnel. In the [[Soviet Union]], the refugees seen as traitors for surrendering were often killed or sent to [[Siberia]]n concentration camps.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Paul|title=Ostarbeiters|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2005/6/po8.html|website=Coffee Lounge|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref>

Issues surrounding repatriation have been some of the most heatedly debated political topics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Many [[Operation Keelhaul|forced back to the Soviet Union by Allied forces]] in [[World War II]] still hold this forced migration against the [[United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The term ''repatriation'' was often used by Communist governments to describe the large-scale state-sponsored [[ethnic cleansing]] actions and [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of national groups. [[Poland|Poles]] born in territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union,  although deported to the State of Poland, were settled in the annexed former [[Germany|German]] territories (referred to in Polish as the [[Regained Territories]]). In the process they were told that they had returned to their Motherland.

====Battlefield casualties====
The [[Korean War]] marked the first time that the United States or any nation began returning the bodies of battlefield casualties as soon as possible.<ref name=Sledge>{{cite book |last=Sledge |first=Michael |title=Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen |orig-year=First published 2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231509374 |pages=78–80 |oclc= 60527603 |date=2005-04-26 }}</ref> During [[Operation Glory]], which followed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]], thousands of remains were exchanged by both sides.<ref name=Sledge /><ref>Not all remains from the Korean War were returned to the home countries. Some 2,300 casualties are buried at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].</ref> The practice of immediately recovering casualties continued for United States during the [[Vietnam War casualties|Vietnam War]].<ref name=Sledge />

===Repatriation laws===
{{See also|Right of Return}}
Repatriation laws give non-citizen foreigners who are part of the titular [[Ethnic majority|majority group]] the opportunity to immigrate and receive [[citizenship]]. Repatriation of their titular diaspora is practiced by most [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] states. Repatriation laws have been created in many countries to enable [[diaspora]]s to immigrate ("return") to their "kin-state". This is sometimes known as the exercise of the [[right of return]]. Repatriation laws give members of the diaspora the right to immigrate to their kin-state and they serve to maintain close ties between the state and its diaspora and gives preferential treatment to diaspora immigrants.

Most countries in central and eastern Europe as well as [[Armenia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Turkey]] have longstanding repatriation legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|title=Democratic Norms, Diasporas, and Israel's Law of Return|last2=Rubinstein|first2=Amnon|author-link2=Amnon Rubinstein|first1=Alexander|last1=Yakobson|author-link1=Alexander Yakobson|work=ajc.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126182841/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|archive-date=2010-11-26}}</ref> [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]] also have repatriation laws for their diaspora populations. The number of countries with repatriation laws has mushroomed since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of Soviet communism]] and most independent nations that were [[Post-Soviet states|once part of the communist domain]] in [[Europe]] have since legislated repatriation laws. Many other countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Sweden]] have (or have had) generous immigration policies with regard to the nation's [[diaspora]] without having formally enacted repatriation laws. Such states can be described as practicing ''common law repatriation''.

In comparison, one of the central tenets of the [[Rastafari movement]] is the desirability of the repatriation of [[black people]] from the [[Americas]] and elsewhere back to [[Africa]]. While [[Ethiopia]] specifically has land available in [[Shashamane]] to encourage this project, black people who are citizens of countries outside Africa do not have the [[right of return]] to Africa, although as individuals they are free to try to [[emigration|emigrate]].

===Psychological aspects===
Repatriation is often the "forgotten" phase of the [[expatriation]] cycle; the emphasis for support is mostly on the actual period abroad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, many repatriates report experiencing difficulties on return: one is no longer special, practical problems arise, new knowledge gained is no longer useful, etc. These difficulties are highly influenced by a number of factors including [[Personal development|self-management]], [[Marriage|spouse's]] adjustment, time spent abroad and skill utilisation. What is crucial is that every individual perceives these factors in a different way. Reintegration is a process of re-inclusion or re-incorporation of a person into a group or a process, and may contribute to overcoming repatriation.<ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/>

Direct managers and [[Human resources|HR]] staff often notice the difficulties a repatriate experiences, but they are not always able to act on it. Budget shortcomings and time constraints are frequently cited as reasons why it fails to be an agenda priority. Solutions for repatriation difficulties do not have to be expensive and can lead to great benefits for the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Basic support can consist, for example, of good communication in advance, during and after the international assignment, or a mentor program to assist the repatriate. The expatriate and his/her family should feel understood by his or her company. Support can increase job satisfaction, thereby protecting the investment made by the company.<ref>Ripmeester, N. “Handle with care”, ''Graduate Recruiter'', Issue 22 (February) 2005</ref>

==Repatriation of non-human entities==

===Human remains===
[[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|Return of human remains]] to their nation of origin. In the United States, Native Americans' human remains are uncovered and removed from their burial sites in the construction/land development process or as part of archaeological excavations<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mithlo|first=Nancy Marie|date=2004|title="Red-Man’s Burden": The Politics of Inclusion in Museum Settings|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=28(3&4)|pages=743-763}}</ref>. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) of 1990 established the process whereby federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations can request that federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funds return culturally affiliated human remains.  The NAGPRA also sets forth provisions that allow for the disposition of Native American human remains found on federal lands to the affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.  NAGPRA does not apply to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which is covered under the repatriation provisions of the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989. In previous eras it was common for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colony|colonial]] authorities to collect heads and other body parts of indigenous peoples such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] for display in British museums. The repatriation of these body parts is currently ongoing.  For an example of a successful body part repatriation, see [[Yagan]]. Another example can be seen through the dedicated work of the Karanga Aotearoa Repatriation Programme, established in partnership between Māori and the New Zealand government in 2003.  This programme is administered by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), and since 2003 has repatriated over 350 Māori and Moriori ancestral remains to Aotearoa New Zealand. Article 12 of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to repatriate their human remains. The declaration was passed in September 2007 with the support of 143 countries. The four opposing countries—Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States—subsequently endorsed the declaration.

=== Cultural artifacts===
Cultural or [[art repatriation]] is the return of cultural objects or works of art to their country of origin (usually referring to ancient art), or (for looted material) its former owners (or their heirs).

=== Economic repatriation===
Economic repatriation refers to the process of a company getting it's profits back into their own country. There are four main methods of repatriation: Dividends and Profits, Royalties, Management Service Fees and Intercompany Loans.<ref>{{cite web |title=Methods of Repatriation |url=https://ieglobal.vistra.com/sites/default/files/resources/radius-resource-methods-cash-repatriation.pdf |publisher=Radius: Global Growth Experts |accessdate=3 September 2020}}</ref>

===Repatriation of currency===
Repatriation of currency is when foreign currency is converted back to the currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the payment of a dividend by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently hundreds of billions of dollars of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings.
