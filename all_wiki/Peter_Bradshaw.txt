==The ''Evening Standard'' and the Alan Clark case==
Before joining ''The Guardian'', Bradshaw was employed by the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' as a columnist, and during the 1997 General Election, editor [[Max Hastings]] asked him to write a series of parodic diary entries purporting to be written by the Conservative MP and historian [[Alan Clark]], which Clark thought deceptive and which were the subject of a court case resolved in January 1998, the first in newspaper history in which the subject of a satire sued its author. Bradshaw was not put into the witness box by his QC [[Peter Prescott (barrister)|Peter Prescott]], and the judge [[Gavin Lightman]] found in Clark's favour, granting an injunction, deciding that Bradshaw's articles were then being published in a form that "a substantial number of readers" would believe they were genuinely being written by Alan Clark.<ref>Kate O'Hanlon [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-report-format-of-parodied-clark-diaries-was-deceptive-1140285.html "Law report: Format of parodied Clark diaries was deceptive"], ''The Independent'', 28 January 1998</ref> Bradshaw found it "the most bizarre and surreal business of my professional life. I'm very flattered that Mr Clark should go to all this trouble and expense in suing me like this."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/49346.stm "Clark victorious in diary battle"], BBC News, 21 January 1998</ref>
