'''United Breweries Holdings Limited''' (UBHL) or '''UB Group''' is an Indian [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] company headquartered in [[UB City]], [[Bangalore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. Its core business includes beverages and investments in various sectors. The company markets beer under the [[Kingfisher (beer)|Kingfisher brand]], and owns various other brands of [[alcoholic beverages]]. It also launched [[Kingfisher Airlines]], an airline in India whose operation has been halted after problems in 2014 that led to its licence being revoked by the [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|DGCA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/government-withdraws-all-international-flying-rights-and-domestic-slots-from-kingfisher-airlines/articleshow/18684088.cms/ |title=economic express}}</ref>  United Breweries is India's largest producer of beer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gupta |first1=Soumya |title=Kingfisher's market share drops as foreign beer brands gain ground |url=https://www.livemint.com/Companies/pSVB3cyL8nI1CO4oofqVgO/Kingfishers-market-share-drops-as-foreign-beer-brands-gain.html |website=livemint |publisher=HT Media}}</ref>

The company chairman is Vijay Mallya, who left India on 2 March 2016, allegedly to escape legal action by Indian banks to whom he owes some {{INRConvert|9000|c}} in loans. United Breweries now has greater than a 40% share of the Indian brewing market with 79 distilleries and bottling units across the world. In 2005, UB financed a takeover of the spirits business of the rival [[Shaw-Wallace]] company, giving it a majority share of India's spirits business.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mallya bottles Shaw Wallace |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050322/asp/business/story_4522815.asp |publisher=The Telegraph |date=22 March 2005}}</ref> The group also owns the [[Mendocino Brewing Company]] in the United States.

==History==
The UB Group was founded by a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]], Thomas Leishman, in 1915, when he brought together Castle Brewery and Nilgiris Breweries (1857), Bangalore Brewing Co. (1885), British Brewing Corp. (1903) and BBB Brewery Co. Ltd. (1913). The Group took its initial lessons in manufacturing [[beer]] from [[South India]] based British Breweries. 
At the age of 22, [[Vittal Mallya]] was elected as the company's first Indian director in 1947. After a year, he replaced R. G. N. Price as the chairman of the company.

United Breweries made its initial impact by manufacturing bulk beer for the British troops before independence, which was transported in huge barrels or "Hogsheads". Kingfisher, the group's most visible and profitable brand, made a modest entry in the sixties. During the 1950s and 60s, the company expanded greatly by acquiring other breweries. First was the addition of [[McDowell (brewing brand)|McDowell]] as one of the Group subsidiaries, a move which helped United Breweries to extend its portfolio to wines and spirits business. Strategically, the Group moved into agro-based industries and medicines when Mallya acquired [http://www.kissan.in/ Kissan] Products and formed a long-term relationship with [[Hoechst AG]] of [[Germany]] to create the Indian pharmaceutical company now known as [[Aventis Pharma]], the Indian subsidiary of the global pharma major [[Sanofi-Aventis]].

UB Group has had some relationship with [[United Spirits Limited]], which is now majority-owned (54.8%) by [[Diageo]].

===The logo===
The [[Pegasus]], which is the symbol of the United Breweries, first found its place as the Group logo in 1941.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Then, the [[Helladic]] horse – associated with [[beer]] and [[nectar]] in Greek [[mythology]] – carried a beer cask between the wings, ostensibly because beer formed the core operations of the Group. Later, the beer cask was removed to represent the Group's multifaceted operations.
