==History of Radio Kiev and Ukrainian Radio==

In the 1920s and 1930s, due to the lack of accurate or reliable information, Radio Kiev or the Kiev Radio was a common name used outside of Ukraine for shortwave broadcast stations located within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Wireless World guide of 1935 reported station RW20 operating from Kharkov in eastern Ukraine on a longwave frequency of 385&nbsp;kHz with power of 10 Kw broadcasting in Russian.  With the onset of World War II in 1941 and the subsequent Nazi occupation of the Ukrainian S.S.R. radio broadcast stations were captured and removed from service. At the end of World War II, during 1946, radio broadcasting began to revive and the World Radio guide of 1946 reported the following stations on the air in Ukraine:

*Kiev 1 on 248&nbsp;kHz with 120 Kw power
*Kiev 2 on 832&nbsp;kHz with 35 Kw power
*Kharkov on 385&nbsp;kHz with 10 Kw power
*Odessa on 968&nbsp;kHz with 10 Kw power
*Dnepropetrovsk on 913&nbsp;kHz with 10 Kw power

On November 1, 1950, Radio Kiev was formally introduced and transmitted its first broadcasts in the Ukrainian language only. These broadcasts were intended to reach the Ukrainian diaspora via shortwave radio, with frequencies in the 31, 25, and 19 meter shortwave bands using high power [[AM broadcasting|amplitude modulated (AM)]] transmitters with omni-directional antennas. In October 1962 Radio Kiev introduced its first English language program broadcast schedule with daily transmissions on various shortwave frequencies. These transmissions originated from multiple transmitting sites employing high power Russian made (KOM) transmitters and gain type "steerable" antenna systems capable of the precision directing of radio broadcasts to desired regions worldwide. In 1966 German language programming was introduced, followed by Romanian language broadcasts in 1970, along with additional transmitting sites. By the late 1970s the following transmitting sites were active full-time on various time and frequency schedules within the territory:

*Kiev region (Brovary) - 1 site of 15 Kw, 4 sites of 100 Kw, and 5 sites of 200 Kw
*Donetsk region (Kopani) - 2 sites of 100 Kw, 2 sites of 250 Kw, and 4 sites of 1000 Kw
*Lviv region (Krasne) - 3 sites of 200 Kw, 2 sites of 1000 Kw
*Kharkiv region (Kharkiv) - 3 sites of 100 Kw
*Odessa region (Odessa) - 2 sites of 100 Kw
