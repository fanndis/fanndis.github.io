'''Suez S.A.''' was a leading [[France|French]] [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]],<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20021230150209/http://www.suez.com/mention-uk.htm Disclaimer]." Suez. Retrieved on 7 July 2010.</ref> with operations primarily in [[water]], [[electricity]] and [[natural gas]] supply, and [[waste management]]. Suez was the result of a 1997 merger between the ''[[Compagnie de Suez]]'' and ''[[:fr:Lyonnaise des Eaux|Lyonnaise des Eaux]]'', a leading French water company. In the early 2000s Suez also owned some [[mass media|media]] and [[telecommunication]]s assets, but has since [[divestment|divested]] these.

==History==
Suez was (and remains, through GDF Suez) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world, with one line of corporate history dating back to the 1822 founding of the {{lang|nl|Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt}} (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King [[William I of the Netherlands]] (see [[Société Générale de Belgique]]). Its form prior to the GDF merger was the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers.  Its most recent name comes from the involvement of one of its several founding entities – the ''[[Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez]]'' – in building the [[Suez Canal]] in the mid-19th century.

===Merger with Gaz de France===
On February 25, 2006, French Prime minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] announced the merger of Suez and [[Gaz de France]], which would make the world's largest [[liquefied natural gas]] company.<ref>http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3234,36-745348,0.html (subscription)</ref> The [[revenue]] of GDF was around 22.4 billion euros in 2005, compared to 41.5 billion for Suez. The [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT trade-union]] called the merger a  "disguised privatization."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-28/2006-02-28-825123 |title=GDF-Suez petits arrangements avec la vérité |publisher=humanite.fr |access-date=2006-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624065945/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2006-02-28/2006-02-28-825123 |archive-date=2006-06-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger. The deal was conducted on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France. The French state holds more than 35% of shares of the merged company, GDF Suez.<ref name=rtt>{{cite news | url=http://www.rttnews.com/sp/todaystop.asp?item=3 | title=Suez, Gaz De France Agree To New Merger Deal | publisher=RTT News | date=2007-09-04 | access-date=2007-09-04 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330021837/http://www.rttnews.com/sp/todaystop.asp?item=3 | archive-date=2008-03-30 }}</ref> As a consequence of the conditions posed by the [[European Commission]] with regards to allowing the merger, on 29 May 2008 Suez sold its Belgian gas supplier [[Distrigas]] to the Italian company [[Eni]] for €2.7 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/07/16/ap5220651.html|title=Key moments in GDF Suez combination|date=16 July 2008|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=2008-07-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> On 22 July 2008 the group [[GDF Suez]], a company of €74 billion of annual turnover, was officially created.<ref name="Bloom" />
