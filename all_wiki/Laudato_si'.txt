{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Laudato si'''''' (''Praise Be to You'') is the second [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Francis]]. The encyclical has the subtitle "on care for our common home".<ref name="OfficialEngText" /> In it, the pope critiques [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment|irresponsible development]], laments [[environmental degradation]] and [[global warming]], and calls all people of the world to take "swift and unified global action."<ref name="NYT"/>

The encyclical, dated 24 May 2015, was officially published at noon on 18 June 2015, accompanied by a news conference.<ref name="NYT" /> The Vatican released the document in Italian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese and Arabic, alongside the original Latin.<ref name=strong />

The encyclical is the second published by Francis, after ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' (''The Light of Faith''), which was released in 2013. Since ''Lumen fidei'' was largely the work of Francis's predecessor [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], ''Laudato si{{'}}'' is generally viewed as the first encyclical that is entirely the work of Francis.<ref name="Crux" /><ref name=things />

[[File:John Zizioulas presents the encyclical Laudato si' at the press conference in Rome.webm|thumb| [[John Zizioulas]],  [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]  [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Pergamon]], presents the encyclical ''Laudato si''' at the [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Press Conference Presentation Laudato si'|press conference]] in Rome. ]]
The title of the social encyclical is an [[Central Italian|Umbrian]] phrase<ref name="Crux" /> from [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 13th-century "[[Canticle of the Sun]]" (also called the Canticle of the Creatures), a poem and prayer in which God is praised for the creation of the different creatures and aspects of the Earth.<ref name=bulletin />

The tone of the Pope's phrasing has been described as "cautious and undogmatic, and he specifically calls for discussion and dialogue."<ref name=good/>  For example, he states in the encyclical (#188):

<blockquote>
There are certain environmental issues where it is not easy to achieve a broad consensus. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.<ref name=good/>
</blockquote>

He adds that "Although the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history, nonetheless there is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  Francis does state that concern for the natural world is no longer "'optional' but is an integral part of the Church teaching on social justice."<ref name=visitor/>

Francis reportedly has said that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all.<ref name=vow/>  The warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as they pursue short-term economic gains.<ref name=vow/>  This has resulted in a "[[throwaway culture]]" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste.<ref name=vow/><ref name=return/>  This subtext makes the document "more profoundly subversive" than it appears on the surface.<ref name=vow/>

The real problem, according to Francis, lies in the fact that humans no longer see God as the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]].<ref name=return/>  Thus we see "other living beings as mere objects subjected to arbitrary human domination" and do not realize that "the ultimate purpose of other creatures is not found in us."<ref name=return/> Francis says that instead of viewing humanity as having "dominion" over the earth, we must see that everything is interconnected and that all of creation is a "kind of universal family".<ref name=visitor/> Nature cannot be seen as something apart from humanity, or merely the place where we live.<ref name=visitor/> He says that our social and environmental crises are thus one complex crisis that must be solved holistically.<ref name=visitor/>

===Environmentalism===
Francis "pulls no punches" when lamenting pollution, [[global warming|climate change]], a lack of clean water, [[loss of biodiversity]], and an overall decline in human life and a breakdown of society.<ref name=visitor/> "Never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last two hundred years," he states.<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>

He "describe[s] a relentless [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[Environmental degradation|destruction]] of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness."<ref name="NYT" /> ''Laudato si''' "unambiguously accepts the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that [[global warming|changes in the climate]] are largely man-made"<ref name=eco /> and states that "climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day" and warns of "unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us" if prompt [[climate change mitigation]] efforts are not undertaken.<ref name="OfficialEngText"/><ref name="NYT" />

The encyclical highlights the role of [[fossil fuel]]s in causing climate change. "We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay," Francis says. "Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the less harmful alternative or to find short-term solutions."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  The encyclical's comments on climate change are consistent with the [[scientific consensus on climate change]].<ref name="GillisScience" />

===Poverty===
The encyclical states that [[developed nation]]s are morally obligated to assist [[developing nation]]s in combating the climate-change crisis.<ref name="NYT" /> Poor nations, the pontiff says, are ill-prepared to [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to the effects of climate change]] and will bear the brunt of its [[Effects of global warming|effects]].<ref name=eco />  Linking the issues of [[poverty]], which has been a major issue in his papacy, and the environment, he insists that the world must "hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."<ref name=eco />

He does not believe, according to [[R.&nbsp;R. Reno]], that "for all our flaws, Western societies are more democratic, more egalitarian, and more inclusive than any in history."<ref name=return/>  Citing the New Zealand Bishops Conference ''Statement on Environmental Issues'', Francis asks "what the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' means when 'twenty percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive.'"<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>

===Science and modernism===
"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both," according to the pontiff.<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  Religions, including Christianity, can make "rich contributions ... towards an integral ecology and the full development of humanity,"<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  However, "the scientific and experimental method" itself can be part of the problem when it decouples creation from the Creator.<ref name=return/>

The editor of ''[[First Things]]'' R.&nbsp;R. Reno critiques the encyclical, writing ''Laudato si''' makes "many fierce denunciations of the current global order." This global order "destroys the environment, oppresses the multitudes, and makes us blind to the beauty of creation."<ref name=return/> According to Reno, the critiques of the scientific and technocratic present contained in the encyclical make this "perhaps the most anti-modern encyclical since the [[Syllabus of Errors]], [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] haughty 1864 dismissal of the conceits of the modern era."<ref name=return/>  He adds that the encyclical's tone lacks elements commonly found in the works of John Paul II and Benedict XVI that, in the tradition of ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', would have affirmed the modern world while correcting its errors.<ref name=return/>

===Technology===
Modern technology, the "dominant technological paradigm", is seen as a key contributor to the environmental crisis and human suffering. While the technocratic [[paradigm]] (i.e. the simulation) is switched on, Pope Francis points out, technology is viewed as "principal key to the meaning of existence" and asks the world to "resist" its "assault". "The technological paradigm has become so dominant that it would be difficult to do without its resources and even more difficult to utilize them without being dominated by their internal logic. It has become countercultural to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology…  Technology tends to absorb everything into its ironclad logic, and those who are surrounded with technology 'know full well that it moves forward in the final analysis neither for profit nor for the well-being of the human race.'"<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>

Technology is not value-neutral and technological developments are directed by the profit motive, according to Pope Francis. This is a form of institutionalized greed, generally with little regard for environmental and social consequences. "The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings".<ref name="OfficialEngText"/> The encyclical warns against "blind confidence in technical solutions," particularly in view of the fact that "the specialization which belongs to technology makes it difficult to see the large picture," which "can actually become a form of ignorance."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/> As a result, many technological solutions are nothing more than short-term techno-fixes attempting to remove symptoms rather than addressing the underlying environmental, social, economic, and even moral and spiritual problems: "Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact, proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>

Given these significant shortcomings of technology, "scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with the progress of humanity and history," and we are deluded by the myth of progress to believe that "ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without need for ethical consideration or deep change."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  A profound redefinition of progress and "liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm" are needed, i.e., "we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  More fundamentally, according to the pontiff, we need to recognize that "technology severed from ethics will not easily be able to limit its own power," and that "the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>  Pope Francis adds that the environmental crisis can ultimately only be solved if our immense technological developments are accompanied by a "development in human responsibility, values, and conscience."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>

===Other topics===

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' summary, the encyclical is "sweeping" in scope and is wide-ranging (80 pages&nbsp;/ 45,000 words), including mentions of such topics as [[urban planning]], [[agricultural economics]], and [[biodiversity]].<ref name="NYT" />

The encyclical also gives voice to the Pope's opposition to [[abortion]], [[Stem cell controversy#Catholicism|embryonic stem cell research]] and [[population control]] – saying that respect for creation and human dignity go hand in hand.<ref name="CNA" /> "Since everything is interrelated," Francis says, "concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion."<ref name="TheIndependent" /> According to the Pope, we can't in fact "genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they maybe, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties."<ref name="OfficialEngText"/>

''Laudato si''' opposes [[gender theory]] and supports "valuing one's own body in its femininity or masculinity." In acknowledging differences, the Pope states "we can joyfully accept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the work of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment."<ref name="CNA" />

===Sources===

The encyclical has 172 footnoted citations,<ref name="OfficialEngText" /> many to Francis's immediate predecessors, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].<ref name="NYT" /> The encyclical also "draws prominently from" [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]], the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Church of Constantinople]] and an ally of the pope.<ref name="NYT" />  It is highly unusual to quote an Orthodox bishop in a papal document.<ref name=vow/>  More than 10 per cent of the footnotes, 21, cite documents from 16 bishops' conferences around the world, mostly from the [[global south]].<ref name=vow/><ref name=footnote />  This is the first encyclical to cite bishops' conferences.<ref name=footnote />  This was an effort, experts believe, to build alliances on a controversial topic.<ref name=vow/>  The encyclical also cites [[Thomas Aquinas]], the 9th-century [[Islamic mysticism|Sufi mystic]] [[Ali al-Khawas]],<ref name="NYT" /><ref name=mystic /> [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Romano Guardini]].<ref name=Faggioli />

== History ==

=== Early stages ===
Speculation about an "environmental encyclical" to be issued by Pope Francis first began in November 2013.<ref name="RoeweProgress" /> On 24 January 2014, the Vatican confirmed that drafting had begun. [[Federico Lombardi]], the [[Holy See Press Office]] director, said that the document was in its very early stages, that no publication date had been set, and that the encyclical would be about ecology (and specifically the "ecology of man").<ref name="RoeweProgress" />

Cardinal [[Peter Turkson]], the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]], and his team wrote the first draft of the encyclical.<ref name="Kaleem" /><ref name="VaticanRadio" /> The draft was later reviewed by several theologians as well and sent (about three weeks before the encyclical's release) to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the second section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and the [[theologian of the Papal Household]].<ref name="VaticanRadio" /> Edits were made based on their responses.<ref name="VaticanRadio" />

In drafting the encyclical, the Vatican consulted with leading scientific experts for months.<ref name="GillisScience" /> One of the experts consulted was [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]], the founder and head of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]].<ref name="GillisScience" />

On 28 April 2015, in advance of the encyclical's release, the Vatican hosted a one-day conference on climate change, featuring Turkson, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] (who delivered the keynote address), Ecuadorian president [[Rafael Correa]] and American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].<ref name=weight /><ref name="Kirchgaessner" />

The title and subtitle of the encyclical were first reported on in a [[Twitter]] message by Spanish-language journalist Mercedes De La Torre on 30 May 2015.<ref name=titled /> The Vatican confirmed that the title would be ''Laudato si' '' on 10 June.<ref name=confirms /> While some initial reports said the encyclical would be called ''Laudato Sii'', this was incorrect; the pope chose to use the original Umbrian form and spelling of the poem, with a single ''i''.<ref name="Crux" />

On 4 June, the Vatican press office announced that the encyclical – which was "already attracting global attention for its expected discourses on Catholic theology on ecology, current environmental destruction, and climate change" – would be released on 18 June.<ref name=released />

== Redaction ==
Archbishop [[Víctor Manuel Fernández]] took part in the redaction of the encyclical.<ref>{{Cite web|last=San Martín|first=Inés|date=Oct 5, 2020|title=Pope Francis doesn't propose 'welfarism,' says close papal advisor|url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-americas/2020/10/pope-francis-doesnt-propose-welfarism-says-close-papal-advisor/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=Crux}}</ref>

=== Leak ===
Four days before the encyclical's release, the Italian magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' posted a leaked draft of the document online.<ref name="Koffler" /> The leaked document "almost exactly matched" the final document.<ref name="NYT" /> The leak angered [[Vatican Curia|Vatican officials]]<ref name="NYT" /> who called it a "heinous act"<ref name="Koffler" /> and revoked the press credentials of the longtime ''L'Espresso''  Vatican correspondent [[Sandro Magister]].<ref name="Winfield" /> ''The New York Times'' and the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' both noted suggestions that the leak came from conservatives inside the Vatican who wished to embarrass the pope and hinder the rollout of the encyclical.<ref name="NYT" /><ref name="Winfield" />

=== Release ===
The encyclical letter was officially released at an event in the New Synod Hall of the [[Vatican City]].<ref name="VaticanRadio" /> Speaking at the press conference were Turkson, Schellnhuber, and [[John Zizioulas]] (the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Pergamon]], representing the Orthodox Church).<ref name=expert /> On the day of the encyclical's official release, Pope Francis issued two messages about it on his official Twitter account, @Pontifex.<ref name="Kaleem" /> It has been suggested that the encyclical's release was timed to influence three summits being held at the [[United Nations]] on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later in 2015.<ref name=vow/>

== Reception ==
{{globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=July 2015}}
After the encyclical was released, the Vatican's website was briefly inaccessible as many  people tried to read it.<ref name=eco />  It has been described as "one of the shrewdest documents issued by the Vatican during the past century" and "has revealed Francis as a wily and sophisticated politician of the first order."<ref name=vow/>  It contains, according to [[Paul Vallely]], "a raft of defenses against critics who dismiss it as the work of some kind of left-wing maverick."<ref name=vow/>

=== Within Roman Catholic Church ===
The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], led by its president [[Joseph Edward Kurtz]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville|archbishop of Louisville]], described the encyclical as "our marching orders for advocacy"<ref name="Guardian" /> and planned briefings on the encyclical with both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and with the [[White House]].<ref name=cama />  Cardinal [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean O'Malley]] of Boston said that the "constant linkage throughout the encyclical of the dual need to respect and protect "Our Common Home" and the need to respect and protect the dignity and lives of the poor may be regarded as the distinctive characteristic of this powerful message of Pope Francis."<ref name=omalley/>

Filipino Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], wrote that "In ''Laudato si''' Pope Francis reminds us to replace consumption with a sense of sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with a spirit of sharing. We must "give, and not simply give up." We are called to free ourselves from all that is heavy and negative and wasteful and to enter into dialogue with our global family."<ref name=tagle/>

The three bishops of Northern and Central California, [[Stephen Blaire]], [[Armando Xavier Ochoa]], and [[Jaime Soto]], issued a joint statement that highlighted how climate change disproportionately affects the poor.  "The Catholic perspective is that human and natural ecology go hand in hand," the trio said. "We are called to solidarity with the poor as well as stewardship of the Earth. Our deep regard for the dignity of every person commands us to cultivate a climate of life where each of God's children thrive and join with creation in praising our Creator. This is the 'integral ecology' of which Pope Francis speaks."<ref name=bee/>

Bishop [[Richard Pates]] of [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which has the first major [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] contest in the United States, called on candidates to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying "With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of goodwill, to talk to them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change."<ref name=plates/>

[[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg|Archbishop of Hamburg]] [[Stefan Heße]] praised the encyclical, calling it "valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation." He commented further, saying:<blockquote>He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved. Without a radical change of mentality, it will not do. Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all can be solved only by all.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url = http://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/ebhh/layer/layer_suchergebnis.php?we_objectID=4408&pid=2|title = Erzbischof würdigt Umwelt-Enzyklika des Papstes|date = 18 June 2015|work = Erzbistum Hamburg|language = de|trans-title = Archbishop commends environmental papal encyclical|access-date = 11 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://incaelo.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/bishops-react-to-laudato-si/|title = Bishops react to Laudato si'|last = de Vries|first = Mark|date = 19 June 2015|website = In Caelo et in Terra|access-date = 11 March 2016}}</ref></blockquote>[[Vaticanology|Vaticanologist]] [[John L. Allen Jr.]], said in an analysis, "''Laudato si''' seems destined to go down as a major turning point, the moment when environmentalism claimed pride of place on a par with the [[dignity]] of human life and [[economic justice]] as a cornerstone of [[Catholic social teaching]]. It also immediately makes the Catholic Church arguably the leading moral voice in the press to combat global warming and the consequences of climate change."<ref name=earthquake />

Catholic Millennials have written widely giving their opinions of the encyclical.<ref name=mil/>

====Criticism====
Samuel Gregg, director of research at the libertarian [[Acton Institute]], has criticised "the sheer overreach that plagues" ''Laudato si'''.<ref name="spoken">{{cite news | url = http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/06/25/pope-francis-has-spoken-on-the-environment-will-us-lawmakers-listen/ | title = Pope Francis has spoken on the environment. Will the US Congress listen? | first = Michael | last = O'Loughlin | date = June 25, 2015 | access-date = June 26, 2015 }}</ref> [[RealClearReligion]] editor Nicholas Hahn has said that "Good Catholics can disagree on how to combat climate change and shouldn't worry about being sent to the confessional if they drive a SUV."<ref name=spoken/>

This criticism comes even though Francis took "care to locate his text firmly in the substantial body of teaching set out by previous popes," especially John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who are especially admired by conservative Catholics.<ref name="vow">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/opinion/the-popes-ecological-vow.html?_r=0 | title = The Pope's Ecological Vow | first = Paul | last = Vallely | author-link = Paul Vallely | date = June 28, 2015 | access-date = June 29, 2015 }}</ref>

In July 2015, Cardinal [[George Pell]] criticised Pope Francis's [[encyclical]] ''Laudato si''' for associating the church with the need to address climate, stating:<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/cardinal-pell-church-has-no-particular-expertise-science |title=Cardinal Pell on environmental encyclical: Church has 'no particular expertise in science.'|access-date = 27 February 2019 |date=17 July 2015 | first = Rosie | last = Scammell | agency = Religion News Service |work=[[America (magazine)|America]]}}</ref> 
{{quote|It’s got many, many interesting elements. There are parts of it which are beautiful. But the church has no particular expertise in science ... the church has got no mandate from the Lord to pronounce on scientific matters. We believe in the autonomy of science.}}

=== From other faiths ===
Three days before the encyclical was released, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] issued a Twitter message stating: "Since climate change and the global economy now affect us all, we have to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity."<ref name="Crux" />

Two days before the encyclical was released, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Justin Welby]], head of the [[Anglican Communion]], issued a "green declaration" (also signed by the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Conference]] as well as representatives of the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] and the British Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities) urging a transition to a [[low-carbon economy]] and fasting and prayer for success at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris.<ref name="Crux" /><ref name=joins />

The same day, the [[Lausanne Movement]] of global [[evangelical Christian]]s said it was anticipating the encyclical and was grateful for it.<ref name="Crux" />  The encyclical was also welcomed by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]].<ref name="Guardian" />

=== From world leaders ===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], welcomed the encyclical in a statement on the day it was released.<ref name="Guardian" /><ref name=spokesman /> [[Kofi Annan]], the former UN secretary-general and current chair of the [[Africa Progress Panel]], also issued a statement in support of the encyclical, stating "As Pope Francis reaffirms, climate change is an all-encompassing threat. … I applaud the Pope for his strong moral and ethical leadership. We need more of such inspired leadership. Will we see it at the climate summit in Paris?"<ref name=chair />

[[Christiana Figueres]], the executive secretary of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], said: "Pope Francis is personally committed to this issue like no other pope before him. I do think the encyclical is going to have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable."<ref name="Vidal" />

On the same day, [[Jim Yong Kim]], the president of the [[World Bank Group]], also praised the encyclical.<ref name="Guardian" />

=== From the scientific community ===
Science historian [[Naomi Oreskes]] observes that ''Laudato si''' "insists we embrace the moral dimensions of problems that have heretofore been viewed primarily as scientific, technological, and economic."<ref name=Heald/><ref name=oreskes/>

The encyclical gave a boost to the [[fossil fuel divestment]] movement.<ref name=schwartz />  Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] (PIK) and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]], who advised the Vatican on the drafting of the encyclical, said that "the science of ''Laudato si' '' is watertight" and gave the pontiff an "A" for command of the subject.<ref name=expert />

An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' praised the encyclical for its statements about [[sustainability]] and global poverty and the [[energy transition|transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to [[renewable energy|renewable energy sources]]: "The papal calls to end poverty and share the world's ecological space in a fair way are objectives that mirror the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to be released in September. The Pope's letter adds an important facet to the discussion: it is not merely conceivable to secure a sound future for human civilization without relying on coal, oil and gas – it is a prerequisite."<ref name=hope/> However, it criticised Francis for ignoring important issues like [[family planning]] and [[birth control]]. "Alas, he remained silent on issues of contraception. With a world population heading towards a possible 10 billion, the importance of family planning is clear. The Vatican has been brave on climate change. If it is serious about the fate of the planet and the welfare of its inhabitants, then it must be braver still on the issue of contraception."<ref name=hope/>

A review by nine climate scientists under the [[Climate Feedback]] project concluded the encyclical "rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change" and "fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community."<ref name=feedback/>

[[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nicholas Stern]], chair of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] and author of an influential report on climate change, stated that "The publication of the Pope's encyclical is of enormous significance. He has shown great wisdom and leadership. Pope Francis is surely absolutely right that climate change raises vital moral and ethical issues.... Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership."<ref name="Guardian" />

{{anchor|Daly's comment}}
Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] praised the Pope's encyclical on the grounds that it "... unifies the main divisions of [[Christianity]] on at least the fundamental recognition that we have a shamefully neglected duty to care for the [[Earth]] out of which we evolved, and to share the Earth's life support more equitably with each other, with the future, and with other creatures." Daly even believes that the Pope "skates fairly close to the idea of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economics]]," although the important issues of population stabilization, responsible [[family planning]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] were "conspicuously near-absent" in the encyclical.<ref name=Daly/>

===Impact on the United States political system===
{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = current}}

[[Stephen F. Schneck]], the director of Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at [[The Catholic University of America]], has said that "Something's going to come out of this and it's definitely going to have an impact on public policy in the US."<ref name=spoken/>  However, Kathy Saile, the former long time director of the US bishops' office for domestic social justice, does not believe that "it will spark a climate change bill, but someday when negotiations are happening on a bill or a treaty, these kinds of moral teachings could have an influence."<ref name=spoken/> Nonetheless, she added, "Pope Francis's tone, his honesty, how he talks about mercy and care for the poor, and his genuine desire to be a bridge," could influence political culture in Washington. "If he could change the tone of the debate, that would be an amazing gift."

[[Miami]] Archbishop [[Thomas Wenski]], chairman of the US bishops' committee on domestic peace and justice, wrote a letter to Congress letting them know that "The U.S. bishops stand united with the Holy Father in his call to protect creation."<ref name=spoken/>  He also asked them to "resist any effort to impair the development of a national carbon standard and instead to support our nation's ability to address this urgent global challenge confronting the human family."<ref name=spoken/>  Schneck opined that "This is different than the normal letters that the USCCB sends over all the time on a variety of issues. It really transcends the fault lines of both US politics and politics around the world."<ref name=spoken/>

Cornell anthropologists [[Annelise Riles]] and Vincent Ialenti told NPR.org: "We find ''Laudato Si''' important because it defies the United States' political imagination at every turn. In some moments, the pope reads like an archconservative, in other moments an archliberal. Sometimes he defers to scientists, other times he quotes scripture and, still other times, he criticizes the very foundations of economics. Mixing together ideas many see as incompatible, he forces us to think."<ref>*[https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/09/26/442485534/excited-about-the-popes-visit-read-laudato-si "Excited About The Pope's Visit? Read 'Laudato Si'"] Cosmos & Culture, NPR.org (26 September 2015)</ref>

''The New York Times'' reported that the encyclical put pressure on Catholics seeking the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican Party nomination for president of the United States]] in 2016, including [[Jeb Bush]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who "have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels."<ref name=davenport /> Jeb Bush said: "I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope."<ref name=backlash />

====Neoconservative critique and counterarguments====
[[Neoconservative]] circles in the United States have criticised the encyclical right from its publication in Rome, sometimes in very harsh terms.<ref name="academia.edu"/>  Writing in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', [[Irwin M. Stelzer]] has argued that:

<blockquote> 
Pope Francis is unambiguously opposed to the American system of "savage capitalism". He has famously quoted a fourth century Doctor of the Church, [[St. Basil of Caesarea]], who called money "the devil's dung", has railed against the "anonymous influences of mammon" and a "new colonialism" that includes "free trade treaties... [and] imposition of austerity," and stated a preference for "cooperatives". Throw in Francis' views that we are witnessing "a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasses," and that "there is an urgent need of a true world political authority," and you have positions that it will take more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of many Americans.<ref name=Stelzer/>
</blockquote>

=== From industry ===
A [[lobbyist]] of [[Arch Coal]] sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope "does not appear to address the tragedy of global [[energy poverty]]." The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor.<ref name=backlash /> The email suggested "talking points" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: "Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result." In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/122052/climate-deniers-say-nope-red-pope Climate Deniers Say Nope to "Red Pope"], ''The New Republic'', 17 June 2015</ref>

In June 2019, in a meeting at the Vatican which climatologist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber described as one of the most significant of his 30-year career, Francis "convinced big oil [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] to alter their message on climate change." These included CEOs of [[ExxonMobil]], [[BP]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] who pledged to avert what Francis called "a [[Climate crisis|climate emergency]]" that risks "perpetrating a brutal act of injustice towards the poor and future generations." Francis "stressed the need for a radical [[energy transition]] to save our common home." They pledged to "advance the energy transition [...] while minimizing the costs to vulnerable communities."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pope Francis Got These Big Oil CEOs to Fight Global Warming|url=https://fortune.com/2019/06/17/pope-franci-energy-ceos-change-message-climate-change/|access-date=2019-09-24|website=Fortune|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kell|first=Georg|title=Pope Francis In Dialogue With Big Oil And Investors|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgkell/2019/06/15/pope-francis-in-dialogue-with-oil-and-investors/|access-date=2019-09-24|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

=== From other groups ===

The [[LGBT]]-interest magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' noted that the encyclical contains passages which reinforce the church's position against the [[transsexuality]] movement, calling for "the acceptance of our bodies as God's gift."<ref name="TheAdvocate"/>

[[Bill McKibben]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' reviewed the encyclical.<ref name="McKibben"/>

[[Pankaj Mishra]] wrote that the encyclical was "Arguably the most important piece of intellectual criticism in our time."<ref>{{cite book
