'''Cozumel''' ({{IPA-es|kosuˈmel}}, {{lang-yua|Kùutsmil}}) is an island and municipality in the [[Caribbean Sea]] off the eastern coast of [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatán Peninsula]], opposite [[Playa del Carmen]]. It is separated from the mainland by [[Cozumel Channel]] and is close to the [[Yucatán Channel]]. The municipality is part of the state of [[Quintana Roo]], Mexico.

The economy of Cozumel is based on tourism, with visitors able to benefit from the island's [[balneario]]s, [[scuba diving]], and [[snorkeling]]. The main town on the island is [[San Miguel de Cozumel]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Cozumel'' was derived from the Mayan "Cuzamil" or "Ah Cuzamil Peten" in full, which means "the island of swallows" ({{lang-es|link=no|Isla de las Golondrinas}}).<ref name="encmuc">{{cite web|title=Cozumel|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM23quintanaroo/municipios/23001a.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612201823/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM23quintanaroo/municipios/23001a.html|archive-date=June 12, 2013|access-date=April 13, 2013|work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México|publisher=Secretaría de Gobernación|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Holt | first=Patricia A. | title=Cozumel: the complete guide|year=2005|publisher=iUniverse|location=New York|isbn=978-0-595-36995-9|page=ix}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Southeast Coast.jpg|thumb|left|Cozumel southeast coast]]
[[File:View of the Interior.jpg|left|thumb|Landscape view of Cozumel]]
The island is located in the [[Caribbean Sea]] along the eastern side of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] about {{convert|82|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Cancún]] and {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mainland. The island is about {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. With a total area of {{convert|477.961|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it is Mexico's largest Caribbean island, largest permanently inhabited island, and Mexico's third-largest island, following [[Tiburón Island]] and [[Isla Ángel de la Guarda]].

The majority of the island's population lives in the town of San Miguel (pop. 77,236 in 2010),<ref name="2010 census tables: INEGI">{{cite web|title=2010 census tables: INEGI|url=http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502025339/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223|archive-date=May 2, 2013|access-date=December 23, 2012|publisher=Mapserver.inegi.org.mx}}</ref> which is on the island's western shore. The municipality, which includes two small areas on the mainland [[enclave]]d within the [[Solidaridad, Quintana Roo|Municipality of Solidaridad]] with a land area of {{cvt|10.423|km2}}, has a total land area of {{cvt|647.33|km2}}.<ref name="INEGI: Land area of islands in Mexico">{{cite web|title=Land area of islands in Mexico: INEGI|url=http://mapserver.inegi.gob.mx/geografia/espanol/datosgeogra/extterri/frontera.cfm?c=920%20&i=e|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512053006/http://mapserver.inegi.gob.mx/geografia/espanol/datosgeogra/extterri/frontera.cfm?c=920%20&i=e|archive-date=May 12, 2013|access-date=November 1, 2009}}</ref>

Large parts of the island are covered with [[mangrove]] forest which has many [[Endemism|endemic]] animal species. Cozumel is a flat island based on [[limestone]], resulting in a [[karst topography]]. The highest natural point on the island is less than {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[cenote]]s are deep water-filled sinkholes formed by water percolating through the soft limestone soil for thousands of years. Cozumel's cenotes are restricted to qualified cave divers with appropriate credentials.

==History==
[[File: Los Murcielagos, San Gervasio.JPG|thumb|Maya ruins of [[San Gervasio (ruins)|San Gervasio]]]]
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] are believed to have first settled Cozumel by the early part of the 1st millennium AD, and older Preclassic [[Olmec]] artifacts have been found on the island as well. The island was sacred to [[Ix Chel]], the Maya Moon Goddess, and the temples here were a place of pilgrimage, especially by women desiring fertility.<ref>{{cite book | author = Paxton, Merideth | title = The Cosmos of the Yucatec Maya: Cycles and Steps from the Madrid Codex | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0826322920 | page = 153 }}</ref> There are a number of ruins on the island, most from the Post-Classic period. The largest Maya ruins on the island were near the downtown area and have now been destroyed.<ref>[http://everythingcozumel.com/history/Cozumelairport2.pdf Hajovsky, Ric, 2011, ''Bases, Bulldozers and Bullshit,''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921112033/http://everythingcozumel.com/history/Cozumelairport2.pdf |date=September 21, 2012 }}</ref> Today, the largest remaining ruins are at [[San Gervasio (ruins)|San Gervasio]], located approximately at the center of the island.

[[File:Santa Cruz Monument.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Chan Santa Cruz]] Monument in Cozumel]]
The first Spanish expedition to visit Cozumel was led by [[Juan de Grijalva]] in 1518.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|28}} In the following year [[Hernán Cortés]] stopped by the island on his way to Veracruz.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|57}} The Grijalva and Cortés expeditions were both received peacefully by the Maya of Cozumel, unlike the expeditions' experiences on other parts of the mainland. Even after Cortés destroyed some of the Maya idols on Cozumel and replaced them with an image of the Virgin Mary, the native inhabitants of the island continued to help the Spanish re-supply their ships with food and water so they could continue their voyages. [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] was rescued at this time.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|60–64}}
As many as 10,000 Maya lived on the island then, but in 1520, infected crew members of the Pánfilo Narváez expedition brought the [[smallpox]] contagion to the island and by 1570 only 186 men and 172 women were left alive on Cozumel. In the ensuing years Cozumel was often the target of attacks by pirates, and in 1650 many of the islanders were forcibly relocated to the mainland town of Xcan Boloná to avoid the Buccaneers’ predation. Later, in 1688, most of the rest of the island's population, as well as many of the settlements along the Quintana Roo coast, were evacuated inland to towns such as Chemax. [[File:SAN MIGUEL COZUMEL CHURST.JPG|right|thumbnail|San Miguel Church]]In 1848, refugees escaping the tumult of the [[Caste War of Yucatán]] settled on the island and in 1849 the town of San Miguel de Cozumel was officially recognized by the Mexican government.<ref>Hajovsky, Ric ''The Yellow Guide to the Mayan Ruins of San Gervasio, Cozumel,'' Amazon Books, 2012, pp. 8–10</ref>

In 1861, American President [[Abraham Lincoln]] ordered his Secretary of State, [[William Henry Seward]], to meet with the Mexican ''chargé d'affaires'' Matias Romero to explore the possibility of purchasing the island of Cozumel for the purpose of relocating freed American slaves offshore. The idea was summarily dismissed by Mexican President [[Benito Juarez]], but in 1862 Lincoln did manage to establish a short-lived colony of ex-slaves on [[Île à Vache]] off the coast of Haiti.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hajovsky|first=Ric|title=The True History of Cozumel|year=2015|publisher=Pan American Publishing|location=Dallas|isbn=9780982861080|pages=147–165}}</ref>

[[File:Cruise Port San Miguel.jpg|thumb|left|Cruise port in San Miguel de Cozumel; the ship pictured is the ''[[Celebrity Equinox]]''.]]

Although the original airport was a World War II relic and was able to handle jet aircraft and international flights, a [[Cozumel International Airport|much larger airport]] was built in the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Scuba diving is still one of Cozumel's primary attractions, mainly due to the coral reef on the western shore of Cozumel. These coral reefs are protected from the open ocean by the island's natural geography. In 1996, the government of Mexico also established the [[Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park|Cozumel Reefs National Marine Park]], forbidding anyone from touching or removing any marine life within the park boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Laskowski|first=Gloriana|date=July 1, 1999|title=Cozumel An Island Paradise - 'Vistas De Cozumel'|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1429-cozumel-an-island-paradise-vistas-de-cozumel|access-date=December 23, 2012|website=Mexconnect|publisher=Mexconnect.com}}</ref> Despite the importance of healthy reefs to Cozumel's tourist trade, a [[deepwater pier]] was built in the 1990s for cruise ships to dock, causing damage to the reefs, and it is now a regular stop on cruises in the Caribbean. Over the past few decades, coral reef health has significantly declined in Cozumel, with much lower coral cover now present than was historically recorded.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reyes-Bonilla|first=Héctor|last2=Millet-Encalada|first2=Marinés|last3=Álvarez-Filip|first3=Lorenzo|date=2014|title=Community Structure of Scleractinian Corals outside Protected Areas in Cozumel Island, Mexico|journal=Atoll Research Bulletin|language=en|volume=601|pages=1–13|doi=10.5479/si.00775630.601|url=https://figshare.com/articles/Community_Structure_of_Scleractinian_Corals_outside_Protected_Areas_in_Cozumel_Island_Mexico/9762053}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gress|first=Erika|last2=Andradi-Brown|first2=Dominic A.|date=2018-07-04|title=Assessing population changes of historically overexploited black corals (Order: Antipatharia) in Cozumel, Mexico|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=6|pages=e5129|doi=10.7717/peerj.5129|pmid=30013832|pmc=6035717|issn=2167-8359}}</ref>

The island was struck directly by two [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s during the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. In July, [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] passed just south of Cozumel, exposing the island to the storm's intense inner core. Despite Emily being a powerful storm, it was the larger, stronger, slower-moving [[Hurricane Wilma]] that caused the most destruction when it hit the island in October.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4374762.stm |title=Hurricane Wilma: The areas affected |work=BBC News |date=October 25, 2005 |access-date=July 24, 2005}}</ref> Wilma's eye passed directly over Cozumel.

There was some damage to the underwater marine habitat. This included the coral reefs, which suffered particularly at the shallower dive sites, and the fish that inhabit the reefs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Species Richness and Community Structure of the Yucatan Marine Reserve Before and After 2005 Hurricane Season|url=http://cmbc.ucsd.edu/Research/student_research/hurricane/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030130808/http://cmbc.ucsd.edu/Research/student_research/hurricane/|archive-date=October 30, 2012|access-date=December 23, 2012|publisher=Cmbc.ucsd.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Calvin|date=March 6, 2007|title=Cozumel Reef Conditions Update – 2007|url=http://www.calvintang.com/blog/2007/03/cozumel-reef-conditions-update-2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528072142/http://www.calvintang.com/blog/2007/03/cozumel-reef-conditions-update-2007|archive-date=May 28, 2013|access-date=December 23, 2012|publisher=Calvintang.com}}</ref>

Tourism, diving and charter fishing comprise the majority of the island's economy. There are more than 300 restaurants on the island and many hotels, some of which run dive operations, have swimming pools, private docks, and multiple dining facilities.

Other water activities include para-sailing, [[kitesurfing]], and a tourist submarine. There are also two [[dolphinarium]]s. At the cruise ship docks, there are several square blocks of stores selling Cuban cigars, jewellery, T-shirts, tequila, and a large variety of inexpensive souvenirs. Also, the only working pearl farm in the Caribbean<ref>https://www.maineterrain.com/tour-pearl-farm/</ref> is located on the North edge of the island.

San Miguel is home to many restaurants with a huge variety of different cuisines, along with several discothèques, bars, cinemas, and outdoor stages. The main plaza is surrounded by shops; in the middle of the plaza is a fixed stage where Cozumeleños and tourists celebrate every Sunday evening with music and dancing.

All food and manufactured supplies are shipped to the island. Water is provided by three different desalination facilities located on the island.

==Education==
There are three universities on the island: the State Public [[University of Quintana Roo]] (UQROO)<ref>{{Cite web|last=webmaster|title=Unidad Académica Cozumel Universidad de Quintana Roo – Universidad de Quintana Roo|trans-title=Cozumel Academic Unit University of Quintana Roo - University of Quintana Roo|url=http://www.uqroo.mx/unidad-academica-cozumel/|access-date=2016-03-08|website=www.uqroo.mx}}</ref> and two private universities, the Partenon Institute<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inicio|trans-title=Start|url=http://upc.edu.mx/|access-date=2016-03-08|website=Instituto Partenón de Cozumel|language=es-ES}}</ref> and the Interamerican University for Development (UNID).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unid.edu.mx/cozumel.html|title=Cozumel|website=www.unid.edu.mx|access-date=2016-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318134418/http://www.unid.edu.mx/cozumel.html|archive-date=March 18, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to teaching English as a degree program, they offer other career options including natural resources research, tourism and commercial systems.

== Culture ==

=== Santa Cruz Festival and El Cedral Fair ===
The Festival of Santa Cruz and El Cedral Fair is a historical tradition held in the town of El Cedral, in the south of Cozumel Island at the end of April. This annual event is said to have been started over 150 years ago by Casimiro Cárdenas. Cárdenas was one of a group that fled to the island from the village of Saban, on the mainland, after an attack during the [[Caste War of Yucatán]]in 1848. The attackers killed other villagers, but Cárdenas survived whilst clutching a small wooden cross.

Legend has it that Cárdenas vowed to start an annual festival wherever he settled, to honor the religious power of this crucifix. Today, the original Holy Cross (Santa Cruz) Festival forms part of the wider Festival of El Cedral, which includes fairs, traditional feasts, rodeos, bullfights, music and competitions. The celebrations last about five days in all and are held every year at the end of April or beginning of May.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cozumel Próximos Eventos – Fiestas de la Santa Cruz|trans-title=Cozumel Upcoming Events - Parties of the Santa Cruz|url=http://cozumel.travel/event/fiestas-de-la-santa-cruz/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308181128/http://cozumel.travel/event/fiestas-de-la-santa-cruz/|archive-date=March 8, 2016|access-date=2016-03-08|website=cozumel.travel}}</ref>

=== Cozumel Carnival ===
The [[Cozumel Carnival]] or ''Carnaval de Cozumel'' is one of the most important carnival festivities in México. It has been celebrated as a tradition beginning from the late nineteenth century and fills Cozumel's streets with parades. It begins the week before [[Mardi-Gras]] in February. Cozumel's Carnaval is a tradition which has been passed down through many generations that celebrates a mixture of cultures that escaped to the warm embrace of Cozumel. Dating back to the mid-1800s, Cozumel Carnaval was started by young people dressed in vibrantly colorful costumes known as "Estudiantinas" or "Comparsas", who expressed themselves in the streets of Cozumel through the artforms of dance, song, and fantasy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Carnival Cozumel 2016|url=http://www.carnavalcozumel.com.mx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503170438/http://www.carnavalcozumel.com.mx/|archive-date=May 3, 2016|access-date=2016-03-08|website=www.carnavalcozumel.com.mx}}</ref>
