The [[music video]] for "From Her Lips to God's Ears (The Energizer)" depicts a fantasy world analogous to that of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. A young girl with the head of a [[rabbit]], after watching news footage of Condoleezza Rice defending the United States' police actions in the Iraq War, sets out along a [[yellow brick road]] in search of Rice. Along the way she is joined by two men, one with the head of a [[pig]] and the other with the head of a [[chicken]], both of whom are also seeking Rice. The trio arrive at a palace in which they find an [[animatronic]] puppet with Rice's televised face, to which they pose the question "What are we gonna do now?" The question confounds and overloads the puppet, and the trio escape as it and the building collapse and explode.<ref>{{cite web|title = Music videos for Against Me!|publisher = [[Fat Wreck Chords]]|url = http://www.fatwreck.com/media/?video_artist_id=2&bandsubmit.x=19&bandsubmit.y=11|accessdate = 2009-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Music video: Against Me! - "From Her Lips to God's Ears (The Energizer)"|publisher = [[MTV]]|url = http://www.mtv.com/videos/against-me/79652/from-her-lips-to-gods-ears-the-energizer.jhtml#artist=1240711|accessdate = 2009-09-27}}</ref>
