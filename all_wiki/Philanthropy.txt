'''Philanthropy''' consists of "private initiatives, for the [[Public good (economics)|public good]], focusing on [[quality of life]]". Philanthropy contrasts with business initiatives, which are private initiatives for private good, focusing on material gain, and with government endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on provision of public services.<ref>Robert McCully. ''Philanthropy Reconsidered'' (2009) p 13</ref> A person who practices philanthropy is a [[List of philanthropists|philanthropist]].

''Philanthropy'' is different from ''[[charity (practice)|charity]],'' though there is some overlap. Charity aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem, whereas philanthropy attempts to address the root cause of the problem.<ref name = "Is There A Difference Between Charity and Philanthropy?_2018">{{ cite web | title = Is There A Difference Between Charity and Philanthropy? | url = http://www.brensimon.com/difference-between-charity-and-philanthropy/ | language = en | access-date = 2018-07-17 }}</ref><ref name = "Charity vs. Philanthropy_2018">{{ cite web | title = Charity vs. Philanthropy | url = https://ssir.org/articles/entry/charity_versus_philanthropy | language = en | access-date = 2018-07-17 }}</ref><ref name="Dietlin2011">{{cite book|author=Lisa M.

==Etymology==
In the second century AD, [[Plutarch]] used the Greek concept of philanthrôpía to describe superior human beings. During the Roman Catholic Middle Ages, philanthrôpía was superseded by Caritas charity, selfless love, valued for salvation and escape from purgatory. Philanthropy was modernized by Sir [[Francis Bacon]] in the 1600s, who is credited in great part with preventing the word from being owned by horticulture. Bacon considered philanthrôpía to be synonymous with "goodness",  correlated with the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] conception of virtue, as consciously instilled habits of good behaviour.   [[Samuel Johnson]] simply defined philanthropy as "love of mankind; good nature".<ref>Johnson, S. (1979). ''A dictionary of the English language''. London: Times Books.</ref><!--CITATION DATE IS 1979, DATE IN TEXT STATES 1700--> This definition still survives today and is often cited more gender-neutrally as the "love of humanity."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blueandgreentomorrow.com/features/philanthropy-is-what-sustains-the-charitable-sector-not-money/ |title=Mitchell Kutney: Philanthropy is what sustains the charitable sector, not money |publisher=Blue & Green Tomorrow |date=2013-06-18 |access-date=2014-11-08}}{{better source|date=January 2016}}</ref>

===Great Britain ===
[[File:Foundling Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Foundling Hospital]]. The original building has since been demolished.]]

In London, prior to the 18th century, parochial and civic charities were typically established by bequests and operated by local church parishes (such as [[St Dionis Backchurch]]) or [[guild]]s (such as the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters|Carpenters' Company)]]. During the 18th century, however, "a more activist and explicitly [[Protestant]] tradition of direct charitable engagement during life" took hold, exemplified by the creation of the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]] and [[Societies for the Reformation of Manners]].<ref name="London">{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlives.org/static/AssociationalCharities.jsp|title=Background - Associational Charities|work=London Lives|access-date=29 January 2016}}</ref>

In 1739,  [[Thomas Coram]], appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of London, received a royal charter to establish the [[Foundling Hospital]] to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields, [[Bloomsbury]].<ref name="Foundling">{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/orphanages/coram1.html|title=The London Foundling Hospital|work=victorianweb.org|access-date=29 January 2016}}</ref> This was "the first children's charity in the country, and one that 'set the pattern for incorporated associational charities' in general."<ref name="Foundling"/> The hospital "marked the first great milestone in the creation of these new-style charities."<ref name="London"/>

[[Jonas Hanway]], another notable philanthropist of the era, established [[The Marine Society]] in 1756 as the first seafarer's charity, in a bid to aid the recruitment of men to the [[Royal Navy|navy]].<ref>[[N. A. M. Rodger]], ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815'' (New York: W. W. Norton & Company: 2004), 313.</ref> By 1763, the society had recruited over 10,000 men and it was incorporated in 1772. Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the [[Magdalen Hospital]] to rehabilitate prostitutes. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held in high social regard—some charities received state recognition in the form of the [[Royal Charter]].

====19th century====
Philanthropists, such as [[Abolition of the Slave Trade|anti-slavery campaigner]] [[William Wilberforce]], began to adopt active campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that succeeded in ending the [[slave trade]] throughout the Empire starting in 1807.<ref>Louis Taylor Merrill,  "The English campaign for abolition of the slave trade." ''Journal of Negro History'' 30#4 (1945): 382–399. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2715027 online]</ref>  Although there were no slaves allowed in Britain itself, many rich men owned sugar plantations in the West Indies, and resisted the movement to buy them out until it finally succeeded in 1833.<ref>Christer Petley,  "‘Devoted Islands’ and ‘that Madman Wilberforce’: British Proslavery Patriotism during the Age of Abolition." ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 39#3 (2011): 393–415.</ref>

Financial donations to organized charities became fashionable among the middle-class in the 19th century.  By 1869 there were over 200 London charities with an annual income, all together, of about £2 million. By 1885, rapid growth had produced over 1000 London charities, with an income of about £4.5 million.  They included a wide range of religious and secular goals, with the American import, [[YMCA]], as one of the largest, and many small ones such as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association.  In addition to making annual donations, increasingly wealthy industrialists and financiers left generous sums in their wills.  A sample of 466 wills in the 1890s revealed a total wealth of £76 million, of which £20 million was bequeathed to charities.  By 1900 London charities enjoyed an annual income of about £8.5 million.<ref>Donald Read, ''England 1868–1914: The age of urban democracy'' (1979), pp 129–30.</ref>

Led by the energetic [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] (1801–1885), philanthropists organized themselves.<ref>Geoffrey  Finlayson, "The Victorian Shaftesbury." ''History Today'' (March 1983) 33#3 pp 31–35.</ref> In 1869 they set up the [[Charity Organisation Society]]. It was a federation of district committees, one in each of the 42 Poor Law divisions.  Its central office had experts in coordination and guidance, thereby maximizing the impact of charitable giving to the poor.<ref>Read, ''England 1868–1914'' p 130.</ref>  Many of the charities were designed to alleviate the harsh living conditions in the slums. such as the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] founded in 1830.  This included the promotion of allotment of land to labourers for "cottage husbandry" that later became the allotment movement, and in 1844 it became the first [[Model Dwellings Company]]—an organization that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, while at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first [[housing association]]s, a philanthropic endeavor that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century, brought about by the growth of the [[middle class]]. Later associations included the [[Peabody Trust]], and the [[Guinness Trust]]. The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given the label "five per cent philanthropy."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Siegel, Fred | year = 1974 | title = Five Per Cent Philanthropy: An Account of Housing in Urban Areas Between 1840 and 1914.

===Switzerland===
{{Main|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|International Committee of the Red Cross}}
In 1863, the Swiss businessman [[Henry Dunant]] used his fortune to fund the Geneva Society for Public Welfare, which became the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].  During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, Dunant personally led Red Cross delegations that treated soldiers. He shared the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for this work in 1901.<ref>David P. Forsythe, ''The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross'' (2005).</ref>

The [[French Red Cross]] played a minor role in the war with Germany (1870–71). After that, it became a major factor in shaping French civil society as a non-religious humanitarian organization.  It was closely tied to the army's Service de Santé.  By 1914 it operated  one thousand local committees with 164,000 members, 21,500 trained nurses, and over 27 million francs in assets.<ref>Rachel Chrastil,  "The French Red Cross, war readiness, and civil society, 1866–1914." ''French Historical Studies'' 31#3 (2008): 445–476.</ref>

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) played a major role in working with POW's on all sides in World War II.  It was in a cash-starved position when the war began in 1939, but quickly mobilized its national offices set up a Central Prisoner of War Agency. For example, it provided food, mail and assistance to 365,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers and civilians held captive.  Suspicions, especially by London, of ICRC as too tolerant or even complicit with Nazi Germany led to its side-lining in favour of the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) as the primary humanitarian agency after 1945.<ref>J. Crossland, ''Britain and the International Committee of the Red Cross, 1939–1945'' (2014).</ref>

===France===
In France,  the Pasteur Institute had a monopoly of specialized microbiological knowledge allowed it to raise money for serum production from both private and public sources, walking the line between a commercial pharmaceutical venture and a philanthropic enterprise.<ref>{{citation|pmid=18351159|year=2007|last1=Simon|first1=J|title=The origin of the production of diphtheria antitoxin in France, between philanthropy and commerce|journal=Dynamis: Acta Hispanica Ad Medicinae Scientiarumque Historiam Illustrandam|volume=27|pages=63–82}}</ref>

By 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression, the French wanted a [[welfare state]] to relieve distress but did not want new taxes. [[War veterans]] came up with a solution: the new national lottery proved highly popular to gamblers, while generating  the cash needed without raising taxes.<ref>Nicolas Delalande, "Giving and Gambling: The Gueules Cassées, the National Lottery, and the Moral Economy of the Welfare State in 1930s France." ''French Historical Studies'' 40#4 (2017): 623–649.</ref>

American money proved invaluable.  The Rockefeller Foundation opened an office in Paris and helped design and fund France's modern public health system, under the National Institute of Hygiene.  It also set up schools to train physicians and nurses.<ref>William H. Schneider, "War, philanthropy, and the National Institute of Hygiene in France." ''Minerva''  41#1 (2003): 1–23.</ref><ref>Timothy B. "The Social Transformation of Hospitals and the Rise of Medical Insurance in France, 1914–1943." ''The Historical Journal 41#4 (1998): 1055–1087.</ref>

===Germany===
The history of modern philanthropy  the European Continent is especially important in the case of Germany, which became a model for others, especially regarding the welfare state.   The princes and in the various Imperial states continued traditional efforts, such as monumental buildings, parks and art collections.  Starting in the early 19th century, the rapidly emerging middle classes made local philanthropy a major endeavor to establish their legitimate role in shaping society, in contradistinction to the aristocracy and the military.  They concentrated on support for social welfare institutions, higher education, and cultural institutions, as well as some efforts to alleviate the hardships of rapid industrialization.  The bourgeoisie (upper-middle-class) was defeated in its effort to it gain political control in 1848, but they still had enough money and organizational skill that could be employed through philanthropic agencies to provide an alternative powerbase for their world view.<ref>Thomas Adam, ''Philanthropy, Civil Society, and the State  in German history, 1815–1989'' (2016).</ref>  Religion was a divisive element in Germany, as the Protestants, Catholics and Jews used alternative philanthropic strategies.   The Catholics, for example, continued their medieval practice of using financial donations in their wills to lighten their punishment in [[purgatory]] after death.  The Protestants did not believe in purgatory, but made a strong commitment to the improvement of their communities here and now. Conservative Protestants Raised concerns about deviant sexuality, alcoholism and socialism, as well as illegitimate births.  They used philanthropy to eradicate social evils that were seen as utterly sinful.<ref>Andrew Lees, "Deviant Sexuality and Other 'Sins': The Views of Protestant Conservatives in Imperial Germany." ''German Studies Review'' 23.3 (2000): 453–476.</ref><ref>Andrew Lees, ''Cities, Sin and Social Reform in Imperial Germany'' (2002).</ref>  All the religious groups used financial endowments, which multiplied in the number and wealth as Germany grew richer. Each was devoted to a specific benefit to that religious community. Each had a board of trustees; these were laymen who donated their time to public service.  Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, an upper class [[Junker]], used his state-sponsored philanthropy, in the form of his invention of the modern welfare state, to neutralize the political threat posed by the socialistic labor unions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dimitris N. Chorafas|title=Education and Employment in the European Union: The Social Cost of Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWIWDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA255|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=255|isbn=9781317145936}}</ref> The middle classes, however, made the most use of the new welfare state, in terms of heavy use of museums, gymnasiums  (high schools), universities, scholarships, and hospitals.  For example, state funding for universities and gymnasiums covered only a fraction of the cost; private philanthropy became the essential ingredient.  19th century Germany was even more oriented toward civic improvement then Britain or the United States,  when measured in terms of voluntary private funding for public purposes.  Indeed, such German institutions as the kindergarten, the research university, and the welfare state became models copied by the Anglo-Saxons.<ref>Adam, ''Philanthropy,'' pp 1–7.</ref>  The heavy human and economic losses of the First World War, the financial crises of the 1920s, as well as the Nazi regime and other devastation by 1945, seriously undermined and weakened the opportunities for widespread philanthropy in Germany.  The civil society so elaborately build up in the 19th century was practically dead by 1945.  However, by the 1950s, as the "economic miracle" was restoring German prosperity, the old aristocracy was defunct,  and middle-class philanthropy started to return to importance.<ref>Adam, Philanthropy, pp 142–73.</ref>

=== War and postwar: Belgium and Eastern Europe===
The [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] (CRB) was an international (predominantly American) organization that arranged for the supply of food to German-occupied Belgium and northern France during the First World War.  It was led by [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>George H. Nash, "An American Epic: Herbert Hoover and Belgian Relief in World War I," ''Prologue'' (1989) 21#1 pp 75–86</ref> Between 1914 and 1919, the CRB operated entirely with voluntary efforts and was able to feed 11,000,000 Belgians by raising the necessary money, obtaining voluntary contributions of money and food, shipping the food to Belgium and controlling it there. For example, the CRB shipped 697,116,000 pounds of flour to Belgium.<ref>David Burner, ''Herbert Hoover: The Public Life'' (1979) pp 72–95.</ref>   Biographer George Nash finds that by the end of 1916, Hoover "stood preeminent in the greatest humanitarian undertaking the world had ever seen."<ref>George H. Nash, ''The Life of Herbert Hoover: The Humanitarian, 1914–1917'' (1988) p 249.</ref>  Biographer William Leuchtenburg adds, "He had raised and spent millions of dollars, with trifling overhead and not a penny lost to fraud. At its peak, his organization was feeding nine million Belgians and French a day.<ref>{{cite book|author=William E.

When the war ended in late 1918, Hoover took control of the [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA), with the mission of food to Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions.<ref>Burner, ''Hoover'' pp 114–37.</ref> U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, and Hoover transformed the ARA into a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children.  When attacked for distributing food to Russia, which was under Bolshevik control, Hoover snapped,  "Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!"<ref>{{cite book|author=Leuchtenburg|title=Herbert Hoover'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bXY94wxD2EC&pg=PA58|year=2009|page=58|isbn=9781429933490 }}</ref><ref>Frank M.

{{Main|Philanthropy in the United States}}
The first corporation founded in the [[13 Colonies]] was [[Harvard College]] (1636), designed primarily to train young men for the clergy.  A leading theorist was the Puritan theologian [[Cotton Mather]] (1662–1728), who in 1710 published a widely read essay, ''Bonifacius, or an Essay to Do Good.'' Mather worried that the original idealism had eroded, so he advocated philanthropic benefaction as a way of life. Though his context was Christian, his idea was also characteristically American and explicitly Classical, on the threshold of the Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cotton Mather|title=Essays to do Good addressed to all Christians, whether in public or private capacities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNllAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA51|year=1825|page=51}}</ref>

[[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) was an activist and theorist of American philanthropy.  He was much influenced by [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''An Essay upon Projects'' (1697) and [[Cotton Mather]]'s ''Bonifacius: an essay upon the good.'' (1710). Franklin attempted to motivate his fellow Philadelphians into projects for the betterment of the city: examples included the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] (the first American subscription library), the fire department, the police force, street lighting and a hospital.  A world-class physicist himself, he promoted scientific organizations including the Philadelphia Academy (1751) – which became the [[University of Pennsylvania]] – as well as the [[American Philosophical Society]] (1743) to enable scientific researchers from all 13 colonies to communicate.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert T.

By the 1820s, newly rich American businessmen were initiating philanthropic work, especially with respect to private colleges and hospitals. [[George Peabody]] (1795–1869) is the acknowledged father of modern philanthropy. A financier based in [[Baltimore]] and [[London]], in the 1860s he began to endow libraries and museums in the United States, and also funded housing for poor people in London. His activities became the model for Andrew Carnegie and many others.<ref>{{cite book|author=Grimm, ed.|title=Notable American Philanthropists: Biographies of Giving and Volunteering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdSBOiSazsC&pg=PA244|year=2002|pages=243–45|isbn=9781573563406}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Schaaf |title=George Peabody: His Life and Legacy, 1795–1869 |journal=Maryland Historical Magazine |volume=90 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=268–285 }}</ref>

===Andrew Carnegie===
[[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835–1919) was the most influential leader of philanthropy on a national (rather than local) scale. After selling his steel corporation in the 1890s he devoted himself to establishing philanthropic organizations, and making direct contributions to many educational, cultural and research institutions. He financed over 1800 libraries built across the nation, and his final and largest project was the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], founded in 1911 with a $25 million endowment, later enlarged to $135 million. In all, Carnegie gave away 90% of his fortune.<ref>Joseph Frazier Wall, '' Andrew Carnegie'' (1970) pp 882–84.</ref>

===Ford Foundation===
{{Main|Ford Foundation}}
With the acquisition of most of the stock of the Ford Motor Company in the late 1940s, the Ford Foundation became the largest American philanthropy, splitting its activities between the United States, and the rest of the world.  Outside the United States,  it established a network of human rights organizations, promoted democracy, gave large numbers of fellowships for young leaders to study in the United States, and invested heavily in the [[Green Revolution]], whereby poor nations dramatically increased their output of rice, wheat and other foods.  Both Ford and Rockefeller were heavily involved.<ref>{{citation|doi=10.1196/annals.1425.028|pmid=18579885|title=Building an Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1136|issue=1|pages=233–42|year=2008|last1=Toenniessen|first1=Gary|last2=Adesina|first2=Akinwumi|last3=Devries|first3=Joseph|bibcode=2008NYASA1136..233T|s2cid=16277025|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53bc12c8887ac5dde70027466cce75e0473f7320}}</ref>  Ford also gave heavily to build up research universities in Europe and worldwide.  For example, in Italy in 1950 it sent a team to help the  Italian ministry of education reform the nation's school system, based on the principles of ‘meritocracy" (rather than political or family patronage),  democratisation (with universal access to secondary schools). It reached a compromise between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, to help promote uniform treatment and equal outcomes.  The success in Italy became a model for Ford programs and many other nations.<ref>{{citation|doi=10.1080/0046760X.2016.1154192|title=American cultural diplomacy and post-war educational reforms: James Bryant Conant's mission to Italy in 1960|journal=History of Education|volume=45|issue=3|pages=352–371|year=2016|last1=Mariuzzo|first1=Andrea|s2cid=146991139}}</ref>

The Ford Foundation in the 1950s wanted to modernize the legal systems in [[India]] and [[Africa]], by promoting the American model.  The plan failed, because of India's unique legal history, traditions, and profession, as well as its economic and political conditions. Ford, therefore, turned to agricultural reform.<ref>Jayanth K.

Philanthropy in Australia is influenced by the country's regulatory and cultural history, and by its geography.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Scaife|first1=Wendy|title=Giving in Australia: Philanthropic Potential Beginning to Be Realized|date=2015|work=The Palgrave Handbook of Global Philanthropy|pages=488–505|editor-last=Wiepking|editor-first=Pamala|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137341532_28|isbn=9781137343239|last2=McDonald|first2=Katie|last3=Williamson|first3=Alexandra|last4=Mossel|first4=Valérie|editor2-last=Handy|editor2-first=Femida}}</ref> Structured giving through foundations<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Scaife|first1=Wendy A.|last2=Williamson|first2=Alexandra|date=2012-02-22|title=Foundations for giving : why and how Australians structure their philanthropy|url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/48801|language=en|location=Queensland, Australia|doi=10.5204/rep.eprints.48801|doi-access=free}}</ref> is slowly growing, although public data on the philanthropic sector is sparse.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McGregor-Lowndes|first1=Myles|last2=Williamson|first2=Alexandra|date=2018-05-02|title=Foundations in Australia: Dimensions for International Comparison|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=62|issue=13|language=en|pages=1759–1776|doi=10.1177/0002764218773495|s2cid=149469573|issn=0002-7642}}</ref>  There is no public registry of philanthropic foundations as distinct from charities more generally.

Two foundation types for which some data is available are Private Ancillary Funds (PAFs)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Non-profit/Getting-started/In-detail/Types-of-DGRs/Private-ancillary-funds/|title=Private ancillary funds|last=Office|first=Australian Taxation|website=www.ato.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-08-06}}</ref> and Public Ancillary Funds (PubAFs).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Non-profit/Getting-started/In-detail/Types-of-DGRs/Public-ancillary-funds/?page=3|title=Public ancillary funds|last=Office|first=Australian Taxation|website=www.ato.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-08-06}}</ref> Private Ancillary Funds have some similarities to private family foundations in the US and Europe, and do not have a public fundraising requirement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=Alexandra|last2=Luke|first2=Belinda|last3=Leat|first3=Diana|last4=Furneaux|first4=Craig|date=2017|title=Founders, Families, and Futures: Perspectives on the Accountability of Australian Private Ancillary Funds|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=46|issue=4|pages=747–771|doi=10.1177/0899764017703711|s2cid=151796260|issn=0899-7640|url=https://eprints.qut.edu.au/105363/3/105363.pdf}}</ref>  Public Ancillary Funds include community foundations, some corporate foundations, and foundations that solely support single organisations such as hospitals, schools, museums and art galleries.

== Differences between traditional and new philanthropy ==

=== Impact investment versus traditional philanthropy ===
Traditional philanthropy and [[impact investment]] can be distinguished by how they serve society. Traditional philanthropy is usually short-term, where organizations obtain resources for causes through fund-raising and one-off donations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Srivastava|first1=Prachi|last2=Oh|first2=Su-Ann|title=Private Foundations, Philanthropy and Partnership in Education and Development: Mapping the Terrain|journal=Public Private Partnerships in Education|doi=10.4337/9780857930699.00015|year=2012|isbn=9780857930699}}</ref> The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Ford Foundation]] are examples of such; they focus more on the financial contributions to social causes and less on the actual actions and processes of benevolence. Impact investment, on the other hand, focuses on the interaction between individual wellbeing and broader society through the promotion of [[sustainability]]. Stressing the importance of impact and change, they invest in different sectors of society, including housing, infrastructure, healthcare and energy.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.myimpact.li/|title=Fundamentals of Modern Philanthropy - myImpact|website=myImpact - Formen der modernen Philanthropie|language=de-DE|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref>

A suggested explanation for the preference for impact investment philanthropy to traditional philanthropy is the gaining prominence of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) since 2015. Almost every SDG is linked to environmental protection and sustainability because of raising concerns about how [[Globalization|globalisation]], liberal [[consumerism]] and [[population growth]] may affect the environment. As a result, development agencies have seen increased accountability on their part, as they face greater pressure to fit with current developmental agendas.

=== Traditional philanthropy versus philanthrocapitalism ===
[[Philanthrocapitalism]] differs from traditional philanthropy in how it operates. Traditional philanthropy is about charity, mercy, and selfless devotion improving recipients' wellbeing.<ref name=":0" /> Philanthrocapitalism, is philanthropy transformed by business and the market,<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Is it time for a new international poverty measure?|date=2013-12-05|pages=35–42|publisher=OECD|isbn=9789264200999|doi=10.1787/dcr-2013-6-en|title=Development Co-operation Report 2013|series=Development Co-operation Report}}</ref> where profit-oriented business models are designed that work for the good of humanity.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2009-05-01|title=Philanthrocapitalism: how the rich can save the world|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=46|issue=9|pages=46–5131–46–5131|doi=10.5860/choice.46-5131|issn=0009-4978}}</ref> Share value companies are an example. They help develop and deliver curricula in education, strengthen their own businesses and improve the job prospects of people.<ref>'''Kramar, M.K., G. Hills, K. Tallani, M. Wilka., and A. Bhatt (2014), “The new role of business in global education: How companies can create shared value by improving education while driving shareholder returns”. A report by FSG, pp.1-23.'''</ref> Firms improve social outcomes, but while they do so, they also benefit themselves.

The rise of philanthrocapitalism can be attributed to global [[capitalism]]. There is an understanding that philanthropy is not worthwhile if no economic benefit can be derived by philanthropy organisations, both from a social and private perspective. Therefore, philanthropy has been seen as a tool to sustain economic growth and the firm's own growth, based on [[Human Capital Theory|human capital theory]]. Through education, specific skills are taught which enhance people's capacity to learn and their productivity at work.

[[Intel]] invests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricular standards in the US and provides learning resources and materials for schools, for its own innovation and revenue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubio Royo|first=Enrique|date=2009-09-30|title=Nuevo "rol" y paradigmas del Aprendizaje, en una Sociedad Global en RED y Compleja: la Era del Conocimiento y el Aprendizaje|journal=Arbor|volume=CLXXXV|issue=Extra|pages=41–62|doi=10.3989/arbor.2009.extran1205|issn=1988-303X|doi-access=free}}</ref> The New Employment Opportunities initiative in Latin America is a regional collaboration to train 1 million youth by 2022 to raise employment standards and ultimately provide a talented pool of labour for companies.

==Celebrity philanthropy==
'''Celebrity philanthropy''' refers to [[celebrity]]-affiliated [[charitable]] and [[philanthropic]] activities. It is an increasingly prevalent topic of scholarship in studies of ‘the popular’ vis-à-vis the modern and post-modern world.<ref name=Allatson15>{{cite book|last1=Allatson|first1=Paul|last2=Jeffreys|first2=Elaine|title=Celebrity Philanthropy|date=2015|publisher=Intellect|location=Bristol, UK}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Structured and systematised charitable giving by celebrities is a relatively new phenomenon. Although charity and [[Celebrity|fame]] are associated historically, it was only in the 1990s that entertainment and sports celebrities from affluent western societies became involved with a particular type of philanthropy.<ref name=Allatson15/>{{rp|1–16}} Celebrity philanthropy in contemporary western societies is not isolated to large one-off monetary donations by definition. It involves celebrities using their publicity, brand credibility and personal wealth to promote [[not-for-profit organisation]]s, which are increasingly ‘business-like’ in form. This is sometimes termed as ‘celanthropy’ – the fusion of celebrity and cause as a representation of what the organisation advocates.<ref name=Allatson15/>{{rp|5}}

===Implications on government and governance===
The advent of celebrity philanthropy has seen the contraction of government involvement in areas such as [[welfare]] support and [[foreign aid]] to name a few. This can be identified from the proliferation of [[neoliberal]] policies. Conversely, [[public interest group]]s, not-for-profit organisations and the [[United Nations]] now budget extensive amounts of time and money to use celebrity endorsers in their campaigns. An example of this is the [[People's Climate March (2014)|People’s Climate March]], which took place on 21 September 2014. The demonstration was part of the larger [[People’s Climate Movement]], which aims to raise awareness of [[climate change]] and environmental issues more generally. Notable celebrities who are part of this campaign include actors [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] and [[Edward Norton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Endorsements|url=http://peoplesclimate.org/endorsements/|website=People's Climate Movement|access-date=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814092039/http://peoplesclimate.org/endorsements/|archive-date=14 August 2015}}</ref>
