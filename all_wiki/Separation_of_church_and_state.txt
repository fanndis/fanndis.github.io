{{Liberalism sidebar}}
The '''separation of church and state''' is a philosophic and [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] concept for defining political distance in the relationship between [[religious organizations]] and the [[State (polity)|state]]. Conceptually, the term refers to the creation of a [[secular state]] (with or without legally explicit church–state separation) and to '''disestablishment''', the changing of an existing, formal relationship between the church and the state.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'' (1992), Kermit D. Hall, Ed. pp. 717–26</ref> Although the concept is older, the exact phrase "separation of church and state" is derived from "wall of separation between church and state", a term coined by [[Thomas Jefferson]].

In a society, the degree of political separation between the church and the civil state is determined by the legal structures and prevalent legal views that define the proper relationship between organized religion and the state. The [[arm's length principle]] proposes a relationship wherein the two political entities interact as organizations each independent of the authority of the other. The strict application of the secular principle of ''[[Secularism in France|laïcité]]'' is used in France, while secular societies such as [[Norway]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/norway-separates-church-and-state#.UPFSb-Q0VPE|title=Norway separates church and state|access-date=22 March 2015}}</ref> Denmark, and England maintain a form of constitutional recognition of an official [[state religion]].

The philosophy of the separation of the church from the civil state parallels the philosophies of [[secularism]], [[disestablishmentarianism]], [[religious liberty]], and [[religious pluralism]]. By way of these philosophies, the European states assumed some of the social roles of the church and the [[welfare state]], a social shift that produced a culturally secular population and [[public sphere]].<ref>''[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=separationism Separationism]'', [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn Princeton University WordNet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508073028/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=May 8, 2016 }} reads: "separationism: advocacy of a policy of strict separation of church and state."</ref> In practice, church–state separation varies from total separation, mandated by the country's political [[constitution]], as in [[Religion in India|India]] and [[Religion in Singapore|Singapore]], to a state religion, as in [[Freedom of religion in the Maldives|the Maldives]].

==History of the concept and term==
{{More citations needed| date = August 2016}}

===Late antiquity===
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]
An important contributor to the discussion concerning the proper relationship between Church and state was St. [[Augustine]], who in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', Book XIX, Chapter 17, examined the ideal relationship between the "earthly city" and the "city of God". In this work, Augustine posited that major points of overlap were to be found between the "earthly city" and the "city of God", especially as people need to live together and get along on earth. Thus, Augustine held that it was the work of the "temporal city" to make it possible for a "heavenly city" to be established on earth.<ref>Feldman (2009)</ref>

===Medieval Europe===
{{Main|Church and state in medieval Europe}}
For centuries, monarchs ruled by the idea of [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. Sometimes this began to be used by a monarch to support the notion that the king ruled both his own kingdom and Church within its boundaries, a theory known as [[caesaropapism]]. On the other side was the Catholic doctrine that the [[Bishop of Rome|Pope]], as the Vicar of Christ on earth, should have the ultimate authority over the Church, and indirectly over the state. Moreover, throughout the Middle Ages the [[Pope]] claimed the right to depose the Catholic kings of Western Europe and tried to exercise it, sometimes successfully (see the investiture controversy, below), sometimes not, such as was the case with [[Henry VIII of England]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry III]] of [[Navarre]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/delineationroma01elligoog |title=Delineation of Roman Catholicism: Drawn from the authentic and acknowledged standards of the Church of Rome|publisher=Lane & Scott |first=Charles|last=Elliott|year=1877|page=[https://archive.org/details/delineationroma01elligoog/page/n169 165] |orig-year=1851}}</ref>

In the West the issue of the separation of church and state during the medieval period centered on monarchs who [[sphere sovereignty|ruled in the secular sphere]] but encroached on the Church's rule of the spiritual sphere. This unresolved contradiction in ultimate control of the Church led to power struggles and crises of leadership, notably in the [[Investiture Controversy]], which was resolved in the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. By this concordat, the Emperor renounced the right to invest ecclesiastics with ring and crosier, the symbols of their spiritual power, and guaranteed election by the canons of cathedral or abbey and free consecration.<ref>{{cite book |last= Berman |first= Harold J. |title= Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition |url= https://archive.org/details/lawrevolutionfor0000berm |url-access= registration |publisher= Harvard University Press |year= 1983 |isbn= 0-674-51774-1 |oclc= 185405865 }}</ref>

===Reformation===
At the beginning of the Protestant [[Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] articulated a [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. According to [[James Madison]], perhaps one of the most important modern proponents of the separation of church and state, Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern conception of separation of church and state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandother01madigoog |title=Madison to Schaeffer, 1821 |publisher=J.B.

Those of the [[Radical Reformation]] (the [[Anabaptist]]s) took Luther's ideas in new directions, most notably in the writings of [[Michael Sattler]] (1490–1527), who agreed with Luther that there were two kingdoms, but differed in arguing that these two kingdoms should be separate, and hence baptized believers should not vote, serve in public office or participate in any other way with the "kingdom of the world". While there was a diversity of views in the early days of the Radical Reformation, in time Sattler's perspective became the normative position for most Anabaptists in the coming centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhsc.ca/index.php?content=http://www.mhsc.ca/mennos/bchurchstate.htm|title=MHSC|website=www.mhsc.ca}}</ref> Anabaptists came to teach that religion should never be compelled by state power, approaching the issue of church-state relations primarily from the position of protecting the church from the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-28/1525-anabaptist-movement-begins.html|title=1525 The Anabaptist Movement Begins}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Church-State_Relations|title=Church-State Relations – GAMEO|website=gameo.org}}</ref><ref>Bender, H.

In the 1530s, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], angered by the [[Pope Clement VII]]'s refusal to annul his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], decided to break with the Church and set himself as ruler of the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon41.html|title=Henry VIII: 1509–47 AD|publisher=Britannia History|access-date=2008-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320002225/http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon41.html|archive-date=2008-03-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> The monarchs of Great Britain have retained ecclesiastical authority in the Church of England since Henry VIII, having the current title, ''[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]''. England's ecclesiastical intermixing did not spread widely, however, due to the [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|extensive persecution]] of [[Catholic]]s that resulted from Henry's power grab.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} This eventually led to [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformism]], [[English Dissenters]], and the anti-Catholicism of [[Oliver Cromwell]], the [[Commonwealth of England]], and the [[penal law (Britain)|Penal Laws]] against Catholics and others who did not adhere to the Church of England.

One of the results of the persecution in England was that some people fled Great Britain to be able to worship as they wished. After the American Colonies [[American Revolutionary War|revolted]] against [[George III of the United Kingdom]], the [[Constitution of United States]] was amended to ban the establishment of religion by [[American Congress|Congress]].

=== Enlightenment ===
[[File:John Locke by Herman Verelst.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Locke]], English [[political]] [[philosopher]] argued for individual conscience, free from state control]]
The concept of separating church and state is often credited to the writings of English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704).<ref name=AFP>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 29 ("It took [[John Locke]] to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion.")</ref> According to his principle of the [[social contract]], Locke argued that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 29</ref>

At the same period of the 17th century, [[Pierre Bayle]] and some [[Fideism|fideists]] were forerunners of the separation of Church and State, maintaining that faith was independent of reason.<ref name=Bayle11>{{cite book |last=Tinsley |first=Barbara Sher|title=Pierre Bayle's Reformation : conscience and criticism on the eve of the Enlightenment|year=2001|publisher=Susquehanna University Press |location=Selinsgrove, Pa. |isbn=1575910438}}</ref><ref name=Bayle22>{{cite book |last=Bayle |first=Pierre |year=2000 |orig-year=1st ed 1682 |title=Various Thoughts on Occasion of a Comet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UueopQAmgzUC&pg=PR23 |publisher=SUNY Press |page=332 |isbn=9780791492734}}</ref> During the 18th century, the ideas of Locke and Bayle, in particular the separation of Church and State, became more common, promoted by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

=== Wall of Separation ===
Although often attributed to Thomas Jefferson, the concept of a wall of separation between state and religion can be found within Roger Williams' writings:

<blockquote>When they [the Church] have opened a gap in the hedge or wall of separation between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world, God hath ever broke down the wall itself, removed the Candlestick, etc., and made His Garden a wilderness as it is this day. And that therefore if He will ever please to restore His garden and Paradise again, it must of necessity be walled in peculiarly unto Himself from the world, and all that be saved out of the world are to be transplanted out of the wilderness of the World. ("Mr. Cotton's Letter Lately Printed, Examined and Answered," The Complete Writings of Roger Williams, Volume 1, page 108 (1644))[1]</blockquote>

Williams' beliefs in this regard were not a brand new novelty, but were consistent with earlier ideals worked out by Martin Luther and his Two kingdoms doctrine.[2][3]

===Jefferson and the Bill of Rights===
{{Main|Establishment Clause|Free Exercise Clause}}
[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the third [[President of the United States]], whose letter to the Danbury Baptists Association is often quoted in debates regarding the separation of church and state.]]

In English, the exact term is an offshoot of the phrase, "wall of separation between church and state", as written in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s letter to the [[Baptists in the history of separation of church and state#American Baptists|Danbury Baptist Association]] in 1802. In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes:

<blockquote>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.<ref name=Jefferson11>{{cite web| url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html| title = Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists| access-date = 2006-11-30| last = Jefferson| first = Thomas| date = 1802-01-01| publisher = U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref></blockquote>

Jefferson was describing to the Baptists that the [[United States Bill of Rights]] prevents the establishment of a national church, and in so doing they did not have to fear government interference in their right to expressions of religious conscience. The Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 as ten amendments to the [[Constitution of the United States]], was one of the earliest political expressions of religious freedom{{cn|date=September 2020}}. Others were the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], also authored by Jefferson and adopted by Virginia in 1786; and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789]].

The metaphor "a wall of separation between Church and State" used by Jefferson in the above quoted letter became a part of the First Amendment jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was first used by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1878). American historian [[George Bancroft]] was consulted by Waite in the ''Reynolds'' case regarding the views on establishment by the framers of the U.S. constitution. Bancroft advised Waite to consult Jefferson. Waite then discovered the above quoted letter in a library after skimming through the index to Jefferson’s collected works according to historian Don Drakeman.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Mark Movsesian (Director of the Center for Law and Religion at St. John’s University) |title=How the Supreme Court Found the Wall {{!}} Mark Movsesian |url=https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/02/how-the-supreme-court-found-the-wall |publisher=[[First Things]] |access-date=June 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220144157/https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2013/02/how-the-supreme-court-found-the-wall/ |archive-date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>

==In various countries==
{{See also|Secular state|Secularism|Pseudo-Secularism|Secular humanism}}
Countries have varying degrees of separation between government and religious institutions. Since the 1780s a number of countries have set up explicit barriers between church and state. The degree of actual separation between government and religion or religious institutions varies widely. In some countries the two institutions remain heavily interconnected. There are new conflicts in the post-Communist world.{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}<!-- Like what?--><ref>{{Cite book|author=Péter Tibor Nagy|title=The social and political history of Hungarian education – State-Church relations in the history of educational policy of the first post-communist Hungarian government |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03700/03797/03797.htm#10|isbn=963-200-511-2 |publisher=Hungarian Electronic library |access-date=2007-04-27}}</ref>

[[File:State Religions.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Countries with a state religion.]]
The many variations on separation can be seen in some countries with high degrees of religious freedom and tolerance combined with strongly secular political cultures which have still maintained state churches or financial ties with certain religious organizations into the 21st century. In England, there is a constitutionally established [[state religion]] but [[religious toleration|other faiths are tolerated]].<ref>[[Status of religious freedom by country#United Kingdom|Status of religious freedom by country]]</ref> The [[British monarch]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], and 26 bishops ([[Lords Spiritual]]) sit in the upper house of government, the [[House of Lords]].

In other kingdoms the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]] or other high-ranking official figures may be legally required to be a member of a given faith. Powers to appoint high-ranking members of the state churches are also often still vested in the worldly governments. These powers may be slightly anachronistic or superficial, however, and disguise the true level of religious freedom the nation possesses. In the case of Andorra there are two heads of state, neither of them native Andorrans. One is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, a town located in northern Spain. He has the title of Episcopalian Coprince (the other Coprince being the French Head of State). Coprinces enjoy political power in terms of law ratification and constitutional court designation, among others.

===Australia===
[[File:Hbhiggins.jpg|thumb|right|[[H. B. Higgins]], proponent of Section&nbsp;116 in the Australian pre-Federation constitutional conventions|alt=A black and white portrait of [[H. B. Higgins]]]]
{{main|Section 116 of the Australian Constitution|Anglican Church in Australia|Catholic Church in Australia}}
The [[Constitution of Australia]] prevents the Commonwealth from establishing any religion or requiring a religious test for any office:

{{quote|Ch 5 § 116 The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.}}

The language is derived from the United States' constitution, but has been altered. Following the usual practice of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], it has been interpreted far more narrowly than the equivalent US sections and no law has ever been struck down for contravening the section. Today, the Commonwealth Government provides broad-based funding to religious schools. The Commonwealth used to fund religious chaplains, but the High Court in ''[[Williams v Commonwealth]]'' found the funding agreement invalid under Section 61. However, the High Court found that Section 116 had no relevance, as the chaplains themselves did not hold office under the Commonwealth.<ref>{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|2012|litigants=[[Williams v Commonwealth]]}} {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hca23-2012-06-20.pdf|title= judgement summary|date=20 June 2012 |publisher=[[High Court of Australia]]}}</ref> All Australian parliaments are opened with a Christian prayer, and the preamble to the Australian Constitution refers to "humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God".<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/preamble Preamble to ''Commonwealth of Australian Constitution Act''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920070013/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/preamble |date=September 20, 2016 }} (Imp.) 1900.</ref>

Although the Australian monarch is [[Elizabeth II]], also British monarch and Governor of the [[Church of England]], her Australian title is unrelated to her religious office and she has no role in the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]. The prohibition against religious tests has allowed former Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane [[Peter Hollingworth]] to be appointed [[Governor-General of Australia]], the highest domestic constitutional officer; however, this was criticised.<ref name="hogan">Hogan, M. (2001, May 16).

Retrieved 2010-10-10.</ref>

Despite inclusion in the "States" chapter, Section 116 does not apply to states because of changes during drafting, and they are free to establish their own religions. Although no state has ever introduced a state church ([[New South Wales]] restricted religious groups during the early colonial period), the legal body corresponding to many religious organisations is established by state legislation.<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|acoaca1960408|Anglican Church of Australia Constitution Act 1960}}.</ref><ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|act|lcoavdia1971629|Lutheran Church of Australia Victorian District Incorporation Act 1971}}.</ref> There have been two referenda to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed. In each case the changes were grouped with other changes and voters did not have the opportunity to expressly accept only one change. Most states permit broad exemptions to religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation; for example, the New South Wales act allowing same-sex couples to adopt children permits religious adoption agencies to refuse them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/03/NSW_Parliament_Passes_Adoption_Bill/ |title=Adoption Bill Passed in NSW |publisher=The Advocate |access-date=2012-04-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130072816/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/09/03/NSW_Parliament_Passes_Adoption_Bill/ |archive-date=November 30, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|num_act|aasca2010n66377|Adoption Amendment (Same Sex Couples) Act 2010}}.</ref>

[[Islam]] is the dominant religion in Azerbaijan, with 96% of Azerbaijanis being [[Muslim]], Shia being in the majority. However, Azerbaijan is officially a secular state. According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, the state and religion are separate. Article 7 of the Constitution defines the Azerbaijani state as a democratic, legal, secular, unitary republic. Therefore, the Constitution provides freedom of religions and beliefs.

The Azerbaijani State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations controls the relations between the state and religions.

Ethnic minorities such as [[Russians]], [[Georgians]], [[Jews]], [[Lezgis]], [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]], [[Udis]] and [[Kurds]] with different religious beliefs to Islam all live in [[Azerbaijan]]. Several religions are practiced in Azerbaijan.

[[File:Rui Barbosa2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rui Barbosa]] had a large influence upon the text adopted as the 1891 Constitution of Brazil.]]
Brazil was a [[Colonial Brazil|colony]] of the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1500 until the nation's [[Independence of Brazil|independence]] from Portugal, in 1822, during which time [[Roman Catholicism]] was the official state religion. With the rise of the [[Empire of Brazil]], although Catholicism retained its status as the official creed, subsidized by the state, other religions were allowed to flourish, as the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|1824 Constitution]] secured [[religious freedom]]. The fall of the Empire, in 1889, gave way to a Republican regime, and a Constitution was enacted in 1891, which severed the ties between church and state; Republican ideologues such as [[Benjamin Constant (Brazil)|Benjamin Constant]] and [[Ruy Barbosa]] were influenced by [[laïcité]] in France and the United States. The 1891 Constitutional separation of Church and State has been maintained ever since. The current [[Constitution of Brazil]], in force since 1988, ensures the right to religious freedom, bans the establishment of state churches and any relationship of "dependence or alliance" of officials with religious leaders, except for "collaboration in the public interest, defined by law".

[[File:Ustav Republike Hrvatske br 1.JPG|thumb|right|"Constitution no. 1", which is kept in the great hall of the Palace of the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] and is used on the occasion of the [[Croatian presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]]]]
[[Freedom of religion]] in [[Croatia]] is a right defined by the [[Croatian Constitution|Constitution]], which also defines all religious communities as equal in front of the law and separated from the state. Principle of separation of church and state is enshrined in Article 41 which states:

<blockquote>All religious communities shall be equal before the law and clearly separated from the state. Religious communities shall be free, in compliance with law, to publicly conduct religious services, open schools, academies or other institutions, and welfare and charitable organizations and to manage them, and they shall enjoy the protection and assistance of the state in their activities.</blockquote>

Public schools allow religious teaching ({{lang-hr|Vjeronauk}}) in cooperation with religious communities having agreements with the state, but attendance is not mandated. Religion classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools.

The public holidays also include religious festivals of: [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[Easter Monday]], [[Corpus Christi Day]], [[Assumption Day]], [[All Saints' Day]], [[Christmas]], and [[Boxing Day]]. The primary holidays are based on the Catholic liturgical year, but other believers are allowed to celebrate other major religious holidays as well.

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Croatia]] receives state financial support and other benefits established in [[concordat]]s between the Government and the Vatican. In an effort to further define their rights and privileges within a legal framework, the government has additional agreements with other 14 religious communities: [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), [[Islamic Community of Croatia]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Church]], [[Reformed Christian Church in Croatia]], [[Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Croatia]], [[Pentecostal Church]], [[Union of Pentecostal Churches of Christ]], [[Christian Adventist Church]], [[Baptist Union of Croatia|Union of Baptist Churches]], [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], [[Church of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Reformed Movement of Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and Croatian [[Old Catholic Church]].

=== Finland ===
The [[Constitution of Finland]] declares that the organization and administration of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] is regulated in the Church Act, and the organization and administration of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] in the Orthodox Church Act. The Lutheran Church and the Orthodox Church thus have a special status in Finnish legislation compared to other religious bodies, and are variously referred to as either "national churches" or "state churches", although officially they do not hold such positions.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=constitution+of+finland+church+act&source=bl&ots=SyaSALeKWe&sig=i9jOA2Ja-zalh7G-KT3JGBj6vKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1uYX6ronOAhVMWywKHY7DCxgQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=constitution%20of%20finland%20church%20act&f=false Jeroen Temperman, 2010, State-Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law: Towards a Right to Religiously Neutral Governance, p. 45] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The Lutheran Church does not consider itself a state church, and prefers to use the term "national church".<ref>{{Cite web | title = Valtiokirkko purettu kansankirkoksi | trans-title = State Church Dismantled into National Church | publisher = Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland | work = evl.fi | date = 24 November 2006 | access-date = 23 July 2016 | url = http://evl.fi/EVLfi.nsf/Documents/85BBFB4816F713BEC2256FEA003A7232 | language = fi}}</ref>

=== France ===
{{see also|Laïcité|1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|Catholic Church in France}}
[[File:Liberte-egalite-fraternite-tympanum-church-saint-pancrace-aups-var.jpg|thumb|right|Motto of the French republic on the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of a church in [[Aups]], Var département, which was installed after the 1905 law on the Separation of the State and the Church. Such inscriptions on a church are very rare; this one was restored during the 1989 bicentennial of the [[French Revolution]].]]
The French version of separation of church and state, called [[laïcité]], is a product of French history and philosophy. It was formalized in a [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] providing for the separation of church and state, that is, the separation of religion from political power.

This model of a secularist state protects the religious institutions from state interference, but with public religious expression to some extent frowned upon. This aims to protect the public power from the influences of religious institutions, especially in public office. Religious views which contain no idea of public responsibility, or which consider religious opinion irrelevant to politics, are not impinged upon by this type of secularization of public discourse.

Former President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] criticised "negative laïcité" and talked about a "positive laïcité" that recognizes the contribution of faith to French culture, history and society, allows for faith in the public discourse and for government subsidies for faith-based groups.<ref name="christiantoday.com">Beita, Peter B. [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm French President's religious mixing riles critics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420223313/http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm |date=April 20, 2016 }} Christianity Today, January 23, 2008</ref> He visited the [[Pope]] in December 2007 and publicly emphasized France's [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic]] roots, while highlighting the importance of [[freedom of thought]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/sarkozy.breaks.french.taboo.on.church.and.politics/15760.htm |title=Sarkozy breaks French taboo on church and politics |publisher=Christiantoday.com |date=2007-12-23 |access-date=2012-04-27}}</ref> advocating that [[faith]] should come back into the [[public sphere]]. [[François Hollande]] took a very different position during the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 presidential election]], promising to insert the concept of laïcité into the constitution. In fact, the French constitution only says that the French Republic is "laïque" but no article in the 1905 law or in the constitution defines laïcité.<ref>{{cite news |title=French president rejects calls for secular values to be in constitution|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1200356.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130215164402/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1200356.htm|archive-date=2013-02-15|url-status=dead|access-date=2 February 2013|newspaper=Catholic News|date=January 27, 2012}}</ref>

Nevertheless, there are certain entanglements in France which include:
* The most significant example consists in two areas, [[Alsace]] and [[Moselle]] (see {{format link|Local law in Alsace-Moselle#Religion}} for further detail), where the 1802 [[Concordat#France|Concordat]] between France and the Holy See still prevails because the area was part of Germany when the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] was passed and the attempt of the laicist [[Cartel des gauches]] in 1924 failed due to public protests. Catholic priests as well as the clergy of three other religions (the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]], the Calvinist [[EPRAL]], and Jewish [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]]) are paid by the state, and schools have religion courses. Moreover, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metz|Catholic bishops of Metz]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]] are named (or rather, formally appointed) by the French Head of State on proposition of the Pope. In the same way, the presidents of the two official Protestant churches are appointed by the State, after proposition by their respective Churches. This makes the French President the only temporal power in the world to formally have retained the right to appoint Catholic bishops, all other Catholic bishops being appointed by the Pope.
* In French Guyana the Royal Regulation of 1828 makes the French state pay for the Roman Catholic clergy, but not for the clergy of other religions.
* In the French oversea departments and territories since the 1939 décret Mandel the French State supports the Churches.
* The French President is ''ex officio'' a [[co-prince of Andorra]], where Roman Catholicism has a status of state religion (the other co-prince being the [[Bishop of Urgell|Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell]], Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour has been awarded to a newly elected president, France pays for a ''choir vicar'', a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral in lieu of the president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her). The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France.
* Another example of the complex ties between France and the Catholic Church consists in the ''Pieux Établissements de la France à Rome et à Lorette'': five churches in Rome ([[Trinità dei Monti]], St. Louis of the French, St. Ivo of the Bretons, St. Claude of the Free County of Burgundy, and St. Nicholas of the Lorrains) as well as a chapel in [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] belong to France, and are administered and paid for by a special foundation linked to the French embassy to the Holy See.
* In [[Wallis and Futuna]], a French overseas territory, national education is conceded to the diocese, which gets paid for it by the State
* A further entanglement consists in liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist for example in Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the diplomatic status of the Holy Places.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, there is considerable controversy about the separation between the State and the Church, causing many debates in the public sphere regarding if there shall be a more radical change in the Article 3, which is maintaining the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ as the prevailing religion of the country. The actual debate concerning the separation of the Church from the State often becomes a tool for polarization in the political competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Karyotakis|first1=Minos-Athanasios|last2=Antonopoulos|first2=Nikos|last3=Saridou|first3=Theodora|title=A case study in news articles, users comments and a Facebook group for Article 3 of the Greek Constitution|journal=Kome |volume=7|pages=37–56|doi=10.17646/KOME.75672.31|year=2019|doi-access=free}}</ref> More specifically, Article 3 of the Greek constitution argues the following:

# “The prevailing religion in Greece is that of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Christ. The Orthodox Church of Greece, acknowledging our Lord Jesus Christ as its head, is inseparably united in doctrine with the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople and with every other Church of Christ of the same doctrine, observing unwaveringly, as they do the holy apostolic and synodal canons and sacred traditions. It is autocephalous and is administered by the Holy Synod of serving Bishops and the Permanent Holy Synod originating thereof and assembled as specified by the Statutory Charter of the Church in compliance with the provisions of the Patriarchal Tome of June 29, 1850 and the Synodal Act of September 4, 1928.
# The ecclesiastical regime existing in certain districts of the State shall not be deemed contrary to the provisions of the preceding paragraph.
# The text of the Holy Scripture shall be maintained unaltered. Official translation of the text into any other form of language, without prior sanction by the Autocephalous Church of Greece and the Great Church of Christ in Constantinople, is prohibited.”<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=The Constitution of Greece|publisher=Hellenic Parliament|year=2008|isbn=978-960-560-073-0|location=Athens, Greece|pages=20–21}}</ref>

Moreover, the controversial situation about the no separation between the State and the Church seems to affect the recognition of religious groups in the country as there seems to be no official mechanism for this process.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Changing Soul of Europe, Religions and Migrations in Northern and Southern Europe|last1=Vilaça|first1=Helena|last2=Pace|first2=Enzo|last3=Furseth|first3=Inger|last4=Pettersson|first4=Per|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315614502|location=United Kingdom|pages=69–88}}</ref>

===India===
{{main|Religion in India|Freedom of religion in India|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva}}
Despite 80% of Indian population are [[Hinduism in India|Hindus]], under the [[Constitution of India]], India is a secular country and there are no special provisions favouring specific religions in its constitution. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] declared India is a secular state in order to avoid [[Hindu nationalism]] and religious conflicts between [[Hinduism]], [[Islam in India|Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and other religions.

As a result of such government power over religion, politicians are sometimes accused of playing [[votebank]] politics, i.e. of giving political support to issues for the sole purpose of gaining the votes of members of a particular community, including religious communities. Both the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC) and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The [[Shah Bano case]], a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court's]] decision. After the [[2002 Gujarat violence]], there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics.<ref>{{cite news |author=Times News Network |title=Togadia wants parties to stop 'vote bank politics' |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-03-25/ahmedabad/27127436_1_vhp-leader-togadia-hindus |work=indiatimes.com |publisher=Times Internet Limited |date=25 March 2002 |access-date=2007-04-20}}</ref>

The issue of the role of the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]] has been highly divisive since the 1820s. Its large land holdings were especially a point of contention. Mexico was guided toward what was proclaimed a separation of church and state by [[Benito Juárez]] who, in 1859, attempted to eliminate the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the nation by appropriating its land and prerogatives.<ref name=mexhistory>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mexico.htm|title=Mexico, A brief History|publisher=history-world.org|access-date=2007-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017111717/http://history-world.org/mexico.htm|archive-date=2007-10-17|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=LeyLerdoClements>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=548|title=Ley Lerdo|first=Greg|last=Clements|publisher=historicaltextarchive.com|access-date=2007-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314043156/http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle|archive-date=2007-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1926, after several years of the [[Mexican Revolution]] and insecurity, President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], leader of the ruling [[National Revolutionary Party (Mexico)|National Revolutionary Party]], enacted the [[Calles Law]], which eradicated all the personal property of the churches, closed churches that were not registered with the State, and prohibited clerics from holding a public office. The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in what became known as the [[Cristero War]]. After the war's end in 1929, President [[Emilio Portes Gil]] upheld a previous truce where the law would remain enacted, but not enforced, in exchange for the hostilities to end.

===Norway===
An act approved in 2016 created the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity, effective from 1 January 2017. Before 2017 all clergy were civil servants (employees of the central government).<ref>[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/offisielt-fra-statsradet/id2501869/ Offisielt frå statsrådet 27. mai 2016] regjeringen.no «Sanksjon av Stortingets vedtak 18. mai 2016 til lov om endringer i kirkeloven (omdanning av Den norske kirke til eget rettssubjekt m.m.)

The final amendment passed by a vote of 162–3. The three dissenting votes were all from the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]].

The constitution also says that Norway's values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage, and according to the Constitution, the [[List of Norwegian monarchs#House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg|King]] is required to be Lutheran. The government will still provide funding for the church as it does with other faith-based institutions, but the responsibility for appointing bishops and provosts will now rest with the church instead of the government. Prior to 1997, the appointments of parish priests and residing chaplains was also the responsibility of the government, but the church was granted the right to hire such clergy directly with the new Church Law of 1997. The Church of Norway is regulated by its own law (''kirkeloven'') and all municipalities are required by law to support the activities of the Church of Norway and municipal authorities are represented in its local bodies.<ref>[[Church of Norway#Legal status|"Church of Norway"]]</ref>

===Romania===
{{main|Religion in Romania}}
[[Romania]] is a secular state and has no state religion. However, the role of religion in society is regulated by several articles of the Romanian Constitution.

Art 29. Freedom of Conscience. (1) Freedom of thought and opinion, as well as freedom of religion, cannot be limited in any way. No one shall be coerced to adopt an opinion or adhere to a religious faith against their will.
(5) Religious cults are autonomous in relation to the state, which provides support including the facilitation of religious assistance in the army, hospitals, penitentiaries, retirement homes and orphanages.

Art 32. Right to education (7) The state assures freedom of religious education, according to the requirements of each specific cult. In state schools, religious education is organized and guaranteed by law.

===Saudi Arabia===
{{main|Legal system of Saudi Arabia}}
The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on [[Sharia]], [[Islam]]ic law derived from the [[Quran]] and the [[Sunnah]] (the traditions) of the [[Muhammad|Islamic prophet Muhammad]], and therefore no separation of church and state is present.

===Singapore===
{{main|Religion in Singapore}}
[[Singapore]] is home to people of many religions and does not have any state religion. The [[government of Singapore]] has attempted to avoid giving any specific religions priority over the rest.

In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses in Singapore. The Singaporean government claimed that this was justified because members of Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the [[Singaporean flag|flag]], or swear oaths of allegiance to the state.<ref name="state.gov">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5732.htm|title=Singapore|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=22 March 2015}}</ref><ref>"Singapore", ''International Religious Freedom Report 2004'', U.

===Spain===
{{Further|Catholic Church and the Spanish Civil War|Catholic Church in Spain}}
In Spain, commentators have posited that the form of church-state separation enacted in France in 1905 and found in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]] are of a "hostile" variety, noting that the hostility of the state toward the church was a cause of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name="Arguing Comparative Politics">Stepan, Alfred, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&dq Arguing Comparative Politics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914183055/https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&dq |date=September 14, 2016 }}'', p. 221, Oxford University Press</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm |title=Payne, Stanley G.

Religious freedom was guaranteed only [[1966 Spanish organic law referendum|in 1966]], nine years before the end of the regime.

Since 1978, according to the [[Spanish Constitution]] (section 16.3) "No religion shall have a state character. The public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of Spanish society and shall consequently maintain appropriate cooperation relations with the Catholic Church and other confessions."

=== Sweden ===
The [[Church of Sweden]] was instigated by [[Gustav I of Sweden|King Gustav I]] (1523–60) and within the half century following his death had become established as a [[Lutheran]] state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself under the control of the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in practice means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of [[cuius regio, eius religio]] one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/januaryweb-only/11.0.html|title=Swedish Church State Separate|magazine=Christianity Today|first=Ted|last=Olsen|date=1 January 2000|access-date=27 December 2014}}</ref>

Churches and state are separated at the federal level since 1848. However, the article 72 ("Church and state") of the [[Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation|constitution]] determine that "The regulation of the relationship between the church and the state is the responsibility of the cantons".<ref name=CstCH/> Some [[cantons of Switzerland]] recognise officially some churches ([[Catholic Church]], [[Swiss Reformed Church]], [[Old Catholic Church]] and [[Jews|Jewish congregations]]). Other cantons, such as [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] are ''[[laïcité|laïques]]'' (that is to say, secular).

===Turkey===
{{Further|Islam in Turkey|Secularism in Turkey|Turkish nationalism}}
Turkey, whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim, is also considered to have practiced the [[laïcité]] school of secularism since 1928, which the founding father [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s [[Atatürk's Reforms|policies]] and theories became known as [[Kemalism]].

Despite Turkey being an officially secular country, the Preamble of the Constitution states that "there shall be no interference whatsoever of the sacred religious feelings in State affairs and politics."<ref>{{cite web
|url = http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/english/constitution.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810204816/http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/english/constitution.htm|archive-date=2006-08-10|title = The Constitution of the Republic of Turkey|publisher = Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM)}}</ref> In order to control the way religion is perceived by adherents, the State pays [[imam]]s' wages (only for Sunni Muslims), and provides religious education (of the Sunni Muslim variety) in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The State has a Department of Religious Affairs, directly under the Prime Minister bureaucratically, responsible for organizing the [[Sunni]] Muslim religion – including what will and will not be mentioned in sermons given at [[mosque]]s, especially on Fridays. Such an interpretation of secularism, where religion is under strict control of the State is very different from that of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and is a good example of how secularism can be applied in a variety of ways in different regions of the world.
The exercise of their religion in Turkey by the Greek Orthodox and the Armenian Apostolic communities is partly regulated by the terms of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. No such official recognition extends to the Syriac communities.

Under [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s tenure since 2003, Turkish secularism has come under heavy fire as a new [[Islamist]] [[right-wing populist]] mood has overtaken Turkish politics. Erdoğan has pursued a suite of policies determined to give state backing to particular interpretations of Islam.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Disestablishmentarianism}}
The [[Church of England]], a part of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]], is an [[established church]], and the [[British monarchy|British Sovereign]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]], and cannot be a Roman Catholic. Until the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]], the monarch could not be married to a Catholic.

In state-run schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (but not in privately run schools), there is a requirement for a daily act of worship that is "wholly or mainly of a Christian character", although non-Christian faith schools are exempt (instead having to have their own form of worship) and sixth-form pupils (in England and Wales) and parents of younger pupils can opt out. Official reports have recommended removing the requirement entirely.<ref name="guardian2015">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/dec/06/religious-teaching-school-assemblies-axe-report |last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=2015-12-06|access-date=2017-07-30|title=Top judge leads calls to scrap mandatory daily Christian worship in UK schools|newspaper=The Observer}}</ref> The High Court of the United Kingdom has ruled in favour of challenges, brought by pupil families supported by the [[British Humanist Association]], to secondary-level religious studies exam syllabuses that excluded non-religious worldviews.<ref name="guardian2015" />

In England, senior Church appointments are Crown appointments; the Church carries out state functions such as coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on [[Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education|Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education]]; and 26 diocesan bishops have seats in the [[House of Lords]], where they are known as the [[Lords Spiritual]] as opposed to the [[laity|lay]] [[Lords Temporal]]. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and [[euthanasia]]. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, but non-religious [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] are not yet legally recognised in their own right.

The [[Church of Scotland]] (or Kirk) is the largest religious denomination in Scotland, however, unlike the Church of England it is [[Presbyterian]] and (since 1921) not a branch of the state, with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a [[national church]] to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|blasphemy law]] has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious couples can have a [[civil wedding]] with no religious elements, and [[humanist celebrant|humanist weddings]] have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017.

Northern Ireland is regarded as the most traditionally Christian country within the UK.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for whole sentence|date=November 2019}} Publicly funded Schools in Northern Ireland are either State or Catholic maintained schools. State schools can be classed as: Controlled (by the Education Authority), Voluntary Grammar, Integrated and Special Schools. Irish-Medium Schools are operated by both the State and the Catholic Church. Despite the common notion of 'Protestant' and 'Catholic' Schools among many citizens, all State schools accept all religions without bias, with the exception of Integrated schools which require a set ratio of 40:40:20 Protestant, Catholic and Other(Mixed or non-Christian Religious).{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for whole sentence|date=November 2019}} An identification with the "Protestant" or "Roman Catholic" community is sought on equal opportunities-monitoring forms regardless of actual personal religious beliefs; as the primary purpose is to monitor cultural discrimination by employers. Atheists should select which community they come from, however particpation is not compulsory. Religious Education is compulsary for all children up to the age of 16, with the four major Church denominational bodies (The Catholic Church, The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, The Church of Ireland and the Methodist Church) agreeing on the content of the syllabus, focussing on Christianity and Secular Ethics. World Religions have to be introduced between the ages of 11 and 14. An act of collective christian worship is mandatory in all Northern Irish schools, usually consisting of a short Bible reading, lesson or dramatisation and a prayer during morning assembly.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for whole sentence|date=November 2019}}

===United States===
{{Main|Accommodationism|Separation of church and state in the United States}}
[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Madison]], drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]]]
The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] which ratified in 1791 states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." However, the phrase "separation of church and state" itself does not appear in the [[United States Constitution]]. The states themselves were free to establish an official religion, and twelve out of the thirteen had official religions.

The phrase of Jefferson ([[#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|see above]]) was quoted by the [[United States Supreme Court]] first in 1878, and then in a series of cases starting in 1947.<ref>William M. Wiecek, ''The birth of the modern Constitution: the United States Supreme Court, 1941–1953'' (Cambridge U.P., 2006) pp. 261–64</ref> The Supreme Court did not consider the question of how this applied to the states until 1947; when they did, in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'', the court [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated]] the establishment clause, determining that it applied to the states and that a law enabling reimbursement for [[busing]] to all schools (including parochial schools) was constitutional.<ref>Kermit Hall, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC The Oxford companion to the Supreme Court of the United States] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134840/https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC |date=March 4, 2016 }}'' (2005) pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC&pg=PA303 303–04] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130907/https://books.google.com/books?id=cY3er3ilgjcC&pg=PA303 |date=March 4, 2016 }}.</ref>

Prior to its incorporation, unsuccessful attempts were made to amend the constitution to explicitly apply the establishment clause to states in the 1870s and 1890s.<ref>Philip Hamburger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&dq ''Separation of Church and State''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624192830/https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&dq |date=June 24, 2016 }}. pp. 10–11, 287–334, 342, Harvard University Press, 2004</ref><ref>Kermit Hall, ed.

The concept was argued to be implicit in the flight of [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] from religious oppression in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] to found the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]] on the principle of state neutrality in matters of faith.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Neil A.|title=Rebels and renegades: a chronology of social and political dissent in the United States|edition=illustrated|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-93639-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jZymqT1HmqAC&pg=PA11 11]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZymqT1HmqAC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bercovitch

Williams was motivated by historical abuse of governmental power, and believed that government must remove itself from anything that touched upon human beings' relationship with God, advocating a "hedge or wall of Separation between the Garden of the Church and the Wilderness of the world" in order to keep religion pure.<ref>{{cite book|last=HAMBURGER|first=Philip|title=Separation of Church and State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03818-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6Axd76IE1UC&pg=PA45&dq=williams+%22hedge+or+wall+of+Separation+between+the+Garden+of+the+Church+and+the+Wilderness+of+the+world%22 45]}}</ref>

Through his work Rhode Island's charter was confirmed by [[King Charles II of England]], which explicitly stated that no one was to be "molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinion, in matters of religion".

Williams is credited with helping to shape the church and state debate in England, and influencing such men as [[John Milton]] and particularly John Locke, whose work was studied closely by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and other designers of the U.S. Constitution. Williams theologically derived his views mainly from Scripture and his motive is seen as religious, but Jefferson's advocation of religious liberty is seen as political and social.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Barry |first=John M. |date=January 2012 |title=Roger Williams and the Creation of the American Soul |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/God-Government-and-Roger-Williams-Big-Idea.html |magazine=Smithsonian}}</ref> Though no states currently have an established religion, almost all of the state constitutions invoke God and some originally required officeholders to believe in the [[Holy Trinity]].

In 1797, the [[United States Senate]] ratified a treaty with [[Tripoli]] that stated in Article 11:

{{quote|As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of [[Musulman|Mussulmen]]; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any [[Mohammedan|Mahometan]] nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.<ref>For full text see [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1796t.asp "The Barbary Treaties 1786–1816; Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Signed at Tripoli November 4, 1796" Avalon Project]</ref>}}

According to Frank Lambert, Professor of History at [[Purdue University]], the assurances in Article 11 were

<blockquote>intended to allay the fears of the Muslim state by insisting that religion would not govern how the treaty was interpreted and enforced.

Supporters of the separation of church and state argue that this treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, confirms that the government of the United States was specifically intended to be religiously neutral.<ref>F. Forrester Church. ''The separation of church and state'' (2004) p. 121</ref> The treaty was submitted by President Adams and unanimously ratified by the Senate.

=====Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States=====
{{Main|Church of the Holy Trinity v. United_States#Christian_nation}}
In the 1892 case ''[[Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States]]'', Supreme Court Justice [[Justice David Brewer|David Brewer]] wrote for a unanimous Court that "no purpose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is a religious people. ... [T]his is a Christian nation."<ref name="Finkelman">{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=Religion and American Law: An Encyclopedia |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136919565 |page=76 |language=en}}</ref>

Legal historian [[Paul Finkelman]] writes that: 
{{quotation|Brewer, the son of a Congregationalist missionary to Asia Minor, quoted several colonial charters, state constitutions, and court decisions that referred to the importance of Christian belief in the affairs of the American people; cited the practice of various legislative bodies of beginning their sessions with prayer, and noted the large number of churches and Christian charitable organizations that exist in every community in the country as evidence that this is a Christian nation. In doing so, Brewer expressed the prevailing nineteenth-century Protestant view that America is a Christian nation.<ref name="Finkelman"/>}}

====Use of the phrase====
The phrase "separation of church and state" is derived from a letter written by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1802 to [[Danbury Baptists|Baptists from Danbury, Connecticut]], and published in a Massachusetts newspaper soon thereafter. In that letter, referencing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], Jefferson writes:

{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.<ref name=Jefferson11 />}}

Another early user of the term was [[James Madison]], the principal drafter of the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. In a 1789 debate in the House of Representatives regarding the draft of the First Amendment, the following was said:

{{quote|August 15, 1789. Mr. [Peter] Sylvester [of New York] had some doubts. … He feared it [the First Amendment] might be thought to have a tendency to abolish religion altogether. … Mr. [Elbridge] Gerry [of Massachusetts] said it would read better if it was that "no religious doctrine shall be established by law." … Mr. [James] Madison [of Virginia] said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that "Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law." … [T]he State[s] … seemed to entertain an opinion that under the clause of the Constitution. … it enabled them [Congress] to make laws of such a nature as might … establish a national religion; to prevent these effects he presumed the amendment was intended. … Mr. Madison thought if the word "National" was inserted before religion, it would satisfy the minds of honorable gentlemen. … He thought if the word "national" was introduced, it would point the amendment directly to the object it was intended to prevent.<ref>''Debates and Proceedings in the Congress of the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Gales & Seaton, 1834, Vol. I pp. 757–59, August 15, 1789</ref>}}

Madison contended "Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendI_religions43.html |title=James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |access-date=2012-04-27}}</ref> Several years later he wrote of "total separation of the church from the state".<ref>(March 2, 1819 letter to [[Robert Walsh (diplomat)|Robert Walsh]]), {{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Frank|title=The founding fathers and the place of religion in America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/foundin_lam_2003_00_2547/page/288 288]|isbn=978-0-691-08829-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qse4fZ6eQgC}}</ref> "Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States", Madison wrote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18191213_monopolies.htm|title=Monopolies Perpetuities Corporations – Ecclesiastical Endowments|first=James|last=Madison|publisher=constitution.org|access-date=2008-06-16}}</ref> and he declared, "practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States."<ref>(1811 letter to Baptist Churches)</ref> In a letter to [[Edward Livingston]] Madison further expanded,

[[File:Thomas Jefferson's Grave Site.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]]'s tombstone. The inscription, as he stipulated, reads, "Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of ... the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom]] ...."]]
This attitude is further reflected in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], originally authored by Jefferson and championed by Madison, and guaranteeing that no one may be compelled to finance any religion or denomination.

{{quote|… no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.<ref>J. F. Maclear, ''Church and state in the modern age: a documentary history'' (1995) p. 65</ref>}}

Under the [[United States Constitution]], the treatment of religion by the government is broken into two clauses: the [[establishment clause]] and the [[free exercise clause]]. Both are discussed in regard to whether certain state actions would amount to an impermissible government establishment of religion.

The phrase was also mentioned in an eloquent letter written by President [[John Tyler]] on July 10, 1843.<ref>Tyler wrote, "The United States have adventured upon a great and noble experiment, which is believed to have been hazarded in the absence of all previous precedent – that of total separation of Church and State. No religious establishment by law exists among us. The conscience is left free from all restraint and each is permitted to worship his Maker after his own judgment. The offices of the Government are open alike to all. No tithes are levied to support an established Hierarchy, nor is the fallible judgment of man set up as the sure and infallible creed of faith. The Mahommedan, if he will to come among us would have the privilege guaranteed to him by the constitution to worship according to the Koran; and the East Indian might erect a shrine to Brahma if it so pleased him. Such is the spirit of toleration inculcated by our political Institutions . … The Hebrew persecuted and down trodden in other regions takes up his abode among us with none to make him afraid . … and the Aegis of the Government is over him to defend and protect him. Such is the great experiment which we have cried, and such are the happy fruits which have resulted from it; our system of free government would be imperfect without it.") quoted in Nicole Guétin, ''Religious ideology in American politics: a history'' (2009) p. 85</ref> During the 1960 presidential campaign the potential influence of the Catholic Church on John F. Kennedy's presidency was raised. If elected, it would be the first time that a Catholic would occupy the highest office in the United States. [[John F. Kennedy]], in his [[s:Address of Senator John F. Kennedy to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association]] on 12 September 1960, addressed the question directly, saying,

{{quote|I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute – where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote – where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference – and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him. I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish – where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source – where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials – and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all. […] I do not speak for my church on public matters – and the church does not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President – on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject – I will make my decision in accordance with these views, in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise. But if the time should ever come – and I do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible – when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office; and I hope any conscientious public servant would do the same.}}

The United States Supreme Court has referenced the separation of church and state metaphor more than 25 times, though not always fully embracing the principle, saying "the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state".<ref>* See [http://supreme.justia.com/us/465/668/case.html ''Lynch v.

[b]ut the metaphor itself is not a wholly accurate description of the practical aspects of the relationship that in fact exists between church and state."

The Court used the phrase again by Justice Hugo Black in 1947 in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education|Everson]]''. In a minority opinion in ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'', Justice Rehnquist presented the view that the establishment clause was intended to protect local establishments of religion from federal interference. Rehnquist made numerous citations of cases that rebutted the idea of a total wall of separation between Church and State. A result of such reasoning was Supreme Court support for government payments to faith-based community projects. [[Justice Scalia]] has criticized the metaphor as a bulldozer removing religion from American public life.<ref>[[Lee v. Weisman]], {{ussc|505|577|1992}}</ref>

====Pledge of Allegiance====
Critics of the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] have argued that the use of the phrase "under God" violates the separation of church and state. While the pledge was created by [[Francis Bellamy]] in 1891, in 1954, the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic organization, campaigned with other groups to have the words "under God" added to the pledge. On June 14, 1954, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed the bill to make the addition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-wrote-the-pledge-of-allegiance-93907224/|title=The Man Who Wrote the Pledge of Allegiance|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}</ref>

Since then, critics have challenged the existence of the phrase in the Pledge. In 2004, [[Michael Newdow]], an ordained [[atheist]] minister of the [[Universal Life Church]] challenged a Californian law which required students to recite the pledge. He said the law violated his daughter's right to free speech. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school system in ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', mainly due to the fact that the father could not claim sufficient custody of the child over his ex-wife who was the legal guardian and had opposed the lawsuit. Additionally, the Supreme Court stated that teachers leading students in the pledge was constitutional, and therefore the pledge should stay the same.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-latest-controversy-about-under-god-in-the-pledge-of-allegiance|title=The history of legal challenges to the Pledge of Allegiance – National Constitution Center|website=[[National Constitution Center]] – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>

== Religious views ==

===Islam===
The separation of religion and state happened very early on in Islamic history. Muslim scholars were endowed and separated from the state, which they became very critical of. The state needed the [[ulama|scholars]] to legitimize their rule while the scholars did not need the state. Thus, the scholars were generally independent, with some bumps in history like the [[mihna]] being the exception rather than the rule. [[Richard Bulliet]] writes that during the colonial and [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] periods of the Muslim world, a main goal of the political tyrants was to remove the independence of the scholars via removing their economic and social independence. The result is the doors of tyranny opened up which is still visible today in many parts of the Muslim world.<ref name="Firas">{{cite book |last1=Alkhateeb |first1=Firas |title=Lost Islamic History: Reclaiming Muslim Civilisation from the Past |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-1-84904-397-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbwHngEACAAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Bulliet">{{cite book |last1=Bulliet |first1=Richard W. |title=The Case for Islamo-Christian Civilization |date=2004 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12796-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeOdAwAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Halaqa">{{cite web |title=Separation of Church and State in Islamic History and Freedom |url=https://halaqa.home.blog/2020/05/21/separation-of-church-and-state-in-islamic-history-and-freedom/ |website=Halaqa |access-date=21 May 2020 |language=en |date=21 May 2020}}</ref>

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]'s understanding of [[Islam]], Islamic principles state that the politics of government should be separate from the doctrine of religion. Special preference should not be given to a Muslim over a non-Muslim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/egazette/articles/Separation_of_Mosque_and_State-200906.pdf|title=Separation of Mosque and state|publisher=Alislam|access-date=2010-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703065348/http://www.alislam.org/egazette/articles/Separation_of_Mosque_and_State-200906.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muslimsforpeace.org/|title=Muslims for Peace|publisher=Muslims for Peace|access-date=2010-09-13}}</ref> This is best represented by the Constitution of Medina which, in the words of Dr. Craig Considine, was one of the earliest forms of secular governance, providing as it did, equal religious and communal rights to Muslims, Jews and pagans, while recognising them all as bound together by the identity of the city-state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://craigconsidinetcd.com/2014/01/28/restoring-the-constitution-of-medina-and-the-us-constitution-as-a-means-to-religious-freedom/|title=Islamic and American Constitutions Give Hope For Religious Freedom|last=Considine|first=Dr Craig|date=2014-01-28|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>

===Christianity===
{{further|Christian state|Christian democracy|Christian Reconstructionism}}

Historically, the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] have deemed a close relationship between church and state desirable wherever possible as per the 2105 of the Catechism<ref>https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm</ref>. The Catholic Church, in addition, teaches that states have a duty to recognize the Catholic faith officially and in its laws and mores, if such states' populations are or become predominantly Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} The Orthodox churches have historically at times formed a "[[symphonia]]" with the state, whether de jure or de facto.
On the other hand, while some Protestants hold views similar to those above, some [[Protestant]]s refuse to vote, carry arms, or participate in civil government in any way, often leading to their persecution, as happened to [[Anabaptist]]s, their descendants including the [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Quakers]], in the 20th Century. Anabaptist Protestants and [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witnesses]], in many countries, believing by not participating they are closer to the [[Kingdom of God]], since "[[Jesus]] answered ([[Pilate]]), 'My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight (to defend him).' " – [[John 18]]:36. For them, the term "[[Christian nation]]" cannot be a valid governmental position, leaving only Christian people, possibly in Christian communities, beyond which are the "things which are Caesar's" – [[Matthew 22:21]].

==== Methodism====
In its section on National Reform, the ''Book of Discipline'' of the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] states, with respect to Church and state relations:<ref name="AWMC2014">{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=en|pages=37–38}}</ref><ref name="WMC1896"/>

{{quote|It shall be the duty of the ministers and members of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection to use their influence in every feasible manner in favor of a more complete recognition of the authority of Almighty God, in the secular and civil relations, both of society and of government, and the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ as King of nations as well as King of saints.<ref name="AWMC2014"/><ref name="WMC1896"/>}}

As such, the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Church advocates for Bible reading in public schools, chaplaincies in the Armed Forces and in Congress, [[blue law]]s (reflecting historic Methodist belief in [[Sunday Sabbatarianism]]), and [[Christian amendment|amendments that advance the recognition of God]].<ref name="AWMC2014"/><ref name="WMC1896">{{cite book |title=Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of America |year=1896|publisher=Wesleyan Methodist Church|language=en|pages=142–143}}</ref>

====Reformed====
The Reformed tradition of Christianity ([[Congregationalist]], [[Continental Reformed]], [[Presbyterian]] denominations) have also addressed the issue of the relationship between the Church and state. In its 1870 [[Presbyterian polity#General assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]] stated:<ref name="Thompson1902"/>

{{quote|We should regard the successful attempt to expel all religious instruction and influence from our public schools as an evil of the first magnitude. Nor do we see how this can be done without inflicting a deadly wound upon the intellectual and moral life of the nation…We look upon the state as an ordinance of God, and not a mere creature of the popular will; and, under its high responsibility to the Supreme Ruler of the world, we hold it to be both its right and bound duty to educate its children in those elementary principles of knowledge and virtue which are essential to its own security and well-being. The union of church and state is indeed against our American theory and constitutions of government; but the most intimate union of the state with the saving and conservative forces of Christianity is one of the oldest customs of the country, and has always ranked a vital article of our political faith.<ref name="Thompson1902">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Robert Ellis |title=The American Church History Series: A History of the Presbyterian Churches |year=1902|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|language=en|page=199}}</ref>}}

====Catholicism====
The first full articulation of the Catholic doctrine on the principles of the relationship of the [[Catholic Church]] to the state (at the time, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) is contained in the document [[Famuli vestrae pietatis]], written by [[Pope Gelasius I]] to the Emperor, which states that the Church and the state should work together in society, that the state should recognize the Church's role in society, with the Church holding superiority in moral matters and the state having superiority in temporal matters. Monsignor John A. Ryan speaks of this Catholic doctrine thusly: "If there is only one true religion, and if its possession is the most important good in life, for states as well as individuals, then the public profession, protection, and promotion of this religion, and the legal prohibition of all direct assaults upon it, becomes one of the most obvious and fundamental duties of the state. For it is the business of the state to safeguard and promote human welfare in all departments of life." ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' ("Joy and Hope"), the 1965 Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, noted that "... the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel."<ref name=gaudium>{{Cite book|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|author=Pope Paul VI|title=Gaudium et Spes|at=§4|date=7 December 1965|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411023509/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |archive-date=April 11, 2011|ref={{SfnRef|Gaudium et Spes}}}}</ref> The mission of the Church recognized that the realities of secularization and pluralism exist despite the traditional teaching on confessional statehood. Because of this reality of secularisation, it also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the secular world, viewing the laity as much-needed agents of change in order to bring about a transformation of society more in line with Catholic teaching. "This council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit.".{{sfn|Gaudium et Spes|loc=§43}} This was further expanded in ''[[Apostolicam Actuositatem]]'', Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity, of 18 November 1965.

''Apostolicam Actuositatem'', the Second Vatican Council's "Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity", was issued 18 November 1965. The purpose of this document was to encourage and guide lay people in their Christian service.

The [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic teaching]] in ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Declaration on Religious Freedom (1986), states that all people are entitled to a degree of religious freedom as long as public order is not disturbed and that constitutional law should recognize such freedom.<ref>Calo, Zachary A., [http://www4.samford.edu/lillyhumanrights/papers/Calo_Catholic.pdf Catholic Social Thought, Political Liberalism, and the Idea of Human Rights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621203728/http://www4.samford.edu/lillyhumanrights/papers/Calo_Catholic.pdf |date=June 21, 2010 }}, pp. 18–19, Samford University, November 2004</ref> "If, in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of society, it is at the same time imperative that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be recognized and made effective in practice.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html Pope Paul VI.

The traditional teaching of the duty of society towards the Church is described in the current edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, number 2105.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1993 edition, https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm</ref>

The Catholic Church takes the position that the Church itself has a proper role in guiding and informing consciences, explaining the [[natural law]], and judging the moral integrity of the state, thereby serving as check to the power of the state.<ref>Grasso, Kenneth L. and Robert P. Hunt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gRNcvjNxXfYC&dq Catholicism and religious freedom: contemporary reflections on Vatican II's declaration on religious liberty] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520111726/https://books.google.com/books?id=gRNcvjNxXfYC&dq |date=May 20, 2016 }}'', p. 6, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006</ref> The Church teaches that the [[Dignitatis humanae#The fundamental right to religious liberty|right of individuals to religious freedom]] is an essential dignity.

Catholic philosopher Thomas Storck argues that, once a society becomes "Catholicised" and adopts the Church as the state religion, it is further morally bound: "'the just requirements of public order' vary considerably between a Catholic state and a religiously neutral state. If a neutral state can prohibit polygamy, even though it is a restriction on religious freedom, then a Catholic state can likewise restrict the public activity of non-Catholic groups. "The just requirements of public order" can be understood only in the context of a people's traditions and modes of living, and in a Catholic society would necessarily include that social unity based upon a recognition of the Catholic Church as the religion of society, and the consequent exclusion of all other religions from public life. Western secular democracies, committed to freedom of religion for all sects, find no contradiction in proscribing polygamy, although some religions permit it, because its practice is contrary to the traditions and mores of these nations. A Catholic country can certainly similarly maintain its own manner of life."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FR89103.HTM |title=THE PROBLEM OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY: A NEW PROPOSAL|access-date=2015-06-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310131008/https://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FR89103.HTM |archive-date=2016-03-10 |work="Faith & Reason".

<blockquote>If, under consideration of historical circumstances among peoples, special civil recognition is given to one religious community in the constitutional order of a society, it is necessary at the same time that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious freedom should be acknowledged and maintained.<ref>

The Church takes stances on current political issues, and tries to influence legislation on matters it considers relevant. For example, the Catholic bishops in the United States adopted a plan in the 1970s calling for efforts aimed at a [[Constitutional amendment]] providing "[[abortion law|protection for the unborn]] child to the maximum degree possible".<ref>{{cite web |last=Curran |first=Charles |url=http://ncronline.org/news/politics/us-catholic-bishops-and-abortion-legislation |title=National Catholic Reporter online, 29 November 2010 |publisher=Ncronline.org |access-date=2012-04-27|date=2010-11-29 }}</ref>

==Friendly and hostile separation==
Scholars have distinguished between what can be called "friendly" and "hostile" separations of church and state.<ref>{{cite book | last=Maier |first=Hans| others=trans.

The hostile model of secularism arose with the [[Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution|French Revolution]] and is typified in the [[Persecution of Christians in Mexico|Mexican Revolution]], its resulting [[Mexican Constitution|Constitution]], in the [[First Portuguese Republic]] of 1910, and in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Maier|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wozo1W7giZQC&pg=PA106 106]}}</ref><ref>Martinez-Torron, Javier.

The French separation of 1905<ref>Félix Fénéon,'' Nouvelles en trois lignes, 1906 '', éditeur Libella, collection Libretto, 162 pages, Paris, 2019 ({{ISBN|978-2-36914-446-5}})</ref> and the Spanish separation of 1931 have been characterized as the two most hostile of the twentieth century, although the current church-state relations in both countries are considered generally friendly.<ref name="Arguing Comparative Politics" /> Nevertheless, France's former President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] at the beginning of his term considered his country's current state of affairs a "negative laïcité" and wanted to develop a "positive laïcité" more open to religion.<ref name="christiantoday.com" /> The concerns of the state toward religion have been seen by some as one cause of the civil war in [[Spanish Civil War#Constitution of 1931|Spain]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/spainport2.htm |title=A History of Spain and Portugal, Volume 2 |chapter=Ch. 25: The Second Spanish Republic |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |author=Payne, Stanley G. |year=1973 |page=632 |access-date=2009-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723131833/http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |chapter-url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm }} ({{cite web |url=http://libro.uca.edu/title.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914233431/http://libro.uca.edu/title.htm|archive-date=2002-09-14 |url-status=dead|title=Title Catalog |website=Library of Iberian Resources Online |access-date=2009-07-11}})</ref> and [[Cristero War|Mexico]].

The French Catholic philosopher and drafter of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'', [[Jacques Maritain]], noted the distinction between the models found in France and in the mid-twentieth century United States.<ref name="Christ And Culture Revisited">{{cite book |author=Carson, D. A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIwE74bxvpAC |title=Christ And Culture Revisited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512113715/https://books.google.com/books?id=pIwE74bxvpAC&dq |archive-date=May 12, 2016 |page=189 |publisher=Wm.

He considered the U.S. model of that time to be more amicable because it had both "sharp distinction and actual cooperation" between church and state, what he called a "historical treasure" and admonished the United States, "Please to God that you keep it carefully, and do not let your concept of separation veer round to the European one."<ref name="Christ And Culture Revisited" /> [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], another French observer, tended to make the same distinction: "In the U.S., from the beginning, politics and religion were in accord, and they have not ceased to be so since."<ref>de Tocqueville, Alexis, ''Democracy in America'', edited and translated by Harvey Mansfield and Delba Winthrop, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000.</ref>
