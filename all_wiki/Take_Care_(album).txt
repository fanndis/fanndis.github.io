'''''Take Care''''' is the second [[studio album]] by Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]. It was released on November 15, 2011 by [[Young Money Entertainment]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[Republic Records]]. The album features guest appearances from [[The Weeknd]], [[Rihanna]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Lil Wayne]], and [[André 3000]]. Alongside prominent [[Record producer|production]] from the album's executive producers Drake and 40, further contributors include [[T-Minus (producer)|T-Minus]], [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], [[Boi-1da]], [[Illangelo]], [[Jamie xx]], [[Supa Dups]], [[Just Blaze]], Chase N. Cashe, and [[Doc McKinney]].  

Prior to ''Take Care'', Drake released ''[[Thank Me Later]]'', which experienced positive critical success, but left him feeling disjointed about the album's musical content. Expressing a desire to reunite with [[40 (record producer)|40]], his long-time producer who featured in parts on ''Thank Me Later'', the duo worked extensively on the new album once recording sessions began in 2010. Drake's vocals on the album feature emotional [[crooner|crooning]], [[alto]] vocals, a [[guttural]] cadence, a melodic [[flow (music)|flow]], and a larger emphasis on singing than on ''Thank Me Later''. In comparison to his debut album, Drake revealed that the album is called ''Take Care'' because "I get to take my time this go-round [rather than rush]".   

The album also expands on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic aesthetic of ''Thank Me Later''. It incorporates several elements that have come to define Drake's sound, including minimalist [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] influences, existential subject matter, and alternately sung and rapped vocals. It features a mixture of [[Braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]] and emotional lyrics, exploring themes of fame, romance, and wealth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/amplifier/drake-handled-care-leak-extremely-well-175712445.html|title=Drake Handled the 'Take Care' Leak Extremely Well|work=[[Yahoo! Music]]|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|date=November 7, 2011|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref> The album also highlights other topics, such as Drake's relationships with friends and family, as well as touching on sex and [[narcissism]]. 

Despite [[Internet leak|leaking online]] nine days before its scheduled release, ''Take Care'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 631,000 copies in its first week. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|six times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Four of the album's singles peaked in the top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: "[[Headlines (Drake song)|Headlines]]", "[[Make Me Proud]]", "[[The Motto]]" and "[[Take Care (song)|Take Care]]". The album received general acclaim from critics, with praise for its expansive production and emotional themes. It was named one of 2011's best albums, and later one of the best albums of the 2010s, by several publications. It won Drake his first [[Grammy Award]], winning [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[55th Annual Grammy Awards|2013 Grammy Awards]]. In 2020, the album was ranked 95th on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s updated list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

In 2010, Drake released his debut album ''[[Thank Me Later]]'', continuing his creative partnership with record producer and audio engineer [[Noah "40" Shebib]], who had first introduced his distinct sound on Drake's breakthrough mixtape ''[[So Far Gone (mixtape)|So Far Gone]]'' (2009).

{{Quote box
|quote = Drake's not the first to ponder such dim realities ... ''Take Care'', however, raises the stakes by fully dwelling in that discomfort zone where not just sex, but every personal exchange — with admirers, among friends, within a family — starts to feel like a financial transaction. Extending the mood of his self-doubt takes Drake beyond the realm of self-pity, offering a critique of the very culture that's created him as an artist.
