Cox appeared as a contestant on the first season of ''I Want to Work for Diddy''; afterwards she was approached by [[VH1]] about show ideas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.papermag.com/2010/03/reality_bites_laverne_cox_from.php|title=PAPERMAG: Reality Bites: Laverne Cox from VH1's ''TRANSform Me'' |first=Alex|last=Catarinella|work=papermag.com|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=28 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701060027/http://www.papermag.com/2010/03/reality_bites_laverne_cox_from.php|archive-date=1 July 2015}}</ref> From that came the makeover television series ''TRANSform Me'', which made Cox the first African-American transgender person to produce and star in her own TV show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/transform_me/cast.jhtml|title=TRANSform Me| publisher=VH1| accessdate=12 April 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209174823/http://www.vh1.com/shows/transform_me/cast.jhtml|archive-date=9 February 2012}}</ref><ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/laverne-cox|title=Laverne Cox Bio|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=12 April 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410153448/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laverne-cox|archive-date=10 April 2012}}</ref> Both those shows were nominated for a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for outstanding reality program, and when ''Diddy'' won in 2009, Cox accepted the award at the ceremony, giving a speech described by the ''[[San Francisco Sentinel]]'' as "among the most poignant because [it] reminded us how important it is to tell our stories, all of our stories."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sbsMZujtvU |title=Laverne Cox and Calpernia Addams at GLAAD Awards 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425070255/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sbsMZujtvU|archive-date=25 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baywindows.com/GLAAD-and-MTPC-Launch-I-AM-Trans-People-Speak-video-series|title=GLAAD and MTPC Launch I AM Trans People Speak video series|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230085720/https://itunes.apple.com/mx/album/rocky-horror-picture-show/id1141483741|archive-date=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=26131 |title=On the Carpet at the GLAAD Media Awards |publisher=[[San Francisco Sentinel]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012041030/http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=26131 |archive-date=12 October 2013}}</ref> She has also acted in a number of TV shows and films, including ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[Bored to Death]]'', and ''[[Musical Chairs (film)|Musical Chairs]]''.

In 2013, Cox began her recurring role in the Netflix series ''Orange is the New Black'' as Sophia Burset, a trans woman sent to prison for credit-card fraud. In that year, she stated, "Sophia is written as a multi-dimensional character who the audience can really empathize with—all of the sudden they're empathizing with a real Trans person. And for Trans folks out there, who need to see representations of people who are like them and of their experiences, that's when it becomes really important."<ref>{{cite web|last=Douvris|first=Michelle|title=Sitting Down With Orange is the New Black Star Laverne Cox|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2013/11/09/sitting-down-with-orange-is-the-new-black-star-laverne-cox/|publisher=Emertainment Monthly|accessdate=9 November 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109170321/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2013/11/09/sitting-down-with-orange-is-the-new-black-star-laverne-cox/| archive-date=9 November 2013}}</ref> Cox's role in ''Orange is the New Black'' provides her a platform to speak on the rights of trans people.

In January 2014, Cox joined trans woman [[Carmen Carrera]] on [[Katie Couric]]'s syndicated show, ''[[Katie (talk show)|Katie]]''. Couric referred to transgender people as "transgenders", and after being rebuffed by Carrera on the subject of her surgeries, specifically what [[Vaginoplasty#Sex reassignment surgery|genital reconstruction]] she had done, turned the same question to Cox. Cox responded,

{{quote|I do feel there is a preoccupation with that. The preoccupation with transition and surgery objectifies trans people. And then we don't get to really deal with the real lived experiences. The reality of trans people's lives is that so often we are targets of violence. We experience discrimination disproportionately to the rest of the community. Our unemployment rate is twice the national average; if you are a trans person of color, that rate is four times the national average. The homicide rate is highest among trans women. If we focus on transition, we don't actually get to talk about those things.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/01/07/laverne_cox_artfully_shuts_down_katie_courics_invasive_questions_about_transgender_people/ |title=Laverne Cox flawlessly shuts down Katie Couric's invasive questions about transgender people |work=Salon.com |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301110310/http://www.salon.com/2014/01/07/laverne_cox_artfully_shuts_down_katie_courics_invasive_questions_about_transgender_people/ |archive-date=1 March 2014}}</ref>}}
