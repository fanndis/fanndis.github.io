"'''Soldier'''" is a song by American [[girl group]] [[Destiny's Child]], featuring American rappers [[T.I.]] and [[Lil Wayne]], from Destiny's Child's fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'' (2004). [[Columbia Records]] released "Soldier" as the second [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Destiny Fulfilled'' on December 7, 2004. The trio, [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], co-wrote the song with [[Sean Garrett]] and [[Rich Harrison]]; the latter co-produced it with Knowles. A [[Southern hip hop]] mid-tempo song, it lyrically describes each member's favorite type of male love interest.

"Soldier" received mostly positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], who praised its composition and the trio's vocal performances, but criticized the lyrical content. The song received a nomination in the category for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]] and won a Best R&B/Soul Single by a Group, Band or Duo award at the [[2005 Soul Train Music Awards]]. A commercial success, "Soldier" peaked within the top-five in six European countries and in Australia, further being certified Gold in the latter region. In the United States, it peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and topped the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart, further receiving a Platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

The [[black-and-white]] [[music video]] directed by [[Ray Kay]] featured cameo appearances by several rappers and singers. It was nominated at the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]] under the category of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]]. The band performed "Soldier" on several televised appearances in 2004 and 2005 and included it on the [[set list]] of their final tour [[Destiny Fulfilled... And Lovin' It]] (2005). Both Beyoncé and Rowland performed the song during their solo tours after Destiny's Child's disbandment. The song was sampled in many songs by different artists, most notably by [[Nelly]] on his single "[[Grillz]]" (2005).

[[Sean Garrett]] and [[Rich Harrison]] assisted the artists in writing the song, with Harrison handling production alongside Destiny's Child member Beyoncé Knowles.<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes|title=Destiny Fulfilled|others=[[Destiny's Child]]|year=2004 |publisher=[[Columbia Records]]}}</ref> It is the only song on the album to feature any guest performers.<ref name="jay" /> "Soldier" was recorded by Jim Caruana at [[Sony Music Studios]] in New York City in 2004, with [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] by Dexter Simmons and [[Audio mastering|mastering]] by Tom Coyne.<ref name="liner" />

Garrett initially wrote "Soldier" in a taxi while going to the studio where the band worked on ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]''; he sang the [[hook (music)|hook]] to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood from the perspective of having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/11/sean-garrett-25-essential-songs/destinys-child-soldier|title=Sean Garrett Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=Complex Media|date=2012-11-22|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref> During an interview with [[MTV News]], Rowland said that with "Soldier" each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance.

Lyrically, "Soldier" is a continuation of the previous song on ''Destiny Fulfilled'', "[[Lose My Breath]]". As the singers feel that their man does not fulfill them in the way they want, they tell him "I need a soldier", further "upping their standards".<ref name="jay" /><ref name="stylus" /> They request their man to be a "[[wikt:thug|thug]]", proclaiming their love for "country boys";<ref name="pitchrev" /><ref name="Sinclair">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,784896,00.html|title=Destiny Fulfilled (2004): Destiny's Child|last=Sinclair|first=Tom|date=2004-11-26|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time Inc]]|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> their preference include a "soldier" who is "street" and "hood".<ref name="nirvana" /> MacPherson further felt that the trio cruised the [[ghetto]] for suitable men with "Soldier", an "ode to gangsta love".<ref name="stylus" /><ref name="Eliscu" /> Corey Moss of [[MTV]] felt that the song was one of the most personal moments on ''Destiny Fulfilled'' in the sense that Beyoncé's then-relatively secret relationship with rapper Jay-Z was acknowledged "on record for the first time".<ref name="jay" /> Moss further elaborated, "Albeit minor, her [Beyoncé's] verse (about falling for a guy from the BK, as in Jay's Brooklyn stomping grounds) offers a rare moment of commentary on the couple, which has thus far only been chronicled by tabloid photographers."<ref name="jay">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/destinys_child/news_feature/041108/index3.jhtml|title=Destiny's Child: Reunited And It Feels So Good|publisher=[[MTV]].

== Critical reception ==
[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from the website [[AllMusic]] described "Soldier" as one of the "hard-driving dance cuts" of ''Destiny Fulfilled'' further choosing it as a highlight.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r715051/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Destiny Fulfilled: Destiny's Child|last= Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=AllMusic. Macrovision|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> Similarly, Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine wrote in his review that "[The album] shoots its load quickly, although just as effectively: 'Lose My Breath' and 'Soldier' are stunning, both displaying the Beyoncé trademark of creepily submissive lyrics matched with dominatrix vocals and arrangements to superb effect."<ref name="stylus" /> MacPherson continued praising the song's slow "contemptuous grind" and the singers' vocal delivery further concluding that T.I. and Wayne "get comprehensively owned".<ref name="stylus">{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=2564|title=Destiny's Child – Destiny Fulfilled&nbsp;– Review|publisher=[[Stylus Magazine]]|first=Alex|last=MacPherson|date=2004-12-03|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' writer Kelefa Sanneh described the track as part of the album's "lovable" material and went on saying, "[it] takes a ludicrous premise... and turns it into sharp, coldblooded electro-pop".<ref name="sanneh" /> Andy Battaglia writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' felt that the song and "[[Cater 2 U]]" "make sassy end-runs around notions of womanly subservience, but their best musical moments hide in tiny melismatic twirls instead of hooks".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/destinys-child-emdestiny-fulfilledem-11185|title=Destiny's Child: ''Destiny Fulfilled''|work=[[The A.V.

<blockquote>
"'Soldier' might not carry with it the shock of the new, but it's still a nice little single... The women of Destiny's Child don't sound the slightest bit convincing singing about how they need thug boyfriends, but they wind their voices around a gorgeous hook exactly as well as they always have. T.I. and Lil Wayne stop by, not saying anything but sounding cool and tough and unflappable doing it. It's pretty good, but don't expect it to set your world on fire."<ref name="pitchrev" />
</blockquote>
Barbara Ellen of ''The Observer'' said the song was "of the exemplary standard" of the band's previous albums, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001) and ''The Writing's on the Wall''.<ref name="ellen" /> Describing it as an "overt bid for street cred", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Tom Sinclair felt that T.I and Lil Wayne "bring little to the party" with their contribution to the song.<ref name="Sinclair" /> Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz writing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine felt that the group "cemented their street and chart credibility" with the song.<ref name="bill" /> Another reviewer from the same magazine felt that the band's "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" was most evident on "Soldier" and two other songs from the album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65669/destiny-fulfilled|title=Destiny Fulfilled|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|first=G.|last=M.|volume=116|number=47|page=66|issn=0006-2510|date=2004-11-20|accessdate=2014-07-21}}</ref> Jenny Eliscu from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote in her review, "It's a hot track, even if the message feels affected coming from these church girls."<ref name="Eliscu" /> For the same reason, ''Vibe'' writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as a [[Broadway show]] tune about thug life.<ref name="Vibe" /> Gil Kaufman from MTV News described the song as a "bouncy homage to thug love that featured the signature DC mix of urban grit and slick production".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1504044/destinys-childs-long-road-to-fame-the-song-isnt-called-survivor-for-nothing/|title=Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing)|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=2005-06-13|publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks|accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> Rashod Ollisong writing for ''The Baltimore Sun'' gave a more mixed review for the song, writing "It is catchy, but the beat is trite, and the lyrical message is downright trifling" before adding that it glorifies a "warped" image of black [[masculinity]] which he heavily criticized. He further argued that the group "should put more thought into their lyrics" due to the background and image each member created throughout their career.<ref name="baltimore" />

== Music video ==
[[File:IceCube Toronto2006.jpg|thumbnail|175px|Hip hop artist Ice Cube (''pictured'') is one of the artists that make a cameo appearance in the music video for "Soldier".]]
The [[music video]] for "Soldier" was filmed by Norwegian director [[Ray Kay]] and was shot in [[black-and-white]], becoming the band's first clip using that technique. It marked the first time the group worked with Kay. During an interview, they praised him for shooting the scenes in a fast and convenient way, further describing the experience as "wonderful".<ref name="vid" /> The video features cameo appearances by seven singers and rappers: Beyoncé's sister [[Solange Knowles]], [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]], [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Bow Wow]], [[Ginuwine]], [[Ice Cube]], [[WC (rapper)|WC]] and [[Young Jeezy]].<ref name="vid" /><ref name="vulture" />

The video opens with Destiny's Child walking between two rows of males intertwined with close-up shots of each member's face. T.I. appears rapping his part wearing a hat, sunglasses and chains. As the song progresses, the members are seen dancing along with the males in the background who also pose for the camera. During the middle of the video, the girls are seen walking with leashed dogs in their hands and Lil Wayne appears rapping his part afterwards. The camera focuses on each member during their solo part in the song as they perform a dance choreography and lip-sync the lyrics. During the end of the video, as the group sings the lines "known to carry big things", they rub the belly of Solange Knowles who was pregnant at the time of shooting.<ref name="vid" /> The clip ends with the girls holding the previously seen dogs in their hands. Throughout the visual, shots of three cars with different [[vehicle registration|registrations]] are shown&nbsp;– a [[Cadillac]] from Georgia with the words "Da Durty", another car from New York City with the words "BK Style" and a third car from California with the word "Crenshaw".
