'''Frank Enrico Pastore''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|s|t|ɔr|i}}; August 21, 1957 &ndash; December 17, 2012) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] player and radio host. He [[pitcher|pitched]] for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 1979 until 1985 and for the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1986, and was in the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] organization in 1987.

==Playing career==
Pastore was born in [[Alhambra, California]], and was valedictorian of the 1975 class of [[Damien High School]] in [[La Verne, California]].  That year, Pastore went to the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the amateur draft.<ref>Frank Pastore https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pastofr01.shtml</ref>  Pastore continued to be promoted within the organization, with an impressive 3.28 ERA in the minor leagues. He made his major league debut on April 4, 1979, at [[Riverfront Stadium]], pitching three scoreless innings in a loss to the [[San Francisco Giants]].<ref>Wednesday, April 4, 1979, Riverfront Stadium https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN197904040.shtml</ref> Used equally as a [[Relief pitcher|reliever]] and [[Starting pitcher|starter]] during his rookie season, he then moved full-time to the starting rotation in 1980.

Pastore's best statistical season came in 1980 with the Reds, as he posted a record of 13 - 7 with an [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 3.27 in 27 appearances.  Pastore was hit on the elbow with a batted ball on June 4, 1984.  That injury caused him to appear in only 41 games in the 1984 and 1985 seasons combined. He was then released by the Reds in 1986 following spring training.  However, Pastore quickly signed with the Minnesota Twins, and spent the entire season coming out of the bullpen.  Following the season, he signed with the Texas Rangers and was assigned to the AAA [[Oklahoma City 89ers]].  However, Pastore started four disappointing games with the team (compiling a 1-3 record and 8.46 ERA) before retiring.<ref>Frank Pastore https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=pastor001fra</ref>

==Later life==

After baseball, Pastore (a former [[Atheism|atheist]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bigger-than-life-christian-radio-personality-frank-pastore-dies-86838/|title='Bigger Than Life' Christian Radio Personality Frank Pastore Dies|work=[[The Christian Post]]|date=December 18, 2012|author=Alex Murashko}}</ref>) went back to school, graduating with a degree in business administration from [[National University (California)|National University]] in 1989. He then spent the next two years with the national leadership of Athletes in Action, the sports ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ. He then attended the [[Talbot School of Theology]] at [[Biola University]], graduating ''summa cum laude'' with an MA in philosophy of religion and ethics in 1994. In 2003, Pastore completed his second master's degree, in political philosophy and American government, from [[Claremont Graduate University|Claremont Graduate School]].<ref>[http://townhall.com/columnists/frankpastore/ townhall.com on Frank Pastore]</ref>

On January 5, 2004, Pastore became the host of ''The Frank Pastore Show'' on [[KKLA-FM]] in [[Los Angeles]], which became one of the largest Christian talk shows in the United States.<ref name=HollywoodReporter>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/frank-pastore-dies-motorcycle-accident-403765|title=Frank Pastore Dies After Motorcycle Accident He Predicted|author=Paul Bond|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2012-12-17|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>

In 2011, Pastore authored ''Shattered:  Struck Down, But Not Destroyed'',<ref>[http://www.tyndale.com/Frank-Pastore/bio Tyndale House on Frank Pastore]</ref> a book recounting how he became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] during recovery from his 1984 pitching arm injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecross-photo.com/A_Big-League_Skeptic_Finds_Faith_At_The_Cross.htm|title=A Big League Skeptic Finds Faith At The Cross (excerpt from Tim LaHaye's Power of the Cross)|author=Frank Pastore|year=1998|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref>

Pastore once held the record for the fastest time to finish eating the famous 72-oz steak dinner, "The Texas King", at [[the Big Texan Steak Ranch]]. Pastore's record of 9 minutes 30 seconds stood for 21 years, until being broken by [[Joey Chestnut]] in 2008.

==Death==

On November 19, 2012, during his radio show while discussing how his faith affects his view of death, Pastore said: 

<blockquote>...you guys know I ride a motorcycle, don’t you? So, at any moment, especially with the idiot people who cross the diamond lane into my lane, all right, without any blinkers -- not that I’m angry about it, but at any minute I could be spread out all over the 210 (Freeway).<ref>[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/12/18/mlb-player-turned-christian-radio-host-who-eerily-predicted-his-own-motorcycle-accident-dies-and-here-is-his-last-email-exchange-with-theblaze/ Radio Host Who Eerily Predicted His Own Motorcycle Accident Dies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815051550/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/12/18/mlb-player-turned-christian-radio-host-who-eerily-predicted-his-own-motorcycle-accident-dies-and-here-is-his-last-email-exchange-with-theblaze/ |date=2016-08-15 }} Retrieved 2016-05-12.</ref><ref>[http://drjamesdobson.org/popupplayer?broadcastId=c9eec73f-0352-4494-b5ee-199acb46b97e Podcast with Frank Pastore: When Life Throws You a Curve Ball] Retrieved 2016-05-12.</ref>

That same day, he was critically injured on the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill (210) Freeway]] in [[Duarte, California]], when a woman from [[Glendora, California]], driving a [[Hyundai Sonata]], collided with his [[Honda VTX Series|Honda VTX]] 1800, throwing him off the motorcycle. He was hospitalized in critical condition with serious head injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sgvtribune.com/2012/11/20/kkla-radio-personality-frank-pastore-injured-in-210-freeway-motorcycle-crash/|title=KKLA radio personality Frank Pastore injured in 210 Freeway motorcycle crash|author=Ruby Gonzales|publisher=The San Gabriel Valley Tribune|date=2012-11-20|accessdate=2019-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/ci_22192872|title=KKLA radio host Frank Pastore transferred to Upland hospital|publisher=DailyBulletin|date=2012-12-14|accessdate=2012-12-17}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
