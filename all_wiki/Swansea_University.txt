==History==
===Foundations===
[[File:Swansea University Foundation Stone.jpg|thumb|left|Swansea University foundation stone]]
The University College, Swansea, (as it was known then), was established in 1920, opening its doors on 5 October. At the time, it was the youngest of the four colleges of the University of Wales. It was established on the recommendations of a Royal Commission set up in 1916.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4101723/4101728/87/royal%20commission%20swansea|title=Welsh Newspapers Online ROYAL COMMISSION AT SWANSEA.{{!}}1916-06-23{{!}}The Cambria Daily Leader – Welsh Newspapers Online|website=newspapers.library.wales|access-date=28 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030808/http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4101723/4101728/87/royal%20commission%20swansea|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The college was founded on what were perceived as the needs and the wants of the local area, and Swansea's main industries in particular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4104815/4104818/61/university%20college%20swansea|title=Welsh Newspapers Online UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF SWANSEA. # IIu■•{{!}}1918-03-20{{!}}The Cambria Daily Leader – Welsh Newspapers Online|website=newspapers.library.wales|access-date=28 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044325/http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4104815/4104818/61/university%20college%20swansea|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Singleton.jpeg|thumb|Singleton Abbey]]

The Park Campus houses the oldest parts of the university's estate, including [[Singleton Abbey]], a large eighteenth-century mansion which was the ancestral home of the [[Vivian family]], having been bought by the prominent industrialist, [[John Henry Vivian]].

Swansea University's foundation stone was laid in 1920 by [[King George V]] in July 1920, welcoming 89 students, of whom eight were female.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.swansea.ac.uk/the-university/world-class/history/|title=History and heritage|website=swansea.ac.uk|access-date=30 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017202235/http://www.swansea.ac.uk/the-university/world-class/history/|archive-date=17 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Subjects taught from the beginning of the College were the Sciences, Mathematics, Metallurgy and Engineering.

The university was granted a coat of arms by the [[College of Heralds]] in 1921 with the motto ''Gweddw Crefft Heb Ei Dawn'', translated as ''Technical Skill is Bereft Without Culture.''<ref name=":0" />

Arts subjects were not taught immediately in 1920, but started in the following 'session', 1921–22. The first professors in those initial departments were D. Emrys Evans (Classics), W.D.

[[Saunders Lewis]], the well-known Welsh language writer and activist, became a member of staff in 1922 although he ran up against controversy in 1936/37 for trying to set fire to a Royal Air Force bombing school on the Llyn Peninsula. He was tried at the Old Bailey and sent to prison for nine months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-16130454|title=Saunders Lewis milestone debated|date=12 December 2011|work=BBC News|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104164759/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-16130454|archive-date=4 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

When Singleton Abbey and its surrounding land was handed to the college in 1923, Arts subjects were moved there from the College's temporary site in Mount Pleasant. Student numbers remained relatively small until the Second World War.

Swansea acquired departments of Philosophy 1925, German in 1931, economics in 1937, Social Policy in 1947, Political Theory and Government in 1954 – the same year that a civil engineering and a Geography department were added. In 1961 Swansea became a centre for Russian and East European Studies, whilst Italian and Spanish joined the Department of French.

There were many notable staff members at the University in the period, including the long-serving female professor of Botany, Florence Mockeridge.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LTSYePZvSXYC&q=Biographical+Dictionary+of+Women+in+Science+mockeridge&pg=PA906|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: L-Z|last1=Ogilvie|first1=Marilyn Bailey|last2=Harvey|first2=Joy Dorothy|author-link=Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie|author2-link=Joy Harvey|date=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780415920407|language=en|access-date=28 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000609/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LTSYePZvSXYC&pg=PA906&lpg=PA906&dq=Biographical+Dictionary+of+Women+in+Science+mockeridge&source=bl&ots=hQkaoRW47A&sig=Jl4BtLApwcfR9VcF-IB-MWwJN3o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-8uOg98fWAhUGJMAKHeECD7AQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&q=Biographical%20Dictionary%20of%20Women%20in%20Science%20mockeridge&f=false|archive-date=29 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Another was Professor Glanmor Williams (History) who retired in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/25/guardianobituaries.obituaries|title=Obituary: Sir Glanmor Williams|first=D.

===Post-war campus development===
In 1947, [[John Fulton, Baron Fulton]], the University Principal, had designs on creating the UK's first contained university campus. Located in the vast expanse of Singleton Park, the university only had 2 permanent buildings; Singleton Abbey and the library.

The 1960s saw the university embark on a large campus development programme, aiming to fulfill Fulton's plan of becoming a self-contained community within the city. Along with new halls of residence, a Maths and Science Tower was built, with College House – later renamed Fulton House.<ref name=":0" />

==Campus==
[[File:Great Hall at Swansea University Bay Campus.jpg|thumb|Great Hall at Swansea University Bay Campus]]
For most of its history, Swansea University operated exclusively from the [[Singleton Park]] Campus. However, owing to rapid expansion, the university developed a 65-acre, £450&nbsp;million beachfront science and innovation Bay Campus which opened in September 2015. Since 2015, Swansea University has operated as a dual-campus university with the 'Park Campus' located in its traditional Singleton Park grounds, and the Bay Campus, at Crymlyn Burrows.

The Bay campus has been developed on a 65-acre beachfront site between Fabian Way and Jersey Marine beach at Crymlyn Burrows. It initially houses the College of Engineering and School of Management, a Great Hall seating 800, a library offering views over a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and student accommodation. Projects moving on to campus include the UK's first Energy Safety Research Institute, and the Institute of Structural Materials, home to the University Technology Centre for Rolls Royce materials testing.

===Sports===

Swansea University's £20&nbsp;million International Sports Village is five minutes' walk from the Singleton Park campus on the western side of [[Sketty]] Lane. It has an eight-lane track, six-lane indoor track and training centre, floodlit playing fields including rugby, football, lacrosse and cricket pitches, two artificial hockey pitches, a sports hall, tennis and squash courts, a climbing wall and spin room. The University also owns training pitches in the north of the city, in [[Fairwood, Swansea|Fairwood]], which it has developed alongside [[Swansea City A.F.C.]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Teamwork – Swansea City FC and University sign deal for training facility|url = http://www.swansea.ac.uk/media-centre/news-archive/2012/teamwork-swanseacityfcanduniversitysigndealfortrainingfacility.php|website = swansea.ac.uk|access-date = 17 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151118222654/http://www.swansea.ac.uk/media-centre/news-archive/2012/teamwork-swanseacityfcanduniversitysigndealfortrainingfacility.php|archive-date = 18 November 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

==Organisation and administration==

===Governance===
[[File:Building in Swansea University - geograph.org.uk - 893505.jpg|thumb|Singleton Abbey, the administrative building of the University]]

Swansea received its [[royal charter]] in 1920 and like many universities is governed by its [[constitution]] that is set out in its [[statutes]] and a [[charter]]. The governing body of Swansea University is its Council, which is supported by the Senate and the Court.
* '''The Council''' consists of 29 members including the Chancellor, Pro-chancellors, Vice-chancellor, Treasurer, Pro-vice-chancellors, staff and student members, city council representation and a majority of lay members.  The council is responsible for all of the University's activities and has a well-developed committee structure to help discharge its powers and duties.
* '''The Senate''' is the main academic body of the university and is responsible for teaching and research. Most of its 200 members are academics but it also includes representatives of the Students' Union and the [[Athletic Union]]. The Senate is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, who is the head of the university both academically and administratively. 
* '''The Court''' consists of more than 300 members representing [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] from local to national institutions. It meets annually to discuss the university's annual report, its financial statements and issues in [[higher education]].
