'''Federal elections''' were held in [[Germany]] on 2 December 1990 to elect the members of the 12th [[Bundestag]]. This was the first all-German election since the [[Elections in Nazi Germany|Nazi show election]] in [[1938 German parliamentary election and referendum|April 1938]], the first multi-party all-German election since that of [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933]], which was held after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] and was subject to widespread suppression, and the first free and fair all-German election since [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932]]. The result was a comprehensive victory for the governing coalition of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], which was reelected to a third term.

==Issues and campaign==

This was the first election conducted after [[German reunification]] which took place on 3 October.  Almost 150 seats had been added to represent the newly re-established [[New states of Germany|eastern states]] of Germany without reducing the number of Western members. The euphoria following the reunification gave the ruling CDU/CSU–FDP coalition a dramatic advantage in both Western and Eastern Germany throughout the campaign.

This was the one and only election for which the 5% threshold was not applied nationwide, but separately for [[East Germany]] (including [[East Berlin]]) and [[West Germany]] (including [[West Berlin]]). As a result, while the Western [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]] failed to gain representation, an ideologically similar party from the East, [[Alliance 90]], did. They merged to form [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] in 1993.

==Post-election==
The governing CDU/CSU-FDP coalition was returned to office with a landslide majority, and [[Helmut Kohl]] remained [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]].  The CDU did exceptionally well in the former East Germany, which had been the heartland of the SPD before the Nazi era.
