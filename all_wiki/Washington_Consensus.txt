The '''Washington Consensus''' is a set of ten economic policy prescriptions considered to constitute the "standard" reform package promoted for [[Economic crisis|crisis-wracked]] [[developing country|developing countries]] by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] and [[United States Department of the Treasury]].<ref name="piie.com">Williamson, John: [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/what-washington-means-policy-reform "What Washington Means by Policy Reform"], in: Williamson, John (ed.): ''Latin American Readjustment: How Much has Happened'', Washington: [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] 1989.</ref> The term was first used in 1989 by English economist [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/washington.html|title=Washington Consensus|date=April 2003|publisher=Center for International Development {{!}} Harvard Kennedy School of Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715151421/http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidtrade/issues/washington.html|archive-date=2017-07-15|url-status=dead|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The prescriptions encompassed policies in such areas as macroeconomic stabilization, economic opening with respect to both trade and investment, and the expansion of market forces within the domestic economy.

Subsequent to Williamson's use of the terminology, and despite his emphatic opposition, the phrase Washington Consensus has come to be used fairly widely in a second, broader sense, to refer to a more general orientation towards a strongly market-based approach (sometimes described as [[market fundamentalism]] or [[neoliberalism]]). In emphasizing the magnitude of the difference between the two alternative definitions, Williamson has argued (see {{section link||Origins of policy agenda}} and {{section link||Broad sense}} below) that his ten original, narrowly defined prescriptions have largely acquired the status of "motherhood and apple pie" (i.e., are broadly taken for granted), whereas the subsequent broader definition, representing a form of neoliberal manifesto, "never enjoyed a consensus [in Washington] or anywhere much else" and can reasonably be said to be dead.

Discussion of the Washington Consensus has long been contentious. Partly this reflects a lack of agreement over what is meant by the term, but there are also substantive differences over the merits and consequences of the policy prescriptions involved. Some critics take issue with the original Consensus's emphasis on the opening of developing countries to global markets, and/or with what they see as an excessive focus on strengthening the influence of domestic market forces, arguably at the expense of key functions of the state. For other commentators, the issue is more what is ''missing'', including such areas as institution-building and targeted efforts to improve opportunities for the weakest in society.

==History==

===Original sense: Williamson's Ten Points===
The concept and name of the Washington Consensus were first presented in 1989 by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]], an economist from the [[Institute for International Economics]], an international economic [[think tank]] based in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |title=A Guide To John Williamson's Writing |last1=Williamson |first1=John |website=www.piie.com |publisher=[[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] |access-date=April 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705172400/http://www.iie.com/content/?ID=1#topic3 |archive-date=July 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Williamson used the term to summarize commonly shared themes among policy advice by Washington-based institutions at the time, such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department, which were believed to be necessary for the recovery of countries in Latin America from the economic and financial crises of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The consensus as originally stated by Williamson included ten broad sets of relatively specific policy recommendations:<ref name="piie.com"/>
# [[Fiscal policy]] discipline, with avoidance of large fiscal deficits relative to GDP;
# Redirection of public spending from subsidies ("especially indiscriminate subsidies") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment;
# [[Tax reform]], broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates;
# [[Interest rate]]s that are market determined and positive (but moderate) in real terms;
# Competitive [[exchange rate]]s;
# [[Trade liberalization]]: liberalization of imports, with particular emphasis on elimination of quantitative restrictions (licensing, etc.); any trade protection to be provided by low and relatively uniform [[tariff]]s;
# Liberalization of inward [[foreign direct investment]];
# [[Privatization]] of [[State-owned enterprise|state enterprise]]s;
# [[Deregulation]]: abolition of regulations that impede market entry or restrict competition, except for those justified on safety, environmental and consumer protection grounds, and prudential oversight of [[financial institution]]s;
# Legal security for [[property right]]s.

===Origins of policy agenda===
Although Williamson's label of the ''Washington'' Consensus draws attention to the role of the Washington-based agencies in promoting the above agenda, a number of authors have stressed that Latin American policy-makers arrived at their own packages of policy reforms primarily based on their own analysis of their countries' situations. Thus, according to [[Joseph Stanislaw]] and [[Daniel Yergin]], authors of ''[[The Commanding Heights]]'', the policy prescriptions described in the Washington Consensus were "developed in Latin America, by Latin Americans, in response to what was happening both within and outside the region."<ref name="Yergin and Stanislaw">{{cite book|last1=Yergin|first1=Daniel|last2=Stanislaw|first2=Joseph|author-link1=Daniel Yergin|author-link2=Joseph Stanislaw|title=The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|date=2002|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780743229630|page=[https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_1/page/237 237]|url=https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_1|url-access=registration|access-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Joseph Stiglitz has written that "the Washington Consensus policies were designed to respond to the very real problems in Latin America and made considerable sense" (though Stiglitz has at times been an outspoken critic of IMF policies as applied to developing nations).<ref>Joseph Stiglitz, ''Globalization and its Discontents'' (2002), p. 53.</ref> In view of the implication conveyed by the term Washington Consensus that the policies were largely external in origin, Stanislaw and Yergin report that the term's creator, John Williamson, has "regretted the term ever since", stating "it is difficult to think of a less diplomatic label."<ref name="Yergin and Stanislaw"/>

A 2010 paper by [[Nancy Birdsall]], [[Augusto de la Torre]], and [[Felipe Valencia Caicedo]] likewise suggests that the policies in the original consensus were largely a creation of Latin American politicians and technocrats, with Williamson's role having been to gather the ten points in one place for the first time, rather than to "create" the package of policies.<ref name = "damaged">{{cite web

In Williamson's own words from 2002:

{{quote|<poem>It is difficult even for the creator of the term to deny that the phrase "Washington Consensus" is a damaged brand name (Naím 2002). Audiences the world over seem to believe that this signifies a set of neoliberal policies that have been imposed on hapless countries by the Washington-based international financial institutions and have led them to crisis and misery. There are people who cannot utter the term without foaming at the mouth.

My own view is of course quite different. The basic ideas that I attempted to summarize in the Washington Consensus have continued to gain wider acceptance over the past decade, to the point where [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] has had to endorse most of them in order to be electable. For the most part they are motherhood and apple pie, which is why they commanded a consensus.<ref name=Williamson2002/></poem>}}

===Broad sense===
Williamson recognizes that the term has commonly been used with a different meaning from his original prescription; he opposes the alternative use of the term, which became common after his initial formulation, to cover a broader market fundamentalism or "[[neoliberal]]" agenda.<ref>Moisés Naím, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/Naim.HTM ''Fads and Fashion in Economic Reforms: Washington Consensus or Washington Confusion?'']. October 26, 1999.</ref>

{{quote|I of course never intended my term to imply policies like capital account liberalization (...I quite consciously excluded that), [[monetarism]], [[supply-side economics]], or a minimal state (getting the state out of welfare provision and income redistribution), which I think of as the quintessentially neoliberal ideas.  If that is how the term is interpreted, then we can all enjoy its wake, although let us at least have the decency to recognize that these ideas have rarely dominated thought in Washington and certainly never commanded a consensus there or anywhere much else...<ref name=Williamson2002/>}}

More specifically, Williamson argues that the first three of his ten prescriptions are uncontroversial in the economic community, while recognizing that the others have evoked some controversy. He argues that one of the least controversial prescriptions, the redirection of spending to infrastructure, health care, and education, has often been neglected. He also argues that, while the prescriptions were focused on reducing certain functions of government (e.g., as an owner of productive enterprises), they would also strengthen government's ability to undertake other actions such as supporting education and health. Williamson says that he does not endorse market fundamentalism, and believes that the Consensus prescriptions, if implemented correctly, would benefit the poor.<ref name=Williamson2000 /> In a book edited with Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski in 2003, Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, "second-generation" reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues.{{sfn|Williamson|2003}}

As noted, in spite of Williamson's reservations, the term Washington Consensus has been used more broadly to describe the general shift towards free market policies that followed the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] in the 1970s. In this broad sense the Washington Consensus is sometimes considered to have begun at about 1980.<ref name = "GPE">{{Cite book

Many commentators see the consensus, especially if interpreted in the broader sense of the term, as having been at its strongest during the 1990s. Some have argued that the consensus in this sense ended at the turn of the century, or at least that it became less influential after about the year 2000.<ref name = "damaged"/><ref>{{cite web

More commonly, commentators have suggested that the Consensus in its broader sense survived until the time of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 global financial crisis]].<ref name = "return"/>
Following the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|strong intervention]] undertaken by governments in response to market failures, a number of journalists, politicians and senior officials from global institutions such as the World Bank began saying that the Washington Consensus was dead.<ref>{{cite news

=== Impact ===
According to a 2020 study, the implementation of policies associated with the Washington Consensus significantly raised real GDP per capita over a 5- to 10-year horizon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grier|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Grier|first2=Robin M.|date=2020-09-08|title=The Washington Consensus Works: Causal Effects of Reform, 1970-2015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300639|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.jce.2020.09.001|issn=0147-5967}}</ref>

==Context==
Many countries have endeavored to implement varying components of the reform packages, with implementation sometimes imposed as a condition for receiving loans from the IMF and World Bank.<ref name = "GPE"/> The results of these reforms are much debated. Some critics focus on claims that the reforms led to destabilization.<ref>{{cite book |title=Development and Disorder: A History of the Third World since 1945 |last=Mason |first=Mike |year=1997 |publisher=University Press of New England |location=Hanover |isbn=0-87451-829-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/developmentdisor0000maso_m7r9/page/428 428] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/developmentdisor0000maso_m7r9/page/428 }}</ref> Some critics have also blamed the Washington Consensus for particular economic crises such as the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentine economic crisis]], and for exacerbating Latin America's economic inequalities.{{citation needed|reason=Who?|date=December 2014}} Criticism of the Washington Consensus has often been dismissed as socialism and/or [[anti-globalism]]. While these philosophies do criticize these policies, general criticism of the economics of the consensus is now more widely established, such as that outlined by US scholar [[Dani Rodrik]], Professor of International Political Economy at [[Harvard University]], in his paper ''Goodbye Washington Consensus, Hello Washington Confusion?''.<ref name="PRIVATISEb"/>

Williamson has summarized the overall results on growth, employment and [[poverty reduction]] in many countries as "disappointing, to say the least".  He attributes this limited impact to three factors: (a) the Consensus ''per se'' placed no special emphasis on mechanisms for avoiding economic crises, which have proved very damaging; (b) the reforms—both those listed in his article and, ''a fortiori'', those actually implemented—were incomplete; and (c) the reforms cited were insufficiently ambitious with respect to targeting improvements in income distribution, and need to be complemented by stronger efforts in this direction. Rather than an argument for abandoning the original ten prescriptions, though, Williamson concludes that they are "motherhood and apple pie" and "not worth debating".<ref name=Williamson2002>Williamson J. (2002). [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/did-washington-consensus-fail ''Did the Washington Consensus Fail?'']</ref> Both Williamson and other analysts have pointed to longer term improvements in economic performance in a number of countries that have adopted the relevant policy changes consistently, such as Chile (below).

As Williamson has pointed out, the term has come to be used in a broader sense to its original intention, as a synonym for market fundamentalism or neo-liberalism. In this broader sense, Williamson states, it has been criticized by people such as [[George Soros]] and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[List of Nobel laureates|Laureate]] [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]].<ref name=Williamson2000>Williamson J. (2000). [https://piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/what-should-world-bank-think-about-washington-consensus ''What Should the Bank Think about the Washington Consensus?''].</ref> The Washington Consensus is also criticized by others such as some Latin American politicians and [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] such as [[Erik Reinert]].<ref name=Reinert2000>Reinert, Erik S.

While opinion varies among economists, Rodrik pointed out what he claimed was a factual paradox: while China and India increased their economies' reliance on free market forces to a limited extent, their general economic policies remained the exact opposite to the Washington Consensus' main recommendations. Both had high levels of [[protectionism]], no [[privatization]], extensive industrial policies planning, and lax fiscal and financial policies through the 1990s. Had they been dismal failures they would have presented strong evidence in support of the recommended Washington Consensus policies. However they turned out to be successes.<ref name=PRIVATISEz>{{harvnb | Rodrik|2006| pp= 3–5}}</ref> According to Rodrik: "While the lessons drawn by proponents and skeptics differ, it is fair to say that nobody really believes in the Washington Consensus anymore. The question now is not whether the Washington Consensus is dead or alive; it is what will replace it".<ref name="PRIVATISEb"/>

Rodrik's account of Chinese or Indian policies during the period is not universally accepted. Among other things those policies involved major turns in the direction of greater reliance upon market forces, both domestically and internationally.<ref>An overview of the origins of the Chinese reforms and their implementation over roughly the first decade of the reforms is provided by Harry Harding in ''China's Second Revolution: Reform after Mao''.  Brookings, 1987.</ref>

In a book edited with [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] in 2003, John Williamson laid out an expanded reform agenda, emphasizing crisis-proofing of economies, "second-generation" reforms, and policies addressing inequality and social issues.{{sfn|Williamson|2003}}

Speaking at a fundraiser for the [[James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy]] in November 2018, [[Barack Obama]] acknowledged that globalization and the policies associated with the Washington Consensus exacerbated [[economic inequality]] which helped fuel the rise of the [[alt-right]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Norton |first=Ben |date= December 21, 2018|title=Obama Admits Bipartisan Capitalist 'Washington Consensus' Fueled Far-Right & Multiplied Inequality|url=https://therealnews.com/stories/obama-admits-bipartisan-capitalist-washington-consensus-fueled-far-right-multiplied-inequality|work=[[The Real News]] |access-date=December 31, 2018 }}</ref>

==Macroeconomic adjustment==
The widespread adoption by governments of the Washington Consensus was to a large degree a reaction to the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] crisis that hit much of Latin America, and some other developing regions, during the 1980s.  The crisis had multiple origins: the drastic rise in the price of imported oil following the emergence of [[OPEC]], mounting levels of external debt, the rise in US (and hence international) interest rates, and—consequent to the foregoing problems—loss of access to additional foreign credit. The import-substitution policies that had been pursued by many developing country governments in Latin America and elsewhere for several decades had left their economies ill-equipped to expand exports at all quickly to pay for the additional cost of imported oil (by contrast, many countries in East Asia, which had followed more [[export-oriented industrialization|export-oriented strategies]], found it comparatively easy to expand exports still further, and as such managed to accommodate the external shocks with much less economic and social disruption). Unable either to expand external borrowing further or to ramp up export earnings easily, many Latin American countries faced no obvious sustainable alternatives to reducing overall domestic demand via greater fiscal discipline, while in parallel adopting policies to reduce protectionism and increase their economies' export orientation.<ref>See e.g., Patrice Franko, "The Puzzle of Latin American Development" (3rd edition, 2007), or Michael Read, "Forgotten Continent" (2007).</ref>

==Criticism==
As of the 2000s, several Latin American countries were led by socialist or other left wing governments, some of which—including Argentina and Venezuela—have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus policies. Other Latin American countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, in practice adopted the bulk of the policies included in Williamson's list, even though they criticized the market fundamentalism that these are often associated with. 

Some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], have challenged what are sometimes described as the 'fundamentalist' policies of the IMF and the [[US Treasury]] for what Stiglitz calls a 'one size fits all' treatment of individual economies. According to Stiglitz the treatment suggested by the IMF is too simple: one dose, and fast—stabilize, liberalize and privatize, without prioritizing or watching for side effects.<ref name=CHALLENGING>{{Cite journal |jstor = 24590462|title = Challenging the Washington Consensus|last1 = Stiglitz|first1 = Joseph|last2 = Schoenfelder|first2 = Lindsey|journal = The Brown Journal of World Affairs|year = 2003|volume = 9|issue = 2|pages = 33–40|url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org:80/bjwa/archive/9.2/Feature/stiglitz.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030828054917/http://www.watsoninstitute.org:80/bjwa/archive/9.2/Feature/stiglitz.pdf|archive-date = August 28, 2003}}</ref>{{quote |The reforms did not always work out the way they were intended. While growth generally improved across much of Latin America, it was in most countries less than the reformers had originally hoped for (and the "transition crisis", as noted above deeper and more sustained than hoped for in some of the former socialist economies). Success stories in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s were relatively few and far in between, and market-oriented reforms by themselves offered no formula to deal with the growing public health emergency in which the continent became embroiled. The critics, meanwhile, argue that the disappointing outcomes have vindicated their concerns about the inappropriateness of the standard reform agenda.<ref name=BELOW>{{harvnb | Rodrik|2006| p=2}}</ref>}}

Besides the excessive belief in market fundamentalism and international economic institutions in attributing the failure of the Washington consensus, Stiglitz provided a further explanation about why it failed. In his article "The Post Washington Consensus Consensus",<ref name="policydialogue.org">{{cite web |url=http://policydialogue.org/files/events/Stiglitz_Post_Washington_Consensus_Paper.pdf |title=The Post Washington Consensus Consensus |author=Joseph Stiglitz |website=policydialogue.org |publisher=The Initiative for Policy Dialogue |access-date=April 24, 2015|author-link=Joseph Stiglitz }}</ref> he claims that the Washington consensus policies failed to efficiently handle the economic structures within developing countries. The cases of East Asian countries such as Korea and Taiwan are known as a success story in which their remarkable economic growth was attributed to a larger role of the government by undertaking [[industrial policies]] and increasing domestic savings within their territory. From the cases, the role for government was proven to be critical at the beginning stage of the dynamic process of development, at least until the markets by themselves can produce efficient outcomes.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The critique laid out in the World Bank's study ''Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform'' (2005)<ref>World Bank. ''Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform'' Washington, D.C., 2005.</ref> shows how far discussion has come from the original ideas of the Washington Consensus. Gobind Nankani, a former vice-president for Africa at the World Bank, wrote in the preface: "there is no unique universal set of rules.... [W]e need to get away from formulae and the search for elusive 'best practices'...." (p. xiii). The World Bank's new emphasis is on the need for humility, for policy diversity, for selective and modest reforms, and for experimentation.<ref name=CRITIQUEWB>World Bank, Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform, Washington, D.C., 2005</ref>

The World Bank's report ''Learning from Reform'' shows some of the developments of the 1990s. There was a deep and prolonged collapse in output in some (though by no means all) countries making the transition from [[communism]] to market economies (many of the Central and East European countries, by contrast, made the adjustment relatively rapidly). Academic studies show that more than two decades into the transition, some of the former communist countries, especially parts of the former Soviet Union, had still not caught up to their levels of output before 1989.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=63 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

There were several successive and painful financial crises in Latin America, East Asia, Russia, and Turkey. The Latin American recovery in the first half of the 1990s was interrupted by crises later in the decade. There was less growth in per capita GDP in Latin America than in the period of rapid post-War expansion and opening in the world economy, 1950–80. [[Argentina]], described by some as "the poster boy of the Latin American economic revolution",<ref name=BELOWb>{{harvnb | Rodrik|2006| pp= 3–4}}</ref> came crashing down in 2002.<ref name="CRITIQUEWB"/>

A significant body of economists and policy-makers argues that what was wrong with the Washington Consensus as originally formulated by Williamson had less to do with what was ''included'' than with what was ''missing''.<ref>See, as examples representative of a much more extensive literature, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre. ''Washington Contentious'' (2003); {{harvtxt|Kuczynski|Williamson|2003}}.</ref> This view asserts that countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, largely governed by parties of the left in recent years, did not—whatever their rhetoric—in practice abandon most of the substantive elements of the Consensus. Countries that have achieved macroeconomic stability through fiscal and monetary discipline have been loath to abandon it: Lula, the former President of Brazil (and former leader of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party of Brazil]]), has stated explicitly that the defeat of [[hyperinflation]]<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20040518120408/http://www.econ.puc-rio.br/gfranco/How%20Brazil%20Beat%20Hyperinflation.htm</ref> was among the most important positive contributions of the years of his presidency to the welfare of the country's poor, although the remaining influence of his policies on tackling poverty and maintaining a steady low rate of inflation are being discussed and doubted in the wake of the Brazilian Economic Crisis currently occurring in Brazil.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/imf-says-brazil-economy-to-shrink-3-in-2015-on-political-crisis</ref>

These economists and policy-makers would, however, overwhelmingly agree that the Washington Consensus was ''incomplete'', and that countries in Latin America and elsewhere need to move beyond "first generation" macroeconomic and trade reforms to a stronger focus on [[productivity]]-boosting reforms and direct programs to support the poor.<ref>See, e.g., Birdsall and de la Torre, ''Washington Contentious'' (2003); de Ferranti and Ody, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060809014850/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/20060803.pdf ''Key Economic and Social Challenges for Latin America''] (2006):</ref> This includes improving the investment climate and eliminating [[red tape]] (especially for smaller firms), strengthening institutions (in areas like justice systems), fighting poverty directly via the types of [[Conditional Cash Transfer]] programs adopted by countries like Mexico and Brazil, improving the quality of primary and secondary education, boosting countries' effectiveness at developing and absorbing technology, and addressing the special needs of historically disadvantaged groups including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-descendant]] populations across Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Anti-globalization movement===
Many critics of [[trade liberalization]], such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], and [[Naomi Klein]], see the Washington Consensus as a way to open the [[labor market]] of underdeveloped economies to exploitation by companies from more developed economies. The prescribed reductions in tariffs and other [[trade barrier]]s allow the free movement of goods across borders according to [[market forces]], but labor is not permitted to move freely due to the requirements of a [[Visa (document)|visa]] or a work permit. This creates an economic climate where goods are manufactured using cheap labor in underdeveloped economies and then exported to rich First World economies for sale at what the critics argue are huge markups, with the balance of the markup said to accrue to large multinational corporations. The criticism is that workers in the [[Third World]] economy nevertheless remain poor, as any pay raises they may have received over what they made before trade liberalization are said to be offset by inflation, whereas workers in the First World country become unemployed, while the wealthy owners of the multinational grow even more wealthy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Profit over people: neoliberalism and global order|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|date=1999|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781888363821|oclc=39505718}}</ref>

Despite macroeconomic advances, poverty and inequality remain at high levels in Latin America. About one of every three people—165&nbsp;million in total—still live on less than $2 a day. Roughly a third of the population has no access to electricity or basic sanitation, and an estimated 10 million children suffer from malnutrition. These problems are not, however, new: Latin America was the most economically unequal region in the world in 1950, and has continued to be so ever since, during periods both of state-directed import-substitution and (subsequently) of market-oriented liberalization.<ref>Michael Read, "Forgotten Continent" (2007), page 156.</ref>

Some socialist political leaders in Latin America have been vocal and well-known critics of the Washington Consensus, such as the late Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], Cuban ex-President [[Fidel Castro]], Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]], and [[Rafael Correa]], President of [[Ecuador]]. In Argentina, too, the recent [[Justicialist Party]] government of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] undertook policy measures which represented a repudiation of at least some Consensus policies.<ref>Charlie Devereux and Raymond Colitt, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-07/venezuelans-quality-of-life-improved-in-un-index-under-chavez.html Venezuelans’ Quality of Life Improved in UN Index Under Chavez.] Bloomberg News May 7, 2013.</ref>

===Proponents of the "European model" and the "Asian way"===
Some European and Asian economists suggest that "infrastructure-savvy economies" such as [[Norway]], Singapore, and China have partially rejected the underlying Neoclassical "financial orthodoxy" that characterizes the Washington Consensus, instead initiating a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] development path of their own<ref>{{in lang|en}} {{Citation |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/op-ed/2799/forecasting-the-future-the-brics-and-the-china-model.html |access-date=2011-03-09 |title=see M.

==Argentina==
{{See also|1998–2002 Argentine great depression|Argentine debt restructuring}}
The [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|Argentine economic crisis of 1999–2002]] is often held out as an example of the economic devastation said by some to have been wrought by application of the Washington Consensus. Argentina's former Deputy Foreign Minister [[Jorge Taiana]], in an interview with the state news agency [[Télam]] on August 16, 2005, attacked the Washington Consensus. There never was a real consensus for such policies, he said, and today "a good number of governments of the hemisphere are reviewing the assumptions with which they applied those policies in the 1990s", adding that governments are looking for a development model to guarantee productive employment and the generation of real wealth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telam.com.ar/especial_xx04.asp |title=Télam – Agencia Nacional de Noticias de la República Argentina |publisher=Telam.com.ar |date=January 1, 1980 |access-date=2012-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023004357/http://www.telam.com.ar/especial_xx04.asp |archive-date=October 23, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Many economists, however, challenge the view that Argentina's failure can be attributed to close adherence to the Washington Consensus. The country's adoption of an idiosyncratic fixed exchange rate regime (the [[convertibility plan]]), which became increasingly uncompetitive, together with its failure to achieve effective control over its fiscal accounts, both ran counter to central provisions of the Consensus, and paved the way directly for the ultimate macroeconomic collapse. The market-oriented policies of the early Menem-Cavallo years, meanwhile, soon petered out in the face of domestic political constraints (including Menem's preoccupation with securing re-election).<ref>See, e.g., Perry and Serven, "The Anatomy of a Multiple Crisis" (2003); Mussa, "Argentina and the Fund" (2002); Blustein, "And the Money Kept Flowing In.... and Out" (2005).</ref>

The problems which arise with reliance on a fixed exchange rate mechanism (above) are discussed in the World Bank report ''Economic Growth in the 1990s: Learning from a Decade of Reform'', which questions whether expectations can be "positively affected by tying a government's hands". In the early 1990s there was a point of view that countries should move to either fixed or completely flexible exchange rates to reassure market participants of the complete removal of government discretion in foreign exchange matters. After the Argentina collapse, some observers believe that removing government discretion by creating mechanisms that impose large penalties may, on the contrary, actually itself undermine expectations. Velasco and Neut (2003)<ref name=VELASCONEUT>{{Cite journal | doi=10.3386/w9932 |title = Tough Policies, Incredible Policies?|year = 2003|last1 = Velasco|first1 = Andres|last2 = Neut|first2 = Alejandro|s2cid = 6764956|doi-access = free}} NBER Working Paper No. 9932.

[[Mark Weisbrot]] says that, in more recent years, Argentina under former President [[Néstor Kirchner]] made a break with the Consensus and that this led to a significant improvement in its economy; some add that Ecuador may soon follow suit.<ref>Weisbrot, Mark, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/opinion/28iht-edweis.4038361.html "Doing it their own way,"] ''International Herald Tribune'', December 28, 2006</ref> However, while Kirchner's reliance on price controls and similar administrative measures (often aimed primarily at ''foreign-invested'' firms such as utilities) clearly ran counter to the spirit of the Consensus, his administration in fact ran an extremely tight fiscal ship and maintained a highly competitive floating exchange rate; Argentina's immediate bounce-back from crisis, further aided by abrogating its debts and a fortuitous boom in prices of primary commodities, leaves open issues of longer-term sustainability.<ref>[http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/papers/mussa0406.pdf Global Economic Prospects 2006/2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Subsidies for agriculture==
The Washington Consensus as formulated by Williamson includes provision for the redirection of [[public spending]] from subsidies ("especially indiscriminate subsidies") toward broad-based provision of key pro-growth, pro-poor services like primary education, [[primary health care]] and infrastructure investment.  This definition leaves some room for debate over specific public spending programs. One area of public controversy has focused on the issues of subsidies to farmers for fertilizers and other modern farm inputs: on the one hand, these can be criticized as subsidies, on the other, it may be argued that they generate positive externalities that might justify the subsidy involved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some critics of the Washington Consensus cite Malawi's experience with [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], for example, as exemplifying perceived flaws in the package's prescriptions. For decades, the World Bank and donor nations pressed [[Malawi]], a predominantly rural country in Africa, to cut back or eliminate government fertilizer subsidies to farmers. World Bank experts also urged the country to have Malawi farmers shift to growing cash crops for export and to use foreign exchange earnings to import food.<ref name="nytimes.com">New York Times, 2007 December 2, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?em&ex=1196744400&en=8dc6209db5ec0efe&ei=5087%0A Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts]"</ref> For years, Malawi hovered on the brink of famine; after a particularly disastrous corn harvest in 2005, almost five million of its 13 million people needed emergency food aid. Malawi's newly elected president [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] then decided to reverse policy. Introduction of deep fertilizer subsidies (and lesser ones for seed), abetted by good rains, helped farmers produce record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007; according to government reports, corn production leapt from 1.2&nbsp;million metric tons in 2005 to 2.7&nbsp;million in 2006 and 3.4&nbsp;million in 2007.  The prevalence of acute child hunger has fallen sharply and Malawi recently turned away emergency food aid.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In a commentary on the Malawi experience prepared for the [[Center for Global Development]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cgdev.org/blog/value-rejecting-expert-advice |title=Global Development: Views from the Center: The Value of Rejecting Expert Advice |author=Vijaya Ramachandran |date=July 7, 2012 |website=cgdev.org |publisher=Center for Global Development |access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref> development economists Vijaya Ramachandran and Peter Timmer argue that fertilizer subsidies in parts of Africa (and Indonesia) can have benefits that substantially exceed their costs. They caution, however, that how the subsidy is operated is crucial to its long-term success, and warn against allowing fertilizer distribution to become a monopoly.  Ramachandran and Timmer also stress that African farmers need more than just input subsidies—they need better research to develop new inputs and new seeds, as well as better transport and energy infrastructure. The World Bank reportedly now sometimes supports the temporary use of fertilizer subsidies aimed at the poor and carried out in a way that fosters private markets: "In Malawi, Bank officials say they generally support Malawi's policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out".<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

==Alternative usage vis-à-vis foreign policy==
In early 2008, the term "Washington Consensus" was used in a different sense as a metric for analyzing American [[mainstream media]] coverage of U.S. [[foreign policy]] generally and Middle East policy specifically. Marda Dunsky writes, "Time and again, with exceedingly rare exceptions, the media repeat without question, and fail to challenge the "Washington consensus"—the official mind-set of US governments on Middle East peacemaking over time."<ref>Marda Dunsky, ''Pens and Swords: How the Mainstream Media Report the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict'', 2008, [[Columbia University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-231-13349-4}}, p.36</ref> According to syndicated columnist [[William Pfaff]], Beltway centrism in American mainstream media coverage of foreign affairs is the rule rather than the exception: "Coverage of international affairs in the US is almost entirely Washington-driven. That is, the questions asked about foreign affairs are Washington's questions, framed in terms of domestic politics and established policy positions. This invites uninformative answers and discourages unwanted or unpleasant views."<ref>Vicki O'Hara, Reaction to the Greater Middle East Initiative, which encourages democracy in Arab countries, [[NPR]]/[[Morning Edition]], March 23, 2004</ref> Like the economic discussion above the foreign policy usage of the term has less to do with what is included than with what is missing.

A similar view, though by a different name, is taken by [[Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR), a progressive media criticism organization. They note "Official Agendas" as one of nine 'issue areas'<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=101 What's Wrong With the News?] fair.org</ref> they view as causing 'What's Wrong With the News?" They note: "Despite the claims that the press has an adversarial relationship with the government, in truth U.S. media generally follow Washington's official line. This is particularly obvious in wartime and in foreign policy coverage, but even with domestic controversies, the spectrum of debate usually falls in the relatively narrow range between the leadership of the Democratic and Republican parties."<ref>[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=7&issue_area_id=36 Issue Area: Official Agendas] fair.org</ref>
