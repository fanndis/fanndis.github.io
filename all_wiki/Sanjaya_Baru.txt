{{main|The Accidental Prime Minister}}

In April 2014, [[Penguin India]] published ''[[The Accidental Prime Minister]]'', Baru's tell-all memoir about his time at the [[Prime Minister's Office (India)|Prime Minister's Office]]. In it, Baru alleges that the prime minister was completely subservient to [[Congress President]] [[Sonia Gandhi]], who wielded significant influence in the running of the Singh administration, including the PMO itself. The book sparked off a controversy, with the office officially denouncing it as "fiction".<ref name=guardian>Anu Anand.
