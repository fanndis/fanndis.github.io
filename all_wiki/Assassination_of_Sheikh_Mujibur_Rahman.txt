The first [[president of Bangladesh]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] (also known as Sheikh Mujib, Bangabandhu or just Mujib) and most of his family were killed during the early hours of 15 August 1975, when a group of young [[Bangladesh Army]] personnel went into his residence and assassinated Sheikh Mujib as part of [[15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état|a coup d'état]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=বাশার |first1=রিয়াজুল |last2=আতিক |first2=ফয়সল |title=১৫ অগাস্ট: কী ছিল সেদিনের পত্রিকায় |url=https://bangla.bdnews24.com/bangladesh/article1379504.bdnews |accessdate=2 October 2020 |work=[[bdnews24.com]] |date=14 Aug 2017}}</ref>

==Background==
{{further|History of Bangladesh}}

===Mujib's presidency===
In the [[1970 Pakistani general election]], Sheikh Mujib's party, the [[Awami League]] (previously known as the Awami Muslim League), won the majority of the seats in the [[Pakistani National Assembly]]. They won 167 of the 169 seats in East Pakistan, which would later become Bangladesh after it seceded from West Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's military government delaying the handover of power, Mujib's house had become the de facto head of government in East Pakistan by March. At the start of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, he was arrested in his home by Pakistani soldiers. Later that year the provisional government of the Bangladeshi rebellion, the [[Mujibnagar Government]], formed on 10 April and made Mujib its head and also the leader of Bangladeshi armed forces.<ref name=":2">{{cite book |last=Harun-or-Rashid |year=2012 |chapter=Rahman, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Following the defeat of Pakistani forces on 16 December 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from custody from Pakistan in [[London]] on 22 December 1971 and flew to India followed by Bangladesh. Mujib led the government as [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]] of Bangladesh for three years after Bangladesh gained independence.<ref name=":2" />

===Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini controversy and outrage in Army===
[[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini]] or JRB was a highly controversial political militia formed in 1972 and was loyal to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pike |first1=Francis |title=Empires at war: a short history of modern Asia since World War II |date=2010 |publisher=I.B.

===Allegation of nepotism and corruption within Mujib-family===
[[Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani]] was given lucrative positions in the Government formed by Sheikh Mujibur. When private trade with India was banned to slow inflation, Fazlul Haque actively engaged in it with Mujibur's blessings. This was seen as an attempt by Mujibur to form a dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Salahuddin |title=Bangladesh : past and present|date=2003 |publisher=A.P.H.

Near the end of 1973 [[Sheikh Kamal]] was involved in a shootout in which he was inflicted with bullet injuries. Multiple claims have been made as to how the shootout occurred. Many people claim that this shootout occurred during the attempted robbery of a bank by Sheikh Kamal and his friends. However, a retired major general of the [[Bangladesh Army]] claimed that it was actually a case of friendly fire. Near the end of 1973, Bangladeshi security forces received intelligence that the left-wing revolutionary activist [[Siraj Sikder]] and his insurgents were going to launch coordinated attacks around [[Dhaka]]. Police and other security officers were on full alert and patrolling the streets of Dhaka in plainclothes. Sheikh Kamal and his friends were armed and also patrolling the city in a microbus looking for [[Siraj Sikder]]. When the microbus was in [[Dhanmondi]] the police mistook Sheikh Kamal and his friends to be insurgents and opened fire on them, thus injuring Sheikh Kamal.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|last=Askari|first=Rashid|date=5 August 2016|title=The story of an unsung hero|work=The Daily Observer|url=https://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=27137&fb_comment_id=702925183114256_1167127280027375|access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref> However, it is also claimed that Sheikh Kamal and his friends were in [[Dhanmondi Thana|Dhanmondi]] to test drive a new car that his friend [[Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku]] had bought recently.

===Dalim-Mostafa conflict===
In 1974, [[Gazi Golam Mostafa]] kidnapped Major [[Shariful Haque Dalim]] and his wife from the [[Dhaka Ladies Club]] after an argument. It was [[Shariful Haque Dalim|Dalim]]'s cousin's wedding reception in the [[Dhaka Ladies Club]]. [[Shariful Haque Dalim|Dalim]]'s only brother-in-law Bappi (his wife Nimmi's brother) was attending from Canada. Mostafa's son occupied the chair in the row behind Bappi and pulled Bappi's hair from the back. Bappi scolded the boy for his behavior and told him not to sit on the row behind him anymore. Mostafa's sons (who were close friends of [[Sheikh Kamal]]) and some associates forcefully abducted [[Shariful Haque Dalim|Dalim]], Nimmi, the groom's mother, and two of [[Shariful Haque Dalim|Dalim]]'s friends (both of whom were distinguished freedom fighters) in [[Microbus|Microbuses]] owned by the [[Bangladesh Red Crescent Society|Red Crescent]]. Mostafa was taking them to the [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini|Rakhi Bahini]] headquarters but later took them to the residence of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Foundation|first1=Bhashani|title=Searching for Bhasani Citizen of the World: The Life and Times of (Earnest) Mozlum Leader Maulana Bhasani|date=8 October 2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781453573136|pages=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMctBgAAQBAJ&q=Gazi+Golam+Mostafa&pg=PA235|accessdate=10 October 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Riaz|first1=Ali|title=Unfolding State: The Transformation of Bangladesh|year=2005|publisher=de Sitter Publications|isbn=9781897160107|pages=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=df9tAAAAMAAJ&q=Gazi+Golam+Mostafa|accessdate=10 October 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title=h4p16|url=http://www.majordalimbu.com/h4p16.htm|access-date=2020-07-03|website=www.majordalimbu.com}}</ref> [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Mujib]] mediated a compromise between them and made Mostafa apologize to Nimmi.

===Corruption, malfunction and BAKSAL===
Sheikh Mujib was later elected [[President of Bangladesh|President]] of Bangladesh and established a national unity government, the [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League]] (BAKSAL), on 7 June 1975 by banning all political parties and independent press. Mujib named the reform as [[Second Revolution (Bangladesh)|Second Revolution]]. Although the BAKSAL was intended to bring stability to Bangladesh and uphold law and order, it engendered hostility among the bureaucracy, military, and civil society. Opposition groups, as well as some of Mujib's supporters, challenged Mujib's authoritarian, one-party state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> The period of the BAKSAL's one-party rule was marked by widespread censorship and abuse of the judiciary, as well as opposition from the general populace, intellectuals, and all other political groups.<ref name=":1" /> The country was in chaos: corruption was rampant, and food shortages and poor distribution led to [[Bangladesh famine of 1974|a disastrous famine]], where approximately 3,00,000 to 45,00,000 (or 1 to 1.5 million) people died.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubin |first1=Olivier |title=Democracy and Famine |date=2012 |isbn=9780415598224 |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=6YkszNkcBAsC&pg=PA56&dq=1974+femine+assassination+of+sheikh+mujib&hl=bn&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLoMPTsqXtAhUIXSsKHa73BmQQ6AEwA3oECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=1974%20femine%20assassination%20of%20sheikh%20mujib&f=false |access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref> Many analysts claimed this famine as one of the major cause for killing Sheikh Mujib.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hossain |first1=Naomi |title=The Aid Lab: Understanding Bangladesh's Unexpected Success |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=UNr_DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA114&dq=1974+femine+assassination+of+sheikh+mujib&hl=bn&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLoMPTsqXtAhUIXSsKHa73BmQQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=1974%20femine%20assassination%20of%20sheikh%20mujib&f=false |access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ahmed |first1=Nizam |title=Public Policy and Governance in Bangladesh: Forty Years of Experience |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=BjOTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA76&dq=1974+femine+assassination+of+sheikh+mujib&hl=bn&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLoMPTsqXtAhUIXSsKHa73BmQQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=1974%20femine%20assassination%20of%20sheikh%20mujib&f=false |access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref> Nationalisation of industry failed to yield any tangible progress.

=== Party-partiality against rape-murder case ===
The army was already dissatisfied with Sheikh Mujib for discriminating them with JRB. However, [[Anthony Mascarenhas]] wrote in his book [[Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood]] that, he cited a specific factor behind the final outcry as influential: Mozammel, a contemporary Awami League youth leader from [[Tongi]] and the chairman of Tongi Awami League, seized a car of a newlywed housewife, killed her driver and husband, abducted her and [[gang-rape]]d her and three days later, her deadbody was found in the road near a bridge of Tongi. Mozammel was arrested by a leader of a squadron of the Bengal Lancer named Major Nasser and handed over to [[Bangladesh Police|the police]], but police released him immediately. At that time, many people thought that he was released from the punishment of that crime only with the intervention of Sheikh Mujib. This incident increased the dissatisfaction against Sheikh Mujib in [[Bangladesh Army|the Army]], specially in Major Faruque and acted as one of the prominently last-minute influences behind his assassination.<ref name="Balb">{{cite book |last1=Mascarenhas |first1=Anthony |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |date=1986 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |isbn=978-0-340-39420-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VoZ0QgAACAAJ&q=legacy+of+blood | pages=48–55 | quote=One day during a combing operation in Tongi area north of Dhaka Major Nasser who was commanding another squadron of the Bengal Lancers, arrested three small-time thugs. In the course of the interrogation one of the men broke down and told the army officers a story about a particularly gruesome triple murder which had rocked Tongi the previous winter. It transpired that a newly married couple travelling to their home in a taxi had been waylaid on the outskirts of town. The bridegroom and the taxi driver were hacked to death and their bodies thrown in the river. The bride, who was carried off to an isolated cottage, was repeatedly raped by her abductors. Three days later her mutilated body was found on the road near a bridge.Confessing to his part in the crime, the thug told the army men the police investigation was called off when they found out that the ring-leader of the gang was his boss, Muzamil, chairman of the Tongi Awami League. According to Farook, the confession so infuriated the interrogating officer, a boyish lieutenant named Ishtiaque who had since resigned and left the country, that “he started kicking the chap so hard that he died of internal injuries”. Muzamil himself was taken by Major Nasser to Dhaka for prosecution after he confirmed from police records that the thug had been telling the truth. According to Farook, Muzamil offered Nasser 300,000 Takkas for his release. “Don’t make it a public affair”, the Awami Leaguer advised him. “You will anyway have to let me go, either today or tomorrow. So why not take the money and forget about it?” Nasser, who was affronted by this blatant attempt to bribe him, swore he would bring Muzamil to trial and make him hang for his crime. He handed him over to the civil authorities. Farook said they were all astonished a few days later to find that Muzamil had been released on Shiekh Mujib’s intervention. “I told you to take the money”, Muzamil crowed. “You would have been the gainers. Now I have been released anyway and you get nothing.”The incident shattered Farook and his colleagues. Tongi marked the turning point for them. “It seemed as if we were living in a society headed by a criminal organization. It was as if the Mafia had taken over Bangladesh. We were totally disillusioned. Here was the head of government abetting murder and other extreme things from which he was supposed to protect us. This was not acceptable. We decided he must go.” “…when hope is extinguished, accountability denied and the people have nothing further to lose, they turn to violence to redress their wrongs.” |accessdate=10 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=Ob>{{cite book |last1=Obaidullah |first1=A.

Mohiuddin Ahmed]], [[Bazlul Huda]], and [[S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury]] (three majors in the [[Bangladesh Army]] and veterans of the Bangladesh Liberation War), planned to topple the government and establish a military government of their own. They were previously part of the opposition to [[BAKSAL]] and viewed the government as too subservient to India and a threat to Bangladesh's military.<ref>{{cite news |title=Farooq's confession |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/august-15-special-coverage/farooqs-confession-1269634 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=19 November 2009 |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> According to [[Anthony Mascarenhas]], Faruque offered Major [[Ziaur Rahman]] indirectly to take part in the plan and tried to convince him, but Zia cleverly avoided the matter. According to Farooq, Zia's gesture meant: ''"I'm sorry, I don't want to get involved in this. If you junior officers want to do something, you should do it yourself.

[[Khandaker Abdur Rashid]]'s wife and accused Jobaida Rashid said in his deposition, "Criticism was happened among Army officers for providing more facilities by forming Rakkhi Bahini besides the army.

One night Major Farooq returned from Zia's house and told my husband that Zia wanted to be president if the government changed. Zia said, ''"It is a success to come to me.

I have heard that General Zia will retire from the army and be sent abroad as an ambassador." At one point after the swearing in of the cabinet, Major Rashid introduced me to his wife.

My wife is the mastermind behind what we have done."<ref name=Boss/> The assassins considered the possible causes of the failure, and for the upcoming after-period after Mujib's assassination, they decided to use a well-wisher from Mujib's Awami League and a person who could be removed in time if desired, in order to curb the possible Indian intervention, the Awami League's vengeful armed opposition, the possible increasing arbitrariness of the anti-Awami League and to temporarily control the situation. After some time of searching, an Awami League cabinet minister under Mujib's government, [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]], agreed to take over the presidency. Journalist Lawrence Lifschultz paints an alternate picture of the conspiracy, however, that implicates Mostaq and the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). In his book ''Bangladesh: The Unfinished Revolution'', he wrote that the "CIA station chief in Dhaka, Philip Cherry, was actively involved in the killing of the Father of the Nation—Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman."<ref>[http://www.daily-sun.com/post/66979/Long-shadow-of-the-August-1975-coup Long shadow of the August 1975 coup].

===Assassination===
In the early hours of 15 August 1975, the conspirators divided into four groups. One group, consisting of members of the Bengal Lancers of the First Armoured Division and 535th Infantry Division under Major Huda, attacked Mujib's residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|pp=63–64}}: "According to foreign journalists, the operation started at 12.30 A.M. ... divided into four groups. The first group rolled towards Mujib's residence ... The first group was formed with selected soldiers from the Bengal Lancers of the First Armoured Division and 535 Infantry Regiment. It was put under Major Huda. "</ref> Correspondent for ''[[Anandabazar Patrika]]'' Sukharanjan Dasgupta, who described the Bangladesh Liberation War in Dhaka until 1974, writes in his book ''Midnight Massacre in Dacca'' that "the exact details of the massacre will always remain shrouded in mystery."<ref name="Dasgupta1978p64" /> He goes on to say, however, that the army platoon protecting the president's house offered no resistance. [[Sheikh Kamal]], son of Mujib, was shot at the reception area on the ground floor.<ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|pp=65–66}}: "[soldiers] quickly surrounded Mujib's residence. A couple of rounds were fired. No resistance came from the army platoon guarding the President's house ... The first round of fire had brought Sheikh Kamal hurrying down to the reception on the ground floor ... A short burst, and his body, riddled with bullets sank to the floor."</ref> Meanwhile, Mujib was asked to resign and allowed time to consider his choice. He telephoned Colonel [[Jamil Uddin Ahmad]], the new Chief of Military Intelligence. When Jamil arrived and ordered the troops back to the barracks, he was gunned down at the gate of the residence. After he refused to resign, Mujib was shot and killed.<ref name="Dasgupta1978p64">{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|loc=p. 64, para 2}}: "Reports reveal that they did not kill Sheikh Mujib at once. Mujib was asked to step down from power and he was given some time to decide. Mujib summoned Colonel Jamil, the new chief of the Military Intelligence over the phone. Colonel Jamil arrived fast and ordered the army to return to the barracks ... Then a rapid burst from machine guns mowed down Jamil right in front of the gate."</ref>

Other people killed in the attack were [[Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib]], wife of Mujib, who was killed upstairs; [[Sheikh Nasser]], younger brother of Mujib, who was killed in a lavatory; several servants of Mujib, who were also killed in lavatories; [[Sheikh Jamal]], the second son of Mujib and an army officer; ten-year-old [[Sheikh Russel]], the youngest son of Mujib; and two daughters-in-law of Mujib.<ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|p=67}}: "The murderers rushed upstairs ... they came across Begum Lutfunnessa Mujib ... Shots rang out again. Begum Mujib lay on the floor, dead ... A group searched the ground floor. In the lavatories, they found Sheikh Nasser and a couple of servants and gunned them down. The other group charged into Mujib's bedroom. There they found the two daughters-in-law of Mujib along with Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russel ... they, too, were not spared by these butchers."</ref>

In [[Dhanmondi]], two other groups of soldiers killed [[Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani]], Mujib's nephew and a leader of the Awami League along with his pregnant wife, Arzu Moni, and [[Abdur Rab Serniabat]], Mujib's brother-in-law. They also killed a minister of the government and thirteen of his family members on Mintu Road.<ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|p=65}}: "Lieutenant Moalemuddin sped for the residence of Sheikh Mani with three trucks full of soldiers ... while Major Shahriar and Captain Huda went out with some soldiers to get rid of Minister Abdur Rab Sarniabat."</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|loc=p. 64, para 3}}: "At the same time at 13/1 Dhanmandi Sheikh Fazlul Haq and his pregnant wife, and on Mineta Road, Abdur Rab Sarniabat with the 13 members of his family, were butchered ..."</ref>

The fourth and most powerful group was sent towards Savar to repel the expected counter-attack by the security forces stationed there. After a brief fight and the loss of eleven men, the security forces surrendered.<ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|loc=p. 64, para 1}}: "[The] fourth group, the most powerful of the lot, proceeded towards Savar, near Dacca, to repel the anticipated counter-attack by the Security Forces. It did run against some resistance at Savar. But once the shelling took toll of eleven people, the leaderless Security Force surrendered"</ref>

Four of the founding leaders of the Awami League, first Prime Minister of Bangladesh [[Tajuddin Ahmed]], former Prime Minister [[Mansur Ali]], former Vice President [[Syed Nazrul Islam]], and former Home Minister [[A.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M. Qamaruzzaman]], were arrested. Three months later, on 3 November 1975, they [[Jail Killing Day|were murdered]] in [[Dhaka Central Jail]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dasgupta|1978|pp=77–78}}: "3 November ... Khondakar also knew that the situation was bound to be grave once Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, Kamaruzzaman and Mansur Ali were released ... Khondakar had had them arrested under various pretexts shortly after Mujib's assassination, and they were still rotting in Dacca Jail. So, Khondakar ... managed to allow the associates of the "killers" [the seven Majors who assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] inside the jail to brutally kill these four leaders."</ref>

===Aftermath of assassination===
On the morning of the assassination, the then Lieutenant Colonel [[Amin Ahmed Chowdhury]] entered the house of General [[Ziaur Rahman]] and found out on the radio that President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had been assassinated,He described the incident, "General Zia is shaving on one side but not on the other. Came running in the sleeping suit, he asked [[Shafaat Jamil]], "What happened, Shafaat?" Shafaat replied, "Apparently two battalions staged a coup. We don't know yet what happened outside. We hear the announcement on the radio that the president is dead."  Then General Zia said, "So what? Let vice-president take over. We have nothing to do with politics. Get your troops ready. Uphold the constitution."<ref name="BBC Bangla">{{cite news |title=শেখ মুজিব হত্যার পর জেনারেল জিয়া যে মন্তব্য করেছিলেন (General Zia made that comment after the assassination of Sheikh Mujib) |url=https://www.bbc.com/bengali/news-40763116.amp |accessdate=21 August 2020 |work=[[BBC News|BBC News Bangla]] |date=15 August 2017 |language=bn}}</ref><ref name=Ob/>

[[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]] assumed the presidency, and [[Major General]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] became the new Chief of Army Staff. The leading conspirators were all given high government ranks. They were all later toppled by yet another coup led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Khaled Mosharraf]] on 3 November 1975. Mosharraf himself was killed during a counter-revolt four days later on 7 November, which freed Major General Ziaur Rahman in power and was brought in to bring law and order.

Major [[Syed Faruque Rahman]], Rashid, and the other army officers were promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. Nevertheless, they were exiled to [[Libyan Arab Republic|Libya]], China, [[Rhodesia]], Canada, and other countries, although they were given several diplomatic posts in Bangladeshi missions abroad. Lieutenant Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman later returned and founded the [[Bangladesh Freedom Party]] in 1985 and took part in the presidential election in 1987 against the military ruler [[Lieutenant General]] [[Hussain Mohammad Ershad]] but lost that election in a landslide.

Mujib's two daughters, [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Sheikh Rehana]], were in [[West Germany]] at the time of his assassination.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina requests extradition of Bangabandhu killers from US |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/bangladeshi-pm-sheikh-hasina-requests-extradition-of-bangabandhu-killers-from-us-116083000733_1.html |newspaper=Business Standard |agency=Press Trust of India |date=30 August 2016 |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> After the coup, they flew back to India, instead of Bangladesh and took refuge with the Indian government. Sheikh Hasina lived in New Delhi in a self-imposed exile before returning to Bangladesh on 17 May 1981.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Helal Uddin |year=2012 |chapter=Hasina, Sheikh |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Hasina,_Sheikh |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>

===Trial===
The military decided not to [[court-martial]] the military officers who masterminded and participated in the coup. [[AFM Mohitul Islam|A.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;M. Mohitul Islam]], personal assistant to Sheikh Mujib and a survivor of the attack on his house, attempted to file a case against the military officers, but the police slapped him in the face and refused to file the report.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ordeals of plaintiff |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/august-15-special-coverage/ordeals-plaintiff-1269652 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=19 November 2009 |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> The assassination conspirators could not be tried in a court of law because of the [[Indemnity Act, Bangladesh|Indemnity Act]] passed by the government under President [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]]. When the Awami League, led by Mujib's daughter [[Sheikh Hasina]], won elections in 1996, the act was repealed. The Bangabandhu murder trial began with the case filing by A.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;M. Mohitul Islam.<ref name="hfxb">{{cite news |title=Mohitul Islam passes away |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/mohitul-islam-passes-away-1275547 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=26 August 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref>

Colonel (Rtd.) [[Syed Faruque Rahman]] was arrested from his Dhaka home, and Colonel (Rtd.) [[Bazlul Huda]] was brought back from [[Bangkok]], where he was serving a prison sentence for [[shop lifting|shoplifting]] as part of a criminal exchange program between [[Thailand]] and Bangladesh. Lieutenant Colonel [[Mohiuddin Ahmed]] was in active military service when he was arrested. Colonel (Rtd.) [[Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan]] had been appointed to active diplomatic service by previous Prime Minister of Bangladesh [[Begum Khaleda Zia]], but he returned to Bangladesh and was arrested when he was recalled by the foreign ministry. Colonel (Rtd.) [[Abdur Rashid]] and other accused individuals had already left Bangladesh, however. They believed that the upcoming 1996 general election would be an Awami League victory, which would result in the repealing of the Indemnity Act and their subsequent arrest. Colonel (Rtd.) Rashid now reportedly shuttles between Pakistan and Libya. All these men were also involved in [[Jail Killing Day]] on 3 November 1975, when four Awami League officials were assassinated.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The first trial ended on 8 November 1998. The District and Session Judge of Dhaka, Mohammad Golam Rasul, ordered the death sentence by firing squad to fifteen out of the twenty accused of conspiring in the assassination. The sentences were not carried out immediately, because five of the convicts sought to file appeals in the high court division of the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]]. The Supreme Court, consisting of Justice Mohammad Ruhul Amin and Justice A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;M. Khairul Haque, who was the former [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh]], gave a divisive verdict. Senior Justice Amin acquitted five out of the original fifteen accused, whereas Junior Justice Haque upheld the lower court's verdict. A verdict from a third judge became necessary. Later, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim condemned twelve out of original fifteen, including two acquitted in Justice Amin's verdict.

One of the convicts, Major (Rtd.) Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe on 2 June 2001.<ref>[http://www.peoplesmouth.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7220:6-killers-still-out-of-reach&catid=34:jv-slideshow 6 killers still out of reach]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221162331/http://www.peoplesmouth.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7220%3A6-killers-still-out-of-reach&catid=34%3Ajv-slideshow |date=21 February 2014 }}</ref> Although the five accused appealed to the [[Law of Bangladesh#The Appellate Division|appellate division of the Supreme Court]], their decision remained pending from August 2001. Several judges refused to hear the case, which meant the government lacked the three judges required to hold a hearing session. On 18 June 2007, one of the conspirators who had been sentenced to death, Major (Rtd.) A.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;M. Mohiuddin Ahmed was extradited to Bangladesh from the United States following a series of failed attempts to gain [[right of asylum|asylum]] or [[permanent residency]] in the United States. On 7 August 2007, the murder case hearings resumed after a six-year delay.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bangabandhu murder case hearing resumes today after 6 years |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/08/07/d7080701033.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=7 August 2007}}</ref> The appellate division of the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] gave its verdict on 19 November 2009,<ref>''Major Md.
