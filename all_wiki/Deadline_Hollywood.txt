==History==
''Deadline'' was founded by Nikki Finke, who began writing an ''[[LA Weekly]]'' column series called ''Deadline Hollywood'' in June 2002. She began the ''Deadline Hollywood Daily'' (DHD) blog in March 2006 as an online version of her column.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=Deadline Turns 10 And Celebrates Disruptors: Nikki Finke Looks Back|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/nikki-finke-deadline-hollywood-10th-anniversary-1201750730/|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=United States|date=May 11, 2016|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> She officially launched it as an entertainment trade website in 2006.<ref name="WrapFired">{{cite news |last1=Maglio |first1=Tony |last2=Donnelly |first2=Matt |title=She’s Back?!
