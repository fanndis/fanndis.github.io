== History ==

===Foundation and early years===

The immediate spur to the organisation's formation was the [[National Hunger March, 1932|National Hunger March of 1932]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/about/history/how-liberty-was-founded.php|title=Liberty|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk|access-date=25 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110170353/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/about/history/how-liberty-was-founded.php|archive-date=10 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The first Secretary was [[Ronald Kidd]], and first President [[E. M. Forster]]; Vice-Presidents were the politician and author [[A. P. Herbert]] and the journalist [[Kingsley Martin]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]''. [[H. G. Wells]], [[Vera Brittain]], [[Clement Attlee]], [[Rebecca West]], [[Edith Summerskill]] and [[Harold Laski]] were also founder members.<ref name="autogenerated1934">Dyson, Brian (1994): ''Liberty in Britain 1934–1994: a diamond jubilee history of the National Council for Civil Liberties''. Civil Liberties Trust.</ref>

The National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) was founded in 1934. The inaugural meeting took place in the church of [[St. Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London on 22 February. A letter published in ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspapers announced the formations of the group, citing "the general and alarming tendency to encroachment on the liberty of the [[citizenship|citizen]]" as the reason for its establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5MzQvMDIvMjQjQXIwMDYwMA==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-customl|title=The Guardian and Observer digital archive|work=the Guardian|access-date=12 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117111829/http://archive.guardian.co.uk/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=R1VBLzE5MzQvMDIvMjQjQXIwMDYwMA==&Mode=Gif&Locale=english-skin-customl|archive-date=17 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The first campaign was against the criminalisation of pacifist or anti-war literature. Under the proposed Incitement to Disaffection Bill, commonly known as the 'Sedition Bill', it would have been a criminal offence to possess pacifist literature, for example anti-war pamphlets. Although the Bill became law as the [[Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934]], NCCL succeeded in watering it down.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/> Other prominent early themes included campaigning against fascists, against film censorship and support for striking miners in [[Nottinghamshire]].<ref name="archiveshub1">[http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/hullhistory-liberty.html Administrative/Biographical History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716200101/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/hullhistory-liberty.html |date=16 July 2011 }} of Liberty | Liberty Archive on the ''Archives hub'' at the ''Centre of great research'' [retrieved: 16 January 2013]</ref>

=== World War II ===
When [[Oswald Mosley]] was released from prison in 1943 (he had been imprisoned without trial under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]), the National Council for Civil Liberties oddly demanded his continued imprisonment. A.W. Brian Simpson notes that the NCCL "had become an enthusiastic supporter of detention without trial".<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/in-the-highest-degree-odious-9780198259497?cc=us&lang=en&|title=In the Highest Degree Odious: Detention without Trial in Wartime Britain|date=1995-01-12|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-825949-7|location=Oxford, New York|pages=391}}</ref> [[Harold Nicolson]] and 38 others resigned from the NCCL over the issue.<ref>Richard Thurlow, "Fascism in Britain", I.B.

=== Liberty ===

In 1989, NCCL rebranded as "Liberty". During this period, the organisation was headed by Andrew Puddephatt and John Wadham.

On 10 September 2001, [[Shami Chakrabarti]] joined Liberty.<ref name="DIDiscs SC">{{cite episode

Since the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 UK general election]], Liberty has spearheaded the campaign to save the Human Rights Act. In August 2015, Chakrabarti said Liberty intended to become "more vigilant and active" in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beaton|first=Connor|url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2015/08/20/shami-chakrabartis-liberty-sets-sights-on-scotland/|title=Shami Chakrabarti’s Liberty sets sights on Scotland|publisher=[[Scottish Legal News]]|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925055232/http://www.scottishlegal.com/2015/08/20/shami-chakrabartis-liberty-sets-sights-on-scotland/|archive-date=25 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> She later shared a platform with Scotland's First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] to jointly defend the HRA.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beaton|first=Connor|url=http://www.scottishlegal.com/2015/09/23/human-rights-act-repeal-would-diminish-uk-reputation-says-sturgeon/|title=Human Rights Act repeal would diminish UK reputation, says Sturgeon|publisher=[[Scottish Legal News]]|date=23 September 2015|accessdate=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223416/http://www.scottishlegal.com/2015/09/23/human-rights-act-repeal-would-diminish-uk-reputation-says-sturgeon/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 2016, Liberty's work has been dominated by taking a High Court challenge to the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016|Investigatory Powers Act]], and campaigning against the so-called '[[Home Office hostile environment policy|hostile environment]]' policies and for an end to the use of indefinite [[Immigration detention in the United Kingdom|immigration detention]] in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/liberty-wins-first-battle-landmark-challenge-mass-surveillance|title=Liberty wins first battle in landmark challenge to mass surveillance powers in the Investigatory Powers Act|last=katiebamber|date=2018-04-27|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170138/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/liberty-wins-first-battle-landmark-challenge-mass-surveillance|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/campaigning/end-indefinite-detention|title=End Indefinite Detention|last=LaurenceHolmes|date=2018-01-25|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170219/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/campaigning/end-indefinite-detention|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Campaigns ==

===Post-war===

'''BBC ban'''

During the 1940s, the NCCL led protests against a [[BBC]] ban on artists who attended a 'People's Convention' organised by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]].<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''Soldiers' civil liberties'''

In the years following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the NCCL campaigned for better civil liberties protections for members of the Armed Forces, including for better education and vocational training, a fairer military justice system and freedom of voluntary association.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The National Council for Civil Liberties: The First Fifty Years|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalcouncilf00lill|url-access=registration|last=Lilly|first=Mark|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|year=1984|isbn=978-1-349-17483-6|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nationalcouncilf00lill/page/64 64]}}</ref>

'''Miscarriages of justice'''

At this time NCCL was also involved in several [[miscarriage of justice]] cases, including that of Emery, Powers and Thompson, who were sentenced to between four and ten years imprisonment for assaulting a police officer, even though someone else [[Confession (law)|confessed]] to the crime and the prosecution evidence was flawed. NCCL found a witness who confirmed the men's [[alibi]] and they were released from prison and granted a [[pardon|royal pardon]].<ref name="liberty-human-rights1">[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/about/legal/key-liberty-legal-cases.php Liberty Legal Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721020612/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/about/legal/key-liberty-legal-cases.php |date=21 July 2011 }} | on www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk</ref>

'''Reform of the Mental Health System'''

During the 1950s NCCL campaigned for reform of the [[mental health]] system, under which people known to be sane but deemed 'morally defective' – unmarried mothers, for example – could be locked up in an asylum.

By 1957, the campaign had seen the release of around 2,000 former inmates, the abolition of the [[Mental Health Act 1913]] and the establishment of new Mental Health Review Tribunals and the [[Mental Health Act 1959]].<ref>Swain, J. & French, S. (1999): ''Therapy and Learning Difficulties: Advocacy, Participation and Partnership''. Oxford: [[Butterworth–Heinemann]].</ref>

===1960–1974===

The 1960s saw the organisation broaden its scope, particularly from 1966 under new general secretary [[Tony Smythe]]. It campaigned on racial issues, on behalf of gypsies, children, prisoners and servicemen who had changed their decision about joining the forces.<ref name="archiveshub1"/> This broader range of campaigning resulted in a large rise in membership and a higher profile in the media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/29/guardianobituaries.humanrights|title=Obituary: Tony Smythe|work=the Guardian|access-date=4 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510202836/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/mar/29/guardianobituaries.humanrights|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Opposition to racial discrimination'''

After 1960, NCCL responded to the tightening of [[immigration law]]s and a rise in race-hate incidents by lobbying for the [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]], which came into force in 1965. NCCL also published pamphlets exposing the effective 'colour bar', whereby black and Asian people were refused service in certain pubs and hotels.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

Following Conservative MP Enoch Powell's [[Rivers of Blood speech]] in 1968 the NCCL set about organising an emergency "Speak out on Race" meeting and also presented an NCCL petition to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

'''Women's rights'''

Campaigning for [[women's rights]] was also a major part of NCCL's work in this period, including successfully calling for reform of jury service laws that effectively prevented women and the poor from serving on juries by means of a property qualification.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''Right to public protest'''

NCCL intervened on behalf of groups refused permission to protest and monitoring the policing of demonstrations such as those against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''Support for reluctant servicemen'''

NCCL also campaigned to raise awareness of the difficulty faced by 'reluctant servicemen' – men in the armed forces who had often signed-up as teenagers then realised they'd made a mistake but were prevented from discharging themselves for anything up to 16 years.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''Northern Ireland'''

In 1972 NCCL campaigned for civil rights in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="Dooley1998">{{cite book|author=Brian Dooley|title=Black and Green: The Fight for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland & Black America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI5TDscIjLcC&pg=PA41|year=1998|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1295-8|page=41}}</ref>

'''Data protection'''

In 1975 NCCL bought 3 million credit rating files from Konfax Ltd after they were offered for sale in the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. The files were destroyed and the major privacy protection 'Right to Know' campaign to give individuals greater control over their personal information was launched in 1977.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

===1975–1989===
Near the end of 1974, [[Patricia Hewitt]], later a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] cabinet minister, was appointed as general secretary.<ref name="archiveshub1"/> A number of other future high-profile Labour politicians worked at the organisation at this time, such as [[Harriet Harman]], who worked as the legal officer from 1978 to 1982, [[Jack Dromey]], later her husband, was a member (1970–79) and chairman of the Executive Committee, and [[Diane Abbott]] was employed as Race Relations Officer (1978–80).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/candidates/candidates/2/28601.stm|title=BBC NEWS - VOTE 2001 - CANDIDATES|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714231139/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/candidates/candidates/2/28601.stm|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Paedophilia'''

In 1976, the NCCL in a submission to the Criminal Law Revision Committee of the British Parliament argued that "Childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult result in no identifiable damage… The real need is a change in the attitude which assumes that all cases of paedophilia result in lasting damage". The NCCL also sought to place the "onus of proof on the prosecution to show that the child was actually harmed" rather than having a blanket ban on [[child pornography]] and advocated the [[decriminalisation]] of [[incest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100185799/how-hatties-friends-defended-paedophilia/|title=How Hattie’s friends defended paedophilia|work=News - Telegraph Blogs|access-date=20 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405123306/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100185799/how-hatties-friends-defended-paedophilia/|archive-date=5 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Organisations such as [[Paedophile Information Exchange]] (P.I.E.), a pro-paedophile activist group, and Paedophile Action for Liberation became affiliated to the pressure group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html|title=Harriet Harman under attack over bid to water down child pornography law|author=Martin Beckford, Social Affairs Correspondent|date=9 March 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222181130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html|archive-date=22 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Prominent pro-paedophile activist [[Tom O'Carroll]] also sat on the NCCL's sub-committee for gay rights.<ref name="Bindel">{{cite news|last=Bindel|first=Julie|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/6193/full|title=Britain's Apologists For Child Abuse|work=Standpoint|date=September 2015|accessdate=15 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806060901/http://standpointmag.co.uk/node/6193/full|archive-date=6 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Shami Chakrabarti]], the former director of  Liberty, issued an apology about the links between the NCCL and the PIE.

'''Gay rights and censorship'''

NCCL acted for the owners of [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|''Gay's the Word'' bookshop]], whose stock was confiscated by Customs officers in 1984. All charges were dropped in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McKerrow|first1=Graham|last2=Northmore|first2=David|title=Newsflash|url=http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/ncropa/ncropa-1986-87.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2016|work=Defend Gay's the Word Campaign|date=27 June 1986|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510143121/http://www.infotextmanuscripts.org/ncropa/ncropa-1986-87.pdf|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Miners' strike'''

During the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]], NCCL campaigned on behalf of miners stopped from picketing outside their home regions.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''MI5 surveillance'''

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that [[MI5]] [[surveillance]] of [[Harriet Harman]] and [[Patricia Hewitt]] during the pair's tenure at Liberty breached the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].<ref name="liberty-human-rights1"/>

===1990–2004===

'''Detention without charge'''

During the [[Gulf War]], Liberty successfully campaigned for the release of over 100 Iraqi nationals – some of whom were openly opposed to [[Saddam Hussein]] – detained without charge in Britain on the grounds that they posed a risk to [[national security]].<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''Miscarriage of justice'''

Throughout the 1990s Liberty focused again on miscarriage of justice cases and campaigned for reform of the criminal justice system. High-profile cases included that of the [[Birmingham Six]], who were released after 16 years in prison for [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombings they did not commit.<ref name="autogenerated1934"/>

'''Human Rights Act'''

At the start of the 2000s, Liberty used the protections in the new [[Human Rights Act 1998]] to fight a number of landmark cases, including supporting terminally ill [[Diane Pretty]]'s fight to die with dignity and [[Christine Goodwin]]'s fight for transgender rights.

'''''A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department'''''

Liberty intervened in the long-running ''[[A and others v Secretary of State for the Home Department]]'' case following which the [[Law Lords]] ruled that detaining non-British nationals without trial was unlawful. In a 2005 judgment the Law Lords also confirmed that [[evidence]] obtained through [[torture]] was not admissible in [[Courts of the United Kingdom|British courts]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd051208/aand-1.htm Judgments – A and others v.

'''Katherine Gun'''

In 2004, Liberty acted for the translator and [[whistleblower]] [[Katharine Gun]] who claimed that the American [[National Security Agency]] had requested the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]]'s help in illegal [[surveillance]] on the UN. She was prosecuted under the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]]. The charges were dropped when the prosecution failed to offer any evidence.<ref name="liberty-human-rights1"/>

=== 2005–2014 ===

'''Pre-charge detention'''

During 2007 and 2008 Liberty led the opposition to government plans to extend detention without charge for those suspected of terrorism to 42 days.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Paul|title=Chakrabarti attacks Asian MPs over support for 42-day detention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/16/terrorism.civilliberties|accessdate=31 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=16 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411120159/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/16/terrorism.civilliberties|archive-date=11 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Chakrabarti and Liberty claimed a major campaign victory when the government dropped the proposal after it was rejected by the [[House of Lords]] in October 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chakrabarti|first1=Shami|title=On 42 days, their lordships were glorious|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/detention-without-charge-42-days|accessdate=31 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411121535/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/detention-without-charge-42-days|archive-date=11 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Gooch Gang'''

In April 2009, Liberty protested against a poster campaign by [[Greater Manchester Police]] which depicted a series of notorious Manchester gangsters, the [[Gooch Gang]], as pensioners. The billboard campaign used computer-generated images of Colin Joyce and [[Lee Amos]] to show how the "aged" criminals would look when they are finally released from prison in the 2040s. Liberty supported claims that the posters should be removed following complaints from family members of the gangsters, not involved with their relative's criminality, who claimed they were being targeted in the community after the posters were erected.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/5558113/Gooch-crime-gang-relatives-sue-police-for-breaching-human-rights.html ''Gooch crime gang relatives sue police for 'breaching human rights' ''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919121608/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/5558113/Gooch-crime-gang-relatives-sue-police-for-breaching-human-rights.html |date=19 September 2018 }} Richard Edwards for [[The Daily Telegraph]], 17 June 2009 (retrieved: 16 January 2013)</ref>

'''Cream of Conscience'''

November 2011 saw Liberty successfully assist in preventing [[Westminster City Council]] from [[implementation|implementing]] a proposed [[By-law|byelaw]] which would have essentially criminalised "soup runs" within areas of [[Southwark]].<ref>[http://londonist.com/2011/06/liberty-serves-up-cream-of-conscience-to-council.php ''Liberty Serves Up Cream Of Conscience To Council''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008090053/http://londonist.com/2011/06/liberty-serves-up-cream-of-conscience-to-council.php |date=8 October 2011 }} | The Londonist, 3 June 2011 (retrieved: 16 January 2013)</ref><ref>[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigns/soup-run/soup-run.php Soup Run Campaign]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611190418/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigns/soup-run/soup-run.php |date=2011-06-11 }} | on www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk</ref>

'''Freedom Games?'''

In response to the vast security systems which were put in place ahead of the London 2012 [[Olympic Games]], Liberty raised concerns with regards to the infringements to civil liberties which would subsequently occur. Liberty argued that neither [[Nonviolent resistance|peaceful protest]] nor the right to free speech were a factor in ensuring the safety of the Games.<ref>[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigns/olympics/freedom-games-.php  Freedom Games Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110165339/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigns/olympics/freedom-games-.php |date=10 November 2012 }} | on www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk</ref>

'''For their eyes only'''

Another prominent campaign in 2012 was "For their eyes only"<ref>[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigns/for-their-eyes-only/for-their-eyes-only.php For Their Eyes Only Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128090127/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/campaigns/for-their-eyes-only/for-their-eyes-only.php |date=28 January 2013 }} | on www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk</ref> in response to the proposed Justice and Security Bill which was introduced in the [[House of Lords]] on 28 May 2012.

A campaign presence and attendance by [[Shami Chakrabarti]] at the Liberal Democrats Conference in September 2012 in Brighton successfully led to the passing of a motion by Jo Shaw, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Spokesperson for Holborn and St Pancras, against the Bill.<ref>[http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news/2012/tide-turns-on-secret-courts.php ''Tide turns on secret courts''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013074246/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news/2012/tide-turns-on-secret-courts.php |date=13 October 2012 }} | Isabella Sankey, Director of Liberty Policy | on www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk</ref> Nevertheless, the substantially unchanged Bill became law in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/justiceandsecurity/stages.html|title=Bill stages — Justice and Security Act 2013|work=parliament.uk|access-date=8 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511155014/http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/justiceandsecurity/stages.html|archive-date=11 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Extradition Watch'''

A prominent campaign by Liberty was in relation to fairer extradition laws and the opposition of unfair extradition proceedings, the most prominent case being that of [[Gary McKinnon]] who gained world wide press attention. Other prolific cases included that of Babar Ahmed, Talha Ahsan and Christopher Tappin.

'''Gary McKinnon'''

16 October 2012 saw a victory for [[Gary McKinnon]], after a decade-long ordeal, as the Home Secretary, [[Theresa May]], announced that she was refusing to allow Gary's extradition to the US on the basis that doing so would breach his Human Rights.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080730/mckinn-1.htm Judgments – Mckinnon V Government of The United States of America and Another] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/677C9REYQ?url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080730/mckinn-1.htm |date=22 April 2012 }} | House of Lords, Session 2007–08</ref> Gary McKinnon was charged in 2002 of hacking into [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] and [[NASA]] systems, but maintains that he was looking for [[UFO]]s and evidence of [[free energy suppression]].

'''Gay rights'''

Liberty intervened in the case of [[Same-sex relationship|gay couple]] Michael Black and John Morgan who were turned away from a [[bed and breakfast]] because of the owner's religious views. On 18 October 2012 it was ruled that the B&B owner was in breach of equality legislation by unlawfully discriminating against the couple on the basis of their [[sexual orientation]]. Liberty's Legal Director James Welch said of the decision "Hopefully today's ruling signals the death knell of such 'no gays' policies – policies that would never be tolerated if they referred to a person's race, gender or religion."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Furness |first1=Hannah |title=Gay couple turned away from B&B win discrimination case |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9617792/Gay-couple-turned-away-from-BandB-win-discrimination-case.html |accessdate=3 August 2020 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=18 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130505095529/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9617792/Gay-couple-turned-away-from-BandB-win-discrimination-case.html |archivedate=2013-05-05 |url-status=unfit}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Liberty welcomes B&B discrimination case ruling |url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/17204 |accessdate=12 July 2020 |date=19 October 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1594514717WCZSOGHNJX?url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/17204 |archivedate=12 July 2020 |publisher=Liberty |via=Ekklesia |url-status=live}}</ref><!-- This is presumed to be subtsantially identical to the press release originally posted at http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2012/liberty-victory-for-b-b-discrimination-couple.phpLiberty under the title ''Victory for B&B Discrimination Couple'', identified as a "permanent dead link" (notwithstanding the apparent typo in the url) --><!-- existing url parameter at Ekklesia requires a click to view the whole content, while the archive url at Freezepage hides only a couple of words, but provides no way to view those words -->

==== Save our Human Rights Act ====
Immediately following the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 General Election]] result, Liberty launched a campaign to save the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] – which had won a majority – had included a pledge in its manifesto to repeal the Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/10/conservatives-to-push-forward-on-manifesto-and-scrap-human-rights-act|title=Conservatives to push forward on manifesto and scrap Human Rights Act|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|date=2015-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417002244/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/10/conservatives-to-push-forward-on-manifesto-and-scrap-human-rights-act|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Liberty called this "a knowing attempt by Government ministers to hand itself the right to end the universality of human rights and choose when and to whom they apply".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/bella-sankey/human-rights-act-british-bill-of-rights_b_7257376.html|title=A British Bill of Rights Will Diminish the Rights of Everyone in the UK - And the Most Vulnerable Will Suffer Most|date=2015-05-11|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170104/https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/bella-sankey/human-rights-act-british-bill-of-rights_b_7257376.html|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2016, Liberty, [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International UK]] and the British Institute of Human Rights published a statement opposing repeal of the Act, backed by more than 130 organisations including [[Pan Am Flight 103|UK Families Flight 103]], [[Friends of the Earth]], Refuge, [[Quakers in Britain]], [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]], the [[Down's Syndrome Association]] and the [[Football Supporters' Federation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/lockerbie-relatives-football-supporters-and-domestic-violence|title=Lockerbie relatives, football supporters and domestic violence survivors among more than 100 groups standing together against Human Rights Act repeal|last=sophiearmour|date=2016-05-18|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170200/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/lockerbie-relatives-football-supporters-and-domestic-violence|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== The Deepcut inquests ====
Liberty represents the families of three of four young soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at [[Deaths at Deepcut army barracks|Deepcut]] army barracks between 1995 and 2002 – Cheryl James, Sean Benton and James Collinson.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/campaigning/soldiers-rights|title=Soldiers' Rights|last=SophieLock|date=2015-11-09|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref> Liberty used the Human Rights Act to compel [[Surrey Police]] to disclose evidence about the deaths to the families, which they were then able to use to apply for fresh inquests.

The second inquest into the death of Cheryl James took place at Woking Coroner's Court from January to April 2016. On 3 June 2016, Coroner [[Brian Barker]] QC recorded a verdict of suicide, delivering a narrative verdict that strongly condemned the culture at Deepcut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/03/deepcut-barracks-failed-duty-army-recruits-coroner-cheryl-james|title=Cheryl James died from 'self-inflicted shot', Deepcut inquest rules|last=Davies|first=Caroline|date=2016-06-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123022419/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/03/deepcut-barracks-failed-duty-army-recruits-coroner-cheryl-james|archive-date=23 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the verdict, Liberty called for reform to tackle the "pervasive sexualised culture" in the Armed Forces.

The second inquest into the death of Sean Benton also took place from January to June 2018, also in Woking. On 18 July 2018, Coroner [[Peter Rook|Peter Rook QC]] also recorded a verdict of suicide and again strongly criticised failings at Deepcut and in the Surrey Police investigation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/deepcut-barracks-sean-benton-inquest-british-army-latest-a8453806.html|title=Private Sean Benton was failed by Army, coroner concludes in Deepcut inquest|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925030922/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/deepcut-barracks-sean-benton-inquest-british-army-latest-a8453806.html|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the verdict, Liberty and Sean's family called for all serious crimes within the Armed Forces to be investigated by the civilian police, rather than the [[Royal Military Police]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/liberty-calls-civilian-police-investigate-all-military-crimes-0|title=Liberty calls for civilian police to investigate all military crimes after Coroner delivers highly critical verdict in Private Sean Benton inquest|last=sophiearmour|date=2018-07-18|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170216/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases-and-statements/liberty-calls-civilian-police-investigate-all-military-crimes-0|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement ====
Liberty represented the family of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, a Royal Military Police Office who took her own life in 2011 after alleging that she had been raped by two colleagues.<ref name="auto1"/> The allegations were investigated by military police themselves, and no charges were brought.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-26420252|title=Bullying 'factor in soldier suicide'|date=2014-03-03|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104171531/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-26420252|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

An initial inquest in March 2012 recorded a verdict of suicide, but Anne-Marie's family, represented by Liberty, used the Human Rights Act to secure a second, more thorough inquest. They alleged that Anne-Marie had been bullied and that the Royal Military Police had failed in their duty of care.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-19183015|title=New inquest for 'raped' soldier|date=2012-08-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104174600/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-19183015|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 3 July 2014, Nicholas Rheinberg – Coroner in the second inquest – ruled that bullying, the lingering effect of the alleged rape and "work-related despair" had contributed to Anne-Marie's suicide.<ref name="auto2"/>

In 2013, Anne-Marie's family, represented by Liberty, also used the threat of legal action under the Human Rights Act to compel the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and Royal Military Police to agree to refer the Anne-Marie's rape allegations for a fresh, independent investigation. This was carried out by [[Royal Air Force Police|RAF Police]] and [[Bedfordshire Police]], overseen by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases/anne-marie-ellement-fresh-investigation-rape-allegation-liberty-launches|title=Anne-Marie Ellement: Fresh investigation into rape allegation as Liberty launches "Military Justice" campaign|last=volunteer|date=2013-07-25|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170244/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/news/press-releases/anne-marie-ellement-fresh-investigation-rape-allegation-liberty-launches|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Mass surveillance ====
Following [[Edward Snowden]]'s whistleblowing in 2013, mass surveillance became a major part of Liberty's work.

Shortly after the revelations, Liberty brought a legal challenge to the UK government's practices with a coalition of other organisations, including [[Amnesty International]], [[Privacy International]] and [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28286105|title=Court hearing GCHQ surveillance case|date=2014-07-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104174605/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28286105|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2018, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]'s bulk interception practices had violated privacy rights and failed to provide sufficient safeguards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/gchq-data-collection-violated-human-rights-strasbourg-court-rules|title=GCHQ data collection regime violated human rights, court rules|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2018-09-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125095107/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/13/gchq-data-collection-violated-human-rights-strasbourg-court-rules|archive-date=25 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2014, Liberty represented MPs [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] and [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] in a legal challenge to the [[Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014|Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act]] (DRIPA), claiming that it breached privacy rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/04/mps-david-davis-and-tom-watson-in-court-challenge-over-surveillance-act|title=MPs David Davis and Tom Watson in court challenge over surveillance act|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2015-06-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113122939/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/04/mps-david-davis-and-tom-watson-in-court-challenge-over-surveillance-act|archive-date=13 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The case was referred to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) by the Court of Appeal, and in December 2016 the ECJ ruled that the general and indiscriminate retention of emails and electronic communications by governments was illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter|title=EU's highest court delivers blow to UK snooper's charter|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2016-12-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203233717/https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter|archive-date=3 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2018, the Court of Appeal found DRIPA unlawful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/30/uk-mass-digital-surveillance-regime-ruled-unlawful-appeal-ruling-snoopers-charter|title=UK mass digital surveillance regime ruled unlawful|last=Travis|first=Alan|date=2018-01-30|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214013113/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/30/uk-mass-digital-surveillance-regime-ruled-unlawful-appeal-ruling-snoopers-charter|archive-date=14 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Throughout 2016, Liberty campaigned against what it believed to be a serious lack of privacy safeguards in the Investigatory Powers Bill. The Bill passed in November 2016. In January 2017, Liberty launched a crowdfunder to raise funds to challenge the Act in the High Court, raising more than £53,000 in a week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/snoopers-charter/|title=The People vs the Snoopers' Charter|work=CrowdJustice|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104170101/https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/snoopers-charter/|archive-date=4 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Liberty's challenge to various parts of the Investigatory Powers Act is ongoing. In April 2018, the High Court issued its ruling on the first part of the challenge, giving the government six months to rewrite core parts of the Act, which it found incompatible with EU law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/27/snoopers-charter-investigatory-powers-act-rewrite-high-court-rules|title=UK has six months to rewrite snooper's charter, high court rules|last=Cobain|first=Ian|date=2018-04-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117074236/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/27/snoopers-charter-investigatory-powers-act-rewrite-high-court-rules|archive-date=17 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Equal pensions for same-sex couples ====
Liberty represented John Walker in a legal challenge to a loophole in the [[Equality Act 2010|Equality Act]] which let employers exempt same-sex spouses from spousal pension benefits. Upon retirement from [[Innospec]], John had discovered that his husband would only receive a few hundred pounds a year. If he were married to a woman, she would have received around £45,000.

In July 2017, the Supreme Court found the loophole unlawful under EU law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40580596|title=Gay man wins case for equal pension rights|date=2017-07-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105032224/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40580596|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Hostile environment policies ====
Liberty campaigned against the introduction of the '[[Home Office hostile environment policy|hostile environment]]' policies and has since campaigned for their repeal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/campaigning/immigration-act-2016|title=Immigration Act 2016|last=LaurenceHolmes|date=2015-11-06|website=Liberty Human Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105012123/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/campaigning/immigration-act-2016|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It has also campaigned against data-sharing arrangements between immigration enforcement and public services including hospitals, schools and police. In August 2017, Liberty exposed that the [[Home Office]] had secretly gained access to nationality data on homeless people in London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/19/home-office-secret-emails-data-homeless-eu-nationals|title=Home Office used charity data map to deport rough sleepers|last=Townsend|first=Mark|date=2017-08-19|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128092945/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/19/home-office-secret-emails-data-homeless-eu-nationals|archive-date=28 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Facial recognition ====
In June 2018, Liberty announced it would be representing Cardiff resident Ed Bridges in a legal challenge to South Wales Police's use of facial recognition technology in public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/14/police-face-legal-action-over-use-of-facial-recognition-cameras|title=Police face legal action over use of facial recognition cameras|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2018-06-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120051429/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/14/police-face-legal-action-over-use-of-facial-recognition-cameras|archive-date=20 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Liberty argues that the technology "is dangerously inaccurate and has the potential to trample on the freedoms we all take for granted".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/10/the-polices-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-will-affect-our-daily-freedoms-7822753/|title=The police's use of facial recognition technology will affect our daily freedoms|date=2018-08-10|work=Metro|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105012207/https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/10/the-polices-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-will-affect-our-daily-freedoms-7822753/|archive-date=5 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
