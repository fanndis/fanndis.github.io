'''Angus''' ({{lang-sco|Angus}}; {{lang-gd|Aonghas}}) is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas of Scotland]], a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. The council area borders [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Dundee City]] and [[Perth and Kinross]]. Main industries include [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Global pharmaceuticals company [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]] has a significant presence in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] in the north of the county.

Angus was historically a [[Shires of Scotland|county]] (known officially as '''Forfarshire''' from the 18th century until 1928), bordering [[Kincardineshire]] to the north-east, [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the north and [[Perthshire]] to the west; southwards it faced [[Fife]] across the [[Firth of Tay]]; these remain the borders of Angus, minus Dundee which now forms its own small separate council area). Angus remains a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. In 1975 some of its administrative functions were transferred to the council district of the [[Tayside]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|Region]], and in 1995 further reform resulted in the establishment of the unitary Angus Council.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name "Angus" indicates the territory of the eighth-century [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[Óengus I|of that name]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Place-names of Great Britain and Ireland |last=Field |first=John |date=1980 |publisher=David & Charles |isbn=0389201545 |location=Newton Abbot, Devon|oclc=6964610|page=24}}</ref>

===Prehistory===
The area that now comprises Angus has been occupied since at least the [[Neolithic period]]. Material taken from [[posthole]]s from an enclosure at Douglasmuir, near [[Friockheim]], about five miles north of Arbroath has been [[radiocarbon date]]d to around 3500&nbsp;BC. The function of the enclosure is unknown, but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes.<ref name="Douglasmuir">{{cite journal|last=Kendrick |first=Jill |others=contributions by Barclay, Gordon J.; Cowie, Trevor G.; Saville, Alan; illustrations by Townshend, Angela; Braby, Alan |year=1995 |url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_125/125_029_067.pdf |title=Excavation of a Neolithic enclosure and an Iron Age settlement at Douglasmuir, Angus |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=125 |pages=29–67 |url-status=dead |archivedate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100003/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_125/125_029_067.pdf}}</ref>

[[Bronze Age]] archaeology is to be found in abundance in the area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jervise |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Jervise |date=1863 |title=Notice of stone cists and an urn, found near Arbroath, Forfarshire |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=5 |pages=100–102 |url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_005/5_100_102.pdf |url-status=live |archive-date=11 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611232404/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_005/5_100_102.pdf}}</ref> [[Iron Age]] archaeology is also well represented, for example in the [[souterrain]] nearby Warddykes cemetery<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watkins |first=Trevor |others=contributions by Barclay, G. |date=1978 |title=Excavation of a settlement and souterrain at Newmill, near Bankfoot, Perthshire |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=110 |pages=165–208 |url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_110/110_165_208.pdf |url-status=live |archive-date=11 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611215131/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_110/110_165_208.pdf}}</ref> and at West Grange of Conan,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jervise |first=Andrew |date=1863 |title=An account of the excavation of the round or "bee-hive" shaped house, and other underground chambers, at West Grange of Conan, Forfarshire |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=4 |pages=429–499 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6o0vAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA492 |url-status=live |archive-date=11 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611154458/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_004/4_492_499.pdf}}</ref> as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.

===Medieval history===
The county is traditionally associated with the [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdom of Circinn, which is thought to have encompassed Angus and the [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]]. Bordering it were the kingdoms of Ce (Mar and Buchan) to the North, Fotla (Atholl) to the West, and Fib (Fife) to the South.

The most visible remnants of the Pictish age are the numerous [[Pictish stones|sculptured stones]] that can be found throughout Angus. Of particular note are the collections found at [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones|Aberlemno]], [[St Vigeans Sculptured Stones Museum|St Vigeans]], [[Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones|Kirriemuir]] and [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones|Monifieth]].

Angus is marketed as the birthplace of Scotland. The signing of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] at [[Arbroath Abbey]] in 1320 marked Scotland's establishment as an independent nation. It is an area of rich history from Pictish times onwards. Notable historic sites in addition to Arbroath Abbey include Glamis Castle, Arbroath Signal Tower museum and the Bell Rock Light House.

==Geography==
[[File:Craigowl hill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Craigowl Hill]], highest of the Sidlaws, in southern Angus]]
Angus can be split into three geographic areas. To the north and west, the [[topography]] is mountainous. This is the area of the [[Grampian Mountains]], [[Mounth]] hills and [[Five Glens of Angus]], which is sparsely populated and where the main industry is [[hill farming]]. [[Glas Maol]] – the highest point in Angus at 1,068&nbsp;m (3,504&nbsp;ft) – can be found here, on the [[tripoint]] boundary with Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. To the south and east the topography consists of rolling hills (such as the [[Sidlaws]]) bordering the sea; this area is well populated, with the larger towns. In between lies [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]] (''the Great Valley''), which is a fertile agricultural area noted for the growing of potatoes, soft fruit and the raising of [[Angus cattle]].

Montrose in the north east of the county is notable for its [[Montrose Basin|tidal basin]]. Angus's coast is fairly regular, the most prominent features being the headlands of [[Scurdie Ness]] and [[Buddon Ness]]. The main bodies of water in the county are [[Loch Lee]], [[Loch Brandy]], [[Carlochy]], [[Loch Wharral]], [[Den of Ogil Reservoir]], [[Loch of Forfar]], [[Loch Fithie]], [[Rescobie Loch]], [[Balgavies Loch]], [[Crombie Reservoir]], [[Monikie Reservoirs]], [[Long Loch]], [[Lundie Loch]], [[Loch of Kinnordy]], [[Loch of Lintrathen]], [[Backwater Reservoir]], [[Auchintaple Loch]], [[Loch Shandra]], and [[Loch Esk]].{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

===Language in Angus===
The most recent available census results (2001) show that [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] is spoken by 0.45% of the Angus population. This, similar to other lowland areas, is lower than the national average of 1.16%.<ref>{{citation |title=Scotlands Census Results Online (SCROL) |work=Comparative Population Profile: Angus Council Area Scotland |url=http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&mainArea=Angus&mainLevel=CouncilArea |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> These figures are self-reported and are not broken down into levels of fluency.

Meanwhile, the 2011 census found that 38.4% of the population in Angus can speak [[Scots language|Scots]], above the Scottish average of 30.1%. This puts Angus as the council area with the sixth highest proficiency in Scots, behind only [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], [[Moray]], [[Aberdeenshire]], and [[East Ayrshire]].

Historically, the dominant language in Angus was [[Pictish language|Pictish]] until the sixth to seventh centuries AD when the area became progressively gaelicised, with Pictish extinct by the mid-ninth century.<ref>Forsyth, 1997; Forsyth, 2006{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}</ref> Gaelic/[[Middle Irish]] began to retreat from lowland areas in the late-eleventh century and was absent from the Eastern lowlands by the fourteenth century. It was replaced there by [[Middle Scots]], the contemporary local [[South Northern]] dialect of [[Modern Scots]], while Gaelic persisted as a majority language in the highland Glens until the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smout |first=T.C. |authorlink=Christopher Smout |title=A history of the Scottish people: 1650–1830 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4SRmgEACAAJ&pg=PP1 |year=2001 |publisher=Fontana Press |isbn=978-0-00-686027-3}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Withers |first=Charles W.

Angus Council are planning to raise the status of Gaelic in the county by adopting a series of measures, including bilingual road signage, communications, vehicle livery and staffing.<ref>{{cite report |publisher=Angus Council |title=Gaelic Language Plan 2014-2019 |url=http://www.angus.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/968/angus_gaelic_plan_2014_-_english_version.pdf |date=17 September 2014 |access-date=6 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817060508/http://www.angus.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/968/angus_gaelic_plan_2014_-_english_version.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Government==

===Local government===
'''Angus Council''' is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas of Scotland]]. In 1996, the two-tier local government council was abolished and Angus was established as one of the replacement single-tier [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Council Areas]]. Prior to 1974 the county had been served by Angus District Council and [[Tayside]] Regional Council. As of May 2017 there are 28 seats on the council. From the May 2017 elections the seats are held as follows – Independent 9, SNP 9, Conservative 8, Liberal Democrat 2.

The council's civic head is the Provost of Angus. There have been six Provosts since its establishment in 1996 – Frances Duncan, Bill Middleton, Ruth Leslie-Melville, Helen Oswald and Alex King. On 16 May 2017 Cllr Ronnie Proctor was appointed Provost from the councillors elected in Angus at the 2017 elections. As Angus is a county area the [[Lord Lieutenant of Angus]] is separate role.

The council has had four Chief Executives since its formation – Sandy Watson 1996–2006, David Sawers 2006–2011, Richard Stiff 2011–2017 and Margo Williamson 2017 to date. Margo Williamson is the first female Chief Executive since the council was formed. The council's main offices are located at Angus House at Orchardbank in Forfar and at Bruce House in Arbroath while council meetings are held in the Town and County Hall in central Forfar. The council's offices include the historic County Buildings in Forfar adjacent to the Sheriff Court.

The boundaries of the present council area are the same as those of the historic county minus the City of [[Dundee]].

The council area borders [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Dundee City]] and [[Perth and Kinross]].

{{As of|2018}} Angus is divided into 25 [[Community council#Scotland|community council area]]s and all apart from Friockheim district have an active council.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.angus.gov.uk/have_your_say/community_councils/find_your_community_council |title=Find your community council |publisher=Angus Council |accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> The areas are: [[Aberlemno]]; [[Auchterhouse]]; [[Carnoustie]]; [[City of Brechin & District]]; [[Ferryden & Craig]]; [[Friockheim & District]]; [[Glamis]]; [[Hillside, Dun, & Logie Pert]]; [[Inverarity]]; [[Inveresk (community council area)|Inveresk]]; [[Kirriemuir]]; [[Kirriemuir Landward East]]; [[Kirriemuir Landward West]]; [[Letham & District]]; [[Lunanhead & District]]; [[Monifieth]]; [[Monikie & Newbigging]]; [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]; [[Muirhead, Angus|Muirhead]], [[Birkhill and Liff]]; [[Murroes & Wellbank]]; [[Newtyle & Eassie]]; [[Arbroath|Royal Burgh of Arbroath]]; [[Royal Burgh of Forfar]]; [[Strathmartine]]; and [[Tealing]].
