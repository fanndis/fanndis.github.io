'''Kristoffer "Kris" Kristofferson''' (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer-songwriter and actor. Among his songwriting credits are the songs "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]", "[[For the Good Times (song)|For the Good Times]]", "[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]", and "[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]", all of which were hits for other artists. Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] songwriters such as [[Shel Silverstein]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lyrics.filestube.com/song/c834334c8fe0c2c303ea,Once-More-with-Feeling.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714105057/http://lyrics.filestube.com/song/c834334c8fe0c2c303ea,Once-More-with-Feeling.html |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=Once More with Feeling |author=[[Shel Silverstein|Silverstein, Shel]] & Kristofferson, Kris |publisher=Files Tube Lyrics |year=2004 |url-status=dead |access-date=February 2, 2013 }}</ref> 

In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Johnny Cash]] in forming the country music supergroup [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], and formed a key creative force in the [[outlaw country]] music movement that eschewed the Nashville music machine in favor of independent songwriting and producing.
In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. As an actor, he is known for his roles in ''[[Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid]]'' (1973), ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973), ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1976) (which earned him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]]),  ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980) ''[[Stagecoach (1986 film)|Stagecoach (1986)]]'' and ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' (1998).

== Early life ==
Kristoffer Kristofferson was born in [[Brownsville, Texas]], to Mary Ann (née Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer (later a [[U.S. Air Force]] [[major general]]).<ref name="Times, San Mateo">{{cite news |title=Death claims famed pilot |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/52168909/henry-christopher-kristofferson/ |access-date=May 26, 2020 |work=The Times |date=January 4, 1971 |location=San Mateo, California |page=3 |quote=Famed Pilot Henry C.

At the age of 17, Kristofferson took a summer job with a [[dredging]] contractor on [[Wake Island]]. He called it "the hardest job I ever had".<ref>interview on Hawaii Public Radio, June 2, 2011</ref>

== Education ==
Like most "[[military brats]]", Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in [[San Mateo, California]], where he graduated from [[San Mateo High School]] in 1954. An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in [[Pomona College]] that same year. Kris Kristofferson's early writing included essays which won him prizes, and "The Rock" and "Gone Are the Days" were published in ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]''. These early stories reveal the roots of Kristofferson's passions and concerns. "The Rock" is about a geographical feature that resembled the form of a woman, while the latter was about a racial incident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kriskristoffersonfan.com/sample-page/biography/kris-kristofferson-short-stories/|title=Kris Kristofferson Short Stories|website=Kris Kristofferson by Fans, for Fans|language=en-US|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref>

He experienced his first dose of fame in 1958 when he appeared in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''{{'s}} "[[Faces in the Crowd (Sports Illustrated)|Faces in the Crowd]]" on March 31 for his achievements in collegiate [[rugby union]], [[American football]], and track and field.<ref name=sipobck>{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1958/03/31/670415/kristoffer-kristofferson |magazine=Sports Illustrated |title=Kristoffer Kristofferson |agency=(A Pat on the Back) |date=March 31, 1958 |page=80}}</ref> He and his classmates revived the [[Claremont Colleges]] Rugby Club in 1958, which has remained a Southern California rugby institution. Kristofferson graduated in 1958 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, ''[[summa cum laude]]'', in [[literature]]. He was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] his junior year. In a 2004 interview with ''Pomona College Magazine'', Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor [[Frederick Sontag]] as an important influence in his life.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pomona.edu/Magazine/PCMWin04/FSkristofferson.shtml |title=Acts of Will |journal=Pomona College Magazine |issue=Winter 2004 |url-status=dead |access-date=February 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907031352/http://www.pomona.edu/Magazine/pcmwin04/FSkristofferson.shtml |archive-date=September 7, 2013 }}</ref>

Kristofferson earned a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he studied at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]].<ref name="MCreg">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=505}}</ref> While at Oxford, he was awarded his [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] for [[boxing]],<ref name=MCreg /> played [[Rugby union|rugby]] for his college, and began writing songs. At Oxford, he was also acquainted with fellow Rhodes scholar, art critic, and poet  [[Michael Fried]]. With the help of his manager, [[Larry Parnes]], Kristofferson recorded for [[Top Rank Records]] under the name Kris Carson. Parnes was working to sell Kristofferson as "a Yank at Oxford" to the British public; Kristofferson was willing to accept that promotional approach if it helped his singing career, which he hoped would enable him to progress towards his goal of becoming a novelist.<ref>Schneider, Jason [https://archive.is/20120709062416/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=137&csid2=9&fid1=41445 "Kris Kristofferson: the Pilgrim's Progress"] "[[Exclaim!]]" October 2009.</ref> This early phase of his music career was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohboy.com/krisbio.html |title=Oh Boy Records &#124; Kris Kristofferson Bio |publisher=Ohboy.com |access-date=April 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105011304/http://www.ohboy.com/krisbio.html |archive-date=November 5, 2009 }}</ref>

His award was presented to him by one of his Pomona mentors, Professor Fred Sontag.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-11-07|title=1973|url=https://www.pomona.edu/timeline/1970s/1973|access-date=2020-12-04|website=Pomona College Timeline|language=en}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Military service ===

Kristofferson, under pressure from his family, joined the U.S. Army, was commissioned as a second lieutenant and attained the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]]. He became a helicopter pilot after receiving flight training at [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]]. He also completed [[Ranger School]]. During the early-1960s, he was stationed in [[West Germany]] as a member of the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Kristofferson: The Wild American|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FILwohIvXCMC&lpg=PT70|publisher = Omnibus Press|date = December 17, 2009|isbn = 9780857121097|first = Stephen|last = Miller}}</ref> During this time, he resumed his music career and formed a band. In 1965, when his tour in Germany ended, Kristofferson was given an assignment to teach English literature at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/kris-kristoffersons-rock-and-rules |title=Kris Kristofferson's Rock And Rules &#124; Clash Music Exclusive Interview |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=July 27, 2010 |access-date=January 5, 2012}}</ref> Instead, he decided to leave the Army and pursue songwriting.

=== Music ===

After leaving the army in 1965, Kristofferson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He worked at a variety of odd jobs while struggling for success in music while burdened with medical expenses resulting from his son's defective [[esophagus]]. He and his wife soon divorced.

He got a job sweeping floors at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville. He met [[June Carter]] there and asked her to give [[Johnny Cash]] a tape of his. She did, but Cash put it on a large pile with others. He also worked as a commercial helicopter pilot for south Louisiana firm [[Petroleum Helicopters International]] (PHI), based in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]. Kristofferson recalled of his days as a pilot, "That was about the last three years before I started performing, before people started cutting my songs. I would work a week down here [in south Louisiana] for PHI, sitting on an oil platform and flying helicopters. Then I'd go back to Nashville at the end of the week and spend a week up there trying to pitch the songs, then come back down and write songs for another week. I can remember '[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]' I wrote sitting on top of an oil platform. I wrote '[[Me and Bobby McGee|Bobby McGee]]' down here, and a lot of them [in south Louisiana]."<ref>Ron Thibodeaux, [http://www.nola.com/music/t-p/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/116478236147900.xml&coll=1 "He Made It through the Night"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185002/http://www.nola.com/music/t-p/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment-0%2F116478236147900.xml&coll=1 |date=September 30, 2007 }} ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'', November 29, 2006.</ref>

Weeks after giving Carter his tapes, Kristofferson landed a helicopter in Cash's front yard, gaining his full attention.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Hawke | first = Ethan | author-link = Ethan Hawke| title = The Last Outlaw Poet | journal = [[Rolling Stone]]| issue = 1076 | page = 57 | date = April 16, 2009  | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/27113898/the_last_outlaw_poet | access-date = May 23, 2009}}</ref> A story about Kristofferson having a beer in one hand and some songs in the other upon arrival was reputed, but has been disproven, with Kristofferson saying that, "It was still kind of an invasion of privacy that I wouldn't recommend. To be honest, I don't think he was there... John had a pretty creative memory."<ref>[https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2010/06/10/Never-a-great-singer-Kris-Kristofferson-has-had-an-amazing-career-nonetheless/stories/201006100491 "Never a great singer, Kris Kristofferson has had an amazing career nonetheless"]. ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''.</ref> But upon hearing "[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]", Cash decided to record it, and that year Kristofferson won Songwriter of the Year at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards|Country Music Awards]].

[[File:Kris Kristofferson Rita Coolidge.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kristofferson with Rita Coolidge at the 1972 [[Dripping Springs Reunion]]]]

In 1966, [[Dave Dudley]] released a successful Kristofferson single, "Viet Nam Blues". In 1967, Kristofferson signed to [[Epic Records]] and released a single, "Golden Idol/Killing Time", but the song was not successful. Within the next few years, more Kristofferson originals hit the [[Record chart|charts]], performed by [[Roy Drusky]] ("Jody and the Kid"); [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] & the Tennessee Walkers ("From the Bottle to the Bottom"); [[Ray Stevens]] ("[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]"); [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] ("Once More with Feeling"); [[Faron Young]] ("Your Time's Comin'"); and [[Roger Miller]] ("Me and Bobby McGee", "Best of all Possible Worlds", and "Darby's Castle"). He achieved some success as a performer himself, following Johnny Cash's introduction of him at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].

Kristofferson signed with [[Monument Records]] as a recording artist. In addition to running that label, [[Fred Foster]] also served as manager of [[Combine Music]], Kristofferson's songwriting label. His debut album for Monument in 1970 was ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]'', which included a few new songs, as well as many of his previous hits. Sales were poor, although this debut album would become a success the following year when it was re-released under the title ''Me & Bobby McGee''. Kristofferson's compositions were still in demand. [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] ("[[For the Good Times (song)|For the Good Times]]"), [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]] ("Help Me Make It Through The Night"), [[Waylon Jennings]] ("The Taker"), [[Bobby Bare]] ("Come Sundown"), [[Johnny Cash]] ("Sunday Morning Coming Down"), and [[Sammi Smith]] ("Help Me Make It Through the Night") all recorded successful versions of his songs in the early-1970s. "For the Good Times" ([[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]) won "Song of the Year" in 1970 from the [[Academy of Country Music]], while "Sunday Morning Coming Down" (Johnny Cash) won the same award from the Academy's rival, the [[Country Music Association]], in the same year. This is the only time an individual received the same award from these two organizations in the same year for different songs.

In 1971, [[Janis Joplin]], who dated Kristofferson for some time until her death, had a number one [[hit single|hit]] with "Me and Bobby McGee" from her posthumous album ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]''. When released, it stayed on the number-one spot on the charts for weeks. More hits followed from others: Ray Price ("I'd Rather Be Sorry"); [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]] ("Help Me Make It Through the Night"); [[Bobby Bare]] ("Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends"); [[O.C. Smith]] ("Help Me Make It Through the Night"); [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] ("Me and Bobby McGee"); [[Patti Page]] ("I'd Rather Be Sorry"); and [[Peggy Little]] ("I've Got to Have You"). Country music performer [[Kenny Rogers]] has also recorded some of Kristofferson's compositions, including a version of "Me and Bobby McGee" in 1969 with [[The First Edition (album)|The First Edition]] for the ''[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town]]'' album.

Kristofferson released his second album, ''[[The Silver Tongued Devil and I]]'' in 1971. It included "[[Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)]]". It was a success and established Kristofferson's career as a recording artist in his own right. Soon after, Kristofferson made his acting debut in ''[[The Last Movie]]'' (directed by [[Dennis Hopper]]) and appeared at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]]. A portion of his Isle of Wight performance is featured on the three disc compilation,  ''The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies''. In 1971, he acted in ''[[Cisco Pike]]'' and released his third album, ''[[Border Lord]]''. The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish. He also swept the [[Grammy Awards]] that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for "Help Me Make It Through the Night". Kristofferson's 1972 fourth album, ''[[Jesus Was a Capricorn]]'', initially had slow sales, but the third single, "[[Why Me (Kris Kristofferson song)|Why Me]]", was a success and significantly increased album sales. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on November 8, 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330 330]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330}}</ref>

In 1972, Kristofferson appeared with [[Rita Coolidge]] on British TV on BBC's ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', performing a physically intimate version of "Help Me Make It Through the Night". In 1972 Al Green released his version of "For the Good Times" on the album ''I'm Still in Love with You''.

=== Film ===
For the next several years, Kristofferson focused on acting. He appeared in ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973) directed by [[Paul Mazursky]], and three [[Sam Peckinpah]] films: ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973), ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974), and ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978) and Michael Ritchie's ''[[Semi-Tough]]'' (1977) with Burt Reynolds. He continued acting in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[Vigilante Force]]'' (1976), and ''[[The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (film)|The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea]]'' (1976), the romantic drama ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1976) with [[Barbra Streisand]], for which he received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]] soon followed. At the peak of his box office power, Kristofferson turned down [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977) and the romantic war film ''[[Hanover Street (film)|Hanover Street]]'' (1979). Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson's solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (album)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]''. His next film, the two-part 1979 [[NBC]]-TV movie ''[[Freedom Road]]'', did not get good ratings.

Kristofferson was next cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in [[Michael Cimino]]'s bleak and sprawling 1980 anti-Western ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''. Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time (it cost Kristofferson his Hollywood A-list status), the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years. In 1986, he starred in ''[[The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James]]'' with Johnny Cash and [[Flashpoint (1984 film)|''Flashpoint'']] in 1984, directed by William Tannen.  In 1987, Kristofferson starred in the seven-episode TV series ''[[Amerika (TV miniseries)|Amerika]]'' with [[Robert Urich]] and [[Christine Lahti]]. In 1989, he was the male lead in the film ''[[Millennium (film)|Millennium]]'' with [[Cheryl Ladd]]. In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt [[South Texas]] sheriff in John Sayles's ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'', a film nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay. In 1997, he co-starred in the film ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' with [[Steven Seagal]].

In 1998, he took a role in the film ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', alongside [[Wesley Snipes]], as [[Blade (comics)|Blade's]] mentor [[Abraham Whistler]]. He reprised the role in ''[[Blade II]]'' (2002) and again in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004). In 1998 he starred in [[Dance with Me (1998 film)|Dance with Me]] along with [[Vanessa Williams]] and [[Chayanne]]. In 1999, he co-starred with Mel Gibson in ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]''. He was then in the 2001 Tim Burton version of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. He has also played the title character "Yohan" as an old man in the Norwegian film ''Yohan—the Children Wanderer''.  He co-starred in the 2011 film ''[[Dolphin Tale]]'' and its 2014 sequel, ''[[Dolphin Tale 2]]''. In 2012, Kristofferson was in ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' with longtime friend, [[Dolly Parton]]. In 2013, Kristofferson co-starred in ''[[The Motel Life (film)|The Motel Life]]'', as well as ''[[Angels Sing]]'' with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Lyle Lovett]]. In 2006, Kristofferson starred with [[Geneviève Bujold]] in the film ''[[Disappearances (film)|Disappearances]]'' about whiskey running from Quebec to the US during the [[Great Depression]].

=== Mid-career ===
After his singing success in the early-1970s, Kristofferson met singer Rita Coolidge. They married in 1973 and released an album titled ''[[Full Moon (Kris Kristofferson album)|Full Moon]]'', another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations. However, his fifth album, ''[[Spooky Lady's Sideshow]]'', released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his musical career. Artists such as [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[John Duncan (artist)|Johnny Duncan]] continued to record Kristofferson's material with success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum. Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including [[Willie Nelson]], whose 1979 LP release of ''[[Sings Kristofferson|(Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson]]'' reached number five on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S.

In 1979, Kris Kristofferson traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place on March 2–4, alongside Rita Coolidge, [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Mike Finnegan, [[Weather Report]], and [[Billy Joel]], plus an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata Güines]], and [[Orquesta Aragón]]. His performance is captured on [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]''.

On November 18, 1979, Kristofferson and Coolidge appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', where Kristofferson sang "[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]" with [[Miss Piggy]], Coolidge sang "[[We're All Alone]]" with forest animals, and the pair sang "[[Full Moon (Kris Kristofferson album)|Song I'd Like to Sing]]" with the Muppet monsters. They divorced in 1980.

===Later work===
In 1982, Kristofferson joined [[Willie Nelson]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Brenda Lee]] on ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', a double album consisting of remastered and updated performances of recordings the four artists had made for the Monument label during the mid-1960s; the album reached the top-ten on the U.S. country album charts. He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in the 1984 releases ''[[The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]]'' and ''[[Songwriter (1984 film)|Songwriter]]''. Nelson and Kristofferson both appeared in ''Songwriter'', and Kristofferson was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song Score]]. The album ''[[Music from Songwriter]]'', featuring Nelson-Kristofferson duets, was a massive country success.

Nelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]] to form the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]]. Their first album, ''[[Highwayman (The Highwaymen album)|Highwayman]],'' was a success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time. The single from the album, also entitled "[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]", and especially written for them by [[Jimmy Webb]], was awarded the ACM's single of the year in 1985.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kristofferson_kris/bio.jhtml "Kris Kristofferson Biography"] "[[Country Music Television|CMT]]" 2004.</ref> In 1985, Kristofferson starred in ''[[Trouble in Mind (film)|Trouble in Mind]]'' and released ''[[Repossessed (album)|Repossessed]]'', a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly "They Killed Him" (also performed by [[Bob Dylan]]), a tribute to his heroes, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Jesus, and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Kristofferson also appeared in ''[[Amerika (miniseries)|Amerika]]'' at about the same time, a miniseries that attempted to depict life in America under [[Soviet]] control.

[[File:Kris Kristofferson SXSW 2006 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Kristofferson at the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] Festival]]
In spite of the success of ''[[Highwayman 2]]'' in 1990, Kristofferson's solo recording career slipped significantly in the early-1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen. ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996 film by [[John Sayles]]) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', ''[[Blade II]]'', ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', ''[[A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (film)|A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries]]'', ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'', [[Tim Burton]]'s remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Chelsea Walls]]'', ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'', ''[[The Jacket]]'', and ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]''.

The [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as had the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] earlier, in 1977. In 1999, ''[[The Austin Sessions (Kris Kristofferson album)|The Austin Sessions]]'', was released, an album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of artists such as [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. In 2003, ''[[Broken Freedom Song: Live from San Francisco|Broken Freedom Song]]'' was released, a live album recorded in San Francisco.

In 2003, he received the "Spirit of Americana" free speech award from The [[Americana Music Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20031009_americana_awards_honor_kristofferson_douglas_prine_and_phillips|title=Americana Awards Honor Kristofferson, Douglas, Prine and Phillips|date=October 8, 2003|website=BMI|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. In 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; ''[[This Old Road]]''. On April 21, 2007, Kristofferson won [[Country Music Television|CMT's]] Johnny Cash Visionary Award. [[Rosanne Cash]], Cash's daughter, presented the honor during the April 16 awards show in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Previous recipients include Cash, [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Reba McEntire]], and the [[Dixie Chicks]]. "John was my hero before he was my friend, and anything with his name on it is really an honor in my eyes," Kristofferson said during a phone interview. "I was thinking back to when I first met him, and if I ever thought that I'd be getting an award with his name on it, it would have carried me through a lot of hard times."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/12/AR2007031200851.html|title=Kris Kristofferson to Receive CMT Award|first=JOHN|last=GEROME|date=March 12, 2007|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Taping was done in Nashville.

Kristofferson released a new album of original songs entitled ''[[Closer to the Bone]]'' on September 29, 2009. It is produced by [[Don Was]] on the [[New West]] label.

== Personal life ==
Kristofferson married Lisa Meyers in 1983. They own a home in Los Flores Canyon in Malibu, California,<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite magazine |last=Strauss |first=Neil  |date=June 6, 2016 |title=Kris Kristofferson: An Outlaw at 80 – Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/kris-kristofferson-an-outlaw-at-80-20160606 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref> and maintain a residence in Hana on the island of Maui. He became a Christian in 1971 at the church of Pastor Jimmie Rogers Snow (son of singer [[Hank Snow]]).

Kristofferson has encountered a few serious medical issues in the past few decades. He had successful bypass surgery in 1999, but from 2004 to 2015 suffered from what was finally diagnosed as [[Lyme disease]], although it was initially and incorrectly thought to be early onset Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear how Kristofferson contracted Lyme disease but it is suspected that he caught it while filming a movie in the woods of Vermont in 2002. His wife credits the successful diagnosis and recovery to getting second opinions when dealing with auto-immune and Alzheimer-type diagnoses. Kristofferson is currently being treated by a specialist in California "who added antibiotic intramuscular injections to Kris's protocol and is continuing to treat Kris", his wife reported.<ref name="rollingstone.com" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-slow-slipping-away-kris-kristoffersons-long_us_577c047be4b00a3ae4ce6609 |title="A Slow Slipping Away"- Kris Kristofferson's Long-Undiagnosed Battle with Lyme Disease &#124; HuffPost |last=Parish |first=Dana  |date=July 6, 2016 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref>

daughter Casey (b. 1974) from his second marriage, to Rita Coolidge; and Jesse (b. 1983), Jody (b. 1985), Johnny (b. 1988), Kelly Marie (b. 1990), and Blake (b. 1994) from his marriage to his current wife, Lisa (Meyers) Kristofferson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/105678%7C0/Kris-Kristofferson/family.html |title=Family for Kris Kristofferson |website=Tcm.com |date=June 22, 1936 |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref>

Kristofferson has said that he would like the first three lines of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Bird on the Wire]]" on his tombstone:<ref>{{cite web|last=Schneider |first=Jason |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/kris_kristofferson-_pilgrims_progress |title=Kris Kristofferson The Pilgrim's Progress |website=Exclaim.ca |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref>
