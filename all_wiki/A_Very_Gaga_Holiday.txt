'''''A Very Gaga Holiday''''' is a live [[extended play|EP]] released by [[Lady Gaga]], containing songs performed on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] holiday television special ''[[A Very Gaga Thanksgiving]]''. It was made available for purchase in the United States on November 22, 2011, exclusively on the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and on November 26 in the rest of the world. The EP is made up of [[jazz]] [[cover version|covers]] of the songs "[[Orange Colored Sky]]" and "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]", the latter featuring an extra verse added by Gaga herself, and acoustic versions of "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]" and "[[The Edge of Glory]]", both songs originally from the singer's second studio album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' (2011). A recurring theme on the EP is Gaga stopping midway through singing to talk about background information on the songs with her listeners.

Following its release, ''A Very Gaga Holiday'' received mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]]. Reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], writing for [[Allmusic]], listed "White Christmas" and "Orange Colored Sky" as highlights.

==Composition==
Gaga's cover of "White Christmas" is a "[[jazz]]y rendition" and features an extra verse about a snowman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2011/11/lady-gaga-totally-feeling-holiday-spirit/|first=Marc|last=Hogan|title=Lady Gaga Is Totally Feeling the Holiday Spirit|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 23, 2011|accessdate=November 23, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125185435/https://www.spin.com/2011/11/lady-gaga-totally-feeling-holiday-spirit/|archivedate=November 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, "So as you can tell, I'm very outgoing and a little bit shy, but I've decided that this song is just too short.

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] awarded the EP three out of five stars, saying that the release was an "attractive holiday bauble" and that although Gaga's main persona was about authenticity, she appeared to "push her affectations" much more than required on the songs.
