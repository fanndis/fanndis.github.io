'''Richard Wagstaff Clark'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/dick-clark/person/2798/summary.html |title=Dick Clark on |publisher=TV |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV5V-7JMV Dick Clark's death record] at Family Search</ref> (November 30, 1929&nbsp;– April 18, 2012) was an American [[radio personality|radio]] and [[television personality]], television producer and film actor, as well as a cultural icon who remains best known for hosting ''[[American Bandstand]]'' from 1956 to 1989. He also hosted the game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' and ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'', which transmitted [[Times Square]]'s New Year's Eve celebrations.

As host of ''American Bandstand'', Clark introduced [[rock & roll]] to many Americans. The show gave many new music artists their first exposure to national audiences, including [[Iggy Pop]], [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[Madonna]]. 

Episodes he hosted were among the first in which blacks and whites performed on the same stage, and likewise among the first in which the live studio audience sat without racial segregation. Singer [[Paul Anka]] claimed that ''Bandstand'' was responsible for creating a "youth culture". Due to his perennially youthful appearance and his largely teenaged audience of ''American Bandstand'', Clark was often referred to as "America's oldest teenager" or "the world's oldest teenager".<ref name=HOF>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/dick-clark/bio/ |title=Dick Clark Biography |publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

In his off-stage roles, Clark served as [[Chief Executive Officer]] of [[Dick Clark Productions]] (a financial interest in which he sold off in his later years). He also founded the American Bandstand Diner, a restaurant chain modeled after the [[Hard Rock Cafe]].{{vague|date=November 2017|reason=pretty sure HRC began post-'73, & that ABD thus deviates from HRC model in being [[retro]] rather than [[wikt:au courant|au courant]].

Clark suffered a [[stroke]] in December 2004. With speech ability impaired, Clark returned to his ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' show a year later on December 31, 2005. Subsequently, he appeared at the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2006, and every ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' show through the December 31, 2011 episode. He died on April 18, 2012, of a heart attack, at the age of 82, following prostate surgery.<ref name="abcnews1">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/dick-clark-entertainment-icon-nicknamed-americas-oldest-teenager/story?id=16076252|title=Dick Clark, Entertainment Icon Nicknamed 'America's Oldest Teenager,' Dies at 82|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=April 18, 2012|date=April 18, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Clark was born and raised in [[Mount Vernon, New York]],<ref name="nyt obit">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/arts/television/dick-clark-tv-host-and-icon-of-new-years-eve-is-dead-at-82.html?pagewanted=all |title=TV Emperor of Rock 'n' Roll and New Year's Eve Dies at 82 |author=Bruce Weber |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> to Richard Augustus Clark and Julia Fuller Clark, {{nee}} Barnard.

Clark attended A.B. Davis High School (later renamed A.B. Davis Middle School) in Mount Vernon, where he was an average student.<ref name=history>{{cite web |title=Dick Clark |url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/clark.htm |work=The History of Rock 'n' Roll |author=DK Peneny |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> At the age of 10, Clark decided to pursue a career in radio.<ref name=history/> In pursuit of that goal, he attended [[Syracuse University]], graduating in 1951 with a degree in advertising and a minor in radio.<ref name=history/> While at Syracuse, he was a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Phi Gamma).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_150/157_dick_clark_interview.html |title=Dick Clark |publisher=AskMen.com |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209084625/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_150/157_dick_clark_interview.html |archive-date=December 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Radio and television career==
In 1945, Clark began his career working in the mailroom at [[WUTI|WRUN]], an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio station in [[Rome, New York]], that was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. Almost immediately, he was asked to fill in for the vacationing weatherman, and within a few months he was announcing station breaks.<ref name=history />

While attending Syracuse, Clark worked at [[WOLF (AM)|WOLF-AM]], then a country music station. After graduation, he returned to WRUN for a short time where he went by the name Dick Clay.<ref name=history /> After that, Clark got a job at the television station [[WKTV]] in [[Utica, New York]].<ref name=history/> His first television-hosting job was on ''Cactus Dick and the Santa Fe Riders'', a [[country music|country-music]] program. He later replaced [[Robert Earle]] (who later hosted the ''[[College Bowl|GE College Bowl]]'') as a newscaster.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rock, Roll and Remember |first1=Dick |last1=Clark |first2=Richard |last2=Robinson |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[Thomas Y.

In addition to his announcing duties on radio and television, Clark owned several radio stations. From 1964 to 1978, he owned KPRO (now [[KFOO (AM)|KFOO]]) in [[Riverside, California]] under the name Progress Broadcasting.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/64-OCR/1964-12-28-BC-OCR-Page-0009.pdf |title=KPRO, WLOB sales announced |magazine=Broadcasting |publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc. |page=9 |date=December 28, 1964 |access-date=June 2, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/78-OCR/1978-03-27-BC-OCR-Page-0043.pdf |title=Changing Hands |magazine=Broadcasting |publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc. |page=43 |date=March 27, 1978 |access-date=June 2, 2018 }}</ref> In 1967, he purchased KGUD-AM-FM (now [[KTMS]] and [[KTYD]] respectively) in [[Santa Barbara, California]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/67-OCR/1967-11-13-BC-OCR-Page-0051.pdf |title=Changing Hands |magazine=Broadcasting |publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc. |page=51 |date=November 13, 1967 |access-date=June 2, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-Billboard-IDX/IDX/60s/1967/Billboard%201967-07-08-OCR-Page-0032.pdf |last=Tiegel |first=Eliot |title=Smothers Set Youthful Pace |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Billboard Publications Inc. |page=32 |date=July 8, 1967 |access-date=June 2, 2018 }}</ref>

===''American Bandstand''===
{{main|American Bandstand}}
In 1952, Clark moved to [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], where he took a job as a disc jockey at radio station [[WFIL]], adopting the Dick Clark handle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Clark, legendary host of 'American Bandstand,' dies at 82 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2012/04/18/3562924/dick-clark-legendary-host-of-american.html |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher=KansasCity |author=Dan Deluca, Sam Wood and Michael D.

Clark was responsible for a similar program on the company's radio station, and served as a regular substitute host when Horn went on vacation.<ref name=history /> In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving and was subsequently dismissed.<ref name=history/> On July 9, 1956, Clark became the show's permanent host.<ref name=history/>

''Bandstand'' was picked up by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network, renamed ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and debuted nationally on August 5, 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleynews.com/DickClark.html|title=Dick Clark&nbsp;— Elvis 1961 Interview; American Bandstand Compare: Dick Clark; Dick Clark's Elvis Collection Sold at Auction|publisher=elvispresleynews.com|accessdate=December 31, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122210808/http://elvispresleynews.com/DickClark.html|archive-date=January 22, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show took off, due to Clark's natural rapport with the live teenage audience and dancing participants as well as the "clean-cut, non-threatening image" he projected to television audiences.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bertram |first1=Colin |title=The Dick Clark Effect: It's Everywhere |url=https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/dick-clark-effect-popular-culture/1954568/ |website=nbcchicago.com |publisher=NBC Universal, Inc. |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref> As a result, many parents were introduced to rock and roll music. According to Hollywood producer [[Michael Uslan]], "he was able to use his unparalleled communication skills to present [[rock 'n roll]] in a way that was palatable to parents."<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dick-clark-obit-20120419,0,6380009.story|title=Dick Clark dies at 82; he introduced America to rock 'n' roll|author=Geoff Boucher|date=April 19, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>

In 1958, ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'' was added to ABC's Saturday night lineup.<ref name=history/> By the end of year, viewership exceeded 20 million, and featured artists were "virtually guaranteed" large sales boosts after appearing.<ref name=history/> In a surprise television tribute to Clark in 1959 on ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', host [[Ralph Edwards]] called him "America’s youngest starmaker," and estimated the show had an audience of 50 million.

Clark moved the show from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in 1964.<ref name=history/> The move was related to the popularity of new "surf" groups based in southern California, including [[The Beach Boys]] and [[Jan and Dean]]. The show ran daily Monday through Friday until 1963, then weekly on Saturdays until 1988. ''Bandstand'' was briefly revived in 1989, with David Hirsch taking over hosting duties. By the time of its cancellation, the show had become the longest-running variety show in TV history.<ref name=history/>

In the 1960s, the show's emphasis changed from merely playing records to including live performers. During this period, many of the leading rock groups of the 1960s had their first exposure to nationwide audiences. A few of the many artists introduced were [[Ike and Tina Turner]], [[Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Bobby Fuller]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Fats Domino]] and [[Chubby Checker]].<ref name=encyc/><ref>{{YouTube|id=4E5xy6gjnt4|title=American Bandstand 30 Year Special – 1982 (2/11)}}</ref>

During an interview with Clark by Henry Schipper of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1990, it was noted that "over two-thirds of the people who've been initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] had their television debuts on ''American Bandstand'', and the rest of them probably debuted on other shows [they] produced."<ref name=RollingStone>Schipper, Henry. "Dick Clark", ''Rolling Stone'', April 19, 1990 pp. 67–70, 126.</ref> During the show's lifetime, it featured over 10,000 live performances, many by artists who were unable to appear anywhere else on TV, as the variety shows during much of this period were "antirock".<ref name=RollingStone/> Schipper points out that Clark's performers were shocking to general audiences:
{{quote|The music establishment, and the adults in general, really hated [[rock and roll]]. Politicians, ministers, older songwriters and musicians foamed at the mouth. [[Frank Sinatra]] reportedly called Elvis Presley a "rancid-smelling aphrodisiac."<ref name=RollingStone/>}}

Clark was therefore considered to have a negative influence on youth, and was well aware of that impression held by most adults:
{{quote|I was roundly criticized for being in and around rock and roll music at its inception. It was the devil's music, it would make your teeth fall out and your hair turn blue, whatever the hell. You get through that.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-legacy-of-dick-clark-the-fastest-follower-in-the-business-20120418 "The Legacy of Dick Clark, 'The Fastest Follower in the Business'"], ''Rolling Stone'', April 18, 2012.</ref>}}

In 2002, many of the groups he introduced appeared at the 50th anniversary special to celebrate ''American Bandstand''.<ref>{{YouTube|id=W0pJb68JbE4|title=American Bandstand 50th Anniversary clip 2002}}</ref> Clark noted during the special that ''American Bandstand'' was listed in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as "the longest-running variety show in TV history." In 2010, ''American Bandstand'' and Clark himself were honored at the Daytime Emmy Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Dick-Clark-Emmys-1019031.aspx |title=Dick Clark to be Honored at Daytime Emmys|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=April 22, 2012|author=Natalie Abrams|publisher=TVGuide.com}}</ref> [[Hank Ballard]], who wrote "The Twist," described Clark's popularity during the early years of ''American Bandstand'':
{{quote|The man was big. He was the biggest thing in America at that time. He was bigger than the president!<ref name=usatoday/>}}

As a result of Clark's work on ''Bandstand'', journalist Ann Oldenburg states "he deserves credit for doing something bigger than just putting on a show."<ref name=usatoday>Oldenburg, Ann. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-04-18/dick-clark-dies-at-82/54390716/1 "TV legend Dick Clark dies at age 82"], ''[[USA Today]]'', April 18, 2012.</ref> ''Los Angeles Times'' writer, Geoff Boucher, goes further, stating that "with the exception of Elvis Presley, Clark was considered by many to be the person most responsible for the bonfire spread of [[rock 'n roll]] across the country in the late 1950s," making Clark a "household name."<ref name=latimes/> He became a "primary force in legitimizing rock 'n' roll," adds Uslan. Clark, however, simplified his contribution:
{{quote|I played records, the kids danced, and America watched.<ref name=cbsnews>[http://www.cbsnews.com/2102-31749_162-57415954.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody "Dick Clark dead at 82"], CBS News, April 18, 2012.</ref>}}

Shortly after taking over, Clark also ended the show's all-white policy by featuring black artists such as [[Chuck Berry]]. In time, blacks and whites performed on the same stage, and studio seating was desegregated.<ref name=encyc>Milner, Andrew (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', Vol. I, St. James Press (2000) pp. 525–527.</ref> During the late 1950s and 1960s, Clark produced and hosted a series of concert tours around the success of ''American Bandstand'', which by 1959 had a national audience of 20 million.<ref name=usatoday/> However, Clark was unable to have the [[Beatles]] appear when they came to America.<ref name=latimes/>

The reason for Clark's impact on popular culture was partly explained by [[Paul Anka]], a singer who appeared on the show early in his career: "This was a time when there was no youth culture — he created it. And the impact of the show on people was enormous."<ref name=nyt>[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-dies-at-82/?emc=na "Reactions to Death of Dick Clark, New Year's Eve Icon"] ''The New York Times'' blog, April 18, 2012.</ref> In 1990, a few years after the show had been off the air, Clark considered his personal contribution to the music he helped introduce:
{{quote|My talent is bringing out the best in other talent, organizing people to showcase them and being able to survive the ordeal. I hope someday that somebody will say that in the beginning stages of the birth of the music of the fifties, though I didn't contribute in terms of creativity, I helped keep it alive.<ref name=RollingStone/>}}

===Payola hearings===
In 1960, the [[United States Senate]] investigated [[payola]], the practice of music-producing companies paying broadcasting companies to favor their product. As a result, Clark's personal investments in music publishing and recording companies were considered a conflict of interest, and he sold his shares in those companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Jordan Brothers&nbsp;— A Musical Biography of Rock's Fortunate Sons|first=Maxim W.|last=Furek|publisher=Kimberley Press|location=[[Berwick, Pennsylvania]]|year=1986|oclc=15588651}}</ref>

When asked about some of the causes for the hearings, Clark speculated about some of the contributing factors not mentioned by the press:
{{quote|Politicians . . . did their damnedest to respond to the pressures they were getting from parents and publishing companies and people who were being driven out of business [by rock]. . . . It hit a responsive chord with the electorate, the older people. . . . they full-out ''hated'' the music. [But] it stayed alive. It could've been nipped in the bud, because they could've stopped it from being on television and radio.<ref name=RollingStone/>}}

===Game show host===
{{main|Pyramid (game show)}}
Beginning in late 1963, Clark branched out into hosting game shows, presiding over ''[[The Object Is]]''.<ref name=ObjectIs>{{cite web|title=The Object Is|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-object-is/|publisher=TV|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> The show was cancelled in 1964, and replaced by ''[[Missing Links (game show)|Missing Links]]'', which had moved from [[NBC]]. Clark took over as host, replacing [[Ed McMahon]].<ref name=ObjectIs/>

[[File:Dick Clark $10000 Pyramid.JPG|thumb|upright|Dick Clark as host of ''The $10,000 Pyramid'']]
Clark became the first host of ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10,000 Pyramid]]'', which premiered on CBS March 26, 1973.<ref name=EW>{{cite news|title=A Dick Clark appreciation: The deceptively laid-back, conservative revolutionary|author=Ken Tucker|date=April 18, 2012|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-american-bandstand-pyramid-rockin-eve/|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> The show — a word-association game created and produced by daytime television producer [[Bob Stewart (television)|Bob Stewart]] — moved to ABC in 1974. Over the coming years, the top prize changed several times (and with it the name of the show), and several primetime spinoffs were created.<ref name=EW />

As the program moved back to CBS in September 1982, Clark continued to host the daytime version through most of its history, winning three [[Emmy Awards]] for best game show host.<ref name=q1520 /> In total, ''Pyramid'' won nine Emmy Awards for best game show during his run, a mark that is eclipsed only by the twelve won by the [[television syndication|syndicated]] version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]''.<ref name=HollywoodReporter>{{cite news|title=Dick Clark Dead of Heart Attack at 82|author=Duane Byrge|date=April 18, 2012|work=The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dick-clark-dead-heart-attack-82-years-old-stroke-313743|accessdate=April 20, 2012|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> Clark's final ''Pyramid'' hosting gig, ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', ended in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bakersfield native wins big on $100,000 Pyramid |url=https://www.turnto23.com/news/local-news/bakersfield-native-wins-grand-prize-on-100000-pyramid |website=turnto23.com |publisher=Scripps Media, Inc. |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>

Clark subsequently returned to ''Pyramid'' as a guest in later incarnations. During the premiere of the [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] version in 1991, Clark sent a pre-recorded message wishing Davidson well in hosting the show. In 2002, Clark played as a celebrity guest for three days on the [[Donny Osmond]] version. Earlier, he was also a guest during the [[Bill Cullen]] version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'', which aired simultaneously with Clark's daytime version of the show.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clark returns to 'Pyramid' — but not as show's host |url=https://www.deseret.com/2002/11/13/19688401/clark-returns-to-pyramid-151-but-not-as-show-s-host |website=deseret.com |publisher=Deseret News |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' credited Clark's "quietly commanding presence" as a major factor in the game show's success.<ref name=EW/>

Clark hosted the syndicated television game show ''[[The Challengers (game show)|The Challengers]]'', during its only season (1990–91).  ''The Challengers'' was a co-production between the production companies of Dick Clark and [[Ron Greenberg]].  During the 1990–91 season, Clark and Greenberg also co-produced a revival of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' for NBC with [[Bob Hilton]] as the host.  Hilton was later replaced by original host [[Monty Hall]]. Clark later hosted ''[[Scattergories (game show)|Scattergories]]'' on NBC in 1993; and [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|The Family Channel]]'s version of ''[[It Takes Two (game show)|It Takes Two]]'' in 1997. In 1999, along with Bob Boden, he was one of the executive producers of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s TV game show ''[[Greed (game show)|Greed]]'', which ran from November 5, 1999, to July 14, 2000, and was hosted by [[Chuck Woolery]]. At the same time, Clark also hosted the Stone-Stanley-created ''[[Winning Lines (U.S. game show)|Winning Lines]]'', which ran for six weeks on CBS from January 8 through February 12, 2000.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adalian |first1=Josef |title=CBS will sweep away quizzer 'Winning Lines' |url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/cbs-will-sweep-away-quizzer-winning-lines-1117776455/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety Media, LLC |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>

===''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve''===
{{main|Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve}}
In 1972, Dick Clark first produced ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'', a [[New Year's Eve]] music special for [[NBC]] which included coverage of the [[Times Square Ball|ball drop festivities]] in [[New York City]]. Clark aimed to challenge the dominance of [[Guy Lombardo]]'s New Year's specials on [[CBS]], as he believed its [[big band]] music skewed too old. After two years on NBC, and being hosted by [[Three Dog Night]] and [[George Carlin]] respectively, the program moved to ABC and Clark assumed hosting duties. Following Lombardo's death in 1977, ''Rockin' Eve'' experienced a surge in popularity and later became the most watched annual New Year's Eve broadcast.

===Radio programs===
Clark's first love was radio, and in 1963, he began hosting a radio program called ''The Dick Clark Radio Show''. It was produced by Mars Broadcasting of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]. Despite Clark's enormous popularity on ''American Bandstand'', the show was only picked up by a few dozen stations and lasted less than a year.<ref name=Highlights>{{cite news|title=Beyond 'American Bandstand': Dick Clark's career highlights, from Philly to Hollywood|date=April 18, 2012|agency=Associated Press|work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/beyond-american-bandstand-dick-clarks-career-highlights-from-philly-to-hollywood/2012/04/18/gIQAj7PoRT_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209191625/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/beyond-american-bandstand-dick-clarks-career-highlights-from-philly-to-hollywood/2012/04/18/gIQAj7PoRT_story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 9, 2018|accessdate=April 20, 2012}} </ref>

On March 25, 1972, Clark hosted ''[[American Top 40]]'', filling in for [[Casey Kasem]].<ref name=CNN>{{cite news|title=Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark|author=Alan Duke|author2=Chelsea J.

Clark left Mutual in  October 1985, and Bill St. James (and later Charlie Tuna) took over the National Music Survey.<ref name=q1520/> Clark's United Stations purchased RKO Radio Network in 1985, and when Clark left Mutual he began hosting USRN's "Countdown America" which continued until 1995.

In 1982, Clark launched his own radio syndication group with partners Nick Verbitsky and [[Ed Salamon]] called the United Stations Radio Network. That company later merged with the Transtar Network to become Unistar. In 1994, Unistar was sold to Westwood One Radio. The following year, Clark and Verbitsky started over with a new version of the USRN, bringing into the fold ''[[Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember]]'', written and produced by Pam Miller (who also came up with the line used in the show and later around the world: "the soundtrack of our lives"), and a new countdown show: ''The U.S. Music Survey'', produced by Jim Zoller. Clark served as its host until his 2004 stroke.<ref name=q1520/> [[United Stations Radio Networks]] continues in operation as of 2020.

Dick Clark's longest running radio show began on February 14, 1982. ''[[Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember]]'' was a four-hour oldies show named after Clark's 1976 autobiography. The first year, it was hosted by veteran Los Angeles disc jockey Gene Weed. Then in 1983, voiceover talent [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliot]] co-hosted with Clark. By 1985, Clark hosted the entire show. [[Pam Miller]] wrote the program and Frank Furino served as producer. Each week, Clark profiled a different artist from the rock and roll era and counted down the top four songs that week from a certain year in the 1950s, 1960s or early 1970s. The show ended production when Clark suffered his 2004 stroke. Reruns from the 1995–2004 era continued to air in syndication until USRN withdrew the show in 2020.

===Other television programs===
At the peak of his ''American Bandstand'' fame, Clark also hosted a 30-minute Saturday night program called ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'' (aka ''The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show''). It aired from February 15, 1958, until September 10, 1960, on the ABC television network. It was broadcast live from the "Little Theater" in New York City and was sponsored by Beech-Nut gum. It featured the rock and roll stars of the day lip-synching their hits, just as on ''American Bandstand''. However, unlike the afternoon ''Bandstand'' program, which focused on the dance floor with the teenage audience demonstrating the latest dance steps, the audience of ''The Dick Clark Show'' sat in a traditional theater setting. While some of the musical numbers were presented simply, others were major production numbers. The high point of the show was Clark's unveiling, with great fanfare at the end of each program, of the top ten records of the previous week.<ref name="Brooks And Marsh">{{cite book|first1=Tim|last1=Brooks|first2=Earle|last2=Marsh|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable Shows, 1946&nbsp;– present|edition=8th, revised and updated|year=2003|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|isbn=978-0-345-45542-0}}</ref> This ritual became so embedded in American culture that it was imitated in many media and contexts, which in turn were satirized nightly by [[David Letterman]] on his own [[Late Show Top Ten List|Top Ten lists]].

From September 27 to December 20, 1959, Clark hosted a 30-minute weekly talent/variety series entitled ''[[Dick Clark's World of Talent]]'' at 10:30&nbsp;p.m. Sundays on ABC. A variation of producer Irving Mansfield's earlier [[CBS]] series, ''This Is Show Business'' (1949–1956), it featured three celebrity panelists, including comedian [[Jack E. Leonard]], judging and offering advice to amateur and semi-professional performers. While this show was not a success during its nearly three-month duration, Clark was one of the few personalities in television history on the air nationwide seven days a week.<ref name="Brooks And Marsh"/>

One of Clark's best-known guest appearances was in the final episode ("The Case of the Final Fade-Out") of the original ''[[Perry Mason (1957 TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' TV series, in which Clark was revealed to be the killer of an egomaniacal actor during the production of a television show.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=IMDb.com|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0673265|title=The case of the Final Fade-Out|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Dick Clark, TV and New Year's Eve icon, dies at 82|author=Lynn Elber|date=April 18, 2012|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixPkPti7yiDpPDsNbeSFOtRrPmKQ?docId=2d14e822d03e4356b98345c82bc0893b|accessdate=April 20, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421233136/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixPkPti7yiDpPDsNbeSFOtRrPmKQ?docId=2d14e822d03e4356b98345c82bc0893b|archivedate=April 21, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref> He appeared as a drag-racing-strip owner in a 1973 episode of the [[procedural drama]] series ''[[Adam-12]]''.

Clark's most humorous appearance was on an episode ("Testimony of Evil") of ''[[Police Squad!]]'' in which he asks an informant about [[ska]] and borrows his skin cream to keep himself looking young, a parody of the fact that Clark was known for his perennial youthful appearance.

Clark attempted to branch into the realm of [[soul music]] with the series ''Soul Unlimited'' in 1973. The series, hosted by [[Buster Jones]], was a more risqué and controversial imitator of the popular series ''[[Soul Train]]'' and alternated in the ''Bandstand'' time slot. The series lasted for only a few episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Top 10 Things You Didn't Know About "Soul Train"|date=February 2, 2012|work=NewsOne|url=http://newsone.com/1844265/soul-train-wiki/|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> Despite a feud between Clark and ''Soul Train'' creator and host [[Don Cornelius]],{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} the two men later collaborated on several specials featuring black artists.

Clark hosted the short-lived ''[[Dick Clark's Live Wednesday]]'' in 1978 for NBC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Clark's Live Wednesday|work=TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/dick-clarks-live-wednesday|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> In 1980, Clark served as host of the short-lived series ''[[The Big Show (TV series)|The Big Show]]'', an unsuccessful attempt by NBC to revive the [[variety show]] format of the 1950s/60s. In 1984, Clark produced and hosted the NBC series ''[[TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes]]'' with co-host with [[Ed McMahon]].  Clark and McMahon were longtime Philadelphia acquaintances, and McMahon praised Clark for first bringing him together with future TV partner [[Johnny Carson]] when all three worked at ABC in the late 1950s. The ''Bloopers'' franchise stemmed from the Clark-hosted (and produced) NBC ''Bloopers'' specials of the early 1980s, inspired by the books, record albums and appearances of [[Kermit Schafer]], a radio and TV producer who first popularized outtakes of broadcasts.<ref name=AP/> For a period of several years in the 1980s, Clark simultaneously hosted regular programs on all three major American television networks – ABC (''Bandstand''), CBS (''Pyramid''), and NBC (''Bloopers'').<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/15/arts/dick-clark-is-thriving-on-3-major-networks.html Dick Clark is Thriving on Three Major Networks – NY Times.com]</ref>

In July 1985, Clark hosted the ABC primetime portion of the historic [[Live Aid]] concert, an all star concert designed by [[Bob Geldof]] to end world hunger.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1204/18/sitroom.02.html|title=Dick Clark Dies of "Massive Heart Attack"; Secret Service Resignations Amidst Scandal|agency=CNN|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>  During the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]], Clark (as host and producer) filled in a void on CBS' fall schedule with ''Live!

Clark also hosted various pageants from 1988–93 on CBS. He did a brief stint as announcer on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' in 1995.<ref>{{YouTube|id=swLeUwcQbBU|title=Pop Will Eat Itself on The Jon Stewart Show}}</ref> He also created and hosted two Fox television specials in 2000 called ''[[Challenge of the Child Geniuses]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Moraes |first1=Lisa |title=Smart Kids Finish First |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/05/11/smart-kids-finish-first/c02e76ab-7ee7-4467-bb76-086fa0672085/ |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=WP Company, LLc |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref> the last game show he hosted.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

From 2001 to 2003, Clark was a co-host of ''[[The Other Half (TV series)|The Other Half]]'' with [[Mario Lopez]], [[Danny Bonaduce]] and [[Dorian Gregory]], a syndicated daytime talk show intended to be the male equivalent of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. Clark also produced the television series ''[[American Dreams]]'' about a Philadelphia family in the early 1960s whose daughter is a regular on ''American Bandstand''. The series ran from 2002 to 2005.<ref name=AP />

===Other media appearances===
Clark wrote, produced and starred in the 1968 film ''[[Killers Three]]'', a Western drama that served as a promotional vehicle for [[Bakersfield sound|Bakersfield country musicians]] [[Merle Haggard]] and [[Bonnie Owens]].

Clark also appears in interview segments of another 2002 film, ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (film)|Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'', which was based on the "unauthorized autobiography" of [[Chuck Barris]]. (Barris had worked at ABC as a standards-and-practices executive during ''American Bandstand''{{'s}} run on that network.)<ref>{{cite news|title=Dick Clark: A Big-Screen Tribute|accessdate=April 19, 2012|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1683415/dick-clark-movies}}</ref>

In the 2002 ''[[Dharma and Greg]]'' episode "Mission: Implausible", Greg is the victim of a college prank, and devises an elaborate plan to retaliate, part of which involves his use of a disguise kit; the first disguise chosen is that of Dick Clark.

He also made brief cameos in two episodes of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''.

In December 2004, the 75-year-old Clark was hospitalized in [[Los Angeles]] after suffering what was initially termed a minor [[stroke]]. Although he was expected to be fine, it was later announced that Clark would be unable to host his annual ''New Year's Rockin' Eve'' broadcast, with [[Regis Philbin]] filling in for him.
