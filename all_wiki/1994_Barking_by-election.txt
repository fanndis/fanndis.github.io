}}The '''Barking by-election''' was held on 9 June 1994, following the death of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] [[Jo Richardson]]. Richardson had represented the seat since the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], following [[Tom Driberg]].

The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945, and Richardson had retained her seat comfortably at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] with an increased majority of over 6,000.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20111015054418/http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/electdata_1992ob.txt</ref> [[Margaret Hodge]], leader of [[Islington London Borough Council]] from 1982 to 1992, was selected as the Labour candidate and was the clear favourite to hold the seat at the [[by-election]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had taken second place in 1992. John Kennedy, the candidate in 1992, was not selected to fight the 1994 by-election, the Conservative nomination going instead to [[Theresa May]]. She had been a councillor in the [[London Borough of Merton]] from 1986 to 1994,<ref>https://www.conservativehome.com/localgovernment/2016/07/theresa-may-the-merton-years.html</ref> and had stood (and lost) in the safe Labour seat of [[North West Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Durham]] in 1992.<ref>https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/opinion/leader/14612264.theresa-may-north-west-durham-no-10/</ref> Having lost two of the three previous by-elections of the Parliament to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and failing to challenge Labour in the third, the Conservatives were not hopeful of gaining ground.

The Liberal Democrat candidate, Steve Churchman, had taken little more than a tenth of the votes cast in 1992, continuing a downward track since 1983. A new candidate, Garry White, at 21 the youngest parliamentary by-election candidate chosen by a British political party since [[universal suffrage]],{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} was chosen for the by-election.

Three other candidates stood: Gary Needs of the [[British National Front|National Front]], [[Gerard Batten]] of the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), and HR Butensky of the [[Natural Law Party]].

==Results==
As expected,{{by whom|date=May 2019}} Hodge won the seat easily, with the Labour majority almost doubling, despite a turnout below 40%. The Liberal Democrats share of the votes declined slightly, but they still managed to push the Conservatives into third place, as they had a month before in [[1994 Rotherham by-election|Rotherham]]. The other three candidates all lost their deposits.

At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 UK general election]], Hodge retained the seat with an increased majority. May went on to be elected as MP for [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] in 1997 and then became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2016. Two other candidates in Barking in 1994 also stood in 1997:  Needs contested [[Devon East (UK Parliament constituency)|Devon East]] for the [[National Democrats (UK)|National Democrats]], and Batten contested [[Harlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Harlow]] for UKIP: both again secured only a few hundred votes. Batten was elected as a UKIP [[Member of the European Parliament]] for [[London]] in 2004. Batten and May both appeared on a ballot paper together again, 23 years later, when Batten stood against her in Maidenhead at the 2017 general election. Batten later became the Leader of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] in 2018.
