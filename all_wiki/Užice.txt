It is located on the banks of the river [[Đetinja]]. According to the 2011 census, the city proper has a population of 59,747, while its administrative area comprises a total of 78,040 inhabitants. <ref name=census/>

==History==

===Ancient era===
The region surrounding Užice was settled by [[Illyrians]], specifically the Parthini and the Celtic-influenced [[Autariatae]] tribes. Their tombs are found throughout the region.  In the 3rd century BC,the [[Scordisci]] featured prominently after the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans]]. The region was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in 168 BC, and was organized into the [[Illyricum (Roman province)|province of Illyricum]] in 32–27 BC and, after 10 AD, the [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|province of Dalmatia]]. The town [[municipium Capedunum]] existed here during Roman times; its name indicates a Celtic origin (''dun'', fortress),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1tdmqdVj-N4C&pg=PA340 p. 340]</ref> similar to [[Singidunum]], the founding name of Serbia's capital, [[Belgrade]].

===Middle Ages===
{{See also|History of Medieval Serbia}}

The settlement of [[Slavs]] in the region has been recorded since the 520s, when Slavic tribes pillaged the Eastern Roman Empire; during [[Justinian I]]'s rule (527–565), up to 100,000 Slavs raided areas far to the south of the city in Thessalonica. The region (Drina županija) was part of the [[Vlastimirović dynasty]] when they established the medieval [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Principality of Serbia]], the first Serb state. Across the [[Drina]], in Bosnia, the army of [[Časlav of Serbia|Časlav]] fought the invading Magyars in the 950s. The region was annexed by the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 969, becoming part of the [[Catepanate of Serbia|Catepanate of Ras]]. Later, the area around the city became a part of the [[Theme of Sirmium]].

[[File:Uzice-fortress-by-pedja-supurovic-09.jpg|thumb|left|200px|<center>''[[Stari Grad, Užice|Stari Grad]]'' (Old town),<br> Castle fort built in the 1300s by Serbian nobleman [[Nikola Altomanović]]</center>]]
The region may have been returned to Serbian hands in the 1040s during the revolt against the Eastern Roman Empire led by [[Stefan Vojislav]], progenitor of the [[Vojislavljević]] dynasty. In 1083, brothers [[Vukan, Grand Prince of Serbia|Vukan]] and Marko were appointed princes in [[Raška (region)|Raška]]. In 1091, Vukan became independent of Byzantine rule, creating the [[Grand Principality of Serbia]], while [[Duklja]] (up until this, the most powerful Serbian principality, situated to the southwest) slowly crumbled, eventually coming under the rule of inner Serbia.

The [[Serbian Grand Principality]] remained in the hands of the [[Vukanović dynasty]] until another line of the same dynasty was set to rule by [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (r. 1143–1180). [[Zavida]], thought to be a brother of [[Uroš II, Grand Prince of Serbia|Uroš II]] and [[Desa of Serbia|Desa]], fled after trying to acquire an appanage or the throne itself. Zavida's four sons divided the rule, each holding ''česti'' (parts): [[Stracimir Zavidović|Stracimir]], ''župan'' of West Morava, ruled the country surrounding Užice'''.''' <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ki1icLbr_QQC&pg=PA31 p. 31]</ref> Stefan Nemanja eventually wrestled rule from the other four sons{{clarify|date=August 2016}} when he defeated Tihomir, Stracimir's brother, in 1171. Stracimir continued ruling in Nemanja's name. 

When King [[Dragutin]] of house [[Nemanjić dynasty|Nemanjić]] abdicated in favor of his brother [[Milutin]], he retained control of Užice region and was given the [[Mačva]] region by the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] king, from which he formed the Kingdom of [[Syrmia|Srem]]. After King Dragutin died, his lands were annexed to [[Medieval Serbia|Serbia]]. The old [[Stari Grad, Užice|Fortress]] on the hill was founded in the mid 14th century. After the death of [[Serbian Empire|Emperor]] [[Dušan the Mighty]], in the period known as the '[[fall of the Serbian Empire]]', Užice came under the control of [[Vojislav Vojinović]], a nobleman in the service of Emperor [[Uroš the Weak]]. When Vojislav died, his nephew [[Nikola Altomanović]] controlled the region. When Uroš died childless, the former Imperial provincial lords begin fighting each other. ''Serbian Autokrator'' [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar Hrebeljanović]] and [[Tvrtko I]] of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] defeated Nikola Altomanović, and divided his lands between themselves. Nikola was blinded in the fortress on the orders of [[Stefan Musić]]. Užice came under the control of Lazar, then the [[Serbian Despotate]] under his son [[Stefan Lazarević]].

===Ottoman period===
{{main article|History of Ottoman Serbia|Sanjak of Smederevo}}
Užice fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1463, and was part of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] until 1807, when it was liberated by the [[Serbian revolution]]aries during the [[First Serbian Uprising]].

===Modern Serbia===
{{main article|History of modern Serbia}}
 [[File:Uzice, Nova iskra (1899).jpg|thumb|left|Užice in the 1890s.]]
Užice was the first town in Serbia with a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]] producing [[alternating current]]. It was built on the [[Đetinja]] river in 1900.

===World War II===
{{main article|Republic of Užice}}
[[File:Kadinjača 028.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to fallen [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], [[Kadinjača]].]]
In 1941, after Nazi occupation, Užice was liberated by the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Partisans]], who chose it as the capital of the [[Republic of Užice]]. This republic was a short-lived military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in the western part of [[Nazi-occupied Serbia]].

The Republic of Užice comprised most of western Serbia, with a population of more than 300,000 people. It was located between the [[Skrapež]] river in the north, the river Drina in the west, the river [[Morava rivers, Serbia|Zapadna Morava]] in the east, and the [[Uvac]] river in the south.

In November 1941, the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] re-occupied this territory, and the majority of Partisan forces escaped to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Sandžak]] and [[Montenegro]].

===Yugoslav era===
[[File:Narrow gauge train station in Titovo Užice, 31 July 1970.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The train station in the 1970s]]
Within the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (established after the [[Second World War]]), Užice was renamed 'Titovo Užice' ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|Титово Ужице}}). From 1992, following the collapse of the pro-communist administration, 'Titovo' (meaning Tito's) was removed, leaving the original city name ''Užice''. It was one of eight towns renamed [[List of places named after Josip Broz Tito|Tito's town]] in Yugoslavia. Due to being 'Titove' and central-planning communist system, Užice received significant amounts of investment in infrastructure and local factories, which made the city one of the most highly developed for its size in former Yugoslavia. Following the break-up of the region, all the towns dropped the 'Titove' title.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, Užice's economy shrank rapidly due to [[Yugoslav Wars|war and instability in the region]].

In 1999 the city was bombed multiple times during [[Operation Allied Force]]. The largest scale bombing occurred on May 6, 1999 when [[NATO]] forces bombed many roads and highways, the airport, civilian buildings and government buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warfacts.org.yu/infrastructure/uzice.html |title=(NATO Aggression) Civilian Infrastructure: Uzice |accessdate=2007-05-14 |author=Warfacts.org.yu |year=1999 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071204125605/http://warfacts.org.yu/infrastructure/uzice.html | archivedate = 2007-12-04}}</ref> After this, thousands of people turned out at the city's main square to protest the bombings and destruction of the city and killings of civilians.

Regardless, the modern city has a developing [[textile]], [[leather]], [[machine]] and [[Metallurgy|metal]] industry. Most companies have factories on the outskirts of the city due to good communication connections, given the close proximity of the main highway, railroad and airport. [[Ponikve Airport]] is currently under reconstruction, and as a result cargo airlines will mostly use it for transporting goods. The airport management confirmed interest in low cost, scheduled and chartered airlines.

As of September 2017, Užice has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name="srbeconomiczone2017">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>
