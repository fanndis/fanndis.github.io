==History==
{{Same-sex marriage map Oceania|align=left}}

===''Quilter v Attorney-General''===
The case ''Quilter v Attorney-General'' had its origin in early 1996 when three female couples in long-term relationships were denied marriage licences by the Registrar-General because marriage under the [[common law]] was between one man and one woman. The case against the [[Government of New Zealand|NZ Government]] was taken to the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] in May 1996. The applicants argued that the ''[[Marriage Act 1955]]'' did not prohibit same-sex marriage and that under the ''[[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]'' and the ''[[Human Rights Act 1993]]'', discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was prohibited.<ref name="Quilter-v-AG"/>

Both parties agreed that at the time the ''Marriage Act 1955'' was written in the 1950s, marriage according to the [[common law]] was between one man and one woman, which explains why the Act did not specifically outlaw same-sex marriage. The applicants argued, however, that under the ''Human Rights Act 1993'', which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, and sections 6 ("Interpretation consistent with Bill of Rights to be preferred") and 19 ("Freedom from discrimination") of the ''Bill of Rights Act 1990'', New Zealand prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and, therefore, the applicants should be allowed to marry. The Government in response cited section 5 ("Justified limitations") of the ''Bill of Rights Act'', which allows rights and freedoms in the ''Bill of Rights'' to "be subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society". In its decision, the High Court sided with the Government and common law and reiterated that marriage is between one man and one woman.<ref name="Quilter-v-AG"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/newzlndlr1998&div=44&id=&page=|title=Reflections on the Bill of Rights after Quilter v. Attorney-General|website=heinonline.org}}</ref>

The High Court decision was appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] (then New Zealand's highest court) in December 1997, which upheld the ruling.<ref name="Quilter-v-AG">{{cite web |url= http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Quilter%20v.pdf |title= Quilter v.

===Ms. Juliet Joslin et al. v. New Zealand===
On 30 November 1998, two couples involved in ''Quilter v Attorney-General'' sued New Zealand before the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] claiming that the country's ban on same-sex marriage violated the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. The Committee rejected the case on 17 July 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/CCPR.C.75.D.902.1999.En?Opendocument|title=Communication No 902/1999 : New Zealand. 2002-07-30|publisher= United Nations Human Rights Committee|date=17 July 2002 |accessdate= 3 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121150042/http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/CCPR.C.75.D.902.1999.En?Opendocument|archivedate=21 November 2015}}</ref>

===2005 election===
During the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]], Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] stated that she thought it was discriminatory to exclude same-sex couples from the ''Marriage Act 1955'', but said she would not push to change it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=80213|title=Act discriminatory, but no amendment|work=[[Newstalk ZB]]|date=14 September 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108091318/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=80213|archivedate=8 November 2005}}</ref>

===Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill 2005===
In 2005, [[United Future]] MP [[Gordon Copeland]] sponsored the ''Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill'' that would have amended New Zealand marriage law to define marriage as only between a man and a woman, and amend anti-discrimination protections in the ''[[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act 1990]]'' related to marital and family status so that the bill could stand. This was criticised by opponents, such as [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney General]] [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], as an overly "radical" attack on the ''Bill of Rights''. The bill also would have prohibited the recognition of same-sex marriages from foreign countries as marriages in New Zealand. The bill received a Section 7 report for [[Bills reported as inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|being inconsistent with the ''New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990'']], specifically freedom from discrimination relating to sexual orientation.

The bill had its first reading debate on 7 December 2005, and subsequently failed 47 votes in favour to 73 votes against.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL6695_1/marriage-gender-clarification-amendment-bill|title=Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]|accessdate=13 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313220031/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL6695_1/marriage-gender-clarification-amendment-bill|archivedate=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/48HansD_20051207_00001276/marriage-gender-clarification-amendment-bill-%e2%80%94-first |title= Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill – First Reading |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 7 December 2005 |accessdate= 18 July 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160229232900/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/48HansD_20051207_00001276/marriage-gender-clarification-amendment-bill-%E2%80%94-first |archivedate= 29 February 2016 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://votes.wotfun.com/bill/42 |title= Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill|publisher=New Zealand Parliamentary Votes Database| accessdate= 27 November 2016}}</ref>

In December 2016, in his first press conference following taking office, Prime Minister [[Bill English]] announced he would vote in favour of same-sex marriage if another vote were to be held. He said "I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage." English voted against the ''Civil Union Act 2004'' and the ''Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013'', and in favour of the ''Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill 2005''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11765250 |title=Incoming Prime Minister Bill English U-turns on gay marriage |publisher=The New Zealand Herald |date=12 December 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://votes.wotfun.com/bill/1 Parliamentary Conscience Votes Database: Civil Unions Act]</ref>

==Economic benefits==
New Zealand has long been a destination for international weddings. From 2013, due to same-sex marriage not being legal in Australia (at the time) and other Asian and Pacific countries, many same-sex couples from these countries took advantage of New Zealand's marriage law and got married in New Zealand. This proved highly beneficial for the country's economy. Australian same-sex couples alone spent an estimated A$550 million a year for marriage ceremonies in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11855451 Same sex marriage in NZ benefits economy to tune of A$550 million] ''NZ Herald'', 13 May 2017</ref> Australian couples comprised 29 per cent of same-sex marriages or civil unions celebrated in New Zealand in 2016.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-21/same-sex-marriage-nz-economic-boost-and-australia/9171498 SSM: New Zealand's experience shows how Yes vote could boost our economy] ''ABC News'', 20 November 2017</ref>

==Marriage statistics==
In the year after 19 August 2013 (when the law became operational), 926 same-sex marriages were registered in New Zealand, of which 520 were between female couples and 406 were between male couples. 532 marriages (57.5%) were between New Zealand citizens, and 237 marriages (25.6%) were between [[Australian]] citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dia.govt.nz/press.nsf/d77da9b523f12931cc256ac5000d19b6/6cd5e0a601ca6d90cc257d38000ca9f2!OpenDocument |title= 926 same sex marriages since law change |publisher= Department of Internal Affairs New Zealand |date= 18 August 2014 |accessdate= 16 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095527/http://www.dia.govt.nz/press.nsf/d77da9b523f12931cc256ac5000d19b6/6cd5e0a601ca6d90cc257d38000ca9f2!OpenDocument|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/a-year-on-one-third-of-nz-gay-marriages-are-of-aussie-couples-13623.html|title=One year on: One third of NZ gay marriages are of Aussie couples|work=Gay News Network|date=23 April 2014 |accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116071627/http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/a-year-on-one-third-of-nz-gay-marriages-are-of-aussie-couples-13623.html|archivedate=16 January 2016}}</ref>

Per the December 2012 Herald-DigiPoll, support for same-sex marriage varied by age: young people overwhelmingly supported same-sex marriage, whereas people above 65 were majoritarily opposed.<ref name="curia"/>

Public opposition to same-sex marriage sharply increased during the time the same-sex marriage bill was being discussed by Parliament. LGBT groups attributed this increase to "scaremongering" from opponents, while those opposed claimed that "people are waking up to the negative social effects of changing the Marriage Act".<ref name="NZHMar2013"/> Since the bill has become law however, opposition to same-sex marriage has significantly decreased, being under 25% according to a 2016 poll.<ref>[http://ilga.org/downloads/Ilga_Riwi_Attitudes_LGBTI_survey_Logo_personal_political.pdf "ILGA/RIWI Global Attitudes Survey on LGBTI People" (PDF).] ILGA. p. 58. Retrieved 31 December 2016.</ref>

A poll conducted by the ''[[Waikato Times]]'' in August 2012 found that 46% of [[Waikato]] residents supported same-sex marriage, while 39% were opposed.<ref name="curia">[https://www.curia.co.nz/issue/same-sex-marriage/ Archives: same sex marriage]</ref>
