The '''environmental impact of aviation''' occurs because [[aircraft engine]]s emit heat, [[Aircraft noise|noise]], [[particulates]] and gases.
Like other emissions resulting from [[fossil fuel]] combustion, aircraft engines produce emissions, rising [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al concerns over their global impact and their local air quality effect.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/pages/aircraft-engine-emissions.aspx|title = Aircraft Engine Emissions |publisher= [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]}}</ref>
Airplanes emit gases ([[carbon dioxide|CO₂]], [[water vapour]],  [[nitrogen oxide]]s or [[carbon monoxide]] − bonding with [[oxygen]] to become CO₂ upon release) and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|atmospheric particulates]] (incompletely burned [[hydrocarbons]], [[sulfur oxide]]s, [[black carbon]]), interacting among themselves and with the atmosphere.<ref name=IPCC-1999/><ref>{{Cite journal |title= Impact of aviation on climate |journal= FAA's Aviation Climate Change Research Initiative (ACCRI) Phase II |publisher= Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume= 97 |issue= 4 |pages= 561–583 |doi= 10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00089.1 |date= April 2016 |last1= Brasseur |first1= Guy P. |last2= Gupta |first2= Mohan |display-authors= etal |hdl= 1721.1/109270 |url= http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/88665/16/bams-d-13-00089%252E1.pdf}}</ref>

;  [[Nitrogen oxides]] (NOₓ, [[nitric oxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]])
: In the [[tropopause]], emissions of [[Nitrogen oxide|NOₓ]] favor [[ozone]] (O₃) formation in the upper [[troposphere]]. At altitudes from {{cvt|8|to|13|km|ft}}, NOₓ emissions result in greater concentrations of O₃ than surface NOₓ emissions, and these in turn have a greater global warming effect.

In 1999, the IPCC estimated aviation's radiative forcing may represent 0.19 W/m² or 5% of the total man-made radiative forcing in 2050, with the uncertainty ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 W/m².<ref name=IPCC-1999-6.6>{{cite book |url= https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=83 |title= The Role of Aircraft in Climate Change-Evaluation of Sample Scenarios |chapter= Potential Climate Change from Aviation |work= Aviation and the Global Atmosphere |publisher= [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] |author= Joyce E.

==== Taxation and subsidies ====
{{main|Aviation taxation and subsidies}}
Financial measures can discourage airline passengers and promote other [[transportation mode]]s, and motivates airlines to improve fuel efficiency. Aviation taxation include:
* [[Air passenger tax]]es, paid by passengers for environmental reasons, may be variable by distance and include domestic flights;
* [[Departure tax]]es, paid by passengers leaving the country, sometimes also applies outside aviation;
* [[Jet fuel tax]]es, paid by airlines for the consumed jet fuel, like the [[kerosene tax]] for the [[European Union]], or [[fuel taxes in the United States]].
Consumer behaviour can be influenced by cutting subsidies for unsustainable aviation and subsidising the development of sustainable alternatives.
By September–October 2019, a carbon tax on flights would be supported by 72% of the EU citizens, in a poll conducted for the [[European Investment Bank]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu-flights-idUSKBN20X2RA |title=Ban short-haul flights for climate?

=== Non-CO₂ emissions ===
[[File:Air traffic optimal climat-cost relation.jpg|thumb|Economic cost and climate impact relation for transatlantic traffic]]
[[File:CointailstoMelbourne.JPG|thumb|upright|Contrails formed by high altitude aircraft]]

Besides carbon dioxide, aviation produces [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOₓ), [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], [[unburned hydrocarbon]]s (UHC) and [[contrail]]s.
[[Airway (aviation)|Flight route]]s can be [[Mathematical optimization|optimised]]: modelling CO₂, H₂O and NOₓ effects of [[transatlantic flight]]s in winter shows westbound flights climate forcing can be lowered by up to 60%, and ~25% for [[jet stream]]-following eastbound flights, costing 10–15% more due to longer distances and lower altitudes consuming more fuel, but 0.5% costs increase can reduce climate forcing by up to 25%.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231014004063 |journal= Atmospheric Environment |date= September 2014 |title= Reduction of the air traffic's contribution to climate change: A REACT4C case study |author= Volker Grewe |display-authors= etal}}</ref>

; Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)

; Particulates 
: Modern engines are designed so that no smoke is produced at any point in the flight while particulates and smoke were a problem with early jet engines at high power settings.<ref name=Rolls1996/>

; Unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) 
: Producted by [[incomplete combustion]], more unburned hydrocarbons are produced with low compressor pressures and/or relatively low combustor temperatures, they have been eliminated in modern jet engines through improved design and technology, like particulates.<ref name=Rolls1996/>

; Contrails 
: [[Contrail]] formation would be reduced by lowering the [[cruise altitude]] with slightly increased flight times, but this would be limited by [[airspace]] capacity, especially in Europe and North America, and increased fuel burn due to lower efficiency at lower altitudes, increasing CO₂ emissions by 4%.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Williams |first1= Victoria |display-authors= etal |title= Reducing the climate change impacts of aviation by restricting cruise altitudes | journal = Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment |date= November 2002 |volume= 7 |issue= 6 |pages= 451–464 |doi= 10.1016/S1361-9209(02)00013-5}}</ref> Contrail radiative forcing could be minimized by [[Public transport timetable|schedule]]s: [[Red-eye flight|night flight]]s cause 60-80% of the forcing for only 25% of the air traffic, while [[winter]] flights contribute half of the forcing for only 22% of the air traffic.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04877.epdf |date= 15 June 2006 |title= The importance of the diurnal and annual cycle of air traffic for contrail radiative forcing |author= Nicola Stuber |display-authors= etal |journal= Nature}}</ref> As 2% of flights are responsible for 80% of contrail radiative forcing, changing a flight altitude by {{cvt|2000|ft}} to avoid high [[humidity]] for 1.7% of flights would reduce contrail formation by 59%.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/195294/small-altitude-changes-could-contrail-impact/ |title= Small altitude changes could cut contrail impact of flights by up to 59 per cent |author= Caroline Brogan |date= 12 February 2020 |publisher= [[Imperial College]] }}</ref>

=== Carbon offsetting ===
[[File:Windmill D1 (Thornton Bank).jpg|thumb|upright|Money generated by carbon offsets from airlines often go to fund green-energy projects such as [[Wind turbine|wind farms]].]]
A [[carbon offset]] is a means of compensating aviation emissions by saving enough carbon or absorbing carbon back into plants through [[photosynthesis]] (for example, by [[Tree planting|planting trees]] through [[reforestation]] or [[afforestation]]) to balance the carbon emitted by a particular action. 

In UK, transportation replaced power generation as the largest emissions source. This includes aviation's 4% contribution. This is expected to expand until 2050, and passenger demand may need to be reduced.<ref name=Flight7jan2019/>
For the [[Committee on Climate Change]] (CCC) of the [[UK government]], the UK target of an 80% reduction from 1990 to 2050 is still achievable, but the committee suggests that the [[Paris Agreement]] should tighten its emission targets.<ref name=Flight7jan2019/>
Their position is that emissions in problematic sectors, like aviation, should be offset by [[greenhouse gas removal]], [[carbon capture and storage]] and [[reforestation]].<ref name=Flight7jan2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-dont-count-on-technology-to-save-us-454396/ |title= Don't count on technology to save us |date= 7 January 2019 |author= Kerry Reals |work=Flightglobal |accessdate=20 October 2020}}</ref>

For the UK's [[Committee on Climate Change]] (CCC), huge technology shifts are uncertain, but consultancy [[Roland Berger (company)|Roland Berger]] points to 80 new [[electric aircraft]] programmes in 2016–2018, all-electric for the smaller two-thirds and [[Hybrid electric aircraft|hybrid]] for larger aircraft, with forecast commercial service dates in the early 2030s on short-haul routes like London to Paris, with all-electric aircraft not expected before 2045.<ref name=Flight7jan2019/> Berger predicts a 24% CO2 share for aviation by 2050 if [[fuel economy in aircraft|fuel efficiency]] improves by 1% per year and if there are no electric or hybrid aircraft, dropping to 3–6% if 10-year-old aircraft are replaced by electric or hybrid aircraft due to regulatory constraints, starting in 2030, to reach 70% of the 2050 fleet.<ref name=Flight7jan2019/> This would greatly reduce the value of the existing fleet of aircraft, however.<ref name=Flight7jan2019/>
Limits to the supply of battery cells could hamper their aviation adoption, as they compete with other industries like [[electric vehicle]]s.<!--ref name=Flight7jan2019-->
[[Lithium-ion batteries]] have proven fragile and fire-prone, and their capacity deteriorates with age. However, alternatives are being pursued, such as [[Sodium-ion battery|sodium-ion batteries]].<ref name=Flight7jan2019/>
