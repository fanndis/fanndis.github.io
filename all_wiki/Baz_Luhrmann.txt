His album ''[[Something for Everybody (Baz Luhrmann album)|Something For Everybody]]'' features music from many of his films and also includes his hit "[[Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)]]".

Luhrmann's influence has extended outside the traditional realm of media and entertainment.

Luhrmann received the nickname "Baz" from his father, given to him because of his afro hair style, the name coming from the English [[Basil Brush]]. While still in high school, Luhrmann changed his name by deed poll to Bazmark, joining his nickname and birth name together.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/23/baz-luhrmann-strictly-ballroom-the-musical-interview "Baz Luhrmann: 'I've never waited for permission to do anything'&thinsp;"] by Ryan Gilbey, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 April 2018</ref> In 1980 Luhrmann graduated high school and in the same year was cast opposite [[Judy Davis]] in the Australian film ''[[Winter of Our Dreams]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baz Luhrmann (12 works by) |url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/OLD?id=A3x&idtype=oldid|work=AustLit|accessdate=6 February 2014|year=2014}}</ref> In 1982 using the money he had earned from film and television experience he funded his own theatre company, The Bond Theatre Company, with future friends and collaborators Nelly Hooper and Gabrielle Mason.

==Films==
[[File:BazLuhrmann2.png|thumb|Luhrmann in 2018]]
After theatrical successes, including the original stage version of ''Strictly Ballroom'', Luhrmann moved into film and has directed five so far:
*''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' (1992)
*''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996)
*''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001)
*''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' (2008)
*''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (2013)

The modern film interpretation ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Claire Danes]], defeated ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' at the BAFTAs for best direction, music and screenplay. The film was celebrated at the Berlin Film Festival, where it was recognised with the Gold Bear award for direction and Silver Bear for DiCaprio's performance. Luhrmann also produced both volumes of the soundtrack album, which went triple-platinum.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chagollan |first1=Steve |title='Gatsby's' Great Music Collection |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/features/gatsby-1200370682/ |website=Variety |publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC |accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>

Luhrmann's Oscar-winning musical ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), set in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris at the dawn of the 20th century, told the story of a young English poet/writer, Christian ([[Ewan McGregor]]) who falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan Satine ([[Nicole Kidman]]). The film was praised by its adherents, including famed musical directors [[Robert Wise]] and [[Stanley Donen]], as having re-invented the modern musical, blending decades of popular music in remixes and mash-ups.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Berk |first1=Philip |title=2002 – Musical or Comedy: ''Moulin Rouge!''|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/2002-musical-or-comedy-moulin-rouge |website=Golden Globe Awards |publisher=HFPA |accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> The movie was named one of the AFI's top ten films of 2001<ref>{{cite web |title=American Film Institute's Top Films of the Year|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0878236.html|work=InfoPlease|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref> and in 2010 was chosen as the top film of the 2000s decade in a poll of 150,000 respondents in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moulin Rouge! voted best film of the decade|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6944981/NEEDS-PIC-Moulin-Rouge-voted-best-film-of-the-decade.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 January 2010|accessdate=28 June 2011|location=London}}</ref> At the 59th Annual Golden Globes, Moulin Rouge! took home the awards for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Winners & Nominees 2002 |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/2002 |website=Golden Globe Awards |publisher=HFPA |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref> The film also gave birth to a successful soundtrack album, produced by Luhrmann, which sold more than seven million copies and went double-platinum, led by the Grammy-winning number one hit single "[[Lady Marmalade]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Marmalade Wins Grammy Award|url=http://www.bignoisenow.com/christina/grammy02win.html|publisher=BigNoiseNow|date=28 February 2002|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chagollan |first1=Steve |title='Gatsby's' Great Music Collection |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/features/gatsby-1200370682/ |website=Variety |publisher=Penske Business Media |accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>

Luhrmann's 2008 historical epic ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' featured some of the country's most celebrated actors, including [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Hugh Jackman]], and [[David Gulpilil]]. Situated between the two World Wars, the film blended a nostalgic romance with major events from Australian history, including the [[Bombing of Darwin]], and the true story of the [[Stolen Generations]], wherein thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children were stolen from their families by the state and forcibly integrated into white society. The movie's racial politics were controversial for their time, and notably, its production coincided with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's 2008 [[Apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples]]. [[Marcia Langton]], professor of Australian indigenous studies at [[University of Melbourne|Melbourne University]] publicly supported the film, saying "Luhrmann depicts with satirical sharpness the racial caste system of that time... In his imagined cinema of the 1940s, the spatial and social shape of racism is reconstructed with such exact detail, I felt I had been transported back to my own childhood."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Langton |first1=Marcia |title=Faraway Downs fantasy resonates close to home |url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/faraway-downs-fantasy-resonates-close-to-home-20081123-ge7jaa.html |website=The Age |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> While achieving modest box office success in the United States, the film was very successful in Europe, maintaining the #1 slot at the box office for many weeks in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=australia.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|title=Australia|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> It is the second-highest grossing Australian film of all time, next to ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' and ahead of ''[[Happy Feet]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Highest Grossing Aussie Films|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1009915/highest-grossing-aussie-films|work=World News Australia|publisher=Published by SBS|date=27 February 2009|accessdate=28 June 2011}}</ref>
