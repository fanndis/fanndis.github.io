The '''Recording Industry Association of America''' ('''RIAA''') is a trade organization that represents the [[recording industry]] in the United States. Its members consist of record labels and distributors, which the RIAA says "create, manufacture, and/or distribute approximately 85% of all legally sold recorded music in the United States".<ref name="RiaaAboutUs">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php |title=Who We Are |publisher=RIAA |access-date=September 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112133432/http://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php |archive-date=November 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The RIAA headquarters is in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>"[https://www.riaa.com/privacy.php Privacy Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161408/http://www.riaa.com/privacy.php |date=September 24, 2015 }}."

==Company structure and sales==
Mitch Glazier has been the RIAA's chairman and CEO since 2019. Glazier joined the RIAA 20 years ago and has played a vital role in the music industry's transition to streaming and "anywhere, anytime" access to music. He was the RIAA's senior executive vice president from 2011 to 2019 and served as executive vice president for public policy and industry relations from 2000 to 2011.

The criterion was changed in 1975 to the number of copies sold, with albums selling 500,000 copies awarded the Gold Award. In 1976, a "Platinum Award" was added for one million sales. In 1989, new criteria were introduced, with a "Gold Award" for singles that reach 500,000 in sales and a "Platinum Award" for singles that reach 1,000,000 in sales; and in 1999, a "Diamond Award" for 10&nbsp;million sales was introduced.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |access-date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701162808/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=historyx |archive-date=July 1, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The awards are open to both RIAA members and nonmembers.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Martha Roby and Miranda Lambert.jpg|thumb|US Representative [[Martha Roby]], and [[Miranda Lambert]], who was the RIAA's 2019 Artist of the Year, at an RIAA event in Washington, DC, in 2019.]]
In 2004, the RIAA added a branch of certification for what it calls "digital" recordings, meaning roughly "recordings transferred to the recipient over a network" (such as those sold via the [[iTunes Store]]), and excluding other obviously digital media such as those on [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]], or [[MiniDisc]]. In 2006, "digital ringtones" were added to this branch of certification.  Starting in 2013, streaming from audio and video streaming services such as [[Spotify]] and [[YouTube]] also began to be counted towards the certification using the formula of 100 streams being the equivalent of one download, RIAA certification for singles, therefore, no longer represents true sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&news_month_filter=5&id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |title=RIAA Adds Digital Streams To Historic Gold & Platinum Awards |publisher=RIAA |access-date=September 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924161215/http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&news_month_filter=5&id=03662575-C88F-51CF-779C-8396A2B8D74D |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1560846/exclusive-on-demand-streams-now-count-toward-riaa-gold-platinum |title= Exclusive: On-Demand Streams Now Count Toward RIAA Gold & Platinum |author= Alex Pham |date= May 9, 2013 |work= Billboard |access-date= January 21, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222115248/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1560846/exclusive-on-demand-streams-now-count-toward-riaa-gold-platinum |archive-date= February 22, 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref> In the same year, the RIAA introduced the Latin Digital Award for digital recordings in Spanish.<ref name=latindigital/>    {{As of|2016}}, the certification criteria for these recordings are:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DIGITAL-SINGLE-AWARD-RIAA-AND-GRF-CERTIFICATION-AUDIT-REQUIREMENTS.pdf |title=RIAA AND GR&F Certification Audit Requirements: RIAA Digital Single Award |work=RIAA |access-date=September 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922010100/http://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DIGITAL-SINGLE-AWARD-RIAA-AND-GRF-CERTIFICATION-AUDIT-REQUIREMENTS.pdf |archive-date=September 22, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Album certification===
In February 2016, RIAA updated its certification criteria for album to include streaming and track sales using the formula for [[album-equivalent unit]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/riaa-debuts-album-award-streams/ |title=RIAA Debuts Album Award with Streams |work=RIAA |date=1 February 2016 |access-date=September 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202081752/http://www.riaa.com/riaa-debuts-album-award-streams/ |archive-date=February 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Video longform certification===
Along with albums, digital albums, and singles, another classification of music release is called "video longform". This release format includes DVD and VHS releases, and certain live albums and compilation albums. The certification criteria are slightly different from other styles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/video.jsp |title=Billboard.com Latest Video Longform Certifications |access-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519083529/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/video.jsp |archive-date=May 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} Retrieved on May 14, 2008</ref>

The association has commenced high-profile lawsuits against file-sharing service providers. It has also commenced a series of lawsuits against individuals suspected of file sharing, notably college students and parents of file-sharing children. It is accused of employing techniques such as peer-to-peer "decoying" and "[[Spoofing (anti-piracy measure)|spoofing]]" to combat file sharing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/17/i_poisoned_p2p_networks/ |title="I poisoned P2P networks for the RIAA" – whistleblower |author=[[The Register]] |access-date=April 23, 2009 |date=January 17, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728230413/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/17/i_poisoned_p2p_networks/ |archive-date=July 28, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/18/riaa_chief_invokes_martin_luther/ |title=RIAA chief invokes Martin Luther King in pigopoly defense: P2P poisoning, ISP clampdown justified |author=[[The Register]] |access-date=April 23, 2009 |date=March 18, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531024821/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/18/riaa_chief_invokes_martin_luther/ |archive-date=May 31, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Selection of defendants====
The RIAA names defendants based on ISP identification of the subscriber associated with an [[IP address]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/27/earlyshow/leisure/music/main1166218.shtml |title=Mom Fights Recording Industry |author=[[CBS News]] |access-date=April 2, 2007 |date=December 27, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213144337/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/27/earlyshow/leisure/music/main1166218.shtml |archive-date=February 13, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> and as such do not know any additional information about a person before they sue. After an Internet subscriber's identity is discovered, but before an individual lawsuit is filed, the subscriber is typically offered an opportunity to settle. The standard settlement is a payment to the RIAA and an agreement not to engage in file sharing of music and is usually on par with statutory damages of $750 per work, with the RIAA choosing the number of works it deems "reasonable". For cases that do not settle at this amount, the RIAA has gone to trial, seeking statutory damages from the jury, written into The [[Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999]] as between $750 and $30,000 per work or $750 and $150,000 per work if "willful".

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and [[Public Citizen]] oppose the ability of the RIAA and other companies to "strip Internet users of anonymity without allowing them to challenge the order in court".<ref>{{cite press release |title=Citing Right to Anonymity Online, ACLU Asks Boston Court to Block Recording Industry Subpoena |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date=September 29, 2003 |url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/anon/15590prs20030929.html |access-date=April 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406161624/http://www.aclu.org/privacy/anon/15590prs20030929.html |archive-date=April 6, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Record Industry Cuts Corners in Crusade Against File-Sharers |publisher=Public Citizen |date=February 2, 2004 |url=http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1636 |access-date=April 3, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518002950/http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1636 |archive-date=May 18, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Settlement programs====

In February 2007, the RIAA began sending letters accusing Internet users of sharing files and directing them to web site <small>P2PLAWSUITS.COM</small>, where they can make "discount" settlements payable by credit card.<ref>{{cite news|title=RIAA Bullies College Students With P2PLawsuits.com|url=http://consumerist.com/2007/03/riaa-bullies-college-students-with-p2plawsuitscom.html|author=Meg Marco|date=March 2007|access-date=January 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052057/http://consumerist.com/2007/03/riaa-bullies-college-students-with-p2plawsuitscom.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The letters go on to say that anyone not settling will have lawsuits brought against them. Typical settlements are between $3,000 and $12,000.

The RIAA also launched an "early [[Settlement (law)|settlement]] program" directed to ISPs and to colleges and universities, urging them to pass along letters to subscribers and students offering early settlements, prior to the disclosure of their identities. The settlement letters urged ISPs to preserve evidence for the benefit of the RIAA and invited the students and subscribers to visit an RIAA website for the purpose of entering into a "discount settlement" payable by credit card.<ref>"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/02/riaa-adopts-new-policy-offers-pre-doe.html RIAA Adopts New Policy, offers Pre-Doe settlement option if ISP Holds Logs Longer, Asks ISP's to Correct Identification Mistakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715073546/http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/02/riaa-adopts-new-policy-offers-pre-doe.html |date=July 15, 2007 }}" Recording Industry vs. The People, February 13, 2007.</ref> By March 2007, the focus had shifted from ISPs to colleges and universities.<ref name="Read A31"/><ref>"[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960319.html?categoryid=18&cs=1 RIAA targets university students] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607051733/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960319.html?categoryid=18&cs=1 |date=June 7, 2007 }}" (Variety.com)</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20070927030702/http://www.theeastcarolinian.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&ustory_id=4e74bd26-4c1b-4c88-8d84-d915653c9459 "Recording industry battles piracy"] by Elizabeth Lauten, ''[[The East Carolinian]]'' ([[East Carolina University]]), April 4, 2007</ref>

In October 1998, the RIAA filed a lawsuit in the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals in [[San Francisco]] claiming the [[Diamond Multimedia]] [[Rio PMP300]] player violated the 1992 [[Audio Home Recording Act]]. The Rio PMP300 was significant because it was the second portable consumer MP3 digital audio player released on the market. The three-judge panel ruled in favor of Diamond, paving the way for the development of the portable digital player market.<ref>''[http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/139091 Court OKs Diamond Rio MP3 Player] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122122804/http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/139091 |date=November 22, 2005 }}'', by Elizabeth Clampet, InternetNews.Com, June 16, 1999</ref>

In 2003, the RIAA sued college student developers of LAN search engines [[Phynd]] and Flatlan, describing them as "a sophisticated network designed to enable widespread music thievery".<ref>{{cite web |last=Borland |first=John |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1027-995429.html?tag=fd_lede1_hed |title=RIAA sues campus file-swappers – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |access-date=July 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120043253/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1027-995429.html?tag=fd_lede1_hed |archive-date=January 20, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.bcheights.com/media/storage/paper144/news/2003/04/08/Marketplace/Record.Industry.Sues.Flatlan.Operators-410377.shtml |title=The Heights – Record industry sues Flatlan operators |publisher=Media.www.bcheights.com |access-date=July 17, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=2599&part=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310202314/http://www.poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=2599&part=1|date=March 10, 2007}}</ref>

In September 2003, the RIAA filed suit in civil court against several private individuals who had shared large numbers of files with [[Kazaa]]. Most of these suits were settled with monetary payments averaging $3,000. Kazaa publisher Sharman Networks responded with a lawsuit against the RIAA, alleging that the terms of use of the network were violated and that unauthorized client software was used in the investigation to track down the individual file sharers (such as Kazaa Lite). An effort to throw out this suit was denied in January 2004, but that suit was settled in 2006. Sharman Networks agreed to a global settlement of litigation brought against it by the Motion Picture Association of America, the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], and the RIAA. The creators of the popular Kazaa file-sharing network will pay $115&nbsp;million to the RIAA, unspecified future amounts to the MPAA and the software industry, and install filters on its networks to prevent users from sharing copyrighted works on its network.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/07/7363/ |title=Sharman Networks settles Kazaa file-sharing lawsuits |publisher=Ars Technica |date=July 27, 2006 |access-date=July 23, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117202325/http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/07/7363/ |archive-date=November 17, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

RIAA has also filed suit in 2006 to enjoin digital [[XM Satellite Radio]] from enabling its subscribers from playing songs it has recorded from its satellite broadcasts.<ref>[http://www.twice.com/article/CA6336520.html XM Faces The Music In RIAA Copyright Suit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613213838/http://www.twice.com/article/CA6336520.html |date=June 13, 2006 }}, by Joseph Palenchar, TWICE, May 22, 2006</ref> It is also suing several Internet radio stations.<ref>[http://www.out-law.com/page-1778 RIAA sues Internet radio stations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329205701/http://www.out-law.com/page-1778 |date=March 29, 2007 }}, Out-Law.com, July 2001</ref>

On October 12, 2007, the RIAA sued Usenet.com seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the company from "aiding, encouraging, enabling, inducing, causing, materially contributing to, or otherwise facilitating" [[copyright infringement]]. This suit, the first that the RIAA has filed against a Usenet provider, has added another branch to the RIAA's rapidly expanding fight to curb the [[copyright infringement|unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials]]. Unlike many of the RIAA's previous lawsuits, this suit is filed against the provider of a service who has no direct means of removing infringing content. The RIAA's argument relies heavily on the fact the Usenet.com, the only defendant that has been named currently, promoted their service with slogans and phrases that strongly suggested that the service could be used to obtain free music.

On April 28, 2008, RIAA member labels sued Project Playlist, a web music search site, claiming that most of the sound recordings in the site's index of links are infringing. Project Playlist's website denies that any of the music is hosted on Project Playlist's own servers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9930419-7.html |title=RIAA files copyright suit against Project Playlist |author=Sandoval, Greg |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=April 28, 2008 |access-date=December 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617005517/http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9930419-7.html |archive-date=June 17, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On June 30, 2009, the RIAA prevailed in its fight against Usenet.com, in a decision, that the U.S. District Judge Harold Baer of the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the music industry on all its main arguments: that Usenet.com is guilty of direct, contributory, and vicarious infringement. In addition, and perhaps most importantly for future cases, Baer said that Usenet.com cannot claim protection under the Sony Betamax decision. That ruling states that companies cannot be held liable for contributory infringement if the device they create is "capable of significant noninfringing uses".<ref>{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Sandoval |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10276607-93.html |title=RIAA triumphs in Usenet copyright case |date=December 17, 2011 |access-date=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111044311/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10276607-93.html |archive-date=January 11, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Furthermore, the parties are now headed to federal court for damage assessments and awards, which could amount to several millions of dollars for the music industry.<ref>{{cite web

RIAA filed briefs in ''[[Allen v. Cooper]]'', which was decided in 2020; the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] abrogated the [[Copyright Remedy Clarification Act]] as unconstitutional, RIAA had argued the opposite view.

===The "work made for hire" controversy===

In 1999, Mitch Glazier, a Congressional staff attorney, inserted, without public notice or comment, substantive language into the final markup of a "technical corrections" section of copyright legislation, classifying many music recordings as "[[Work for hire|works made for hire]]", thereby stripping artists of their copyright interests and transferring those interests to their record labels.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/08/38129?currentPage=all |title=Rule Reversal: Blame It on RIAA |access-date=April 9, 2007 |author=Wired |date=August 10, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602053522/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/08/38129?currentPage=all |archive-date=June 2, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml |title=RIAA Accounting: Why Even Major Label Musicians Rarely Make Money From Album Sales |access-date=October 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830125727/http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml |archive-date=August 30, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shortly afterwards, Glazier was hired as Senior Vice President of Government Relations and Legislative Counsel for the RIAA, which vigorously defended the change when it came to light.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eric Boehlert |date=August 28, 2000 |url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html |title=Four Little Words |work=Salon |access-date=October 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123063924/http://archive.salon.com/ent/music/feature/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/print.html |archive-date=January 23, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The battle over the disputed provision led to the formation of the [[Recording Artists' Coalition]], which successfully lobbied for repeal of the change.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barry Willis |date=October 29, 2000 |url=http://www.stereophile.com/news/10880/ |title=Clinton Signs Repeal of "Works for Hire" Law |publisher=Stereophile |access-date=October 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112154255/http://www.stereophile.com/news/10880/ |archive-date=November 12, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{USPL|106|379}}</ref>

{{Main article|Trade_group_efforts_against_file_sharing#Criticism|l1=Criticism of anti-file sharing efforts}}

There is much criticism of the RIAA's policy and method of suing individuals for copyright infringement, notably with Internet-based pressure groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and [[Students for Free Culture]].<ref>[https://www.eff.org/share/petition/ "Stop the RIAA! petition"], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]; [http://freeculture.org/riaafree/ "RIAA Free"], FreeCulture.org.</ref> To date, the RIAA has sued more than 20,000<ref>[https://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/howto-notgetsued.php "How to Not Get Sued For File Sharing"] [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].</ref> people in the United States suspected of distributing copyrighted works and settled approximately 2,500 of the cases.
