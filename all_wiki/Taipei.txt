In English-language news reports the name ''Taipei'' often serves as a [[synecdoche]] referring to central government of Taiwan. Due to the ambiguous [[political status of Taiwan]] internationally, the term ''[[Chinese Taipei]]'' is also frequently used as a [[synonym]] for the entire country, as when Taiwan's governmental representatives participate in [[international organizations]] or Taiwan's athletes participate in international sporting events.

In 1885, work commenced to govern the island as a province, and Taipeh was temporarily made the provincial capital. The city officially became the capital in 1894.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} All that remains from the historical period is the north gate.

As settlement for losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], China ceded the [[island of Taiwan]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895 as part of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. After the Japanese take-over, Taipei, romanized into English as '''Taihoku''' following the Japanese language pronunciation, was retained as the capital and emerged as the political center of the Japanese Colonial Government.<ref name="marsh1" /> During that time the city acquired the characteristics of an administrative center, including many new public buildings and [[Qidong Street Japanese Houses|housing for civil servants]]. Much of the architecture of Taipei dates from the period of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], including the [[Presidential Office Building]] which was the Office of the [[Governor-General of Taiwan]].

During Japanese rule, Taihoku was incorporated in 1920 as part of [[Taihoku Prefecture]]. It included [[Wanhua District|Bangka]], [[Twatutia]], and {{nihongo||城內|Jōnai}} among other small settlements. The eastern village of {{nihongo4||松山庄|Matsuyama|modern-day [[Songshan District, Taipei]]}} was annexed into Taihoku City in 1938. Taihoku and surrounding areas were bombed by Allied forces on several occasions. The largest of these Allied air raids, the [[Taihoku Air Raid]], took place on 31 May 1945. Upon the Japanese defeat in the [[Pacific War]] and its consequent surrender in August 1945, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) [[Retrocession Day|assumed control]] of Taiwan. Subsequently, a temporary Office of the Taiwan Province Administrative Governor was established in Taipei City.{{sfnp|Marsh|1996|p=85}}

In 1947 the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] declared island-wide [[martial law in Taiwan]] as a result of the [[28 February Incident]], which began with incidents in Taipei but led to an island-wide crackdown on the local population by forces loyal to Chiang. Two years later, on 7 December 1949, Chiang and the Kuomintang forces were forced to flee mainland China by the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] near the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The KMT-led national government that fled to Taiwan declared Taipei to be the provisional capital of a continuing [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], with the official capital at [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) even though that city was under Communist control.<ref name="ng">{{cite book|last=Ng|first=Franklin|title=The Taiwanese Americans|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|page=10|isbn=0-313-29762-2}}</ref><ref name="bbctimeline-retreat">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1949_1955.stm|title=Taiwan Timeline – Retreat to Taiwan|year=2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624190413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1949_1955.stm|archive-date=24 June 2009|url-status=live}} Taipei has never been declared the official capital but Kuomintang loyalists today generally regard it as such.

Taipei [[Military dependents' village|expanded greatly]] in the decades after 1949, and as approved on 30 December 1966, by the [[Executive Yuan]], Taipei was declared a special [[Direct-controlled municipality|centrally administered municipality]] on 1 July 1967, and given the administrative status of a province.<ref name="tcghistory" /> In the following year, Taipei City expanded again by annexing [[Shilin District|Shilin]], [[Beitou District|Beitou]], [[Neihu District|Neihu]], [[Nangang District, Taipei|Nangang]], [[Jingmei]], and [[Muzha District|Muzha]]. At that time, the city's total area increased fourfold by absorbing several outlying towns and villages and the population increased to 1.56 million people.<ref name="tcghistory" />

The city's population, which had reached one million in the early 1960s, also expanded rapidly after 1967, exceeding two million by the mid-1970s. Although growth within the city itself gradually slowed thereafter{{sfnp|Marsh|1996|p=85}} — its population had become relatively stable by the mid-1990s – Taipei remained one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, and the population continued to increase in the region surrounding the city, notably along the corridor between Taipei and [[Keelung]].

In 1990 Taipei's 16 districts were consolidated into the current 12 districts.<ref name="yearbook">{{cite book|title=Republic of China Yearbook|publisher=Kwang Hwa Publishing Co.|year=2002|page=120|isbn=957-9227-35-7}}</ref> [[Wild Lily student movement|Mass democracy rallies]] that year in the [[Liberty Square (Taipei)|plaza]] around Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall led to an island-wide transition to multi-party [[democracy]], where legislators are chosen via regularly scheduled popular elections, during the presidency of [[Lee Teng-Hui]].

Motor vehicle engine exhaust, particularly from motor scooters, is a source of [[air pollution]] in Taipei. There are higher levels of fine [[particulate]] matter and [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s in the mornings because of less air movement; sunlight reduces some pollution.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oung |first=Angelica |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/04/2003359365 |title=Taipei air pollution alarming: scientists |newspaper=[[The Taipei Times]] |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705014955/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/04/2003359365 |archive-date=5 July 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The aboriginal population in the city stands at 16,713 at the end of 2018 (<1%), concentrated mostly in the suburban districts.

Some restaurants, for example, may set up a small shrine to the [[Kitchen God]] for success in a restaurant business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wikimania2007.wikimedia.org/wiki/About_Taipei_5:_Religions |title=About Taipei 5: Religions – Wikimania 2007, The International Wikimedia Conference |publisher=Wikimania2007.wikimedia.org |date=26 July 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227123246/http://wikimania2007.wikimedia.org/wiki/About_Taipei_5:_Religions |archive-date=27 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Taipei City is a [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] which is directly under the [[Executive Yuan]] ([[Central Government]]).

===Garbage recycling===
Taipei City is also famous for its effort in garbage recycling, which has become such a good international precedent that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the [[Environmental Protection Administration (Republic of China)|Environmental Protection Administration]] (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. The EPA also introduced garbage recycling trucks, in effort to raise community recycling awareness, that broadcast classical music (specifically Beethoven's "Für Elise" and Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska's "A Maiden’s Prayer") to announce its arrival to the community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/taiwan-garbage-trucks-music_n_1195020.html|title=Taiwan Garbage Trucks: Classical Music Accompanies Collection (VIDEO)|date=9 January 2012|work=Huffington Post|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005113810/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/taiwan-garbage-trucks-music_n_1195020.html|archive-date=5 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=93434&ctNode=1337&mp=1|title=Recycling: Taiwan's Way of Life|publisher=Taiwan Review|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206120553/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=93434&CtNode=1337&mp=1|archivedate=6 December 2010}}</ref> This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo 2010]].

===Administrative divisions===
Taipei City is divided up into 12 administrative [[District (ROC)|districts]] ({{zh|labels=no |t=區 |p=qū}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=27185&mp=100002|title=Administrative Districts|publisher=Taipei City Government|accessdate=11 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715110737/http://english.taipei.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=27185&mp=100002|archive-date=15 July 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Each district is further divided up into [[Village (Taiwan)|urban villages]] ({{lang|zh|里}}), which are further sub-divided up into neighborhoods ({{lang|zh|鄰}}).

===City planning===
The city is characterized by straight roads and public buildings of grand Western architectural styles.<ref name="jones">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Ian|title=City Museums and City Development|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2008|page=102|isbn=978-0-7591-1180-6}}</ref> The city is built on a square grid configuration, however these blocks are huge by international standards with {{convert|500|m|2|abbr=on}} sides. The area in between these blocks are infilled with lanes and alleys, which provide access to quieter residential or mixed-use development. Other than a citywide {{convert|30|km/h|mph}} speed limit, there is little uniform planning within this "hidden" area; therefore lanes (perpendicular to streets) and alleys (parallel with street, or conceptually, perpendicular to the lane) spill out from the main throughways. These minor roads are not always perpendicular and sometimes cut through the block diagonally.

Although development began in the western districts (still considered the cultural heart of the city) of the city due to trade, the eastern districts of the city have become the focus of recent development projects. Many of the western districts, already in decline, have become targets of new [[urban renewal]] initiatives.<ref name="jones" />

==Transportation==
[[File:Wende Station platform.jpg|thumb|Platform of [[Wende Station]] on the [[Taipei Metro]] system.]]
[[Public transport]] accounts for a substantial portion of different modes of transport in Taiwan, with Taipei residents having the highest utilization rate at 34.1%.<ref name="pubtrans">{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20100206-197064.html|title=Only 13% using Taiwan's public transport|publisher=The China Post/Asia News Network|date=6 February 2010|accessdate=8 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927205100/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20100206-197064.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Private transport]] consists of [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooters]], private cars, taxi cabs, and [[bicycle]]s. Motor-scooters often weave between cars and occasionally through oncoming traffic.

===Metro===
{{Main|Taipei Metro|Taoyuan Airport MRT}}
Taipei's public transport system, the [[Taipei Metro]] (commonly referred to as the MRT), incorporates a [[rapid transit|metro]] and [[light rail]] system based on advanced [[Véhicule Automatique Léger|VAL]] and [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] technology. There are currently six metro lines that are labelled in three ways: color, line number and depot station name. In addition to the rapid transit system itself, the Taipei Metro also includes several public facilities such as the [[Maokong Gondola]], underground shopping malls, parks, and public squares. Modifications to existing [[Taiwan Railways Administration|railway]] lines to integrate them into the metro system are underway.

In 2017 a rapid transit line was opened to connect Taipei with [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] and [[Taoyuan City]]. The new line is part of the new [[Taoyuan Metro]] system.

On 31 January 2020, Hitachi Rail Corporation officially commissioned Phase 1 of the Circlular Line which took place at Shisizhang Station. The Circular Line is a 15.4&nbsp;km driverless rail system. The Circular line offered free rides beginning in February 2020 for passengers to test the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://railway-news.com/hitachi-rail-taipei-metro-circular-line/|title=Hitachi Rail Commissions Phase 1 of Taipei Metro Circular Line|date=2020-02-03|website=Railway-News|access-date=2020-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301052706/https://railway-news.com/hitachi-rail-taipei-metro-circular-line/|archive-date=1 March 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202002250014|title=Free rides on MRT Circular Line to end Saturday - Focus Taiwan|website=focustaiwan.tw|language=zh-Hant-TW|access-date=2020-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303022214/https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202002250014|archive-date=3 March 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Bus===
{{Main|Taipei Joint Bus System}}
An extensive [[Taipei bus|city bus system]] serves metropolitan areas not covered by the metro, with exclusive bus lanes to facilitate transportation.<ref name="tpctoday" /> Riders of the city metro system are able to use the EasyCard for discounted fares on buses, and vice versa. A unique feature of the Taipei bus system is the joint venture of private transportation companies that operate the system's routes while sharing the fare system. This route is in sharp contrast to bus systems in the U.S. which are mostly public entities. Several major intercity bus terminals are located throughout the city, including the [[Taipei Bus Station]] and [[Taipei City Hall Bus Station]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/05/24/2003473719/print|title=Traffic chaos expected in Xinyi|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=11 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201204445/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/05/24/2003473719/print|archive-date=1 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Songshan Airport is accessible by the Taipei Metro [[Neihu Line (TRTS)|Neihu Line]]; Taoyuan International Airport is accessible by the [[Taoyuan Airport MRT]].

===Ticketing===
In 1994, with the rapid development of Taipei, a white paper for transport policies expressed the strong objective to "create a civilised transport system for the people of Taipei." In 1999, they chose Mitac consortium, which Thales-Transportation Systems is part of. [[Thales Group|Thales]] was then selected again in 2005 to deploy an upgrade of Taipei's public transport network with an end-to-end and fully contactless automatic fare collection solution that integrates 116 metro stations, 5,000 buses and 92 car parks.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[National Taiwan University]] (NTU or ''Tai-Da'') was established in 1928 during the period of Japanese colonial rule. NTU has produced many political and social leaders in Taiwan. Both [[pan-blue coalition|pan-blue]] and [[pan-green coalition|pan-green]] movements in Taiwan are rooted on the NTU campus. The university has six campuses in the greater Taipei region (including [[New Taipei]]) and two additional campuses in [[Nantou County]]. The university governs farms, forests, and hospitals for educational and research purposes. The main campus is in Taipei's Da-An district, where most department buildings and all the administrative buildings are located. The College of Law and the College of Medicine are located near the [[Presidential Office Building]]. The [[National Taiwan University Hospital]] is a leading international center of medical research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about+ntu/location/ntumap.htm |title=National Taiwan University – About NTU |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=27 July 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[National Taiwan Normal University]] (NTNU or ''Shi-Da'') likewise traces its origins to the Japanese colonial period. Founded as Taihoku College in 1922 and organized as a teacher training institution by the Kuomintang in 1946, NTNU has since developed into a comprehensive international university. The university boasts especially strong programs in the humanities and international education. Worldwide it is perhaps best known as home of the [[Mandarin Training Center]], a program that offers [[Mandarin language]] training each year to over a thousand students from scores of countries throughout the world.  The main campus, in Taipei's Daan district near MRT Guting Station, is known for its historic architecture. The Shida market area surrounding this campus takes its name from the school's acronym.
