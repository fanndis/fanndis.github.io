The economic crisis started in the U.S. but spread to the rest of the world.<ref name=gofromhere/> U.S. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 and the rest of the world depended on the U.S. consumer as a source of demand. Toxic securities were owned by corporate and institutional investors globally. Derivatives such as [[credit default swap]]s also increased the linkage between large financial institutions. The [[leverage (finance)|de-leveraging]] of financial institutions, as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets, further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade. Reductions in the growth rates of [[developing countries]] were due to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and [[remittances]] sent from migrant workers. This led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line.<ref name=action>{{cite web | url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/3705.pdf | title=The global financial crisis and developing countries: taking stock, taking action | work=[[Overseas Development Institute]] | date=September 2009}}</ref> States with fragile political systems feared that investors from Western states would withdraw their money because of the crisis.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/european-bank-regulators-would-do-well-learn-their-latin-american-counterparts |title=Exceedingly high interest rates| first=Bruno | last=Wenn| publisher=[[D+C Development and Cooperation]]| date=January 2013}}</ref>

As part of [[national fiscal policy response to the Great Recession]], governments and central banks, including the [[Federal Reserve]], the [[European Central Bank]], the [[Bank of England]] provided then-unprecedented trillions of dollars in [[bailout]]s and [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulus]], including expansive [[fiscal policy]] and [[monetary policy]] to offset the decline in consumption and lending capacity, avoid a further collapse, encourage lending, restore faith in the integral [[commercial paper]] markets, avoid the risk of a [[deflationary spiral]], and provide banks with enough funds to allow customers to make withdrawals. In effect, the central banks went from being the "[[lender of last resort]]" to the "lender of only resort" for a significant portion of the economy. In some cases the Fed was considered the "buyer of last resort".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7889897.stm |title=US Congress passes stimulus plan |work=[[BBC News]]| date=February 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum09/si_sum09.pdf |title=Government Support for Financial Assets and Liabilities Announced in 2008 and Soon Thereafter ($ in billions)|page= 7|work=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] |date=Summer 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikecollins/2015/07/14/the-big-bank-bailout/ |title=The Big Bank Bailout |first=Mike |last=Collins |work=[[Forbes]] |date=July 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr563.pdf | title=Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision during the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009 | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] | date=July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bibalex.org/Search4Dev/files/400653/344463.pdf |title=Fixing Global Finance: A Developing Country Perspective on Global Financial Reforms | publisher=[[Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations]] | first=Kavaljit | last=Singh | year=2010}}</ref> During the fourth quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks.

Typical American families did not fare well, nor did those "wealthy-but-not-wealthiest" families just beneath the pyramid's top. However, half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis because they generally did not own financial investments whose value fluctuates.

* November 29, 2008: Economist [[Dean Baker]] observed:
{{blockquote|There is a really good reason for tighter credit. Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This matters for credit decisions. A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. In the case of businesses, their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007... While many banks are obviously at the brink, consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid. The problem with the economy is the loss of close to $6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://prospect.org/economy/credit-crisis-damn-it/ |title=It's Not the Credit Crisis, Damn It! |last=Baker |first=Dean | work=[[The American Prospect]] |date=November 29, 2008}}</ref>}}

While the causes of the bubble are disputed, the precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 was the bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]] and the subsequent [[subprime mortgage crisis]], which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of [[mortgage loan]]s, particularly [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s. Some or all of the following factors contributed to the crisis:<ref name=4questions/><ref name=aspnewhome/><ref name=Homeownership/>

* Lax underwriting standards and high mortgage approval rates led to an increase in the number of homebuyers, which drove up housing prices. This appreciation in value led many homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes as an apparent windfall, leading to over-leveraging.
* The high delinquency and default rates by homeowners, particularly those with subprime credit, led to a rapid devaluation of mortgage-backed securities including bundled loan portfolios, derivatives and credit default swaps. As the value of these assets plummeted, buyers for these securities evaporated and banks who were heavily invested in these assets began to experience a liquidity crisis.
* Securitization allowed for shifting of risk and lax underwriting standards: Many mortgages were bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called [[mortgage-backed securities]], in a process known as [[securitization]]. These bundles could be sold as (ostensibly) low-risk securities partly because they were often backed by [[credit default swaps]] insurance.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Credit Default Swaps and the Credit Crisis |doi=10.1257/jep.24.1.73 |first=René M. |last=Stulz |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume =24 |issue=1 |pages=73–92 |url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.1.73 |date=Winter 2010 |s2cid=154418474 }}</ref> Because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages (and the associated risks) on in this way, they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria (due in part to outdated and lax regulation{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{Cite book| last=Marshall |first=John | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2011379415/ | title=The financial crisis in the U.S.: Key events, causes and responses |publisher=Research Paper House of Commons Library| year=2009}}</ref>).

* Easy availability of credit in the US, fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] and [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] of the 1997–1998 period, led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending. As banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners, housing prices began to rise. Lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble.

===Subprime lending===
[[File:U.S. Home Ownership and Subprime Origination Share.png|thumb|upright=1.6|US subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004–2006]]
{{Main|Subprime mortgage crisis}}

The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in [[subprime lending]]. Subprime had not become less risky; Wall Street just accepted this higher risk.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSkjB_PGp98C | title=Uncontrolled Risk| last=Williams |first=Mark| publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0-07-163829-6 |pages=125}}</ref>

Due to competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share, and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers. In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators, and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. The riskiest loans were originated in 2004–2007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs. The GSEs eventually relaxed their standards to try to catch up with the private banks.<ref>{{cite news |last=Labaton |first=Stephen| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html |title=The Reckoning-Agency 04 Rule Lets Banks Pile on Debt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Duhigg |first=Charles | author-link=Charles Duhigg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/05fannie.html |title=The Reckoning-Pressured to Take More Risk, Fannie Reached Tipping Point| work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 4, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

A contrarian view is that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] led the way to relaxed underwriting standards, starting in 1995, by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems, by designing no-down-payment products issued by lenders, by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers, and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as [[Bank of America Home Loans|Countrywide]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0ceRXT8Hc8C | first=Joseph | last=Fried | title=Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? | location=New York, NY | publisher=Algora Publishing | year=2012 | pages=16–42, 67–119| isbn=9780875869445 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Housing in the New Millennium: A Home without Equity Is Just a Rental with debt |publisher=Ssrn.com| first=Graham | last=Fisher |date=June 29, 2001 |ssrn=1162456}}</ref>

Depending on how "subprime" mortgages are defined, they remained below 10% of all mortgage originations until 2004, when they rose to nearly 20% and remained there through the 2005–2006 peak of the [[United States housing bubble]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research-areas/reports/state-nations-housing-2008 | title=THE STATE OF THE NATION'S HOUSING 2008 | publisher=[[Joint Center for Housing Studies]] | date=June 23, 2008}}</ref>

====Role of affordable housing programs====
The majority report of the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], written by the six Democratic appointees, the minority report, written by three of the four Republican appointees, studies by [[Federal Reserve]] economists, and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government [[affordable housing]] policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis. Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis, they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks, and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios.

In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, conservative [[American Enterprise Institute]] [[fellow]] [[Peter J.

In the early and mid-2000s, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] called numerous times for investigations into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages. On September 10, 2003, the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] held a hearing, at the urging of the administration, to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] (OFHEO) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities.<ref>{{cite web| title=Just the Facts: The Administration's Unheeded Warnings About the Systemic Risk Posed by the GSEs| url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080919-15.html |publisher=[[whitehouse.gov]] | date=September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=OFHEO Report on Systemic Risk |url=https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Research/Pages/Systemic-Risk-Fannie-Mae,-Freddie-Mac-and-the-Role-of-OFHEO.aspx | publisher=[[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] | date=February 4, 2003}}</ref> The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation.<ref>{{cite web| title=House Hearing on OFHEO Report |url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba97754.000/hba97754_0f.htm | publisher=house.gov}}</ref> Some, such as conservative [[Peter J.

A 2000 [[United States Department of the Treasury]] study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by [[Community Reinvestment Act]] (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/crareport.pdf |title=The Community Reinvestment Act After Financial Modernization | first1=Robert E. | last1=Litan | first2=Nicolas P. | last2=Retsinas | first3=Eric S. | last3=Belsky | first4=Susan | last4=White Haag | publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |date=April 15, 2000}}</ref> but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all subprime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of subprime loans had some connection with CRA.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://prospect.org/article/liberals-cause-sub-prime-crisis/ | first=Robert | last=Gordon |title=Did Liberals Cause the Sub-Prime Crisis? |work=[[The American Prospect]] | date=April 7, 2008}}</ref> However, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Robert |first=W.K.| title=Fiscal Aspects of Aviation Management |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]| year=2000}}</ref> especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Wray |first=Randall L. |date=2007 |title=Lessons from the Subprime Meltdown.| url=https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/Kojucharov-Martin-Martin-Xu.pdf |journal=Working Paper No. 522 |via=Levy Economics Institute of Bard College}}</ref> nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Demyank, Y.| first=Hemert, V.O. |title=Understanding the subprime mortgage crisis| publisher=Review of Financial Studies |year=2011 |pages=1848–1880}}</ref>

To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes in 1995 and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0ceRXT8Hc8C | first=Joseph | last=Fried | title=Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? | location=New York, NY | publisher=Algora Publishing | year=2012 | pages=5| isbn=9780875869445 }}</ref> Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0ceRXT8Hc8C | first=Joseph | last=Fried | title=Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? | location=New York, NY | publisher=Algora Publishing | year=2012 | pages=148| isbn=9780875869445 }}</ref> They also argue that the Federal Reserve's classification of CRA loans as "prime" is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal "subprime" loans.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0ceRXT8Hc8C | first=Joseph | last=Fried | title=Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? | location=New York, NY | publisher=Algora Publishing | year=2012 | pages=140–141| isbn=9780875869445 }}</ref>

Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. In an article in ''Portfolio Magazine'', [[Michael Lewis]] spoke with one trader who noted that "There weren't enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product." Essentially, investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made, far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans, using [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] called credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and [[synthetic CDO]]s.

By March 2011, the FDIC had paid out $9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions.<ref name=post>{{cite news |title=FDIC's Tab For Failed U.S. Banks Nears $9 Billion| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=March 16, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704396504576204752754667840 |first=Robin| last=Sidel | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20110317/NEWS/110319829 | title=US banking regulator's tab for failed banks nears $9B | work=[[The Portsmouth Herald]] | date=March 17, 2011}}</ref> The Congressional Budget Office estimated, in June 2011, that the bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exceeds $300 billion (calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time).<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0ceRXT8Hc8C | first=Joseph | last=Fried | title=Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? | location=New York, NY | publisher=Algora Publishing | year=2012 | pages=75| isbn=9780875869445 }}</ref>

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis. In other words, bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/cre-ative-destruction/ | title=CRE-ative destruction| first=Paul | last=Krugman | author-link=Paul Krugman | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>

Countering Krugman, Peter J. Wallison wrote: "It is not true that every bubble—even a large bubble—has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates." Wallison notes that other developed countries had "large bubbles during the 1997–2007 period" but "the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997–2007 [bubble] deflated." According to Wallison, the reason the U.S. ''residential housing'' bubble (as opposed to other types of bubbles) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans—generally with low or no downpayments.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aei.org/research-products/book/dissent-from-the-majority-report-of-the-financial-crisis-inquiry-commission-2/ | first=Peter J. | last=Wallison | author-link=Peter J. Wallison| title=Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission| publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]] | date=January 2011}}</ref>

Krugman's contention (that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that U.S. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis) is challenged by additional analysis. After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): "We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [commercial mortgage-backed securities] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis."<ref>{{Cite document | last1=Sanders | first1=Anthony B. | last2=An | first2=Xudong | title=Default of CMBS Loans During the Crisis |date=November 29, 2010| ssrn=1717062 | url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1717062}}</ref> Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place ''after'' the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reported: "The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Amadeo | first=Kimberly | title=Commercial Real Estate and the Economy | url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-commercial-real-estate-3305914 | publisher=[[Dotdash]] | date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote:

In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad-it was the economy.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop-in-commercial-real-estate-18275 | last=Gierach | first=Denice A.| title=Waiting for the other shoe to drop in commercial real estate | website=hg.org}}</ref></blockquote>

===Growth of the housing bubble===
{{Main|United States housing bubble}}

By contrast, this ratio increased to 4.0 in 2004, and 4.6 in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/the-financial-crisis-blame-game/articleshow/3617818.cms |title=The Financial Crisis Blame Game | first1=Ben | last1=Steverman | first2=David | last2=Bogoslaw | work=[[Times Internet]] | date=October 18, 2008}}</ref> This [[housing bubble]] resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out [[second mortgage]]s secured by the price appreciation.

In a [[Peabody Award]] winning program, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] correspondents argued that a "Giant Pool of Money" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade. This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the [[mortgage-backed security]] and the [[collateralized debt obligation]] that were assigned safe [[Credit rating|ratings]] by the [[credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis|credit rating agencies]].<ref name=giantpool/>

In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US, with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage [[supply chain]], from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted, and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards.<ref name=giantpool/>

The collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority. Those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies. Securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eavis|first=Peter| url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/11/24/magazines/fortune/eavis_cdo.fortune/index.htm |title=CDO Explained| work=[[CNN]]| date=November 25, 2007}}</ref>

By September 2008, average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20% from their mid-2006 peak.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4Nkye6tpWcC&pg=PA128 | title=Banking and Finance : Theory, Law and Practice | first=Gomez | last=Clifford | publisher=PHI Learning | date=November 30, 2011| isbn=9788120342378 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2008/10/23/a-helping-hand-to-homeowners |title= A Helping Hand to Homeowners|work=The Economist|date=October 23, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> As prices declined, borrowers with [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default.

After the bubble burst, Australian economist John Quiggin wrote, "And, unlike the Great Depression, this crisis was entirely the product of financial markets. There was nothing like the postwar turmoil of the 1920s, the struggles over gold convertibility and reparations, or the [[Smoot-Hawley tariff]], all of which have shared the blame for the Great Depression." Instead, Quiggin lays the blame for the 2008 near-meltdown on financial markets, on political decisions to lightly regulate them, and on rating agencies which had self-interested incentives to give good ratings.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTgiRDj-uIYC&pg=PA62 | title=Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us | first=John | last=Quiggin | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | date=2010 | page=63-64| isbn=978-1400842087 }}</ref>

===Easy credit conditions===
Lower interest rates encouraged borrowing. From 2000 to 2003, the [[Federal Reserve]] lowered the [[federal funds rate]] target from 6.5% to 1.0%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Federal Reserve Board: Monetary Policy and Open Market Operations |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]]}}</ref> This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] and the [[September 11 attacks]], as well as to combat a perceived risk of [[deflation]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGKpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT38 | title=China's Role in Global Economic Recovery | first=Xiaolan | last=Fu | publisher=[[Routledge]] | date= March 12, 2012| isbn=9781136632488 }}</ref> As early as 2002, it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the Fed "needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/02/opinion/dubya-s-double-dip.html |title=Dubya's Double Dip?| last=Krugman| first=Paul| author-link=Paul Krugman | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 2, 2002 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> Moreover, empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis.<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jimfin/v35y2013icp1-19.html| title=Leading indicators of crisis incidence: Evidence from developed countries| first1=Jan| last1=Babecký |first2=Tomáš |last2=Havránek| first3=Jakub| last3=Matějů |first4=Marek |last4=Rusnák |first5=Kateřina |last5=Šmídková| first6=Bořek| last6=Vašíček| date=July 11, 2017| journal=Journal of International Money and Finance| volume=35|issue=C| pages=1–19 |via=RePEc - IDEAS| doi=10.1016/j.jimonfin.2013.01.001| s2cid=18761719}}</ref>

[[File:U.S. Trade Deficit Dollars and % GDP.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|US current account deficit.]]
Additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising U.S. [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit, which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006. Federal Reserve chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] explained how trade deficits required the U.S. to borrow money from abroad, in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=The Global Saving Glut and U.S. Current Account Deficit| first=Ben | last=Bernanke | author-link=Ben Bernanke | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]] | date=April 14, 2005}}</ref>

Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004, the U.S. current account deficit increased by $650 billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the U.S. to finance its imports.

All of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices. Ben Bernanke referred to this as a "[[saving glut]]".<ref name=Bernanke>{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070911a.htm |title=Global Imbalances: Recent Developments and Prospects | first=Ben S. |last=Bernanke | author-link=Ben S. Bernanke | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]] | date=September 11, 2007}}</ref>

A flood of funds ([[Financial capital|capital]] or [[liquidity]]) reached the U.S. financial markets. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing [[Treasury bond]]s and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis. U.S. households, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]].{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}

===Weak and fraudulent underwriting practices===
Subprime lending standards declined in the U.S.: in early 2000, a subprime borrower had a FICO score of 660 or less. By 2005, many lenders dropped the required FICO score to 620, making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business. Proof of income and assets were de-emphasized. Loans at first required full documentation, then low documentation, then no documentation. One subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income, no job, no asset verification required (NINJA) mortgage. Informally, these loans were aptly referred to as "[[liar loans]]" because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process.<ref>{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSkjB_PGp98C | title=Uncontrolled Risk |last=Williams |first=Mark |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |date=April 12, 2010 |isbn=978-0-07-163829-6 |pages=124 }}</ref> Testimony given to the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] by [[whistleblower]] [[Richard M.

His testimony stated that by 2006, 60% of mortgages purchased by [[Citigroup]] from some 1,600 mortgage companies were "defective" (were not underwritten to policy, or did not contain all policy-required documents)—this, despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible (certified via representations and warrantees) that its mortgage originations met [[Citigroup]] standards. Moreover, during 2007, "defective mortgages (from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to [[Citigroup|Citi's]] standards) increased ... to over 80% of production".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-testimony/2010-0407-Bowen.pdf | title=Hearing on Subprime Lending And Securitization And Government Sponsored Enterprises | publisher=[[Stanford University]] | date=April 7, 2010}}</ref>

In separate testimony to the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]], officers of Clayton Holdings, the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe, testified that Clayton's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators' underwriting standards. The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including 7 "[[too big to fail]]" banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer. Clayton's analysis further showed that 39% of these loans (i.e. those not meeting ''any'' issuer's minimal underwriting standards) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Raters Ignored Proof of Unsafe Loans, Panel Is Told |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/business/27ratings.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Gretchen |last=Morgenson| author-link=Gretchen Morgenson | date=September 26, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=All Clayton Trending Reports 1st quarter 2006 – 2nd quarter 2007 | url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/fct/fcic/fcic_docs_clayton_alltrending_20100923.pdf | publisher=[[FRASER]] | year=2007}}</ref>

===Predatory lending===
[[Predatory lending]] refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders, enticing borrowers to enter into "unsafe" or "unsound" secured loans for inappropriate purposes.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/mortgages/what-is-predatory-lending-14953861 | title=What Is Predatory Lending? | first=BRIAN | last=O'CONNELL | work=[[TheStreet.com]] | date=May 9, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://dfi.wa.gov/financial-education/information/predatory-lending | title=Predatory Lending | publisher=[[Washington State Department of Financial Institutions]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/predatory_lending | title=predatory lending | publisher=[[Legal Information Institute]]}}</ref>

In June 2008, [[Countrywide Financial]] was sued by then [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] for "unfair business practices" and "false advertising", alleging that Countrywide used "deceptive tactics to push homeowners into complicated, risky, and expensive loans so that the company could sell as many loans as possible to third-party investors".<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/brown-sues-countrywide-mortgage-deception | title=Brown Sues Countrywide For Mortgage Deception | publisher=[[Attorney General of California]] | date=June 25, 2008}}</ref> In May 2009, Bank of America modified 64,000 Countrywide loans as a result.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://dsnews.com/news/loss-mitigation/05-31-2009/bofa-modifies-64000-countrywide-loans-2009-06-01 | title=BofA Modifies 64,000 Countrywide Loans | work=DS News | date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> When housing prices decreased, homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments, since their home equity had disappeared.

Former employees from [[Ameriquest]], which was United States' leading wholesale lender, described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits.

===Deregulation and lack of regulation ===
{{Further|Government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis}}
A 2012 OECD study<ref>{{cite journal|title=Systemically Important Banks and Capital Regulation Challenges |doi=10.1787/5kg0ps8cq8q6-en| journal=OECD Economics Department Working Papers |year=2012 | last1=Slovik | first1=Patrick|doi-access=free }}</ref> suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. In other cases, laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Key examples include:
* [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980 (DIDMCA) phased out several restrictions on banks' financial practices, broadened their lending powers, allowed [[credit union]]s and [[savings and loan]]s to offer [[checkable deposit]]s, and raised the [[deposit insurance]] limit from $40,000 to $100,000 (thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders' risk management policies).<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] | title=History of the Eighties – Lessons for the Future | date=December 1997 | url=https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/3_85.pdf}}</ref>

* In November 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]], which repealed provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibited a [[bank holding company]] from owning other financial companies.

* In 2004, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] relaxed the [[net capital rule]], which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages.

Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives, which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book| last1=Chang | first1=V. | last2=Newman | first2=R. | last3=Walters | first3=R.J. | last4=Wills | first4=G.B. |title=Review of economic bubbles| publisher=International Journal of Information Management: The Journal for Information Professionals| year=2016 |pages=497–506}}</ref>

Behavior that may be optimal for an individual such as saving more during adverse economic conditions, can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a "paradox of deleveraging" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name="Yellen on Minsky" />

In April 2009, [[Federal Reserve]] vice-chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes:

<blockquote>Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.<ref name="Yellen on Minsky" /></blockquote>

===Financial innovation and complexity===
[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]
The term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}

CDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets. As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found. For example, buying a CDS to insure a CDO ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the CDO, when those CDO's became worthless.<ref>{{cite book| last=Lewis| first=Michael | author-link=Michael Lewis | date=March 15, 2010 | title=The Big Short | publisher=[[W.

This boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity. It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/resource/staff-data-projects/story-of-a-security |title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission – story of a security | publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}</ref> Economists have studied the crisis as an instance of [[cascades in financial networks]], where institutions' instability destabilized other institutions and led to knock-on effects.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Elliott|first1=Matthew |last2=Golub |first2=Benjamin |last3=Jackson| first3=Matthew O.| title=Financial Networks and Contagion| journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |volume=104| issue=10| year=2014|pages=3115–3153 |issn=0002-8282 |doi=10.1257/aer.104.10.3115|url=https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20141114-080019333 }}</ref>

[[Martin Wolf]], chief economics commentator at the ''[[Financial Times]]'', wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: "... an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade—the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself—was to find a way round regulation."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0| title=Reform of Regulation and Incentives | first=Martin | last=Wolf | author-link=Martin Wolf | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=June 23, 2009 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

===Incorrect pricing of risk===
[[File:AIG Protester on Pine Street.jpg|thumb|A protester on [[Wall Street]] in the wake of the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]] is interviewed by news media.]]

Mortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years. Limitations of default and prepayment models, the heart of pricing models, led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators, securitizers, broker-dealers, rating-agencies, insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors (with the exception of certain hedge funds).<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/reckless-optimism/ |title=Reckless Optimism | last=Samuelson | first=Robert J. |journal=[[Claremont Review of Books]] | volume=XII | issue=1 |year=2011 | page=13}}</ref><ref name=kourlas>{{cite web | last=Kourlas| first=James | title=Lessons Not Learned From the Housing Crisis| url=https://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/4959-lessons-not-learned-from-the-housing-crisis-| publisher=[[The Atlas Society]] |date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> While financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants, it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk.<ref name=kourlas/>

The pricing of risk refers to the [[risk premium]] required by investors for taking on additional risk, which may be measured by higher interest rates or fees. Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}

For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system.<ref name=declaration/> The pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between "late 2005 to the middle of 2007"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for "high quality" CDOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for [[mezzanine capital]] CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.

[[AIG]] insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of [[credit default swap]]s. The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. U.S. taxpayers provided over $180 billion in government loans and investments in AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=27156 | title=Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk | first1=Shannon D. | last1=Harrington | first2=Abigail | last2=Moses | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=November 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Byrnes| first=Nanette | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2009-03-17/whos-who-on-aigs-list-of-counterparties | title=Who's Who on AIG List of Counterparties | work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=March 17, 2009}}</ref>

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis. It concluded in January 2011:

<blockquote>The Commission concludes AIG failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, or hedging its exposure—a profound failure in corporate governance, particularly its risk management practices. AIG's failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including credit default swaps, which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products, including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIG's failure.<ref>{{cite book| first=Phil |last=Angelides | author-link=Phil Angelides| title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Report| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKfTVrhNfMC&pg=PA352 |year=2011| publisher=DIANE Publishing |page=352| isbn=9781437980721}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=Jerry M. |last=Rosenberg |title=The Concise Encyclopedia of The Great Recession 2007–2012| url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000rose|url-access=registration |year=2012| publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000rose/page/244 244]|isbn=9780810883406}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Asli Yüksel Mermod|author2=Samuel O.

A [[conflict of interest]] between [[investment management]] professional and [[institutional investor]]s, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[assets under management]]. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a "plausible deniability" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early "vintages" of subprime loans was so low.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Calomiris |first=Charles| author-link=Charles Calomiris | title=The Subprime Turmoil: What's Old, What's New, and What's Next |journal=Journal of Structured Finance| volume=15| issue=1|pages=6–52|date=Spring 2009 |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2008/arc/pdf/CWC.pdf |doi=10.3905/JSF.2009.15.1.006 |citeseerx=10.1.1.628.2224|s2cid=15660445}}</ref>

===Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system===
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis]]
There is strong evidence that the riskiest, worst performing mortgages were funded through the "[[shadow banking system]]" and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their underwriting standards and originate riskier loans.

In a June 2008 speech, President and CEO of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] [[Timothy Geithner]]—who in 2009 became [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]—placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a "run" on the entities in the "parallel" banking system, also called the [[shadow banking system]]. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[Asset–liability mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would force them to engage in rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities:

{{quote|In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2 trillion. Assets financed overnight in tri-party repo grew to $2.5 trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8 trillion. The combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled $4 trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion. The combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles.<ref name=reducing/>}}

Economist [[Paul Krugman]], laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect" and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity.<ref name="Krugman 2009" /> Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] or [[asset-backed commercial paper]], investment banks and other entities in the [[shadow banking]] system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations.<ref name=reducing/><ref name="Krugman 2009" />

This meant that nearly one-third of the U.S. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009.<ref name=Uncrunch/> According to the [[Brookings Institution]], at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: "It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume." The authors also indicate that some forms of [[securitization]] were "likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions". While traditional banks raised their lending standards, it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that was the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing.<ref name=gofromhere/>

The securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds.<ref name=Uncrunch>{{cite news| url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/can-feds-uncrunch-credit-13139.html |title=Can the Fed's Uncrunch Credit? | first=Nicole | last=Gelinas | work=[[City Journal]] | date=Winter 2009}}</ref> According to the [[Brookings Institution]] in June 2009, the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: "It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume" and some forms of securitization are "likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions".<ref name=gofromhere/>

===Commodity price inflation===
{{Main|2000s commodities boom}}

Rapid increases in several commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://futures.tradingcharts.com/chart/CO/M |title=Light Crude Oil Chart| publisher=Futures.tradingcharts.com}}</ref> Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy,<ref>{{cite news| last=Conway |first=Edmund| author-link=Ed Conway | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2790539/George-Soros-rocketing-oil-price-is-a-bubble.html |title=Soros – Rocketing Oil Price is a Bubble |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=May 26, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://mises.org/library/oil-price-bubble |title=The Oil Price Bubble |publisher=[[Mises Institute]]| date=June 2, 2008}}</ref> There was a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-12-08/was-volatility-price-oil-cause-2008-financial-crisis/ |title=Was Volatility in the Price of Oil a Cause of the 2008 Financial Crisis? | first=Tom | last= Therramus| work=[[Post Carbon Institute]] |date=December 8, 2009}}</ref> The destabilizing effects of this price variance was proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis.

[[File:Copper Price History USD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Global copper prices]]

Copper prices increased at the same time as oil prices. Copper traded at about $2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999, when it fell to about $1,600. The price slump lasted until 2004, when a price surge pushed copper to $7,040 per ton in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kitcometals.com/charts/copper_historical_large.html| title=Kitco - Spot Copper Historical Charts and Graphs | publisher=Kitco}}</ref>

Nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s, then declined from around $51,000 /£36,700 per metric ton in May 2007 to about $11,550/£8,300 per metric ton in January 2009. Prices were only just starting to recover as of January 2010, but most of Australia's nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7841417.stm |title=Miner BHP to lay off 6,000 staff |work=[[BBC News]] |date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> As the price for high grade [[nickel sulphate]] ore recovered in 2010, so did the Australian nickel mining industry.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/10856 |title=Mincor's result reflects a return to better days for sulphide nickel |publisher=Proactive Investors |date=February 18, 2010 }}</ref>

Coincidentally with these price fluctuations, long-only commodity index funds became popular—by one estimate investment increased from $90 billion in 2006 to $200 billion at the end of 2007, while commodity prices increased 71% – which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble.<ref name=IrwinSanders2010 /> The empirical research has been mixed.<ref name=IrwinSanders2010>{{cite journal | last1=Irwin | first1=Scott H. | last2=Sanders | first2=Dwight R. | date=June 1, 2010 | title=The Impact of Index and Swap Funds on Commodity Futures Markets | url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/the-impact-of-index-and-swap-funds-on-commodity-futures-markets_5kmd40wl1t5f-en | journal=OECD Working Paper | series=OECD Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Papers | doi=10.1787/5kmd40wl1t5f-en }}</ref>

===Systemic crisis of capitalism===
In a 1998 book, [[John McMurtry (academic)|John McMurtry]] suggested that a financial crisis is a systemic crisis of [[capitalism]] itself.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7Mbb1aMWAkC | last=McMurty| first=John | author-link=John McMurtry (academic) | date=December 10, 1998 | publisher=[[Pluto Press]] | title=The Cancer Stage of Capitalism | isbn=978-0-7453-1347-4}}</ref>

In his 1978 book, ''[[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism]]'', [[Ravi Batra]] suggests that growing inequality of [[financial capitalism]] produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes. He also suggested that a "demand gap" related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments.<ref>{{cite news| last=Batra| first=Ravi| author-link=Ravi Batra | url=https://truthout.org/articles/weapons-of-mass-exploitation/ |title=Weapons of Mass Exploitation? |work=[[Truthout]] |date=May 8, 2011}}</ref>

[[John Bellamy Foster]], a political economy analyst and editor of the ''[[Monthly Review]]'', believed that the decrease in GDP growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing [[market saturation]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://monthlyreview.org/2008/04/01/the-financialization-of-capital-and-the-crisis |title=The Financialization of Capital and the Crisis | first=John Bellamy | last=Foster | work=[[Monthly Review]] | date=April 1, 2008}}</ref>

[[Marxian economics]] followers [[Andrew Kliman]], Michael Roberts, and Guglielmo Carchedi, in contradistinction to the Monthly Review school represented by Foster, pointed to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit "eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits".<ref>{{cite web |last=Roberts | first=Michael |url=https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/carchedi-foster-and-the-causes-of-crisis/ |title=Carchedi, Foster and the causes of crisis| date=July 3, 2011}}</ref>

In 2005 book, ''The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism'', [[John C. Bogle]] wrote that "Corporate America went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long". Echoing the central thesis of [[James Burnham]]'s 1941 seminal book, ''[[James Burnham#The Managerial Revolution|The Managerial Revolution]]'', Bogle cites issues, including:<ref>{{cite book| last=Bogle| first=John |year=2005| title=The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism| url=https://archive.org/details/battleforsoulo00bogl| url-access=registration |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] | isbn=978-0-300-11971-8}}</ref>
* that "Manager's capitalism" replaced "owner's capitalism", meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders, a variation on the [[principal–agent problem]];
* the burgeoning executive compensation;
* the management of earnings, mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value; and
* the failure of gatekeepers, including auditors, boards of directors, Wall Street analysts, and career politicians.

In his book ''[[The Big Mo (book)|The Big Mo]]'', [[Mark Roeder]], a former executive at the Swiss-based [[UBS]] Bank, suggested that large-scale momentum, or [[The Big Mo]] "played a pivotal role" in the financial crisis. Roeder suggested that "recent technological advances, such as computer-driven trading programs, together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets, has magnified the momentum effect. This has made the financial sector inherently unstable."<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrnFCB2lNAEC | title=The Big Mo: Why Momentum Now Rules Our World | first=Mark | last=Roeder | author-link=Mark Roeder | publisher=[[Virgin Books]] | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-7535-3937-8}}</ref>

[[Robert Reich]] attributed the economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the United States, particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80% of the workforce.

Economists [[Ailsa McKay]] and [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] argued that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Bjørnholt |first1=Margunn |author1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt |last2=McKay |first2=Ailsa |author2-link=Ailsa McKay |editor1-last=Bjørnholt |editor1-first=Margunn |editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt |editor2-last=McKay |editor2-first=Ailsa |editor2-link=Ailsa McKay| title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|chapter-url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf |year=2014| publisher=[[Demeter Press]] |pages=7–20| chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis |isbn=978-1-927335-27-7}}</ref>

===Wrong banking model: resiliency of credit unions===
A report by the [[International Labour Organization]] concluded that [[cooperative banking]] institutions were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis. The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7% of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---coop/documents/publication/wcms_207768.pdf |title=Resilience in a downturn |website=www.ilo.org }}</ref> In 2008, in the U.S., the rate of commercial bank failures was almost triple that of [[credit union]]s, and almost five times the credit union rate in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/11/22/in-pictures-banks-vs-credit-unions-in-the-financia.aspx |title=In Pictures: Banks vs. Credit Unions in the Financial Crisis |first=Matt |last=Cropp| date=November 22, 2011 |website=[[The Motley Fool]]}}</ref> Credit unions increased their lending to small- and medium-sized businesses while overall lending to those businesses decreased.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.sba.gov/advocacy/how-did-bank-lending-small-business-united-states-fare-after-financial-crisis |title=How Did Bank Lending to Small Business in the United States Fare After the Financial Crisis? | publisher=[[Small Business Administration]]}}</ref>

Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis. For example, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and stated that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html | title=Dr. Doom | first=Stephen | last=Mihm | date=August 15, 2008 | work=[[New York Times Magazine]] | url-access=subscription}}</ref> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while ''The New York Times'' labelled him "Dr. Doom".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/24/nouriel-roubini-credit-crunch| first=Emma |last=Brockes | title=He Told Us So| work=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 24, 2009 |location=London}}</ref>

The former Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], [[Raghuram Rajan]], had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]]. In 2005, at a celebration honoring [[Alan Greenspan]], who was about to retire as chairman of the [[US Federal Reserve]], Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Raghuram |last=Rajan |title=Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier? |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 11728 |date=November 2005 |doi=10.3386/w11728 |doi-access=free}}</ref> In that paper, Rajan "argued that disaster might loom".<ref>{{cite news | first=Justin | last=Lahart | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123086154114948151 | title=Mr Rajan Was Unpopular (But Prescient) at Greenspan Party | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 2, 2009 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to "take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time. These risks are known as tail risks. But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialize, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimized."

Stock trader and financial risk engineer [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], author of the 2007 book ''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]'', spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting, and framed the problem as part of "robustness and fragility".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-nassim-taleb-is-the-t_b_263194 |title=Why Nassim Taleb is the True Predictor of this Crisis | first=Pablo | last=Triana | work=[[HuffPost]]| date=August 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/imbeciles.htm |title=The Black Swan: Quotes & Warnings that the Imbeciles Chose to Ignore |publisher=fooledbyrandomness.com |date=April 2007}}</ref> He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis ("They didn't listen, so I took their money").<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html |work=[[The New York Times]]| first=Joe| last=Nocera | author-link=Joe Nocera | title=Risk Mismanagement | date=January 4, 2009 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> According to [[David Brooks (commentator)|David Brooks]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Taleb not only has an explanation for what's happening, he saw it coming."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/opinion/28brooks.html| work=[[The New York Times]]| first=David| last=Brooks| author-link=David Brooks (commentator) | title=The Behavioral Revolution | date=October 28, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

==IndyMac==
The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California–based [[IndyMac]], a spin-off of [[Countrywide Financial]]. Before its failure, IndyMac Bank was the largest [[savings and loan association]] in the [[Los Angeles]] market and the seventh largest [[mortgage loan]] originator in the United States.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080408005471/en/IndyMac-Bancorp-Announces-Earnings-Webcast-Teleconference-Call |title=IndyMac Bancorp Announces Earnings Webcast & Teleconference Call for First Quarter 2008 Financial Results | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=August 8, 2008}}</ref> The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11, 2008, was the fourth largest [[Bank run|bank failure]] in [[United States]] history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures,<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrea| last=Shalal-Esa |title=FACTBOX: Top ten U.S. bank failures |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-washingtonmutual-jpmorgan-failures-fa/factbox-top-ten-u-s-bank-failures-idUSTRE48P0YC20080926 |work=[[Reuters]] | date=September 25, 2008}}</ref> and the second largest failure of a regulated [[savings and loan association|thrift]].<ref name=shutsdown>{{cite news |url=https://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Jul11/0,4675,IndyMac,00.html |title=Government shuts down mortgage lender IndyMac |first=Alex |last=Veiga | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=July 12, 2008}}</ref> IndyMac Bank's parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank.<ref name=Liquidate>{{cite web| url=https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/indymac-bancorp-to-liquidate-10431578 |title=IndyMac Bancorp to Liquidate |last=LaCapra| first=Lauren Tara |work=[[TheStreet.com]] |date=August 1, 2008}}</ref> IndyMac Bancorp filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] in July 2008.<ref name=Liquidate/>

IndyMac Bank was founded as Countrywide Mortgage Investment in 1985 by [[David S. Loeb]] and [[Angelo Mozilo]]<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030702005243/en/David-S.-Loeb-Chairman-IndyMac-Bancorp-Passes | title=David S.

In 1997, Countrywide spun off IndyMac as an independent company run by Mike Perry, who remained its CEO until the downfall of the bank in July 2008.<ref name="Paletta">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121581435073947103 |title=Crisis Deepens as Big Bank Fails: IndyMac Seized In Largest Bust In Two Decades |first1=Damian |last1=Paletta | last2=Enrich | first2=David | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 12, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

The primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing [[Alt-A]] loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.

IndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets—states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] was most pronounced—and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.

IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the [[secondary mortgage market]]. IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.<ref name=lossreview>{{cite web| url=https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/ig/Documents/oig09032.pdf |title=Audit Report - SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS: Material Loss Review of IndyMac Bank, FSB | publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] | date=February 26, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html |title=FDIC Board Approves Letter of Intent to Sell IndyMac Federal | publisher=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] | date=January 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Letter from IndyMac | access-date=February 24, 2014 |url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf | archive-date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>

On May 12, 2008, in the "Capital" section of its last 10-Q, IndyMac revealed that it may not be well capitalized in the future.<ref name=indymac10Q>{{cite web | url=http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#msef | title=Indymac Bancorp Inc – '10-Q' for 3/31/08 | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}</ref>

IndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds—including $160 million issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed its risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, IndyMac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below "well capitalized" (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to "adequately capitalized" (8–10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds.

Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37% of IndyMac's total deposits, and ask the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/business/23thrift.html | title=Irregularity Is Uncovered at IndyMac Bank | first=Edmund L. | last=Andrews | author-link=Edmund L. Andrews | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 22, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31,<ref name=indymac10Q/> Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30.

IndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thestreet.com/markets/rates-and-bonds/indymac-seeks-to-preserve-capital-10416473 | title=Indymac Seeks to Preserve Capital | first=PHILIP | last=VAN DOORN | work=[[TheStreet.com]] | date=May 13, 2008}}</ref>

IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million capital it claimed it had, as of March 31, 2008, was fabricated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1040/IMB_01/201099_r01c_08CV03812.pdf | title=Robert C.

When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits.<ref name=indymac10Q/> This [[bank run]] on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS. The letter outlined the Senator's concerns with IndyMac. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way it was operated.<ref name=lossreview/>

On June 26, 2008, Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY), a member of the [[Senate Banking Committee]], chairman of Congress' [[Joint Economic Committee]] and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, released several letters he had sent to regulators, in which he was"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers." Some worried depositors began to withdraw money.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/07/13/news/companies/schumer_indymac/index.htm | title=Schumer: Don't blame me for IndyMac failure | work=[[CNN]] | date=July 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121607771017452513 | title=The $4 Billion Senator | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 15, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

On July 7, 2008, IndyMac announced on the company blog that it:
* Had failed to raise [[Capital (economics)|capital]] since its May 12, 2008 quarterly earnings report;
* Had been notified by bank and thrift regulators that IndyMac Bank was no longer deemed "well-capitalized";
IndyMac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions, halted new loan submissions, and cut 3,800 jobs.<ref>{{cite news | last=Veiga | first=Alex | title=IndyMac stops new mortgage loans, to cut workforce by half | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/07/07/indymac-stops-new-mortgage-loans-to-cut-workforce-by-half/ | publisher=Mercury News |agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=July 7, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into [[conservatorship]]. A [[bridge bank (United States)|bridge bank]], IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on July 14, 2008. Until then, depositors would have access their insured deposits through ATMs, their existing checks, and their existing debit cards. Telephone and Internet account access was restored when the bank reopened.<ref name=indymactaken>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/indymac-idUSWAO00014120080711 |title=IndyMac Taken Over By Regulators| first1=John | last1=Poirier | first2=Karey | last2=Wutkowski | first3=Rachelle | last3=Younglai | work=[[Reuters]] | date=July 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://ml-implode.com/info/indy-fdic.pdf |publisher=IndyMac Bank| title=FDIC Notification to All Employees| first=Evan |last=Wagner |date=July 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name=fn1>{{cite news| url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/federal-regulators-close-california-mortgage-lender | publisher=[[Fox News]] | agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Federal Regulators Close California Mortgage Lender | date=July 11, 2008}}</ref> The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to US$100,000, and declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount, guaranteeing 50% of any amounts in excess of $100,000.<ref name=shutsdown/> Yet, even with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings, an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-feb-28-fi-indymac28-story.html | title=IndyMac's shuffle ran over depositors | first=William | last=Heisel | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 28, 2009 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/IndyMac.html |title=FDIC: Failed Bank Information - Bank Closing Information for IndyMac Bank, F.S.B., Pasadena, CA | publisher=[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]}}</ref>

With $32 billion in assets, IndyMac Bank was one of the largest bank failures in American history.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-indy.4.14456887.html | title=IndyMac one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history | first=Louise | last=Story | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 13, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

IndyMac Bancorp filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] on July 31, 2008.<ref name=Liquidate/>

Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and [[Countrywide Financial]], as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets. Over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008. Concerns that investment bank [[Bear Stearns]] would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to [[JP Morgan Chase]]. The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008. Several major institutions either failed, were acquired under duress, or were subject to government takeover. These included [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Merrill Lynch]], Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, [[Washington Mutual]], [[Wachovia]], [[Citigroup]], and [[AIG]].<ref name=greatcrash/> On October 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO [[Richard S. Fuld Jr.]] found himself before Representative [[Henry A. Waxman]], the California Democrat who chaired the [[House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. Fuld said he was a victim of the collapse, blaming a "crisis of confidence" in the markets for dooming his firm.<ref>{{cite news| first=James | last=Sterngold | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-04-29/how-much-did-lehman-ceo-dick-fuld-really-make | title=How Much Did Lehman CEO Dick Fuld Really Make? | work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | date=April 29, 2010 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

==Notable books and movies==
* In 2006, [[Peter Schiff]] authored a book titled ''[[Crash Proof: How to Profit From the Coming Economic Collapse]]'', which was published in February 2007 by [[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]. The book describes various features of the economy and housing market that led to the [[United States housing bubble]], and warns of the impending decline. After many of the predictions came to pass, a second edition titled ''Crash Proof 2.0'' was published in 2009, which included a "2009 update" addendum at the end of each chapter. It was featured on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]].

*''[[Meltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and the Government Bailout Will Make Things Worse]]'', by [[Thomas Woods]], was published in February 2009 by [[Regnery Publishing]]. It was featured on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]] for 10 weeks

* A 2010 documentary film, ''Overdose: A Film about the Next Financial Crisis'', describes how the financial crisis came about and how the solutions that have been applied by many governments are setting the stage for the next crisis. The film is based on the book ''Financial Fiasco'' by [[Johan Norberg]] and features [[Alan Greenspan]], with funding from the [[libertarian]] think tank [[Cato Institute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cato.org/events/overdose-film-about-next-financial-crisis |title=Overdose: A Film about the Next Financial Crisis| publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |date=May 17, 2010}}</ref>

* In October 2010, a documentary film about the crisis, ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'' directed by [[Charles Ferguson (filmmaker)|Charles Ferguson]], was released by [[Sony Pictures Classics]]. In 2011, it was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].{{Citation needed|reason=No source|date=September 2019}}

* [[Michael Lewis]] authored a best-selling non-fiction book about the crisis, entitled ''[[The Big Short]]''. In 2015, it was adapted into a [[The Big Short (film)|film of the same name]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. One point raised is to what extent those outside of the markets themselves (i.e., not working for a mainstream investment bank) could forecast the events and be generally less myopic.

* Subsequent to the crisis, Nate Drumond in ''The Power of Three: Discovering What Really Matters in Life'' noted a change in social relations as some group culpability emerged.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOQ5AgAAQBAJ | last=Drummond |first=Norman| title=The Power of Three: Discovering what really matters in life |date=July 22, 2010 | publisher=[[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]] | location=[[London]] | isbn=978-0-340-97991-4}}</ref>

* Set on the night before the crisis broke, ''[[Margin Call]]'' is a movie that follows traders through a sleepless 24 hours as they try to contain the damage after an analyst discovers information that is likely to ruin their firm, and possibly the whole economy.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/9/14/17856048/movies-financial-crisis-streaming-lehman-brothers-versailles-big-short-inside-job | title=5 movies that explain what caused the financial crisis, and what happened after | first=Alissa | last=Wilkinson | work=[[Vox Media]] | date=September 15, 2018}}</ref>
