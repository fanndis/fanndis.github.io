The '''domestic policy of the George W. Bush Administration''' was the domestic policy of the United States from 2001 to 2009 while [[George W. Bush]] was [[President of the United States|president]]. Bush's main domestic policy advisors include Chairman of the Council of Economic Affairs [[Edward Lazear]], [[Rob Portman]], director of the Office of Management and Budget; U.S. Secretary of Labor [[Elaine Chao]] Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]; U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Paulson]]; U.S. Secretary of Commerce [[Carlos Gutierrez]]; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services [[Michael O. Leavitt]] and [[Allan Hubbard (Presidential advisor)|Allan Hubbard]], director of the [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]].

Some of George W. Bush's biggest domestic policy achievements include winning passage for two major tax cuts during his term in office: the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]]. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the "[[Bush tax cuts]]".

==Law enforcement and justice==
===Surveillance and homeland security===

On October 26, 2001, Bush signed into law the [[Patriot Act]]. Passed on the president's request, the act permitted increased sharing of intelligence among the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] and expanded the government's domestic authority to conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists.<ref name=mann6365/> The Patriot Act also authorized the use of [[roving wiretap]]s on suspected terrorists and expanded the government's authority to conduct surveillance of suspected "[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]]" terrorists.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=Everything you need to know about the Patriot Act debate |url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/politics/patriot-act-debate-explainer-nsa/index.html |accessdate=February 24, 2019 |publisher=CNN |date=May 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225102956/https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/politics/patriot-act-debate-explainer-nsa/index.html |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bush also secretly authorized the [[National Security Agency]] to [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|conduct warrantless surveillance]] of communications in and out of the United States.<ref name=mann6365>Mann (2015), pp. 63–65</ref>

Shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], Bush announced the creation of the [[Office of Homeland Security]] and appointed former [[governor of Pennsylvania]] [[Tom Ridge]] its director.<ref>Draper (2007), p. 157</ref> After Congress passed the [[Homeland Security Act]] signed into law by President Bush on November 25, 2002 to create the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), Ridge became the first director of the newly created department. The department was charged with overseeing immigration, border control, customs, and the newly established [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), which focused on [[airport security]].<ref name=mann6365/> Though the FBI and CIA remained independent agencies, the DHS was assigned jurisdiction over the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (which was divided into three agencies), the [[United States Customs Service]] (which was also divided into separate agencies), and the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]. The Homeland Security Act represented the most significant departmental reorganization since the [[National Security Act of 1947]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Glass |first1=Andrew |title=Bush creates Homeland Security Department, Nov. 26, 2002 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/this-day-in-politics-november-26-1012269 |accessdate=February 24, 2019 |publisher=Politico |date=November 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225102948/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/this-day-in-politics-november-26-1012269 |archive-date=February 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Capital punishment===
George W. Bush is a strong supporter of [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]]. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were [[capital punishment in Texas|executed in that state]], maintaining its record as the leading state in [[execution (legal)|executions]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/01/13/death-in-texas/|title=Death in Texas|first=Sister Helen|last=Prejean|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=29 March 2018|accessdate=29 March 2018|via=www.nybooks.com}}</ref> As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist [[Timothy McVeigh]]. Although Bush's support of the death penalty is known, controversy broke in 1999 when journalist [[Tucker Carlson]] revealed that the Governor had mocked the plight of [[Karla Faye Tucker]] in an interview.

===Amber Alert===
Bush signed the [[Amber Alert]] legislation into law on April 30, 2003, which was developed to quickly alert the general public about [[child abduction]]s using various media sources.<ref>{{cite news

===Prison rape===
The [[Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003]] (PREA) is the first United States federal law passed dealing with the [[Prison rape in the United States|sexual assault of prisoners]]. The bill was signed into law by President Bush on September 4, 2003. As a result, the [[National Prison Rape Elimination Commission]] was created to study the problem and recommend solutions. Federal funding for prisons also began to require detainment facilities to keep records on sexual assault. Failure to follow PREA requirements resulted in losing up to 5% of funding. New grants to prevent sexual assault were also created by the law. Significant support for the act came from [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Concerned Women for America]], Just Detention International, and numerous evangelical organizations.

== Science ==
On December 19, 2002, Bush signed into law H. R. 4664, far-reaching legislation to put the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) on a track to double its budget over five years and to create new [[mathematics]] and [[science]] [[education]] initiatives at both the pre-college and [[undergraduate]] level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aibs.org/public-policy-reports/public-policy-reports-2002_12_20.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928013845/http://www.aibs.org/public-policy-reports/public-policy-reports-2002_12_20.html|url-status=dead|title=Public Policy Report for 12/20/2002|archive-date=September 28, 2006}}</ref> In the first three years of those five, the R&D budget has increased by fourteen percent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/nsf05c.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206101750/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/nsf05c.htm|url-status=dead|title=AAAS R&D Funding Update on R&D in the Final FY 2005 National Science Foundation Budget – December 2|archive-date=December 6, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/nsf05cf1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102110449/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/nsf05cf1.pdf |archive-date=2006-11-02 }}</ref> Bush has long been dogged by criticism that his administration ignores or suppresses scientific advice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/reports-scientific-integrity-in-policy-making.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130054225/http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/reports-scientific-integrity-in-policy-making.html|url-status=dead|title=Reports: Scientific Integrity in Policy Making|archive-date=November 30, 2006}}</ref> Bush showed support for [[oceanography]] and [[space exploration]]; and supported sciences on reducing pollution. Bush generally was opposed to [[biology]] especially the science of [[human reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]]; and science with [[global warming]]. Bush supported "[[Teach the Controversy]]". Bush's positions were not always shared by his [[Republican Party (United States)#Social policies|party.]]

=== Stem cell research ===
[[George W. Bush|President Bush]] supported adult stem cell research and umbilical cord blood stem cell research. However, Bush opposed any new embryonic [[stem cell research]], and had limited the federal funding of existing research. Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research was first approved under [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] on January 19, 1999,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} but no money was to be spent until the guidelines were published. The guidelines were released under Clinton on August 23, 2000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} They allowed use of unused frozen [[embryo]]s. On August 9, 2001, before any funding was granted under these guidelines, Bush announced modifications to the guidelines to allow use of only existing stem cell lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html|title=President Discusses Stem Cell Research|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> While Bush claimed that more than 60 embryonic stem cell lines already existed from privately funded [[research]], scientists in 2003 said there were only 11 usable lines, and in 2005 that all lines approved for Federal funding are contaminated and unusable.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/24/stem.cells/ | work=CNN | title=House passes embryonic stem cell bill | date=2005-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> Adult stem cell funding was not restricted and was supported by President Bush as a more viable means of research.

=== Space exploration ===
[[File:Bush waves from Marine One on the South Lawn.jpg|thumb|right|President [[George W. Bush]] waves as he prepares to depart the [[White House]] aboard Marine One from the South Lawn en route to [[Andrews Air Force Base]] for his trip to [[Michigan]].]]
On January 14, 2004, Bush announced a [[Vision for Space Exploration]],<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/54868main_bush_trans.pdf "President Bush Delivers Remarks On U.S. Space Policy"] January 14, 2004. Release from NASA Facts.</ref> calling for the completion of the [[International Space Station]] by 2010 and the retirement of the [[space shuttle]] while developing a new [[spacecraft]] called the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] under the title [[Project Constellation]]. The CEV would be used to return American [[astronaut]]s to the [[Moon]] by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent [[lunar base]], and eventually sending future manned missions to [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/01/14/bush.space/index.html | work=CNN | title=Bush unveils vision for moon and beyond | date=2004-01-14 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> To this end, the plan proposes that [[NASA]]'s budget increase by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/54873main_budget_chart_14jan04.pdf "Strategy Based on Long-Term Affordability"] – A January 14, 2006 graph showing a plan for NASA's long-term budget.</ref> The planned retirement of the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign.<ref>http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/world/8572141.htm?1c</ref> Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.

Supporters believe that this plan will be an important part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding over the next five years that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from [[NASA]]'s other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.

In January 2005, the White House released a new Space Transportation Policy fact sheet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ostp.gov/html/SpaceTransFactSheetJan2005.pdf|title=Office of Science and Technology Policy|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> which outlined the administration's space policy in broad terms and tied the development of space transport capabilities to national security requirements.

=== Environment ===
{{further|Environmental policy of the United States#The George W. Bush Administration .282001.E2.80.932009.29|l1=Environmental policy of the United States during the Bush administration}}
In December 2003, Bush signed legislation implementing key provisions of his [[Healthy Forests Initiative]]. Another subject of controversy is Bush's [[Clear Skies Initiative]], which seeks to reduce [[air pollution]] through expansion of [[emissions trading]].

Bush signed the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002 authorizing the federal government to begin cleaning up [[pollution]] and contaminated sediment in the [[Great Lakes]], as well as the [[Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act|Brownfields Legislation]] in 2002, accelerating the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites, or [[Brownfield land|brownfields]], to better protect public health, create jobs, and revitalize communities.

Bush stated his reason for not supporting the [[Kyoto Protocol]] was that it unfairly targeted the United States while being deliberately lenient with certain developing countries, especially [[China]] and [[India]]. Bush stated, "The world's second-largest emitter of [[greenhouse gases]] is China. Yet, China was entirely exempted from the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol."

Bush also questioned the science behind the [[global warming]] phenomenon, insisting that more research be done to determine its validity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/06/20010611-2.html|title=President Bush Discusses Global Climate Change|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

==== Global warming ====
{{main|Climate change policy of the George W. Bush administration}}
Upon arriving in office in 2001, President Bush withdrew United States support of the then-pending [[Kyoto Protocol]], a [[United Nations|UN]] Convention seeking to impose mandatory targets for reducing "greenhouse gas" emissions. Bush stated that human activity had not been proven to be the cause and cited concerns about the treaty's impact on the U.S. economy and pointed out that China and India had not signed on.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.alternet.org/story/11054/ | work=AlterNet| title= George W.

In 2002, the Bush Administration's [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] issued a Climate Action Report concluding that the climate changes observed over several decades "are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability".<ref name=cbsGlobWarm>{{cite news

The Bush Administration's stance on global warming, and in particular its questioning the consensus of scientists, would remain controversial in the scientific and environmental communities during his presidency. In 2004, the Director of [[NASA]]'s Goddard Institute, [[James E. Hansen]], came out publicly and harshly accusing the Administration of misinforming the public by suppressing the scientific evidence of the dangers of greenhouse gases, saying the Bush Administration wanted to hear only scientific results that "fit predetermined, inflexible positions" and edited reports to make the dangers sound less threatening in what he asserted was "direct opposition to the most fundamental precepts of science."<ref>{{cite web

The United States has signed the [[Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]], a pact that allows signatory countries to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions individually, but with no enforcement mechanism.

==== Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ====
For economic and national security reasons, Bush supported [[Alaska]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] Ted Stevens' plan to tap the [[oil]] reserves in a {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} area of Alaska's 19 million acre (77,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. Pro-exploration supporters argue that U.S. companies have the most stringent environmental requirements, and that by doing the drilling in the middle of the winter, it would create a very small environmental footprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7195164|title=Senate votes to open arctic refuge to oil drilling|date=17 March 2005|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

The goal of the initiative was to reduce the [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxide]], and mercury emissions of power plants over the course of 15 years, while saving consumers millions of dollars.<ref name = "EXsummary" />

Among other things, the Clear Skies Act states that it would:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/clearskies.html|title=The Clear Skies Initiative|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/clearskies/|title=EPA: Clear Skies|first=US EPA, Office of Air and|last=Radiation|website=www.epa.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/clearskies/Air_005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910110253/http://www.epa.gov/air/clearskies/Air_005.pdf |archive-date=2008-09-10 }}</ref>
* Cut [[mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions by 69 percent, – the first-ever national cap on mercury emissions. Emissions will be cut from current emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010, and 15 tons in 2018.
* Cut emissions of [[nitrogen oxide]] (NOx) by 67 percent, from emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million tons in 2008, and to 1.7 million tons in 2018
* Cut [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2) emissions by 73 percent, from emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010, and 3 million tons in 2018.
* Emission caps will be set to account for different air quality needs in the [[Eastern United States|East]] and the [[Western United States|West]].
* Section 483 of the Bill exempt some older building from many of the provisions of the Bill, but must still meet [[carbon monoxide]] standards.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, and its more than 500,000 members, examined the administration proposal and concluded it would harm public health, weaken current pollution fighting programs and worsen global warming. S. 385, the administration's bill to amend the Clean Air Act would:
1. Allow power plant pollution to continue to inflict huge, avoidable health damages on the public. 
2. Repeal or interfere with major health and air quality safeguards in current law. 
3. Worsen global warming by ignoring CO2 emissions from the power sector.<ref>US Senate Committee Hearing, April 8, 2003, "Testimony of the Natural Resources Defense Council" by David G. Hawkins, [http://epw.senate.gov/108th/Hawkins_040803.htm]</ref>

In 2005–06, Bush emphasized the need for comprehensive energy reform and proposed increased funding for research and development of renewable sources of energy such as [[hydrogen power]], [[nuclear power]], [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], and [[clean coal|clean coal technologies]]. Bush proposed the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]] which seeks to support increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy, with greater development of advanced technologies, as well as greater education and support for American students. 

In his [[2006 State of the Union Address]], Bush declared, "America is addicted to oil" and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase [[energy development]] research.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=October 1, 2006 |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/Transcripts/SOTU-2006.aspx |title=President George W.

In his [[2007 State of the Union Address]], Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing [[fossil fuel]] consumption and increasing [[alternative fuel]] production.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html |title=President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address |publisher=The White House |date=January 23, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |archive-date=May 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on [[offshore drilling]].<ref name="drilling-cnn">{{cite news |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |date=July 14, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/14/bush.offshore/ |title=Bush lifts executive ban on offshore oil drilling |publisher=CNN |archive-date=May 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502232627/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/14/bush.offshore/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."<ref name="drilling-cnn"/> Bush had said in June 2008, "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s{{nbsp}}... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home.

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive." He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm |title=George W.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economic policy of the George W. Bush administration}}
[[File:BushCAGovs.jpg|thumb|George W. Bush speaks to firefighters on November 4, 2003, as California Governor-Elect [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Governor [[Gray Davis]] listen.]]
According to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], the economy suffered from a [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] that lasted from March 2001 to November 2001. During the Bush Administration, Real [[GDP]] has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls|title = Gross Domestic Product|publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate = 2007-07-25}}</ref>

[[Inflation]] under Bush has remained near historic lows at about 2–3% per year. The recession and a drop in some prices led to concern about [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] from mid-2001 to late 2003. More recently, [[Oil price increases since 2003|high oil prices]] have caused concern about increasing inflation.

Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s. Under the Bush administration, productivity has grown by an average of 3.76% per year, the highest such average in ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/prod_nr.htm|title=Productivity and Costs Archived News Releases : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

While the GDP recovered from a recession that some claim Bush inherited from the previous administration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7089700|title=Did Bush 'inherit' a recession?|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]] has since worsened according to the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]]. The percentage of the population below the poverty level increased in each of Bush's first four years, while it decreased for each of the prior seven years to an 11-year low. Although the poverty level increased the increase was still lower from 2000 to 2002 than it was from 1992 to 1997, which reached a peak of 39.3% in 1993. In 2002 the poverty rate was 34.6% which was almost equal to the rate in 1998, which was 34.5%. Poverty was at 12.7% in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Taxes ===
President Bush won passage for two major [[tax cut]]s during his term in office: The [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]]. Collectively, they became known, analyzed, and debated as the "[[Bush tax cuts]]".

The cuts, scheduled to expire a decade after passage, increased the standard [[Standard deduction|income tax deduction]] for married couples, eliminated the [[estate tax]], and reduced [[marginal tax rate]]s. Bush asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent, but others wanted the cuts to be wholly or partially repealed even before their scheduled expiration, seeing the decrease in revenue while increasing spending as fiscally irresponsible.

Bush's supporters claim that the tax cuts increase the pace of economic recovery and job creation. They also claim that total benefits to wealthier individuals are a reflection of higher taxes paid. Individual income tax rate provisions in the 2001 law, for instance, created larger marginal tax rate decreases for people earning less than US$12,000 than any other earners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid%3D21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220084200/http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid=21 |archive-date=2005-12-20 }}</ref>
[[File:Bush visits NSA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|President [[George W. Bush]] addresses the media during a visit to the [[National Security Agency]] in [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], [[Maryland]].]]

His opponents contest job prediction claims, primarily noting that the increase in job creation predicted by Bush's plan failed to materialize. They instead allege that the purpose of the tax cuts was intended to favor the wealthy and special interests, as the majority of benefit from the tax cut, in absolute terms, went to earners in the higher tax brackets. Bush's opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national [[Economic surplus|surplus]] into a historically large [[Government budget deficit|deficit]].

In an open letter to Bush in 2004, more than 100 professors of business and economics at U.S. business schools ascribed this "fiscal reversal" to Bush's "policy of slashing taxes – primarily for those at the upper reaches of the income distribution."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yubanet.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi/13/14283|title=1,325 Kids in Nevada County Risk Summer Hunger – YubaNet – Page 14283|first=California Food Policy|last=Advocates|website=www.yubanet.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

By 2004, these cuts had reduced federal tax revenues, as a percentage of the [[Gross Domestic Product]], to the lowest level since 1959. With the NASDAQ crash and one quarter of negative growth in 2000 it was likely we were headed into a recession,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/relsarchivegdp.htm|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329184117/https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/relsarchivegdp.htm|archive-date=29 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> yet merely two years after the 2003 Bush tax cuts, federal revenues (in dollars) had reached a record high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx|title=Front page – U.S. Department of the Treasury|website=www.treasury.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> The effect of simultaneous record increases in spending and tax reductions was to create record budget deficits in absolute terms, though as recently as 1993, the deficit was slightly larger than the current 3.6% of the GDP.

=== Spending ===
President Bush expanded public spending by 70 percent, more than double the increase under President Clinton. Bush was the first president in 176 years to continue an entire term without vetoing any legislation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where Did Bush Go Wrong? – A depressing look back on eight years of arrogance, power lust, and incompetence|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/131068.html|magazine=Reason magazine|date=January 15, 2009}}</ref>

The tax cuts, recession, and increases in outlays all contributed to record [[budget deficit]]s during the Bush administration. The annual deficit reached record current-dollar levels of US$374 billion in 2003 and US$413 billion in 2004. National debt, the cumulative total of yearly deficits, rose from US$5.7 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (58% of GDP) to US$8.3 trillion (67% of GDP) under Bush,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} as compared to the US$2.7 trillion total debt owed when [[Ronald Reagan]] left office, which was 52% of the GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

According to the "baseline" forecast of federal revenue and spending by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (in its January 2005 Baseline Budget Projections),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6060&sequence=2|title=Congressional Budget Office|website=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> the budget deficits will decrease over the next several years. In this projection the deficit will fall to US$368 billion in 2005, US$261 billion in 2007, and US$207 billion in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection "omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year — and possibly for some time to come — for [[U.S. military]] operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and for other activities related to the global [[War on Terrorism]]." The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts "will expire as scheduled on December 31, 2010." If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then "the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of US$141 billion to a deficit of US$282 billion." Other economists have disputed this, arguing that the CBO does not use dynamic scoring, to take into account what effect tax cuts would have on the economy.

Federal spending in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% in his first four and a half years. Non-defense spending increased 18% in that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=102&FirstYear=2003&LastYear=2005&Freq=Qtr|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis|first=US Department of Commerce, BEA, Bureau of Economic|last=Analysis|website=www.bea.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121046/https://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=102&FirstYear=2003&LastYear=2005&Freq=Qtr|archive-date=29 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense. This level is generally comparable to the defense spending during the [[cold war]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Congress approved US$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier US$79 billion package last spring. Most of those funds were for U.S. military operations in the two countries.

Former President Clinton's last budget featured an increase of 16% on domestic non security discretionary spending. Growth under President Bush was cut to 6.2% in his first budget, 5.5% in his second, 4.3% in his third, and 2.2% in his fourth.

=== Trade ===

President Bush signed a large number of free trade agreements into law during his Presidency: Jordan (2001), Singapore and Chile (2004), Australia (2005), Dominican Republic, CAFTA, Morocco, Oman, and Bahrain (2006), and Oman and Peru (2009).

The Bush administration also launched trade negotiations with New Zealand, Thailand, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, with some being completed during President Obama's first term in office (2009–2013).

However, Bush resorted to protectionist policies on occasion. [[United States steel tariff 2002|Tariffs on imported steel]] and [[U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute|on Canadian softwood lumber]] were controversial in light of his advocacy of [[free market]] policies in other areas. The steel tariff was later lifted after the [[World Trade Organization]] ruled them illegal. Bush explained that the safeguard measures had "achieved their purpose", and "as a result of changed economic circumstances", it was time to lift them.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/12/05/bush_lifts_steel_import_tariffs/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Bush lifts steel import tariffs | date=2003-12-05 | first1=Wayne | last1=Washington}}</ref> A negotiated settlement to the softwood lumber dispute was reached in April 2006, and the historic seven-year deal was finalized on July 1, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Regulation ===

Some say economic regulation expanded rapidly during the Bush administration. President Bush is described by these observers as the biggest regulator since President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name="bushregulation"/> Bush administration increased the number of new pages in the Federal Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, from 64,438 new pages in 2001 to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation.<ref name="bushregulation"/> Economically significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100 million a year, increased by 70%.<ref name="bushregulation">{{cite web|title=Bush's Regulatory Kiss-Off – Obama's assertions to the contrary, the 43rd president was the biggest regulator since Nixon.|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|magazine=Reason magazine|date=January 2009}}</ref>

Spending on regulation increased by 62% from $26.4 billion to $42.7 billion.<ref name="bushregulation"/>

The 2008 financial crisis occurred near the end of the Bush second term and has been regarded by some as an enormous failure of financial deregulation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-prexy.4.16321064.html|title=Bush can share the blame for financial crisis|first1=Mark|last1=Landler|first2=Sheryl Gay|last2=Stolberg|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Employment ===
[[File:Unemployment2000-2005.png|thumb|Unemployment percentage, 2000–2005]]
Looking at the annual average unemployment rates for each of the eight years of Bush's presidency, the average of all eight figures, and thus of his entire presidency, is 5.26%, with a low of 4.6% for the years of 2006 and 2007, and a high of 6.0% for 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/prev_yrs.htm|title=Where can I find the unemployment rate for previous years?|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

According to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the number of unemployed was nearly 6.0 million in January 2001 and 6.9 million in September 2006. The unemployment rate was 4.2% in January 2001, 4.6% in September 2006, and 7.2% in December 2008. Employment peaked in late 1999 and declined through 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/empsit_nr.htm|title=Employment Situation Archived News Releases : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>
[[File:US Poverty1973toPresent.jpg|thumb|left|Poverty Rate, 1973 to 2004]]

The [[Current Population Survey]] (aka Household Survey) measures the percentage of the population that is employed and unemployed. The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that the percentage of the population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm|title=Table A-1. Employment status of the civilian population by sex and age|website=www.bls.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>
Private sector employment, as measured by private nonfarm payrolls, shrank over the 8 years of the George W. Bush presidency. There were modest gains in private-sector payroll employment during his first term, but these were more than offset by the shedding of workers by the private sector in his second term. There were 463,000 fewer private-sector payroll jobs when he left office than when he came into office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2015/07/public-and-private-sector-payroll-jobs.html|title=Public and Private Sector Payroll Jobs: Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama|website=www.calculatedriskblog.com|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Economic Report ===
In 2004, a full chapter on Iraq's economy was excised from the [[Economic Report of the President]], in part because it doesn't fit the "feel good" tone of the writing, according to White House officials.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Education ==
=== No Child Left Behind ===
[[File:No Child Left Behind Act.jpg|thumb|President Bush signing the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] into law, January 8, 2002]]

In January 2002, Bush signed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], with Democratic Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] as chief sponsor,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2004/03/16/bush_relaxes_rules_on_teacher_standards/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Bush relaxes rules on teacher standards | first1=Mary | last1=Leonard | first2=Anand | last2=Vaishnav | date=2004-03-16}}</ref> which aims to close the achievement gap, measures [[student]] performance, provides options to parents with children in low-performing [[school]]s, and targets more federal funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator [[John Kerry]] and the [[National Education Association]], say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Committee on Education and the Workforce]] said that the Department of Education's overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Some state governments are refusing to implement provisions of the act as long as they are not adequately funded.<ref>{{cite news | last = Dobbs | first = Michael | title = More States Are Fighting 'No Child Left Behind' Law | page = A03 |newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2004-02-19 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A52720-2004Feb18 | accessdate = 2006-10-19 }}</ref>

In January 2005, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that the [[United States Department of Education]] had paid US$240,000 to African-American [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[political commentator]] [[Armstrong Williams]] "to promote the law on his nationally [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television]] show and to urge other [[Black people|black]] [[journalist]] to do the same."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-06-williams-whitehouse_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Education Dept. paid commentator to promote law | first1=Greg | last1=Toppo | date=2005-01-07 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> Williams did not disclose the payments.

The [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and Workforce Committee]] stated, "As a result of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], signed by Bush on January 8, 2002, the Federal government today is spending more money on elementary and [[High school (North America)|High School]] (K-12) [[education]] than at any other time in the history of the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Funding increases have to a large degree been offset at the state level by increased costs associated with implementing NCLB, as well as the impacts of the economic downturn on education budgets.

== Diversity and civil rights ==
=== Faith-based initiatives ===

In early-2001, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] worked with Republicans in Congress to pass [[legislation]] changing the way the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] [[regulation|regulated]], taxed and funded [[charities]] and non-profit initiatives run by [[religion|religious]] [[organizations]]. Although prior to the legislation it was possible for these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the [[White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/fbci/|title=Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling more federal aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith-based service organizations. Critics claimed that this was an infringement of the [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].<ref>{{cite news

[[File:Bush Meets with Cabinet June 2006.jpg|thumb|right|President [[George W. Bush]] meets with his cabinet after his re-election.]]

=== LGBT issues ===
As Governor of Texas, Bush had opposed efforts to repeal the criminal prohibition on "homosexual conduct", the same law that the United States Supreme Court overturned in 2003, ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''. During the 2000 campaign he did not endorse a single piece of [[gay rights]] legislation, although he did meet with an approved group of [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a first for a Republican presidential candidate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050611081519/http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0925-01.htm|url-status=dead|title=National Lesbian and Gay Task Force|archive-date=June 11, 2005}}</ref>

In his first four years of office, his views on gay rights were often difficult to ascertain, but many experts feel that the Bush White House wanted to avoid bad publicity without alienating evangelical conservative Christian voters. Thus, he did not repeal President Clinton's Executive Order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian government, but its critics felt it was ignored.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401496.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Official Says Law Doesn't Cover Gays | first=Christopher | last=Lee | date=2005-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref> He did not attempt to repeal [[Don't ask, don't tell]], nor try to change it. He threatened to veto the [[Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007|Matthew Shepard Act]], which would have included [[sexual orientation]] in hate crimes.

While President Bush had always been on record as opposing the [[legal]] recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on "value issues" such as a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], that would prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition. President Bush endorsed this proposed amendment, but late in the campaign told [[ABC News]] and [[Larry King]] that he did not have a problem with state legislators enacting some type of [[civil unions]] legislation, although critics charged that the constitutional amendment he endorsed did not permit recognition of such unions.

Bush still expressed support for the Federal Marriage Amendment in his February 2, 2005 [[State of the Union]] address
and during the 2006 midterm election, but given that it did not even receive majority support in the Senate, has ignored this issue in his most recent public statements and speeches.

Bush was the first Republican president to appoint an openly [[gay]] man to serve in his administration, [[Scott Evertz]], as director of the Office of National AIDS Policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/10/MN198145.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=NEWSMAKER PROFILE / Scott Evertz / New AIDS Czar Called a Skillful Bridge Builder / Evertz the first gay man to hold position |first=Christopher |last=Heredia |date=2001-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524151549/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2001%2F04%2F10%2FMN198145.DTL |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 May 2011 }}</ref> In addition, during Bush's first term, his nominee as ambassador to Romania, [[Michael E. Guest]], became the first openly gay man to be confirmed by the Senate as a U.S. ambassador. The first openly gay ambassador, [[James Hormel]], received a [[recess appointment]] from [[Bill Clinton]] after the Senate failed to confirm the nomination.

=== Racial diversity ===
According to a CNN exit poll, Bush's support from [[African-Americans]] increased during his presidency from 9% of the black vote in 2000 to 11% in 2004.<ref name="elec1">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-05-01 | title=CNN.com Election 2004}}</ref> An increase in [[Ohio]] (from 9% to 16%,<ref name="elec1" /> each ± about 5%) may have helped give the [[2004 United States presidential election|victory to Bush over Kerry]].

Although Bush expressed appreciation for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s ruling upholding the selection of [[college]] applicants for purposes of [[multiculturalism|diversity]], his Administration filed briefs against it. Bush has said he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that the private and public sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity.

In August 2005, a report by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] states that "the government fails to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives as the Constitution requires."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccr.gov/press/2005/0818list.htm|title=U.S. Commission on Civil Rights – FOIA|website=www.usccr.gov|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> Chairman [[Gerald A. Reynolds]] explained, "Federal agencies do not independently evaluate, conduct research, collect data, or periodically review programs to determine whether race-neutral strategies will provide an adequate alternative to race-conscious programs." Civil rights groups expressed concern that the report was an attack on affirmative action inconsistent with [[Grutter v. Bollinger]].

In his first term, Bush appointed [[Colin Powell]] as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Powell was the first [[African-American]] man to serve in that position, and was succeeded by [[Condoleezza Rice]]: Rice became the first African-American woman to hold the post. In 2005, he appointed [[Alberto Gonzales]] as the [[United States Attorney General]], the first [[Hispanic]] to hold that position.

Bush met with the [[National Urban League]], the nation's oldest civil rights organization during his term of office as well.

===Genetic non-discrimination===
President George W. Bush signed into law the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/24519851|title=Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/GINAMay2008.pdf</ref> The bill protects Americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.

== Health ==

=== Health care ===
In July 2002, Bush cut off U.S. funding to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA). Bush stated that the UNFPA supported forced [[abortion]]s and [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilizations]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2145029.stm | work=BBC News | title=US to axe family planning funds | date=2002-07-22 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>

Bush sought to expand [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] so it would also cover the cost of [[prescription drug]]s, a program that became known as [[Medicare Part D]]. Many congressional Democrats opposed the bill because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of drugs, while many conservative Republicans opposed the expansion of the government's involvement in healthcare. Assisted by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Senate majority leader [[Bill Frist]], Bush overcame strong opposition and won passage of his Medicare bill.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 390–391</ref> In December 2003, Bush signed the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]], the largest expansion of Medicare since the program's creation in 1965.<ref name="auto">Mann (2015), pp. 88–89</ref>

Bush signed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, having declared his aim to "promote a [[culture of life]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/3|title=S.3 – Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003|publisher=www.congress.gov|access-date=May 21, 2020}}</ref>

In 2007, Bush vetoed the expansion of the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] stating his concern that the bill would "federalize health care".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116.html?hpid=topnews|title=Bush Vetoes Health Measure|date=2017-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011190734/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116.html?hpid=topnews|archive-date=11 October 2017|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> His veto was criticized as the bill as insensitive to children's needs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/03/opinion/03sat1.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Mr. Bush's Health Care Legacy|date=2009-01-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312141152/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/03/opinion/03sat1.html|archive-date=12 March 2016|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

After winning re-election in 2004, Bush made the partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] his top domestic priority.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 295–296</ref> He proposed restructuring the program so that citizens could invest some of the money they paid in [[payroll tax]]es, which fund the Social Security program.<ref>Smith (2016), pp. 425–426</ref> The president argued that Social Security faced an imminent funding crisis and that reform was necessary to ensure its continuing solvency.<ref name="auto1">{{cite news|last1=Prokop|first1=Andrew|title=In 2005, Republicans controlled Washington.

Ultimately, Bush failed to win the backing of a single congressional Democrat for his plan, and even moderate Republicans like [[Olympia Snowe]] and [[Lincoln Chafee]] refused to back privatization. In the face of unified opposition, Republicans abandoned Bush's Social Security proposal in mid-2005.<ref>Draper (2007), pp. 293, 300–304</ref>

Bush called for major reforms in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], identifying the system's projected insolvency as a priority early in his second term. From January through April 2005, he toured the country, stopping in over 50 cities across the nation warning of an impending "crisis". Initially, President Bush emphasized his proposal for personalized accounts would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax ([[FICA tax|FICA]]) into secured investments. The main advantage of personal accounts within Social Security is to allow workers to own the money they place into retirement that cannot be taken away by political whims.<ref name="auto1"/>

Most Democrats and some Republicans are critical of such ideas, partly because of the large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between [[revenue]]s and [[expense]]s that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the [[United Kingdom]]'s privatized pension plan. See [[Social Security debate (United States)]]. In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.
