'''Fujian''' or '''Fukien''' Province ({{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-Fujian.ogg|f|u|2|.|j|yan|4}}; [[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: Hok-kiàn; [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhou]] [[Foochow Romanized|BUC]]: Hók-gióng; [[Pu-Xian Min]] [[Hinghwa Romanized|BUC]]: Ho̤h-ge̤̍ng; also [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]] as '''Fuchien''') is a nominal [[Administrative divisions of Taiwan|province]] of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] without administrative function. It includes three small archipelagos off the coast of the [[Fujian Province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], namely the [[Matsu Islands]], which make up [[Lienchiang County]], and the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]] and Kinmen Islands, which make up [[Kinmen County]]. The seat of the provincial government is [[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng Township]] of Kinmen County.{{NoteTag|Between 1956 and 1996, [[Xindian District|Xindian City]] in [[Taipei County]] served as the seat of government.}}

The current Fujian Province under ROC control was once part of a larger Fujian Province, which consisted of a mainland portion and some islands. After the [[Chinese Civil War]] of 1949, the majority of the historical province became [[Fujian]], People's Republic of China, while the remaining islands remained under ROC control, which comprise 0.5% of the ROC's territories.

== History ==
{{See also|Fujian}}

=== Imperial China ===

The [[Han dynasty]] collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the [[Three Kingdoms]] era. [[Sun Quan]], the founder of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]], spent nearly twenty years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.

The first wave of [[Migration of the eight clans|immigration]] of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the [[Western Jin dynasty]] collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war.  These immigrants were primarily from eight families in central China: [[Lin (surname)|Lin (林)]], [[Huang (surname)|Huang (黃)]], [[Chen (surname)|Chen (陳)]], [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng (鄭)]], [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan (詹)]], [[Qiū (surname)|Qiu (邱)]], [[He (surname)|He (何)]], and [[Hu (surname)|Hu (胡)]]. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.

Nevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively backward economy and level of development, despite major population boost from northern China during the "barbarian" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Yunnan]], Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.

During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era, the [[Southern Dynasties]] reigned south of the [[Yangtze River]], including Fujian.

The [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) oversaw the next golden age of China. As the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]]. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by general Wang, who set up an independent [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Kingdom of Min]] with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon swallowed up by [[Southern Tang]], another southern kingdom.<ref>Fukien. (2008). In Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved December 20, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/221639/Fujian</ref>

[[Quanzhou]] was blooming into a seaport under the reign of the [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min Kingdom]], and is the largest seaport in the world. Its population is also greater than [[Fuzhou]].<ref name="《伊本・白图泰游记》">伊本・白图泰（著）、马金鹏（译），《伊本・白图泰游记》，宁夏人民出版社，2005年</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=中国网事:千年古港福建"泉州港"被整合改名引网民争议|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2012-04/11/c_111763389.htm|publisher=新华网|accessdate=2014-08-17}}</ref> Due to the [[Ispah Rebellion]], Quanzhou was severely damaged. In the early [[Ming dynasty]], Quanzhou was the staging area and supply depot of [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|naval expeditions]]. Further development was severely hampered by the [[Hai jin|sea trade ban]] of the Ming dynasty, and the area was superseded by nearby ports of [[Guangzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Shanghai]] despite the lifting of the ban in 1550. Large scale piracy by [[Wokou]] (Japanese pirates) was eventually wiped out by Chinese military and Japanese authority of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

=== Qing Dynasty ===
Late Ming and early [[Qing dynasty]] symbolized an era of large influx of refugees and another 20 years of sea trade ban under the [[Kangxi Emperor of China|Kangxi Emperor]], a measure intended to counter the [[Kingdom of Tungning|refuge Ming government]] of [[Koxinga]] in [[Taiwan]]. Incoming refugees, however, did not translate into a major labor force owing to their re-migration into prosperous regions of [[Guangdong]]. In 1683, the Qing dynasty [[Battle of Penghu|conquered]] Taiwan and annexed it into Fujian province, as [[Taiwan Prefecture]]. Settlement of Taiwan by [[Han Chinese]] followed, and the majority of people in Taiwan are descendants of [[Hoklo people]] from Southern Fujian. Fujian arrived at its present extent after Taiwan was split as its [[Taiwan Province|own province]] in 1885.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=George William|last2=Baker|first2=Hugh D. R.|title=The City in late imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZuaAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA197|accessdate=19 January 2012|year=1977|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0892-0|page=197}}</ref> Just ten more years later, [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|Taiwan Province would be lost]] to Japan due to the Qing losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] which ended in 1895.

=== Republic of China  ===
The [[Xinhai Revolution]] deposed the Qing dynasty brought the province into the rule of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Fujian briefly gained independence from China again under the [[Fujian People's Government]] until it was recontrolled by the ROC during the [[Warlord Era]].

It came under Japanese sea blockade during [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

During the [[Chinese Civil War]], the ROC lost control of [[mainland China]], including most of [[Fujian]] province, and was forced to relocate to Taiwan, while the victorious [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] forces established the PRC in 1949, subsequently the capital of Fujian was also moved from [[Fuzhou|Foochow]] to [[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng]]. In the [[Battle of Guningtou]], however, ROC forces were able to defend the island of Quemoy ([[Kinmen]]) just off the coast of Fujian from communist attack. As a result, the ROC has been able to hold on to a number of offshore islands of Fujian, and has continued to maintain a separate [[Fujian Provincial Government]] to govern these islands, parallel to the province of [[Fujian]] in mainland China.

In 1956, due to heightened potential for military conflict with the PRC, the ROC central government moved the Fujian provincial government out of Fujian to within [[Taiwan Province]] in [[Xindian District|Xindian]] (now part of [[New Taipei]]), and the islands were placed under an extraordinarily tight military administration due to their extreme proximity to mainland China. This was an unusual situation where the government of a province was located and operating in a different province. With the easing of [[cross-strait relations]] between the PRC and ROC and the democratization of the ROC in the 1990s, the islands were returned to civilian government in 1992. On January 15, 1996, the provincial government moved back to [[Kinmen]], on Fujian soil.<ref>[http://www.fkpg.gov.tw/intro.php Fujian Provincial Government website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414064548/http://www.fkpg.gov.tw/intro.php |date=April 14, 2009 }}</ref>

Recently,{{when|date=July 2020}} the ROC has significantly diluted the powers of the two provinces it governs, namely [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]] and Fujian. Most of the authority at the Fujian province level has been delegated to the two county governments of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang]].

==Government==
{{main|Fujian Provincial Government}}
The Governor of Fujian Province was the head of the [[Fujian Provincial Government]], the governor was also titled the "Chairperson of the Fujian Provincial Government". According to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution]], the governor is appointed by the [[Government of the Republic of China|central government]]. 

The Fujian Provincial Government was located in [[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng]], [[Kinmen]] between January 1996 and 2018. In July 2018, the [[Executive Yuan]] decided to transfer the duties and functionalities of the provincial government to other branches under the [[Executive Yuan]], including [[Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fkpg.gov.tw/news/u_news_v2.asp?id={76941809-07A0-4996-974B-DFFA79527DE6}&newsid=1661|title=The personnel of the provincial government will be transferred to Kinmen-Matsu Joint Service Center, Executive Yuan|accessdate=29 Nov 2018}}</ref> and [[National Development Council (Taiwan)|National Development Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpg.gov.tw/|title=Taiwan Provincial Government Official Website|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> The transformations were scheduled to be done by the end of year 2018.
