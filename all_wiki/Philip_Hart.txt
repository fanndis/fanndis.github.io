In June 1943, Hart married [[Jane Briggs Hart|Jane "Janey" Briggs]], the daughter of [[Walter Briggs, Sr.|Walter and Jane Cameron Briggs]]. Her father was by then a philanthropist and had owned the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Jane was an aviator who was the first female helicopter pilot in Michigan. She later qualified in the 1960s as one of the [[Mercury 13]] group. The couple met through her brother, who was Hart's roommate at Georgetown. They have four surviving sons and four daughters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Finding aid for Jane Briggs Hart papers, ca. 1925-1996|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-2010191?rgn=main;view=text|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]}}</ref> Hart's namesake, Philip Jr., died as a toddler. He was buried in a family plot, followed decades later by his father nearby.

==Early career==
Hart was admitted to the [[State Bar of Michigan]] in 1938 and became an associate in the [[Detroit]] firm of Beaumont, Smith & Harris.<ref name=yearbook/> During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] with the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] (1941–1946).<ref name=congress/> He was wounded during the [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] [[invasion of Normandy]] on [[Utah Beach]] when shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell damaged the inside of his right arm.<ref name=virtue/> Following the war, he returned to Michigan and recovered at the [[Percy Jones Army Hospital]] in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]]. There he became acquainted with fellow veterans  [[Bob Dole]] and [[Daniel Inouye]], both also future US senators.<ref name=virtue/> He was decorated with the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with clusters, [[Arrowhead device]], [[Purple Heart]], and [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945 (France)|Croix de guerre]].<ref name=yearbook/>

In 1946, Hart returned to Detroit and entered the general law practice of Monaghan, Hart & Crawmer.<ref name=yearbook/> He became politically active in the Democratic Party and, from 1949 to 1951, he served as Michigan's Corporation Securities Commissioner, a political appointee position.<ref name=congress/> His duties included the approving of stock issues of corporations in the state, licensing real estate brokers and builders, and collecting real estate taxes.<ref name=yearbook/> In 1951 Hart was appointed as state director of the Office of Price Stabilization, serving for a year.<ref name=westcatholic/> For his work in that office, he was named Outstanding Federal Administrator of the Year in 1952 by the Federal Business Association.<ref name=yearbook/> 

In 1952, he was appointed as [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan]], serving for one year.<ref name=congress/> He next served from 1953 to 1954 as legal adviser to [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] [[G. Mennen Williams]], a former law school classmate.<ref name=westcatholic/>

In 1954, Hart ran for electoral office, elected as the 51st [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan]], on a ticket with incumbent Governor Williams. He served two terms, until 1959.<ref name=congress/> His re-election in 1956 made him the first Democrat in Michigan to serve two terms as lieutenant governor.<ref name=yearbook/>

==U.S. Senate==
Hart was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate in 1958, defeating one-term incumbent Republican [[Charles E. Potter]] by a 54% to 46% margin.  He was reelected by overwhelming margins in 1964 and 1970. (His 1970 opponent was [[Lenore Romney]].) Some conservatives in Michigan attempted to [[Recall election|recall]] Hart from office due to his stands on [[gun control]] and busing for racial integration, with bumper stickers reading "Recall cures Hart attacks." But the [[US Constitution]] does not authorize the recall of elected federal officials, and Hart was strongly re-elected by supporters.

Hart was the chief Senate sponsor of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], also known as the Hart-Celler bill, which ended the discriminatory quotas that restricted immigration from most of the world since 1924.

Hart died in office. He had announced his intention not to run for reelection in June 1976 and was diagnosed with cancer a month later.<ref name=LSSU /> That same year, the Senate voted to name its new [[Congressional office buildings|Senate office building]] after him, the [[Hart Senate Office Building]].<ref>{{USBill|94|SR|525}}, Designation of the Philip A. Hart Office Building</ref> It would have been the first federal government building named after someone still living. The vote was 99 to 0, with Hart abstaining. Hart died of [[melanoma]] a few days later, just before his term would have expired and he would have retired. [[Donald W. Riegle, Jr.]], who had just been elected to the seat for the next term, was named to fill Hart's seat for the remaining days of the congressional session.

Hart is interred in St. Anne's Catholic Cemetery on [[Mackinac Island]], in a family plot near his namesake son, who died as a toddler.

==Honors==
*In 1982, the [[Hart Senate Office Building]], the third to be constructed, was officially dedicated and named for him.

Hart Memorial Scholarship]</ref>
