'''Basingstoke''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|z|ɪ|ŋ|s|t|əʊ|k}} {{respell|BAY|zing|stohk}}) is the largest town in the county of [[Hampshire]].{{efn|[[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]] are now [[unitary authorities]] in their own right, and [[Winchester]] is a city}} It is situated in south central [[England]], and lies across a valley at the source of the [[River Loddon]]. It is located {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} northeast of [[Southampton]], {{convert|48|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[London]], and {{convert|19|mi|km|0}} northeast of the [[county town]] and former capital [[Winchester]]. According to the 2016 population estimate the town had a population of 113,776.{{efn|In 2012 the town proper had a population of 84,275, but this does not include the large suburban villages of [[Chineham]], [[Old Basing]] or [[Lychpit]], which are now considered as outer suburbs of the town.}} It is part of the borough of [[Basingstoke and Deane]] and part of the [[constituency#United Kingdom|parliamentary constituency]] of [[Basingstoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Basingstoke]]. Basingstoke is often nicknamed "Doughnut City" or "Roundabout City" because of the number of large roundabouts.

Basingstoke is an old [[market town]] expanded in the mid 1960s as a result of an agreement between [[London County Council]] and [[Hampshire County Council]]. It was developed rapidly after the [[Second World War]], along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, in order to accommodate part of the [[London overspill|London 'overspill']] as perceived under the [[Greater London Plan]] in 1944.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stokes | first = Eric | title = Basingstoke – Expanding Town | publisher = The Workers' Educational Association | year = 1980 | page = 15}}</ref> Basingstoke market was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and it remained a small market town until the early 1960s. At the start of World War II the population was little more than 13,000. It still has a regular market, but is now larger than Hampshire County Council's definition of a market town.<ref name="ruralfaqs">{{cite web| year = 2006| url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/factsandfigures/ruralfaqsgeneral.html#5| title = Rural Hampshire FAQs| publisher = Hampshire County Council| access-date = 12 January 2007|url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001005523/http://www.hants.gov.uk/factsandfigures/ruralfaqsgeneral.html#5| archive-date = 1 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Basingstoke has become an important economic centre during the second half of the 20th century, and houses the locations of the UK headquarters of [[Motorola]], [[The Automobile Association]], [[De La Rue]], [[Sun Life Financial]], [[ST Ericsson]], [[GAME (retailer)|GAME]], [[Barracuda Networks]], [[Eli Lilly and Company]], FCB Halesway part of [[FCB (advertising agency)|FCB]], BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions, the leasing arm of [[BNP Paribas]] in the UK, and [[Sony]] Professional Solutions. It is also the location of the European headquarters of the [[TaylorMade]] Golf Company. Other industries include [[Information technology|IT]], telecommunications, insurance and electronics.

== Etymology ==
The name Basingstoke (A.D 990; Embasinga stocæ,<ref name="anglosaxons">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=874 | title = Anglo-Saxon Charters| publisher = Sean Miller| access-date = 3 June 2007}}</ref> [[Domesday Book|Domesday]]; Basingestoches) is believed to have been derived from the town's position as the outlying, western settlement of Basa's people.<ref name="placenames">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/ins/epntest/keytoepn.html | title = English Place Names| publisher = The University of Nottingham| access-date = 3 June 2007}}</ref>{{efn|The [[List of generic forms in British place names]] shows a toponymic interpretation of the various [[Old English language|Old English]] elements within the names Basing and Basingstoke. ''Bas'' is taken to be from the personal name 'Basa', ''ingas'' as 'people of' and ''stoc'' as 'dependent farmstead' or 'secondary settlement'.}} The ending -stoke means outlying settlement or possibly refers to a stockade that surrounded the settlement in early medieval times (of which there is now no trace). Basing, now [[Old Basing]], a village {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} to the east, is thought to have the same etymology, and was the original Anglo-Saxon settlement of the people led by a tribal chief called "Basa".  It remained the main settlement until changes in the local church moved the religious base from St Marys Church, Basing, to the church in Basingstoke.<ref name="oldbasingpc">{{cite web| year = 2006| url = http://www.oldbasing.gov.uk/profile.htm#history| title = Old Basing & Lychpit Parish History| publisher = Old Basing & Lychpit Parish Council| access-date = 3 June 2007|url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111001122400/http://www.oldbasing.gov.uk/profile.htm#history| archive-date = 1 October 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of English Place-Names|last=Mills|first=A.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=0-19-869156-4|location=Oxford|pages=26}}</ref>

[[File:Holy Ghost Ruins - geograph.org.uk - 71774.jpg|thumb|right|The remains of the 16th-century [[William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys|Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke]]]]

A Neolithic campsite of around 3000 BC beside a spring on the west of the town is the earliest known human settlement here, but the Willis Museum has flint implements and axes from nearby fields that date back to Palæolithic times. The [[hillfort]] at [[Winklebury]] (<span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|2|mi|km|0}}</span> west of the town centre), known locally as Winklebury Camp or Winklebury Ring<ref name="winkleburyring">{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.forthill.hants.sch.uk/folders/community/history_of_winklebury_ring/a_brief_history_of_winklebury_ring.cfm | title = A brief history of Winklebury Ring| publisher = Fort Hill Community School| access-date = 9 May 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928145535/http://www.forthill.hants.sch.uk/folders/community/history_of_winklebury_ring/a_brief_history_of_winklebury_ring.cfm |archive-date = 28 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> dates from the [[Iron Age]] and there are remains of several other earthworks around Basingstoke, including a [[long barrow]] near Down Grange.

Further to the east, another Roman road ran from [[Chichester]] through the outlying villages of [[Upton Grey]] and [[Mapledurwell]]. The [[Harrow Way]] is an Iron-age [[Ancient trackway|ancient route]] that runs to the south of the town. The first recorded historical event here was the victory gained by [[Æthelred of Wessex]] and [[Alfred the Great]] over the Danes in 871. Again, in 904, Basingstoke saw a savage battle between [[Edward the Elder]], Alfred's only son, and his cousin Æthelwald.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Market town ===

Basingstoke is recorded as a weekly market site in the [[Domesday Book]], in 1086, and has held a regular Wednesday market since 1214.<ref name="marketsandfairs">{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/gaz/gazweb2.html | title = Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs| publisher = Centre for Metropolitan History| access-date = 9 May 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609094005/http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/gaz/gazweb2.html| archive-date= 9 June 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>
During the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]], and the siege of [[Basing House]] between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of [[Roundheads|Parliamentarians]]. During this time, [[St. Michael's Church, Basingstoke|St. Michael's Church]] was damaged whilst being used as an explosive store<ref name="stmichaels">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.stmichaelsbasingstoke.org.uk/ChurchBuilding.html | title = St Michael's Church – the building| publisher = Hampshire County Council| access-date = 3 June 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703061428/http://www.stmichaelsbasingstoke.org.uk/ChurchBuilding.html |archive-date = 3 July 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> and lead was stripped from the roof of the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke<ref name="hampshiretreasures2">{{cite web| year = 2006| url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/hampshiretreasures/vol02/page035.html| title = Hampshire Treasures Vol 2| publisher = Hampshire County Council| access-date = 3 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200855/http://www.hants.gov.uk/hampshiretreasures/vol02/page035.html| archive-date = 30 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage to much of the town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] is thought to have stayed here towards the end of the siege of Basing House, and wrote a letter to the Speaker of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] addressed from Basingstoke.<ref>{{cite book | last = Baigent | first = Francis J.|author2=James Millard| title = A History of the Ancient Town and Manor of Basingstoke | url = https://archive.org/details/cu31924017840772 | publisher = C.J.

=== Victorian history ===

The [[London and South Western Railway]] arrived in 1839 from London, and within a year it was extended to [[Winchester]] and [[Southampton]]. In 1848 a rival company, sponsored by the [[Great Western Railway]] built a branch from [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. In 1854 a line was built to [[Salisbury]] by the London and South Western.<ref name="railwayhistory">{{cite web | author = Christopher J.

Violent clashes became a regular occurrence{{efn|In summarising to Magistrates at the trial of those members of the public said to have rioted against the Salvationists, defence counsel stated that ''Until this body known as the Salvation Army was formed here, the number of summonses which had come before the Magistrates was comparatively unknown.

=== Recent history ===
Basingstoke was fortunate during the [[Second World War]] to suffer very little bomb damage. A stick of German bombs did fall in the Church Square area on 16 August 1940. The same day bombs destroyed part of a row of houses in Burgess Road. Six people were killed in the raid.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Basingstoke: Arthur Attwood's look into the past|last=Attwood|first=Arthur|publisher=Basingstoke gazette|location=Basingstoke|pages=57–60}}</ref> After the war, the town had a population of 25,000.<ref name="Basingstoke census">{{cite web|title=A Brief History - Basingstoke census|url=http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/browse/leisure-and-culture/local-history-and-heritage/abriefhistory.htm|website=Basingstoke.gov|publisher=Basingstoke and Deane|access-date=15 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711000043/http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/browse/leisure-and-culture/local-history-and-heritage/abriefhistory.htm|archive-date=11 July 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

As part of the London Overspill plan, along with places such as [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Swindon]], Basingstoke was rapidly developed in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to [[Milton Keynes]]. As the population increased, the town produced more figures of national importance, such as the art critic [[Waldemar Januszczak]] and the actress [[Elizabeth Hurley]]. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a [[ring road]].<ref name="Basingstoke census" /> The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became [[The Malls, Basingstoke|The Malls]]. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build [[The Anvil, Basingstoke|the Anvil]] concert hall.<ref name="The Anvil Arts">{{cite web|title=History of The Anvil|url=http://www.anvilarts.org.uk/about-us/history|website=Anvil Arts|access-date=15 June 2014}}</ref> The central part of the shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as [[Festival Place]]. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.<ref name="Basingstoke census" /><ref name="centralbascommittee">{{cite web| year = 2007| url = http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/CommitteeDocs/Committees/Central%20Basingstoke%20Vision%20Single%20Issue%20Panel/20070410/Minutes%20of%20the%20Meeting%20held%20on%2010%20April%202007.doc| title = Central Basingstoke Vision, Single Issue Panel Meeting No 5| publisher = Basingstoke & Deane Borough Council| access-date = 8 May 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222609/http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/CommitteeDocs/Committees/Central%20Basingstoke%20Vision%20Single%20Issue%20Panel/20070410/Minutes%20of%20the%20Meeting%20held%20on%2010%20April%202007.doc| archive-date = 27 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Situated in a valley through the [[Hampshire Downs]] at an average elevation of {{convert|88|m|ft}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unitedkingdom.meteoconsult.co.uk/weather/basingstoke/united-kingdom/weather_forecast_basingstoke_united-kingdom_city_9945_0.php |title=Meteoconsult web site |publisher=Unitedkingdom.meteoconsult.co.uk |access-date=6 August 2011}}</ref> Basingstoke is a major interchange between [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Winchester]], and [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]], and lies on the natural [[trade route]] between the southwest of [[England]] and [[London]]. The area had been something of an interchange even in ancient times. It had been cut by a Roman roadway that ran from northeast to southwest, from Silchester towards Salisbury (Sorbiodunum), and by another Roman road that linked Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum) in the north with Winchester (Venta Belgarum) to the south. These cross-cutting highways, along with the good agricultural land hereabouts, account for the many “Roman” villas in the area, mostly put up by Romanized native nobility ([[Roman villa]]). Even more ancient was the Harrow Way, a Neolithic trackway, possibly associated with the ancient tin trade, that crossed all of southern England from west to east, from Cornwall to Kent, passing right through Andover and Basingstoke.

=== Physical geography and geology ===
The precise size and shape of Basingstoke today are difficult to identify, as it has no single official boundary that encompasses all the areas contiguous to its development. The unparished area of the town represents its bulk, but several areas that might be considered part of the town are separate parishes, namely [[Chineham]], [[Rooksdown]], and [[Lychpit]]. The unparished area includes [[Worting, Hampshire|Worting]] which was previously a separate village and parish,<ref>{{cite web | title = Victoria County History, Worting Parish| publisher = British History Online | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=56798&strquery=worting| access-date = 26 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234437/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=56798&strquery=worting| archive-date= 27 September 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>
extending beyond Roman Road and Old Kempshott Lane, which might otherwise be considered the town's 'natural' western extremity.

Relying on the M3 as the southern boundary, Roman Road as the western, and considering Chineham as the "tail" to the north-east, Basingstoke can best be described as "kite-shaped" with the tip pointing towards the south-west and this can be clearly seen on an aerial photograph of the town and its environs.  

Basingstoke is situated on a bed of [[cretaceous]] [[Chalk Group#England|upper chalk]] with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined [[Clay-with-Flints|clay and flint]] patches. [[Loam]] and [[alluvium]] [[Holocene|recent]] and [[pleistocene]] sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary [[Reading beds]] run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from [[Sherborne St John]] through Popley, [[Lychpit|Daneshill]] and the north part of [[Old Basing|Basing]]. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is [[London clay]], which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stokes| first = Eric| title = Basingstoke – Expanding Town| publisher = The Worker's Educational Association| year = 1980 | page = 45}}</ref>

=== Divisions and suburbs ===

Basingstoke's expansion has absorbed much surrounding farmland and scattered housing, transforming it into [[housing estate]]s or local districts. Many of these new estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, [[Winklebury]], [[Oakridge, Hampshire|Oakridge]], [[Kempshott]], [[Brighton Hill]], [[Viables]], [[South Ham]], Black Dam, [[Buckskin and South Ham Extension]] and [[Hatch Warren]]. The [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] acts as a buffer zone to the south of the town, and the [[South Western Main Line]] constrains the western expansion, with a [[green belt]] to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of [[Cliddesden]], [[Dummer, Hampshire|Dummer]], [[Sherborne St John]] and [[Oakley, Hampshire|Oakley]], although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and [[Beggarwood]] are seeing rapid growth in housing.<ref>{{cite web | title = Report of the Director of Property, Business and Regulatory Services| publisher = Hampshire County Council | url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/decisions/decisions-docs/070717-excsed-R0710180838.html| access-date = 26 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180613/http://www.hants.gov.uk/decisions/decisions-docs/070717-excsed-R0710180838.html| archive-date= 30 September 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Report of the Director of Environment| publisher = Hampshire County Council | url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/decisions/decisions-docs/031111-exemss-R1106153251.html| access-date = 26 August 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071001005829/http://www.hants.gov.uk/decisions/decisions-docs/031111-exemss-R1106153251.html| archive-date= 1 October 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Demography ===
The population has increased from around 2,500 in 1801 to over 52,000 in 1971; the most significant growth occurring during the latter half of the 20th century.<ref name="visionofbritian">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10135758&c_id=10001043&add=N | title = A Vision of Britain Through Time | publisher = Great Britain Historical GIS Project | access-date = 5 June 2007}}</ref> The borough of Basingstoke was merged with other local districts in 1974 to form the borough of [[Basingstoke and Deane]]. Since then most census data has been for the larger area: before 1974, census information was published for the town as a separate entity.

Figures published for the most recent [[United Kingdom Census 2011|UK census in 2011]] for the Borough of Basingstoke and Deane, give a population of 167,799 and a population density of 2.7 persons per hectare—only about half the national figure.<ref name="nationalstatistics">{{cite web | title = Neighbourhood Statistics | publisher = Statistics.gov.uk | url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=276977&c=basingstoke+and+deane&d=13&e=16&g=449607&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&enc=1 | access-date = 17 June 2007}}</ref> The number of women slightly exceeded that of men, and a slight increase in the percentage of residents over 65 was also noted.<ref name="nationalstatistics1">{{cite web | title = Neighbourhood Statistics | publisher = Statistics.gov.uk | url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276977&c=basingstoke+and+deane&d=13&e=16&g=449607&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=77| access-date = 17 June 2007}}</ref> The present century has seen rapid social change in the town: whereas 96.6 per cent of the population were classified as [[White British]] in 2001, this number had declined to 88.3 per cent by 2011. Now 4.3 per cent had originated elsewhere in Europe, and a further 3.4 per cent were of Asian origin. Similarly, with regard to religion, there was a big change: those declaring themselves as Christian declined in ten years from 74 per cent to 60 per cent. This was not because of a big influx of adherents to other faiths, but rather because those who held to no religion increased to 30 per cent of the population by 2011.  Among other findings in 2001 were that 74.33 per cent felt they were in good health, 50.98 per cent were economically active full-time employees (over 10 per cent higher than the national average) and 48.73 per cent were buying their property with a mortgage or loan (almost 10 per cent higher than the national average).<ref name="nationalstatistics" />
Amongst the working population, 64.2 per cent travelled less than {{convert|10|km}} to work.<ref name="nationalstatistics2">{{cite web | title = Neighbourhood Statistics | publisher = Statistics.gov.uk | url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276977&c=basingstoke+and+deane&d=13&e=16&g=449607&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=121| access-date = 17 June 2007}}</ref> The biggest percentage of employees, 17.67 per cent, worked in real estate, renting and business activities.<ref name="nationalstatistics3">{{cite web | title = Neighbourhood Statistics | publisher = Statistics.gov.uk | url = http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276977&c=basingstoke+and+deane&d=13&e=16&g=449607&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=119| access-date = 17 June 2007}}</ref>

== Governance ==
Basingstoke is part of a two-tier local government structure and returns county councillors to [[Hampshire County Council]]. When the cities of Southampton and [[Portsmouth]] attained [[unitary authority]] status in 1998, Basingstoke became the largest settlement in the [[Non-metropolitan county|county]] administered by the county council,<ref>{{cite web | title = Hampshire County Council library service, Best Value Inspection 2001| publisher = Hampshire County Council | url = http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Products/BVIR/AC0D8291-8C93-4141-9347-E1DB6121A44E/HampshireCC01.pdf| access-date = 26 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Combined feasibility and building design project appraisal| publisher = Hampshire County Council | url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c20001.html| access-date = 26 August 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001005701/http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c20001.html |archive-date = 1 October 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> although it remains the third largest settlement in the [[ceremonial county]].

[[Basingstoke and Deane]] is the local [[Borough status in the United Kingdom#England and Wales|Borough]] Council and has its offices in the town centre. [[Basingstoke and Deane local elections|Elections to the council]] take place in 3 out of every 4 years.

Under the [[town twinning]] scheme, the local council have twinned Basingstoke with [[Alençon]] in France,<ref name="Archant twinning">{{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns |title=British towns twinned with French towns |access-date=11 July 2013 |work=Archant Community Media Ltd |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705094933/http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns |archive-date=5 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Braine-l'Alleud]] in Belgium, and [[Euskirchen]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twin Towns in Hampshire|url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/localpages/twintown.htm|publisher=Hampshire County Council|access-date=13 June 2012|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120441/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/localpages/twintown.htm|archive-date=30 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Facilities ==
[[File:The Malls Basingstoke.JPG|thumb|View of [[The Malls, Basingstoke|The Malls]] from [[Basingstoke railway station]] before the 2011 refurbishment]]

The former [[Willis Museum|Town Hall]], adjoining the old marketplace, houses the Willis Museum (originally the Basingstoke Museum, until 1956). This was founded and directed by Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923-24. He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was able to build it up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection (largely made by him) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches. His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. Its central location today is where, once upon a time, [[Jane Austen]] and her sister used to go to dances. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen's novel ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', written in 1797, is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society two centuries ago.

The Top of Town is the historic heart of Basingstoke, housing the Museum<ref>{{cite web | title = Willis Museum | publisher = Hampshire County Council | url = http://www3.hants.gov.uk/hampshire-museums/willis-museum | access-date = 26 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818191157/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/hampshire-museums/willis-museum | archive-date = 18 August 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref> in the former [[City and town halls|Town Hall]] building (rebuilt 1832) as well as several locally run shops and the [[Marketplace#Marketplaces and street markets|market place]]. Basingstoke is also home to multiple theatrical organisations: [[The Anvil, Basingstoke|The Anvil]],<ref>{{cite web | title = The Anvil | publisher = Anvil Arts| url = http://www.anvilarts.org.uk/| access-date = 26 August 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070810125952/http://www.theanvil.org.uk/ |archive-date = 10 August 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> and the Haymarket, situated in the former [[Corn Exchange]].

[[Festival Place]], opened in October 2002, gave a huge boost to the town centre whilst transforming the former The Walks Shopping Centre and the New Market Square.<ref name="proud">{{cite web|year=2004 |url=http://archive.thisishampshire.net/2004/9/10/22938.html |title=The Place to be proud of! |publisher=Thisishampshire.net |access-date=9 May 2007 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011083327/http://archive.thisishampshire.net/2004/9/10/22938.html |archive-date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> Aside from a wide range of shops, there is also a range of cafés and restaurants as well as a large multiscreen [[Vue (cinema)|Vue]] cinema (formerly [[Ster Century]] from Festival Place's opening until their takeover in 2005; the pre-existing Vue in the Leisure Park was sold to [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]]).<ref>{{cite web | title = Completed acquisition by Vue Entertainment Holdings | publisher = Office of Fair Trading | url = http://www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_resources/resource_base/Mergers_home/decisions/2005/vue | access-date = 26 August 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204324/http://www.oft.gov.uk/advice_and_resources/resource_base/Mergers_home/decisions/2005/vue | archive-date = 27 September 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

Central Basingstoke has two further shopping areas: The Malls and the Top of Town. The Malls area had declined since the opening of Festival Place and the closure of its [[Allders]] department store, though still home to several major retailers. The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the [[St. Modwen Properties|St Modwen]] development group in partnership with the Kuwait property investment company Salhia Real Estate, with provision for redevelopment<ref name="mallssold">{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=3044488| title = St Modwen buys Basingstoke's Malls with Key Kuwaiti partner| publisher = Property Week.com
| access-date = 9 May 2007}}</ref> The redevelopment of The Malls started in late 2010, and the shopping centre was given a major facelift. The existing canopies were removed and a clear roof canopy installed, to protect the centre from bad weather, but still allow natural light and air in. The whole shopping centre has been repaved and new street furniture installed. A new gateway entrance to The Malls links it to the rail station. The redevelopment was completed in the last quarter of 2011. The redevelopment work has been carried out by [[Wates Group]] using a variety of subcontractors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/leisure/shopping/themalls.htm |title=The Malls Transformation |publisher=Basingstoke.gov.uk |access-date=6 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123055956/http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/leisure/shopping/themalls.htm |archive-date=23 January 2011 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

In November 2015, as part of the redevelopment of BasingView a co-located [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis at home]] and [[Waitrose]] store was opened.

The town's nightlife is split between the new Festival Square, and the traditional hostelries at the Top of Town, with a few local community [[pub]]s outside the central area. The town has four nightclubs, two in the town itself, one on the east side and one <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|2|mi}}</span> out to the west.

In Portchester Square is the Basingstoke Sports Centre which has a subterranean swimming pool, [[sauna]], [[jacuzzi]] and steam room. Above ground there is a gym, aerobics studios, squash courts and main hall. There is also an Ofsted-registered crèche.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sports Centre | publisher = Basingstoke & District Sports Trust Limited| url = http://www.sportscentre.org.uk/home.html| access-date = 26 August 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027132546/http://www.sportscentre.org.uk/home.html |archive-date = 27 October 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>

=== Sport and leisure ===
[[File:Eastrop Park - geograph.org.uk - 72043.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eastrop Park]], with [[Fanum House]] in the background]]

Outside the town centre, there is a leisure park featuring the Aquadrome swimming pool, which opened in May 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aquadrome opens its shores to swimmers |publisher=This is Hampshire.net |url=http://archive.thisishampshire.net/2002/5/29/64320.html |access-date=18 December 2007 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126183917/http://archive.thisishampshire.net/2002/5/29/64320.html |archive-date=26 January 2009 }}</ref> The park includes an ice rink, bowling alley, Indoor sky-diving centre with ski and surf machines, [[Bingo (UK)|Bingo]] club and a ten screen [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] (formerly Vue prior to the takeover of the Ster Century cinema in Festival Place, and before that, Warner-Village) [[Multiplex (movie theater)|cinema]], as well as a restaurant and fast food outlets. The leisure park is home to the [[Milestones Museum]] which contains a network of streets and buildings based on the history of [[Hampshire]].

Basingstoke has a [[association football|football]] club, [[Basingstoke Town F.C.]], the [[Basingstoke R.F.C.|Basingstoke Rugby Football Club]] and the [[Basingstoke Bison]] [[ice hockey]] team. Basingstoke also has a swimming team,<ref>{{cite web|title=Basingstoke Bluefins|url=http://swimbluefins.org/|publisher=Swimblue|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref> known as the Basingstoke Bluefins and an American Flag Football Team known as the Basingstoke Zombie Horde.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basingstoke Zombie Horde|url=http://www.rollhorde.co.uk|website=Rollhorde|access-date=15 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815165005/http://rollhorde.co.uk/|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> The diversity of sporting activity in the area is also illustrated by organisations such as Basingstoke Demons Floorball Club, Basingstoke Volleyball Club, Basingstoke Bulls Korfball Club and [[Lasham Airfield|Lasham Gliding Society]].

== Education ==
{{See also|List of schools in Basingstoke and Deane}}

The Holy Ghost School (subsequently [[Queen Mary's School for Boys, Basingstoke|Queen Mary's School for Boys]]) was a state funded [[grammar school]] operating in Basingstoke for four centuries, from 1556 until 1970, producing nationally recognised alumni such as Revd. [[Gilbert White]] (1720-1793), a pioneer naturalist, and the famed cricket commentator, [[John Arlott]] (1914-1991).

In modern times education in Basingstoke has been co-ordinated by [[Hampshire County Council]]. Each neighbourhood in the town has at least one primary school, while secondary schools are distributed around the town on larger campuses. Basingstoke has two large [[further education]] colleges: a [[sixth form college]], [[Queen Mary's College, Basingstoke|Queen Mary's College]] (QMC) and [[Basingstoke College of Technology]] (BCoT). The [[University of Winchester]] had a campus in Basingstoke (Chute House Campus) which closed in July 2011; it had offered full-time and part-time university courses in subjects including childhood studies, various management pathways, community development and creative industries. [[Bournemouth University]]'s health and social care students can work on placement at the [[North Hampshire Hospital]].<ref name="Bournemouth University HSC">{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/library/using-the-library/basingstoke-hospital-library.html |title=Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital Healthcare Library |access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref> However, the hospital only caters for midwifery students.<ref name="Midwife Students from Bournemouth Uni">{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/accommodation/contacts_and_rents_for_hospital_accommodation.html |title=Contacts & Rents for Hospital Accommodation |access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref>

== Transport ==

[[File:Basingstoke station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Basingstoke railway station]], as seen from Alençon Link in 2005|217x217px]]

===Road===
Basingstoke is situated close to junctions 6 and 7 of the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]], which skirts the town's south-eastern edge, linking the town to London, Southampton and the south-west. The central area of the town is encircled by a [[ring road]], constructed in the 1960s named The Ringway, and is bisected east to west by the A3010 (Churchill Way). The [[A33 road|A33]] runs north-east to Reading and the [[M4 motorway]], and south-west to Winchester.<ref name="pophamairfield">{{cite web| year = 2007| url = http://www.popham-airfield.co.uk/Index.htm| title = Popham Airfield home page| publisher = Chris Thompson, Popham Airfield| access-date = 14 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070629013807/http://www.popham-airfield.co.uk/Index.htm| archive-date = 29 June 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>  The [[A30 road|A30]] runs east to Hook and west to Salisbury. The A303 begins a few miles south-west of Basingstoke to head west towards [[Wiltshire]] and the West Country, sharing the first few miles with the A30. The A339 runs south-east to Alton and north-west to Newbury. Basingstoke has a reputation for having a large density of roundabouts and, with some larger roundabouts dealing with traffic from six directions, this only adds to the illusion, as does the fact some multilevel junctions on the Ringway were never built or completed.<ref name="brimpton">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.brimpton-airfield.co.uk/| title = Brimpton Airfield| publisher = Brimpton Flying Club| access-date = 14 June 2007}}</ref>

===Railway===
The [[South Western Main Line]] [[Rail transport in Great Britain|railway]] runs east and west through the centre of the town and [[Basingstoke railway station]]. This line links it to the [[West of England Main Line]] to [[Salisbury]] and the [[South West England|South West of England]], [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] (the fastest train Basingstoke to London takes 44 minutes), Winchester, Southampton, Bournemouth and Weymouth, and via the [[Eastleigh to Fareham Line]] and [[West Coastway Line]] to Portsmouth and Brighton. The [[West of England Main Line]] to Salisbury and Exeter diverges at [[Worting Junction]], to the west. The Basingstoke Branch<ref name="basbranchmap">{{cite web | last = Crawford| first = Ewan| year = 2002 | url = http://www.railscot.co.uk/Basingstoke_Branch/frame.htm | title = Basingstoke Branch| publisher = Ewan Crawford| access-date = 26 August 2007}}</ref> runs north-east to [[Reading railway station|Reading]], providing services to {{stnlnk|Oxford}}, Birmingham, the north of England and Scotland. The town was the terminus of the defunct [[Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway]]. Current rail services from Basingstoke are operated by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]], [[CrossCountry]] and [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]].

===Cycling===
Separating provision for cyclists from other road traffic was not part of the remit of the 1960s town redevelopment and, in 1996, the perception of provision for cyclists was very poor.<ref name="transportprov">{{cite web | year = 1996 | url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c19733.html | title = Public attitudes on Transport Issues| publisher = Hampshire County Council| access-date = 14 June 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201123/http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c19733.html |archive-date = 30 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> The Basingstoke Area Cycling Strategy was developed in 1999 <ref name="cyclestrat">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c29946.html| title = Basingstoke Environmental Strategy for Transport| publisher = Hampshire County Council| access-date = 14 June 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211020/http://www.hants.gov.uk/scrmxn/c29946.html |archive-date = 30 September 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> and subsequently an extensive cycle network has been developed<ref name="cyclemap">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/25DA32B0-8691-4D42-BCBF-C70B7AE51637/0/cycle_map.pdf | title = Basingstoke Cycle Network Map | publisher = Hampshire County Council | access-date = 14 June 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705140828/http://www.basingstoke.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/25DA32B0-8691-4D42-BCBF-C70B7AE51637/0/cycle_map.pdf | archive-date = 5 July 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref> mainly utilising on-road routes or off-road routes that run parallel with and directly alongside roads. Basingstoke was linked to Reading on the [[National Cycle Network]] route 23 in May 2003; the route was extended south to Alton and Alresford in April 2006.

=== Basingstoke Canal ===
The [[Basingstoke Canal]] started at a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran alongside the [[River Loddon]] following the line of Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards [[Old Basing]], where the route goes around the now ruined palace of [[Basing House]] and then through and around the eastern edge of Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards [[Mapledurwell]]. The section of the canal from [[Up Nately]] to the western entrance of the [[Greywell Tunnel]] still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards [[West Byfleet]] where it joins the [[Wey Navigation]], which itself can be navigated to the River [[Thames]] at [[Weybridge]].

Plans to reconnect Basingstoke with the surviving sections of the Canal have been delayed several times in the past and this remains a long term aim of the Surrey and Hampshire Canal Society.<ref name="lastfive miles">{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.basingstoke-canal.org.uk/last5m.htm| title = Basingstoke Canal – The last 5 miles| publisher = Surrey and Hampshire Canal Society| access-date = 14 June 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070617130424/http://www.basingstoke-canal.org.uk/last5m.htm |archive-date = 17 June 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The [[Anglican]] church of [[St. Michael's Church, Basingstoke|St. Michael's]] is west of [[Festival Place]] and the chancel dates from 1464;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basingstoketeamparish.org.uk/stm/buildings/ |title=St Michael's Church, Basingstoke |date=14 January 2009 |access-date=8 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022170602/http://www.basingstoketeamparish.org.uk/stm/buildings/ |archive-date=22 October 2011 |url-status = dead}}</ref> the south chapel may be older.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Buildings of Hampshire|last = Pevsner|first = Nikolaus|publisher = Penguin|year = 1967|location = london|pages = 90}}</ref> The nave and aisles were added 50 years later by [[Richard Foxe]], [[Bishop of Winchester]]. The Memorial Chapel at the north east corner of the church was completed in 1921. The ruined Chapel of the Holy Ghost, north of the railway station, has not been a place of worship for the past four centuries, an effect of the Reformation. It was built by the first Lord Sandys, beginning in 1524, when King Henry VIII issued a charter of incorporation. However the west tower of a 13th-century building survives.<ref name=":0" /> It is surrounded by an ancient cemetery; [[William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys of the Vyne|William, Lord Sandys]] himself lies buried in the chapel with his wife. The Church of St Mary, Eastrop is an old church enlarged in 1912.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = Buildings of Hampshire|last = Pevsner|first = Nikolaus|publisher = Penguin|year = 1967|location = London|pages = 91}}</ref>  All Saints' Church was built in 1915, designed by Temple Moore.<ref name=":1" /> St Peter's Church was built in 1964-5 designed by Ronald Sims and is in a housing estate built in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Buildings of Hampshire|last = Pevsner|first = Nikolaus|publisher = Penguin|year = 1967|location = London|pages = 93}}</ref>   In 2014 a group named Basingstoke Community Churches covered an area of six churches in the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Churches|url=http://www.bccnet.org.uk/our-churches|website=Basingstoke Community Churches|publisher=BCC|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref> There is also an Assemblies of God church called Wessex Christian Fellowship, two very new Roman Catholic churches, St. Bede's and St. Joseph's, and churches of other denominations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wessex Christian Fellowship|url=http://www.wessexchristianfellowship.com}}</ref>

== Cultural associations ==
"Basingstoke" is a code word in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1887 comic opera ''[[Ruddigore]]'', used by the "bad baronet" after he reforms, to remind his bride "Mad Margaret" of their plan to live lives of boring respectability.<ref>One writer stated that Gilbert's reference was inspired by an incident, the year before ''Ruddigore'' premiered, where the governing party spent much of a summer in a manor near a Basingstoke mental hospital to avoid both the stench of a recent sewer blockage in London and the anger of the people with whom they were unpopular.{{cite journal|last=Bosdêt|first=Mary| title=Whence Basingstoke!?| journal=GASBAG| date=November–December 1992| volume=XXIV| issue=185| page=7| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e14JAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA66|access-date=29 August 2014}}</ref> In 1895, [[Thomas Hardy]] referred to Basingstoke as "Stoke Barehills" in ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''. The town is mentioned in [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' and is widely thought to be the location of Market Basing in the Miss Marple stories. [[Patrick Wilde]]'s 1993 play, ''[[What's Wrong with Angry?]]'' is set in Basingstoke. It was later adapted into the 1998 film, ''[[Get Real (film)|Get Real]]'', which was filmed at various locations around Basingstoke.<ref name="getreal">{{cite web| last = Shaw| first = Pete| year = 2007| url = http://www.bensilverstone.net/bslocations.asp| title = Get Real, Basingstoke filming locations| publisher = bensilverstone.net| access-date = 26 August 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808212308/http://bensilverstone.net/bslocations.asp| archive-date = 8 August 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Basingstoke's [[North Hampshire Hospital]] was one of two hospitals used for the filming of [[Channel 4]]'s hit comedy ''[[Green Wing]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = Raphael | first = Amy | title = Green Wing's midwife and surgeon |work=The Daily Telegraph | date = 29 March 2006 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/03/29/btvpile29.xml&sSheet=/arts/2006/03/29/ixartleft.html | access-date = 26 December 2006 | location=London}}</ref> [[George Formby]]'s film, ''He Snoops to Conquer,'' was partly shot in the town in 1944. And in 1974 the National Film Board of Canada produced a documentary here called ''Basingstoke – Runcorn: British New Towns''. The former Park Prewett Mental Hospital was the setting for the novel ''Poison in the Shade'' (1953), by Eric Benfield, a local author and sculptor who worked as an art therapist at that hospital.
