The '''United States District Court for the Southern District of New York''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''S.D.N.Y.''') is a [[United States district court|federal district court]] whose geographic jurisdiction encompasses eight counties of [[New York (state)|New York State]]. Two of these are in [[New York City]]: [[Manhattan|New York]] (Manhattan) and [[The Bronx|Bronx]]; six are in Downstate: [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]], and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]]. Appeals from the Southern District of New York are taken to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] (except for [[patent]] claims and claims against the U.S. government under the [[Tucker Act]], which are appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]]).

Because it covers Manhattan, the Southern District of New York has long been one of the most active and influential federal district courts in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fuchs |first1=Erin |title=America's 'Killer Elite' Lawyers Are All In One Prosecutor's Office In Manhattan |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-southern-district-of-new-york-is-so-prestigious-2013-11 |website=Business Insider |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> The district has had several prominent judges on its bench, including [[Learned Hand]], [[Michael Mukasey]], and [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and many of the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]s for the district have been prominent American legal and political figures, such as [[Elihu Root]], [[Henry L. Stimson]], [[Robert Morgenthau]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[James Comey]], [[Michael J. Garcia]], and [[Preet Bharara]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiser |first1=Benjamin |title=A Steppingstone for Law’s Best and Brightest |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/nyregion/30southern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=July 24, 2019 |date=January 29, 2009}}</ref>

== Jurisdiction ==

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York encompasses the counties of New York, Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, and Sullivan and draws jurors from those counties. The Court hears cases in Manhattan, White Plains, and Poughkeepsie, New York.<ref>https://nysd.uscourts.gov/</ref>

The [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York|United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]] represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. The current acting [[United States Attorney]], since June 20, 2020 is [[Audrey Strauss]]. The court sits in the [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse]] and [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse]], both in [[Manhattan]], and in the [[Charles L. Brieant Jr. Federal Building and Courthouse]] in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]].

== History ==

The [[United States District Court for the District of New York]] was one of the original 13 courts established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], 1 Stat. 73, on September 24, 1789. It first sat at the [[Royal Exchange (New York)|old Merchants Exchange]] on Broad Street in November 1789, the first federal court to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.nysd.uscourts.gov/|title=Southern District of New York 225th Anniversary|website=history.nysd.uscourts.gov|accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=S386>Asbury Dickens, ''A Synoptical Index to the Laws and Treaties of the United States of America'' (1852), p. 386.</ref><ref name=fjcny>[https://www.fjc.gov/history/courts/u.s.-district-courts-districts-new-york-legislative-history U.S. District Courts of New York, Legislative history], ''[[Federal Judicial Center]]''.</ref>  The Act of April 9, 1814, 3 Stat. 120, divided the District of New York into [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York|Northern]] and Southern Districts.<ref name=S386 /><ref name=fjcny />
The subdivision of the district was reportedly instigated by [[Matthias B. Tallmadge]], out of antipathy for fellow district judge [[William P. Van Ness]]. These Districts were later further subdivided with the creation of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|Eastern]] District on February 25, 1865 by 13 Stat. 438,<ref name=fjcny /> and the [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|Western]] District on May 12, 1900, by 31 Stat. 175.<ref name=fjcny />

For the first hundred years of its existence, the case load of the District was dominated first by [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases, and then by a mix of admiralty and [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] cases. The primary responsibility for hearing bankruptcy cases has since been transferred to the [[United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York]], with the District Court only reviewing cases already decided by a bankruptcy judge.

Since its creation, the Southern District of New York has had over 150 judges, more than any other District. Twenty judges from the Southern District of New York have been elevated to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]—[[Samuel Blatchford]], [[Charles Merrill Hough]], [[Learned Hand]], [[Julius Marshuetz Mayer]], [[Augustus Noble Hand]], [[Martin Thomas Manton]], [[Robert P. Patterson]], [[Harold Medina]], [[Irving Kaufman]], [[Wilfred Feinberg]], [[Walter R. Mansfield]], [[Murray Gurfein]], [[Lawrence W. Pierce]], [[Pierre N. Leval]], [[John M. Walker Jr.]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], [[Denny Chin]], [[Barrington Daniels Parker Jr.]], [[Gerard E. Lynch]], and [[Richard J. Sullivan]]. Two judges, [[Samuel Blatchford]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]], were elevated from the Southern District of New York to serve as Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit and were later elevated to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The longest serving judge, [[David Norton Edelstein]], served as an active judge for 43 years to the day, and in [[senior status]] for an additional six years.

Judges of the court have gone on to other high governmental positions. [[Robert P. Patterson]] served as Under Secretary of War under President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and was Secretary of War under President [[Harry S. Truman]]. [[Louis Freeh]] served as [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]] from September 1993 to June 2001. [[Michael Mukasey]] served as the 81st [[United States Attorney General]] under President [[George W. Bush]].

== Notable cases ==

* The espionage trial of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] and the perjury trial of [[Alger Hiss]] were heard in the S.D.N.Y.

* Judge [[John M. Woolsey]] of the S.D.N.Y. rejected government efforts to censor on obscenity grounds the distribution of [[James Joyce]]'s [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']].

Mitchell|John Mitchell]] of the [[Watergate]] era. Juries were unable to reach verdicts in the two trials against Daugherty; John Mitchell was acquitted.

* Financial frauds have been prosecuted in the S.D.N.Y., among them the cases against [[Bernard Madoff]], [[Ivan Boesky]], and [[Michael Milken]].

* Bombings: the trials of those accused of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] in East Africa; those alleged to have been responsible for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]; and [[Omar Abdel Rahman]] (known in the press as "The Blind Sheikh"), occurred in the District. More recently, the prosecution arising out of the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] were each heard in the S.D.N.Y.

* ''[[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.|Bridgeman v. Corel]]'' (1999) established that exact reproductions of public domain paintings were not subject to [[copyright]] protection.

* Prosecution of [[Abduwali Muse]], the so-called "Somali Pirate", was heard in the Court.
