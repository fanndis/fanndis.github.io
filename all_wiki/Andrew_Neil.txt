==Press career==
After his graduation, Neil briefly worked as a sports correspondent for local newspaper, the ''[[Paisley Daily Express]]'', before working for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In 1973, he joined ''[[The Economist]]'' as a correspondent and was later promoted as editor of the publication's section on Britain.

===''The Sunday Times''===
Neil was editor of ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' from 1983 to 1994. His hiring was controversial: it was argued that he was appointed by [[Rupert Murdoch]] over more experienced colleagues, such as [[Hugo Young]] and [[Brian MacArthur]].<ref>Roy Greenslade ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda'', London: Macmillan/Pan, 2003 [2004], p.387. Greenslade uses the word "many", but cites only Paul Foot's essay "The Slow Death of Investigative Journalism" (in Stephen Glover (ed.) ''Secrets of the Press: Journalists on Journalism'' (Allen Lane, 1999), pp. 79–89, 85, as evidence.</ref>

Neil told Murdoch before he was appointed editor that ''The Sunday Times'' was intellectually stuck in a 1960s time-warp and that it needed to "shake off its [[collectivism|collectivist]] mind-set to become the champion of a market-led revolution that would shake the British [[The Establishment|Establishment]] to its bones and transform the economy and society".<ref name="Neil">Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (London: Pan, 1997), p. 32.</ref> Neil later claimed that although he shared some of Murdoch's right-wing views, "on many matters Rupert was well to the right of me politically. He was a [[monetarism|monetarist]]. I was not. Nor did I share his [[Social conservatism|conservative social outlook]]".<ref name="Neil"/> In his first editorial, on 9 October 1983, Neil advised [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government to "move to the right on industrial policy (trust-bust, deregulate, privatise wherever it produces more competition and efficiency) and centre-left in economic strategy (a few billion extra in capital spending would have little impact on interest rates or inflation but could give a lift to a shaky economic recovery)".<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 65–66.</ref>

''The Sunday Times'' strongly supported the stationing of American [[cruise missile]]s in bases in Britain after the Soviet Union installed [[RSD-10 Pioneer|SS-20s]] in Eastern Europe, and it criticised the resurgent [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 67–69, 75.</ref> Neil also wrote editorials supporting the [[United States invasion of Grenada]] because it would restore democracy there, despite opposition from Hugo Young. Neil replied to Young that he wanted the editorial stance of ''The Sunday Times'' to be "neo-Keynesian in economic policy, radical right in industrial policy, liberal on social matters and European and [[Atlanticism|Atlanticist]] on foreign policy".<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 70–71.</ref> In Neil's first year as the paper's editor, ''The Sunday Times'' had revealed the date of the deployment of cruise missiles, exposed how [[Mark Thatcher]] had channelled the gains from his consultancy business into a bank account and reported on [[Robert Mugabe]]'s atrocities in [[Matabeleland]].<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 79–80.</ref> Neil also printed extracts from [[Germaine Greer]]'s ''Sex and Destiny'' and from [[Francis Pym]]'s anti-Thatcher autobiography, as well as a study of the "Patels of Britain", a celebration of the success of [[British Asian|Britain's Asian]] community.<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 80.</ref>

Neil regards the newspaper's revelation of details of [[nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear weapons programme]] in 1986, by using photographs and testimony from former Israeli nuclear technician [[Mordechai Vanunu]], as his greatest scoop as an editor.<ref name="bbc-20040420">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3640613.stm |title=Vanunu: Israel's nuclear telltale |publisher=BBC |date=20 April 2004 |access-date=17 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908192717/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3640613.stm |archive-date=8 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> During his editorship, the newspaper lost a libel case over claims that it had made concerning a witness, [[Carmen Proetta]], who was interviewed after her appearance in the ''[[Death on the Rock]]'' documentary on the [[Operation Flavius|Gibraltar shootings]].

On 20 July 1986 ''The Sunday Times'' printed a front-page article (titled 'Queen dismayed by "uncaring" Thatcher') alleging that the Queen believed that [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies were "uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive".<ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 467.</ref><ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography. Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 575.</ref><ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 243.</ref> The main source of information was the Queen's press secretary, Michael Shea.<ref name="Moore">Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography. Volume Two'', p. 576.</ref> When Buckingham Palace issued a statement rebutting the story, Neil was so angry at what he considered to be the Palace's double-dealing that he refused to print the statement in later editions of ''The Sunday Times''.<ref name="Moore"/>

In 1987 the Labour-controlled [[Strathclyde]] Regional Authority wanted to close down Neil's old school, Paisley Grammar School. After finding the Secretary of State for Scotland, [[Malcolm Rifkind]], indifferent to the school's future, Neil contacted Margaret Thatcher's policy adviser, [[Brian Griffiths, Baron Griffiths of Fforestfach|Brian Griffiths]], to try and save the school. When Griffiths informed Thatcher of Strathclyde's plan to close it she issued a new regulation that gave the Scottish Secretary the power to save schools where 80 per cent of the parents were opposed to the local authority's closure plan, thereby saving Paisley Grammar.<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 296–299.</ref><ref>[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] claims that it was [[Michael Forsyth, Baron Forsyth of Drumlean|Michael Forsyth]] who alerted Griffiths. He adds that the ''Sunday Times'' under Neil "made much of the running with the story". ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography. Volume Three: Herself Alone'' (London: Allen Lane, 2019), p. 69 + n. †.</ref>

While at ''The Sunday Times'' in 1988, Neil met the former [[Femina Miss India|Miss India]], [[Pamella Bordes]], in a nightclub, an inappropriate place for someone with Neil's job according to [[Peregrine Worsthorne]].<ref name="Greenspan">{{cite news|last=Greenspan|first=Edward|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19900129&id=QQckAAAAIBAJ&pg=1458,6358153&hl=en|title=Sin, sex, news editors fill London front pages<!--|work=Toronto Globe and Mail-->|work=Ocala Star-Banner|page=43|date=29 January 1990|access-date=11 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311233535/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19900129&id=QQckAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DwcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1458,6358153&hl=en|archive-date=11 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''[[News of the World]]'' suggested Bordes was a [[call girl]].<ref name="Greenslade">{{cite book|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|title=Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda|publisher=Pan Macmillan|location=London, Basingstoke and Oxford|year=2004|pages=503–5}}</ref> <!-- Not knighted until 1991. -->Worsthorne argued in an editorial article "Playboys as Editors" in March 1989 for ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' that Neil was not fit to edit a serious Sunday newspaper.

In a July 1988 editorial ("Morals for the majority") Neil claimed that in Britain there were emerging pockets of social decay and unsocial behaviour: "a social rot...has gone deeper than the industrial decay of the 1960s and 1970s".<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 474.</ref> Having been impressed with [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]]'s study of the American welfare state, ''[[Losing Ground (book)|Losing Ground]]'', Neil invited Murray to Britain in 1989 to study Britain's emerging [[underclass]].<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 473–474.</ref> ''The Sunday Times Magazine'' of 26 November 1989 was largely devoted to Murray's report, which found that the British underclass consisted of people existing on welfare, the black economy and crime, with illegitimacy being the single most reliable predictor.<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 475–476.</ref> The accompanying editorial said Britain was in the midst of a "social tragedy of Dickensian proportions", with an underclass "characterized by drugs, casual violence, petty crime, illegitimate children, homelessness, work avoidance and contempt for conventional values".<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 476.</ref>

Under Neil's editorship, ''The Sunday Times'' opposed the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt: Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 247.</ref> In his memoirs, Neil claimed that his opposition to the poll tax crystallised when he discovered that his cleaner would be paying more poll tax than himself at a time when his income tax had just been reduced to 40% from 60%.<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 302.</ref><ref>Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two'', p. 562, n.</ref> During the [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election]], ''The Sunday Times'' was the only Murdoch-owned newspaper to support [[Michael Heseltine]] against Thatcher.<ref name="Campbell">Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two'', p. 729.</ref> Neil blamed Thatcher for high inflation, "misplaced chauvinism" over Europe, and the poll tax, concluding that she had become an "electoral liability" and must therefore be replaced by Heseltine.<ref name="Campbell" /><ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Three'' (London: Pan, 2000), p. 149.</ref>

In an editorial of January 1988 ("Modernize the monarchy"), Neil advocated the abolition of both the preference for males in the law of succession and of the exclusion of Catholics from the throne.<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 275.</ref> Subsequent editorials of ''The Sunday Times'' called for the Queen to pay income tax and advocated a scaled-down monarchy that would not be class-based but which would be "an institution with close links to all classes. That meant clearing out the old-school courtiers...and creating a court which was far more representative of the multi-racial meritocracy that Britain was becoming".<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', p. 276.</ref> In an editorial of February 1991 Neil criticised some minor members of the Royal Family for their behaviour while the country was at war in the [[Gulf War|Gulf]].<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 274–275.</ref> In 1992 Neil obtained for ''The Sunday Times'' the serialisation rights for [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]]'s book ''Diana: Her True Story'', which revealed the breakdown of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]]'s marriage as well as her bulimia and her suicide attempts.<ref>Neil, ''Full Disclosure'', pp. 263–264.</ref>

According to Neil, he was replaced as ''Sunday Times'' editor in 1994 because Murdoch had become envious of his celebrity.<ref name="Summerskill" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4705343/The-Wapping-Kid.html|title=The Wapping Kid|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 October 1996|access-date=11 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226051020/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4705343/The-Wapping-Kid.html|archive-date=26 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Many years later, in November 2017, former Conservative cabinet minister [[Kenneth Clarke]] said Neil had been removed because Neil's article about corruption in the Malaysian government of [[Mahathir Mohamad]] conflicted with Murdoch's desire to acquire a television franchise in the country.

===Post-News Corp career===
Neil became a contributor to the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. In 1996, he became editor-in-chief of the [[Barclay brothers]]' [[Press Holdings]] group of newspapers, owner of ''[[The Scotsman]]'', ''[[Sunday Business]]'' (later just ''[[The Business (magazine)|The Business]]'') and ''[[The European (newspaper)|The European]]''. Press Holdings sold ''The Scotsman'' in December 2005, ending Neil's relationship with the newspaper. Neil has not enjoyed great success with the circulations of the newspapers (indeed ''The European'' folded shortly after he took over). ''The Business'' closed down in February 2008. He exchanged his role as chief executive of Press Holdings for chairman in July 2008.<ref>Stephen Brook [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/08/pressandpublishing.mediabusiness "Neil takes step back from Spectator"], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306141332/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/08/pressandpublishing.mediabusiness |date=6 March 2016 }} ''The Guardian'', 8 July 2008</ref>

==Broadcasting career==
As well as Neil's newspaper activities he has maintained a television career. While he worked for ''The Economist'', he provided news reports to American networks.

His regular interview series for [[Channel 4]], ''[[Is This Your Life?]]'' (made by [[Open Media]]), was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award for "Best Talk Show".<ref>[http://www.openmedia.co.uk/broadcast.htm Open Media] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429150935/http://www.openmedia.co.uk/broadcast.htm |date=29 April 2009 }}, accessed 24 April 2009</ref> In the course of the series Neil interviewed a wide variety of personalities, from [[Albert Reynolds]] and [[Morris Cerullo]] to [[Jimmy Savile]] and [[Max Clifford]].<ref>A.A.Gill, ''The Sunday Times'', 6 August 1995</ref> He acted as a television newsreader in two films: ''[[Dirty Weekend (1993 film)|Dirty Weekend]]'' (1993) and ''[[Parting Shots]]'' (1999), both directed by [[Michael Winner]].

===Sky===
[[File:Adam Boulton Andrew Neil Benedicte Paviot.jpg|thumb|right|Neil (centre) with Sky News anchor [[Adam Boulton]] (left) and [[Bénédicte Paviot]] (second from right) in 2013]]
In 1988 he became founding chairman of [[Sky Television plc|Sky TV]], also part of Murdoch's [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]. Neil was instrumental in the company's launch, overseeing the transformation of a downmarket, single-channel satellite service into a four-channel network in less than a year. Neil and Murdoch stood side by side at Sky's new headquarters in [[Isleworth]] on 5 February 1989 to witness the launch of the service. Sky was not an instant success; the uncertainty caused by the competition provided by [[British Satellite Broadcasting]] (BSB) and the initial shortage of satellite dishes were early problems.

The failure of BSB in November 1990 led to a merger, but a few programmes acquired by BSB were screened on [[Sky One]] and BSB's satellites were sold. The new company was called [[British Sky Broadcasting]] (BSkyB). The merger may have saved Sky financially; despite its popularity, Sky had very few major advertisers to begin with, and it was beginning to suffer from embarrassing breakdowns. Acquiring BSB's healthier advertising contracts and equipment apparently solved the problems. BSkyB would not make a profit for a decade but by July 2010, it was one of the most profitable television companies in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===BBC===
At ''The Sunday Times'', he contributed to BBC, both radio and television. He commented on the various controversies provoked by the paper while he was editor. During the 1990s, Neil fronted political programmes for the BBC, notably ''[[Despatch Box]]'' on [[BBC Two]].

[[File:Andrew Neil 2.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Clegg]] (right) being interviewed by Andrew Neil for ''[[Daily Politics]]'']]
Following the revamp of the BBC's political programming in early 2003, Neil presented the live political programmes, ''[[This Week (2003 TV programme)|This Week]]'' on [[BBC One]] and ''[[Daily Politics]]'' on BBC Two. The latter ended in 2018 and was replaced by ''[[Politics Live]]'', which Neil presented until he left the corporation.

From 2007 to 2010, he presented the weekly one-on-one political interview programme ''Straight Talk with Andrew Neil'' on the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]]. He also presented ''[[Sunday Politics]]'' on BBC One between 2012 and 2017 and occasionally guest presented ''[[Newsnight]]'' on BBC Two following host [[Jeremy Paxman]]'s departure in 2014.<ref name="bbcprofile" />

Neil played an important part of the BBC general election night coverage in both [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]] and [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Neil interviewed various celebrities on the [[River Thames]] for the 2010 election and political figures in the studio for the 2015 election. He also provided commentary on foreign elections, and with [[Katty Kay]] led the BBC's overnight live coverage of the [[2016 United States presidential election|US presidential election in 2016]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Joe|title=BBC and Andrew Neil slammed over 'terrible' and 'biased' US election coverage|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/730296/us-election-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-andrew-neil-bbc-us-election-coverage|access-date=24 February 2017|work=[[Daily Express]]|date=9 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Election Night in America|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/ffqx5s/election-night-in-america/|work=The Radio Times|date=8 November 2016|access-date=16 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816064235/http://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/ffqx5s/election-night-in-america/|archive-date=16 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=US 2016: Election Night in America|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/45/us-election|publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2016|access-date=16 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124181011/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/45/us-election|archive-date=24 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2017}} In the run-up to the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] he interviewed five of the political party leaders on BBC One in ''The Andrew Neil Interviews''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Andrew Neil Interviews|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08s49q7|publisher=BBC|date=1 June 2017|access-date=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917082352/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08s49q7|archive-date=17 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Neil rejects the [[scientific consensus on climate change]] and has frequently invited non-scientists and [[climate change denier]]s to debate climate change on his BBC programmes.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/mar/03/bbc-climate-change-science|title=Why the BBC's 'impartial' stance on climate science is irresponsible |last=Ward|first=Bob|date=2011-03-03|website=The Guardian|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725153307/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/mar/03/bbc-climate-change-science|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourbeeb/adam-ramsay/why-did-bbc-broadcast-climate-deniers-during-cop21|title=Why did the BBC broadcast climate deniers during COP21?|date=2015-12-10|website=openDemocracy|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725033806/https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourbeeb/adam-ramsay/why-did-bbc-broadcast-climate-deniers-during-cop21|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/davey-vs-neil-two-non-scientists-discuss-climate-change-on-the-sunday-politics-show|title=Davey vs Neil: Two non-scientists discuss climate change on the Sunday Politics show |date=2013-07-17|work=Carbon Brief|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725063315/https://www.carbonbrief.org/davey-vs-neil-two-non-scientists-discuss-climate-change-on-the-sunday-politics-show|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/07/giving-platform-climate-change-sceptics-bbc-misleading-public|title=By giving a platform to climate change sceptics, the BBC is misleading the public|website=www.newstatesman.com|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725033447/https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/07/giving-platform-climate-change-sceptics-bbc-misleading-public|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jul/23/climate-change-andrew-neil-bbc-errors-take2|title=The climate change policy discussion I wish Andrew Neil would have on BBC |last=Nuccitelli|first=Dana|date=2013-07-23|website=The Guardian|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725063535/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jul/23/climate-change-andrew-neil-bbc-errors-take2|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jul/17/climate-change-scepticism-andrew-neil-ed-davey|title=Andrew Neil – these are your climate errors on BBC Sunday Politics|last=Nuccitelli|first=Dana|date=2013-07-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725153252/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jul/17/climate-change-scepticism-andrew-neil-ed-davey|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, [[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]] of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] at the [[London School of Economics]], said that Neil had "rarely, if ever, included a [[climate scientist]] in any of its debates about global warming" on his BBC programme ''The Daily Politics''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/bbc-climate-change-ward/|title=The BBC is sacrificing objectivity for impartiality in its coverage of climate change|date=2012-07-11|work=British Politics and Policy at LSE|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725063341/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/bbc-climate-change-ward/|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Ward wrote that Neil lets inaccurate and misleading statements about climate change go unchallenged on ''The Daily Politics''.<ref name=":0"/> He has however pressed politicians who accept the consensus on climate change.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/andrew-neils-phoney-war-against-the-climate-mafia-16374|title=Andrew Neil's phoney war against the 'climate mafia'|last=Happer|first=Catherine|work=The Conversation|access-date=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725063256/https://theconversation.com/andrew-neils-phoney-war-against-the-climate-mafia-16374|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

===HIV/AIDS===
During Neil's time as editor, ''The Sunday Times'' backed a campaign to prove that [[HIV]] was not a cause of [[AIDS]].<ref name="Summerskill"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=2 October 2006|title=When it's time to speak out|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/news061002-12|s2cid=177131624|issn=1744-7933}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|title=The Sunday Times and Andrew Neil|journal=[[Journalism Studies]]|volume=10|issue=6|pages=754–768|year=2009|doi=10.1080/14616700903119891|last1=McKnight|first1=David|s2cid=141612792}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Policy, the Media and Misrepresentation|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/socialpolicymedi00fran|url-access=limited|publisher=Routledge|editor-last=Franklin|editor-first=Bob|pages=[https://archive.org/details/socialpolicymedi00fran/page/n82 72]}}</ref> In 1990, ''The Sunday Times'' serialised a book by an American conservative who rejected the scientific consensus on the causes of AIDS and argued that AIDS could not spread to heterosexuals.<ref name=":2"/> Articles and editorials in ''The Sunday Times'' cast doubt on the scientific consensus, described HIV as a "politically correct virus" about which there was a "conspiracy of silence," disputed that AIDS was spreading in Africa, claimed that tests for HIV were invalid, described the HIV/AIDS treatment drug [[azidothymidine]] (AZT) as harmful, and characterised the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as an "Empire-building AIDS [organisation]."<ref name=":2"/>

The [[pseudoscientific]] coverage of HIV/AIDS in ''The Sunday Times'' led the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to monitor the newspaper's coverage and to publish letters rebutting ''The Sunday Times''' articles.<ref name=":2" /> In response to this, ''The Sunday Times'' published an article headlined "AIDS – why we won't be silenced", which claimed that ''Nature'' engaged in censorship and "sinister intent".<ref name=":2" /> In his 1996 book, ''Full Disclosure'', Neil wrote that the [[HIV/AIDS denialism]] "deserved publication to encourage debate."<ref name=":2" /> That same year, he wrote that ''The Sunday Times'' had been vindicated in its coverage, "The Sunday Times was one of a handful of newspapers, perhaps the most prominent, which argued that heterosexual Aids was a myth. The figures are now in and this newspaper stands totally vindicated... The history of Aids is one of the great scandals of our time. I do not blame doctors and the Aids lobby for warning that everybody might be at risk in the early days, when ignorance was rife and reliable evidence scant." He criticised the "AIDS establishment" and said "Aids had become an industry, a job-creation scheme for the caring classes."<ref>{{Cite news|title=The great Aids myth is finally laid to rest|last=Neil|first=Andrew|date=1996|work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>

===Republicanism===
In January 1997, [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] broadcast a live television debate ''Monarchy: The Nation Decides'', in which Neil spoke in favour of [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|establishing a republic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/66-yes-vote-to-monarchy-in-tv-phone-poll-contradicts-previous-result-1.19905|title= 66% 'yes' vote to monarchy in TV 'phone poll contradicts previous result|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Borrill|first=Rachel|date=8 January 1997|access-date=17 February 2019}}</ref>

==''Private Eye''==
The British satirical and investigative journalism magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' has referred to Neil by the nickname "Brillo" after his wiry hair, which is seen as bearing a resemblance to a [[Brillo Pad]], a brand of [[scouring pad]].<ref name="totalpoliticsconversation">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/4493/part_3/in-conversation-with-andrew-neil.thtml |title=In Conversation with Andrew Neil |publisher=Total Politics |first=Iain |last=Dale |date=10 May 2010 |access-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613040917/http://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/4493/part_3/in-conversation-with-andrew-neil.thtml |archive-date=13 June 2013}}</ref>

A photograph of Neil in a vest and baseball cap, embracing a woman (often mistaken for [[Pamella Bordes]], a former ''Miss India'', but really an African-American make-up artist with whom Neil was once involved)<ref name="Riddell">Mary Riddell [http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no2_riddell.htm "Non-stop Neil, at home alone"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121223213056/http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no2_riddell.htm |date=23 December 2012 }}, ''British Journalism Review'', Vol. 16, No. 2, 2005, p13-20</ref> appeared frequently for many years in the magazine. A long running joke within the letters page is that a reader will ask the editor if he has any photographs related to some topic in the news, frequently accompanied by a reference to the woman's ethnicity. By [[double entendre]], it can be construed as a request for this photo, which was duly published alongside the letter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/haunted-by-that-photo-one-for-the-album-2357389.html?action=gallery&ino=3|title=Haunted by that photo: One for the album?|first=Tim|last=Walker|date=20 September 2011|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=24 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324142106/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/haunted-by-that-photo-one-for-the-album-2357389.html?action=gallery&ino=3|archive-date=24 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Neil claims to find it "fascinating" and an example of "public school racism" on the part of the magazine's editorial staff.<ref name="Riddell" />
