'''MSNBC''' is an American [[news broadcasting|news]]-based [[pay television]] cable channel, owned by the [[NBCUniversal Television Group#NBCUniversal News Group|NBCUniversal News Group]] division of [[NBCUniversal]] (a subsidiary of [[Comcast]]). It provides [[NBC News]] coverage as well as its own reporting and political commentary on current events.

MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between [[Microsoft]] and [[General Electric]]'s [[NBC]] unit, hence the network's naming.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brian | last=Stelter | date=October 6, 2010 | title=MSNBC on the Web May Change Its Name | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07msnbc.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref> Although they had the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in [[Redmond, Washington]], while MSNBC operated out of NBC's headquarters in New York City. Microsoft divested itself of its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as [[NBCNews.com]], and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brian | last=Stelter | date=July 15, 2012 | title=Microsoft and NBC Complete Web Divorce | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/media/msnbccom-renamed-nbcnewscom-as-microsoft-and-nbc-divorce.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}</ref>

In the late summer of 2015, MSNBC revamped its programming; the moves were in sharp contrast to previous programming decisions at the network. MSNBC sought to sharpen its news image by entering into a dual editorial relationship with its organizational parent NBC News. ''[[MSNBC Live]]'', the network's flagship daytime news platform, was expanded to cover over eight hours of the day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/business/media/msnbc-changes-lineup-to-sharpen-hard-news-focus.html|title=MSNBC Retools to Sharpen Its Focus on Hard News|first=Emily|last=Steel|date=September 17, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> [[Phil Griffin]] is the president and director of day-to-day operations at MSNBC.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/06/msnbc-year-of-standing-up-straight-004562 | title=MSNBC's year of standing up straight | publisher=[[Politico]] | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}</ref> On June 29, 2015, MSNBC launched a 1080i high-definition feed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MSNBC goes high definition - msnbc- NBCNews.com|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30015383/ns/msnbc/|last=|first=|date=June 29, 2015|website=NBC News|publisher=Comcast|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

As of September 2018, approximately 87 million households in the United States (90.7 percent of pay television subscribers) were receiving MSNBC. In 2019, MSNBC ranked second among basic cable networks averaging 1.8 million viewers, behind rival [[Fox News]], averaging 2.5 million viewers. 

==History==

===Development===
MSNBC was established under a strategic partnership between [[NBC]] and [[Microsoft]]. NBC executive [[Tom Rogers (executive)|Tom Rogers]] was instrumental in developing this partnership. James Kinsella, a Microsoft executive, served as president of the online component, MSNBC.com, and represented the tech company in the joint venture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/1999/01/13/msnbc-com-nets-cyber-pioneer-as-head/|title=MSNBC.com Nets Cyber Pioneer As Head|last=Huhn|first=Mary|date=January 13, 1999|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref> Microsoft invested $221 million for a 50 percent share of the cable channel.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1996-07-14/network-meets-net | title=Network Meets Net: How big an audience is there for Microsoft and NBC's cable-Web news venture? | journal= Businessweek | date=July 15, 1996}}</ref> MSNBC and Microsoft shared the cost of a $200 million newsroom in [[Secaucus, New Jersey|Secaucus]], [[New Jersey]], for [[msnbc.com]]. The network took over the channel space of NBC's 2-year-old [[America's Talking|America's Talking (AT)]] network, although in most cases cable carriage had to be negotiated with providers who had never carried AT.

{{Main|History of MSNBC: 1996–2007}}

MSNBC was launched on July 15, 1996. The first show was anchored by [[Jodi Applegate]] and included news, interviews, and commentary.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://home.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa-home.exe?A2=ind0404a&L=wnn&T=0&P=1941 | title=Jodi Jodi Applegate WNYW biography | website=Home.ease.lsoft.com | accessdate=May 11, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114033544/http://home.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa-home.exe?A2=ind0404a&L=wnn&T=0&P=1941 | archivedate=November 14, 2012}}</ref> During the day, rolling news coverage continued with ''The Contributors'', a show that featured [[Ann Coulter]] and [[Laura Ingraham]], as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate, [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]], and [[John Seigenthaler Jr.|John Seigenthaler]]. Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories [[CNN]] was running. NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories directly from NBC's network affiliates, along with breaking news coverage from the same sources.<ref>{{cite book | last=Collins | first=Scott | title=Crazy Like A Fox: The Inside Story of How Fox News Beat CNN | isbn=1-59184-029-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/crazylikefoxinsi00coll | year=2004 }}</ref>

MSNBC gradually increased its emphasis on politics.<ref>{{cite news | last=Moss | first=Linda | title=MSNBC Shifts Shows | publisher=Cable World | date=July 2, 2001}}</ref> After completing its seven-year survey of cable channels, the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] said in 2007 that, "MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand, with a large dose of opinion and personality."<ref name=project>[http://stateofthemedia.org/2007/cable-tv-intro/public-attitude/ The State of the News Media 2007: Public Attitudes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630171923/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2007/cable-tv-intro/public-attitude/ |date=June 30, 2017 }}. [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]].</ref>

In January 2001, [[Mike Barnicle]]'s MSNBC show started, but it was canceled in June 2001 because of high production costs.<ref>E! Online, [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.gossip.celebrities/EmCVows7rz0/sxxhsHAywSsJ Bits and Pieces], June 26, 2001. {{webarchive | url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110122130054/https://groups.google.com/forum/ | date=January 22, 2011}}</ref> In June, Microsoft chief executive officer [[Steve Ballmer]] said that he would not have started MSNBC had he foreseen the difficulty of attracting viewers.<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-268073.html Ballmer: Would not launch MSNBC again]. CNET News.Com, June 7, 2001.</ref>

After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], NBC used MSNBC as an outlet for the up-to-the-minute coverage being provided by NBC News as a supplement to the longer stories on broadcast NBC. With little financial news to cover, [[CNBC]] and [[CNBC Europe]] ran MSNBC for many hours each day following the attacks. The year also boosted the profile of [[Ashleigh Banfield]], who was present during the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center#Original building (1987–2001)|Building 7]] while covering the World Trade Center on September 11.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.today.com/popculture/five-years-later-memories-trying-task-wbna14783031 | title=Five years later, memories of a trying task | website=TODAY.com | accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> Her ''Region In Conflict'' program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/profiles/ashleigh-banfield-profile#about | title=CNN Profiles – Ashleigh Banfield – Host, HLN's Primetime Justice with Ashleigh Banfield | publisher=[[CNN]] | accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

In the aftermath of September 11, MSNBC began calling itself "America’s NewsChannel" and hired opinionated hosts like [[Alan Keyes]], [[Phil Donahue]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[Tucker Carlson]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/112733/roger-ailes-msnbc-how-phil-griffin-created-lefts-fox-news|title=Slyer Than Fox|first=Rebecca|last=Dana|date=March 25, 2013|via=The New Republic}}</ref> This branding makeover, however, was followed by declining ratings.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHACCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA283 | title=The 21st-Century Voter: Who Votes, How They Vote, and Why They Vote [2 volumes] | author1=Guido H. Stempel III | author2=Thomas K. Hargrove | date=December 14, 2015 | publisher=ABC-CLIO | isbn=9781610692281}}</ref>

On December 23, 2005, NBC Universal announced its acquisition of an additional 32 percent share of MSNBC from Microsoft,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2005/digital/markets-festivals/peacock-plucks-msnbc-1117935156/ | title=Peacock plucks MSNBC | last=Learmonth | first=Michael | date=December 23, 2005 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> which solidified its control over television operations and allowed NBC to further consolidate MSNBC's backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties. (The news website msnbc.com remained a separate joint venture between Microsoft and NBC for another seven years.) NBC later exercised its option to purchase Microsoft's remaining 18 percent interest in MSNBC.

In late 2005, MSNBC began attracting liberal and progressive viewers as [[Keith Olbermann]] began critiquing and satirizing [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] media commentators during his ''[[Countdown With Keith Olbermann]]'' program. He especially focused his attention on the [[Fox News Channel]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], its principal primetime commentator.

On June 7, 2006, Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC after holding the post for two years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/rick-kaplan-exits-effective-immediately-president-of-msnbc-steps-down_b9986 | title=Rick Kaplan Exits: Effective Immediately, President Of MSNBC Steps Down | year=2006 | accessdate=January 23, 2008}}</ref> Five days later, [[Dan Abrams]], a nine-year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News, was named general manager of MSNBC with immediate effect. NBC News senior vice president Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC while continuing to oversee NBC News’ ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' program, with Abrams reporting to Griffin.

On June 29, 2006, Abrams announced the revamp of MSNBC's early-primetime and primetime schedule. On July 10, ''[[Tucker (television program)|Tucker]]'' (formerly ''The Situation with Tucker Carlson'') started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET (taking over Abrams' old timeslot), while Rita Cosby's ''[[Rita Cosby: Live & Direct|Live & Direct]]'' was canceled. Cosby was made the primary anchor for ''MSNBC Investigates'' at 10 and 11 p.m. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson's timeslots. According to the press release, ''MSNBC Investigates'' promised to "complement MSNBC's existing programming by building on [the channel's] library of award-winning documentaries."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nbcumv.com/release_detail.nbc/msnbc-20060629000000-msnbcannouncesprim.html | title=MSNBC Announcement | date=June 29, 2006 | accessdate=January 23, 2008}} {{Dead link | date=September 2010 | bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. probably resulted from MSNBC's successful Friday "experiment" of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials.

On September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he was leaving his general manager position so he could focus on his 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ET talk show, ''Live With Dan Abrams''. Oversight of MSNBC was shifted to Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at NBC.<ref>{{cite news | last=Kurtz | first=Howard | title=MSNBC's Abrams Quits His Day Job | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=September 25, 2007 | page=C03 | authorlink=Howard Kurtz}}</ref>

MSNBC and NBC News began broadcasting from their new studios at NBC's [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Center]] complex in New York City on October 22, 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nbc-news-to-begin-broadcasting-from-new-world-headquarters-oct-22_b16529 | title=NBC News to Begin Broadcasting from New World Headquarters | date=October 22, 2007 | accessdate=January 23, 2008}}</ref> The extensive renovations of the associated studios allowed NBC to merge its entire news operation into one building. All MSNBC broadcasts and ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' originate from the new studios. More than 12.5 hours of live television across the NBC News family originate from the New York studios daily. MSNBC also announced new studios near the [[Universal Studios]] lot.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/msnbc-move-new-york-city-studio-366532|title=MSNBC to Move to New York City Studio|last=Moss|first=Linda|date=October 11, 2007|work=Multichannel|accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref> MSNBC's master control did not make the move to 30 Rock. It remained in the old Secaucus headquarters until it completed its move to the NBC Universal Network Origination Center located inside the CNBC Global Headquarters building in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]], on December 21, 2007. Shortly thereafter, [[Major League Baseball]] firmed up a long-term lease of the former MSNBC building to become the home studios of [[MLB Network]], which launched from the facility on January 1, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newscaststudio.com/2008/10/20/mlb-network-taking-over-former-msnbc-hq/|title=MLB Network taking over former MSNBC HQ|last=Hill|first=Michael P.|date=October 20, 2008|work=Newscast Studio|accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>

Concerning the campaign, Griffin said, "It is active, it is positive, it is about making tomorrow better than today, a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time."<ref name="mediabistro.com">[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/lean-forward-campaign-phil-griffi_b33894 Phil Griffin: 'Lean Forward' Campaign 'Is Going to Define Us As MSNBC'] ''Media Bistro'' Retrieved October 13, 2010</ref> The new campaign embraces the network's politically progressive identity.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com">[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/39507182/ns/business-media_biz/ Msnbc to 'lean forward' in two-year brand campaign] ''MSNBC'' Retrieved October 13, 2010</ref> The two-year advertising campaign would cost $2 million and consist of internet, television, and print advertising.<ref name="mediabistro.com"/> The new positioning has created brand image issues for msnbc.com, the umbrella website for the television network.

===Return to hard news and alignment with NBC News: since 2015===

To help revive the struggling network, MSNBC in the summer of 2015 started transitioning from left-leaning, opinionated programming to hard news programming. Nearly all daytime opinionated news programs were replaced with more generic news programs. [[Ronan Farrow]], [[Joy-Ann Reid]], [[Krystal Ball]], [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]], [[Abby Huntsman]], [[Alex Wagner]], [[Ed Schultz]], and [[Al Sharpton]] lost their shows. News programs presented by established NBC News personalities such as [[Telemundo]] anchor [[Jose Diaz-Balart]], ''[[Meet the Press]]'' anchor [[Chuck Todd]], Sunday NBC Nightly News anchor [[Kate Snow]], [[Thomas Roberts (television journalist)|Thomas Roberts]], and former NBC Nightly News anchor [[Brian Williams]] replaced the opinion shows.<ref>{{cite news | title=Brian Williams dropped from NBC's 'Nightly News,' will join MSNBC | work=[[Reuters]] | date=June 18, 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/18/us-media-brianwilliams-idUSKBN0OY22Y20150618}}</ref> The revamped on-air presentation debuted in late summer 2015 and included a new logo, news ticker, and graphics package.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/msnbc-rolls-out-new-on-air-look/269746 | title=MSNBC Rolls Out New On-Air Look}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/kate-snow-appointment-complete-msnbc-transformation-3383292 | title=Entertainment News, Celebrity and Pop Culture – ABC News | publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> ''MSNBC Live'' had at least eight hours of programming each day, barring any breaking news that could extend its time.  Daytime news coverage was led primarily by Brian Williams, [[Stephanie Ruhle]], Jose Diaz-Balart, Andrea Mitchell, Craig Melvin, Thomas Roberts, and Kate Snow, in addition to "beat leaders" stationed throughout the newsroom. These included chief legal correspondent [[Ari Melber]], primary political reporter [[Steve Kornacki]], business and finance correspondent [[Olivia Sterns]], and senior editor [[Cal Perry]]. Morning and primetime programming did not change and remained filled mostly by opinionated personalities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/schedule|title=TV Schedule {{!}} MSNBC|date=October 15, 2015|access-date=March 30, 2018|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015183413/http://www.msnbc.com/schedule|archivedate=October 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4411797/|title=Craig Melvin|website=IMDb|access-date=March 30, 2018}}</ref>

In April 2016, MSNBC launched a promotional ad campaign with the theme, "in order to know beyond, you have to go beyond." The campaign portrayed MSNBC's reporting and perspectives as "in depth" and an alternative to "talking points" coverage on other cable news outlets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/newsbusters/posts/10154569887336178|title=Greg Ganzerla|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=March 30, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2016, the network debuted ''Dateline Extra'', which was an abridged version of ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' and another step towards aligning MSNBC and NBC News. The new program was hosted by ''MSNBC Live'' anchor [[Tamron Hall]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.msnbc.com/documentaries/dateline-extra-tamron-hall-msnbc-weekends|title=Dateline Extra with Tamron Hall on MSNBC weekends|work=MSNBC|access-date=March 30, 2018}}</ref>

In September 2016, MSNBC launched ''[[The 11th Hour (news program)|The 11th Hour with Brian Williams]]'' as a nightly wrap-up of the day's news and a preview of the following day's headlines. This was MSNBC's first new primetime program in nearly four years.

In January 2017, MSNBC debuted a program in the 6 pm EST hour entitled ''[[For the Record with Greta]]'', hosted by former Fox News Channel anchor [[Greta Van Susteren]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://info.msnbc.com/_news/2017/01/05/36576960-greta-van-susteren-joins-msnbc | title=GRETA VAN SUSTEREN JOINS MSNBC | first=Msnbc | last=Info | accessdate=January 20, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121181152/http://info.msnbc.com/_news/2017/01/05/36576960-greta-van-susteren-joins-msnbc | archive-date=January 21, 2017 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The program aired for six months before being cancelled in late June 2017. The network promoted Chief legal Correspondent Ari Melber to host ''[[The Beat with Ari Melber]]'' at 6pm.

In March 2017, MSNBC started rebranding its daytime shows as "NBC News" programs. The network logos started appearing on show opens, within the set design, and in commercials.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/msnbc-nbc-news-logos-1202015277/|title=MSNBC Programs Start Giving More Space to NBC News Logos|first=Brian|last=Steinberg|date=March 23, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> In May 2017, MSNBC launched a 4pm afternoon program entitled ''[[Deadline: White House]]'' and hosted by former White House communications director and NBC political analyst [[Nicolle Wallace]].

For the first time, MSNBC in May 2017 became the highest rated American cable news network in primetime. MSNBC's increasing viewership was accompanied by declining numbers at Fox News Channel. MSNBC's May 15–19 programming topped the programming of both CNN and Fox News in total viewers and the advertiser-coveted younger demographic.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/msnbc-fox-news-ratings-cable-news-cnn-1202440320/ | title=MSNBC Reaches No. 1 for First Time in Weekly Primetime Ratings, Fox News Drops to Third | last=Otterson | first=Joe | date=May 22, 2017 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/business/media/msnbc-rachel-maddow-andrew-lack-ratings.html|title=Led by Rachel Maddow, MSNBC Surges to Unfamiliar Spot: No. 1 in Prime Time|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=June 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 31, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Another significant change was made on April 16, 2018, when MSNBC completely removed the [[news ticker]] at the bottom of the screen on every program, citing the reason "for a cleaner view that puts our reporting more front and center ... and we want viewers to get the best possible experience". At the time of the change, CNN is still running the news ticker during live programming (although its sister network [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]] does not), meanwhile Fox News only scraps the news ticker during daytime news programs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/msnbc-removes-news-ticker-1202754729/ | title=MSNBC Says On-Screen News Ticker Will No Longer Scroll | last=Steinberg | first=Brian | date=April 16, 2018 | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate=April 18, 2018}}</ref>

On March 2, 2020, Chris Matthews abruptly announced his resignation from ''Hardball'' effective immediately. The 7&nbsp;p.m. hour was hosted by rotating anchors until July 20, when it was replaced by ''The ReidOut'', a new evening program hosted by [[Joy Reid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chris-matthews-retire-msnbc-1282226|title=Chris Matthews to Retire From MSNBC|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ryu|first=Jenna|title=Joy Reid takes over Chris Matthews' MSNBC time slot to host nightly news show|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/07/09/joy-reid-to-host-msnbc-show-chris-matthews-time-slot/5404429002/|access-date=2020-07-09|website=USA Today|language=en-US}}</ref>

Before 2010, MSNBC was not available to [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[AT&T U-verse]] television subscribers in the portions of [[New York (state)|New York State]], northern [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]] that overlapped [[Cablevision]]'s service area. One of several reasons for this was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision that prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/02/22/cablevision-has-exclusive-fios-deal-with-msnbc-in-nyc// | title=Inside Cable News :: Cablevision has exclusive carriage deal with MSNBC... :: February :: 2007 | website=Insidecable.blogsome.com | accessdate=May 11, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413233648/http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/02/22/cablevision-has-exclusive-fios-deal-with-msnbc-in-nyc/ | archivedate=April 13, 2011 | df=mdy-all}}</ref> The terms of the agreement were not publicly known.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 2009, Verizon filed a formal "program-access complaint" with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and petitioned for termination of the deal.

In Asia and Europe, MSNBC is not shown on a dedicated channel. When MSNBC started in 1996, they announced plans to start broadcasting in Europe during 1997. This never happened although MSNBC was seen occasionally on affiliate channel [[CNBC Europe]] until the end of the 2000s, showing the channel overnight at the weekend and during the afternoon on American public holidays as well as during [[breaking news]] events.

In Turkey, NTV-MSNBC is the news channel of the Turkish broadcaster [[NTV Turkey]]. The channel is a joint partnership between the two, although very little Turkish content is shown on English MSNBC. English content on MSNBC is translated into Turkish.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com | title=NTVMSNBC.com | year=2008 | accessdate=January 23, 2008}}</ref>

MSNBC and its website msnbc.com were launched concurrently. Unlike the network, msnbc.com was operated as the general online news outlet of NBC News in partnership with Microsoft's [[MSN.com]] portal. The network and website also remained editorially separate. The website did not adopt the network's increasingly liberal viewpoints and remained a joint venture with Microsoft even after it had sold its stake in MSNBC.<ref name="nyt-msnbcname">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07msnbc.html | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Brian | last=Stelter | title=MSNBC on the Web May Change Its Name | date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>

In November 2007, a ''New York Times'' article stated that MSNBC's primetime lineup was tilting more to the left.<ref name=NYT>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/business/media/06msnb.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin Cable Channel Nods to Ratings and Leans Left].

[[Fox News]] media analyst [[Howard Kurtz]], while previously in the same role at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', stated that the channel's evening lineup "has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of Fox News."<ref name=Kurtz/> In 2011, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' referred to MSNBC as "left-leaning",<ref name="MSNBC host coaxes Ron Paul to run">Barr, Andy (April 5, 2011) [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52608.html MSNBC host coaxes Ron Paul to run], ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]''</ref> and Steve Kornacki of ''[[Salon.com]]'' noted that, "MSNBC’s prime-time lineup is now awash in [[Contemporary progressivism|progressive]] politics."<ref>Kornacki, Steve (January 21, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/2011/01/22/countdown_rip/ Is Olbermann the victim of his own success?], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref> Regarding changes in the channel's evening programming, senior vice president of NBC News Phil Griffin claimed that "it happened naturally.

In the February 2008 issue of ''[[Men's Journal]]'' magazine, an MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive as saying that liberal commentator Keith Olbermann "runs MSNBC" and that "because of his success, he's in charge" of the channel.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/olbermann-talks-office-politics-other-politics_b17699 | website=mediabistro.com.| title=Olbermann Talks Office Politics, Other Politics | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=September 16, 2009}}</ref> In 2007, ''The New York Times'' called Olbermann MSNBC's "most recognizable face".<ref name=NYT/> In September 2008, MSNBC stated that Olbermann and [[Chris Matthews]] would no longer anchor live political events, with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] assuming that role.

Some media outlets, including msnbc.com, claimed that the network was now embracing its politically progressive identity.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/><ref>{{cite magazine | title=MSNBC's new slogan: What doesn't it even mean? | magazine=[[The Week]] | date=October 6, 2010 | url=https://theweek.com/article/index/207856/msnbcs-new-slogan-what-does-it-even-mean | accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Stelter | first=Brian | title=With Tagline, MSNBC Embraces a Political Identity | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 4, 2010 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/media/05adco.html | accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref>
 
In January 2012, MSNBC used Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews, and other network commentators during its coverage of the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa Republican caucuses]]. Nando Di Fino of the [[Mediaite]] website said MSNBC was  "giving up on the straight news coverage, and instead [appearing] to be aiming to create some controversy."<ref>{{cite web | last=Di Fino | first=Nando | title=MSNBC Hosting Lineup For Iowa Caucus Exchanges Neutral Journalism For Partisanship… And Fun | url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-hosting-lineup-for-iowa-caucus-exchanges-neutral-journalism-for-partisanship-and-fun/ | publisher=Mediaite | accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

In November 2012, ''The New York Times'' called MSNBC "The Anti-Fox" and quoted former President Bill Clinton as saying, "Boy, it really has become our version of Fox."<ref>{{cite news | last=Stelter | first=Brian | title=The Anti-Fox Gains Ground | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/business/media/msnbc-its-ratings-rising-gains-ground-on-fox-news.html?pagewanted=1 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=October 2, 2013 | date=November 11, 2012}}</ref> Citing data from the [[A.C. Nielsen]] TV ratings service, the article noted that while the Fox News Channel had a larger overall viewership than MSNBC, the two networks were separated by only around 300,000 viewers among the 25–54 age bracket most attractive to advertisers.

In the [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2013 "State of the News Media" report, MSNBC was found to be the most opinionated news network, with 85 percent of the content being commentary or opinions and the remaining 15 percent being factual reporting. The report also stated that in 2012, MSNBC spent only $240 million on news production compared to CNN's $682 million and the Fox News Channel's $820 million.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Bercovici | first=Jeff | title=Pew Study Finds MSNBC the Most Opinionated Cable News Channel By Far | magazine=[[Forbes]] | date=March 18, 2013 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/03/18/pew-study-finds-msnbc-the-most-opinionated-cable-news-channel-by-far/ | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref>

Others have argued that MSNBC has a bias against progressive politics. [[Phil Donahue]]'s show was canceled in 2003 due to his opposition to the Iraq War, and Donahue later commented that the management of MSNBC required that "we have two conservative (guests) for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals."<ref>Poniewozik, James, [http://entertainment.time.com/2007/04/26/im_not_generally_in_the/ "Watching the Not-Watchdogs,"]''Time'', April 26, 2007.</ref> [[Cenk Uygur]], after his departure from MSNBC in 2011, said that MSNBC management had told him "people in Washington" were "concerned about [his] tone,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/7/22/rejecting_lucrative_offer_cenk_uygur_leaves|title=Cenk Uygur Leaves MSNBC After Being Told to 'Act Like an Insider'|work=Democracy Now!|accessdate=September 17, 2018}}</ref> and that he "didn't want to work in a place that didn't challenge power."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/cenk-uygur-on-why-he-left-msnbc-i-didnt-want-to-work-in-a-place-that-didnt-challenge-power/|title=Cenk Uygur Out at MSNBC|work=Mediaite|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>

====Favoritism towards Barack Obama====
Some Democratic Party supporters, including former Pennsylvania governor [[Ed Rendell]] and Bill Clinton advisor [[Lanny Davis]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://thehill.com/in-the-know/clinton-confidant-dismisses-msnbc-as-no-longer-fair-and-balanced-2008-05-05.html | title=Clinton confidant dismisses MSNBC as no longer fair and balanced | newspaper=The Hill | date=May 5, 2008 | accessdate=April 18, 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208111648/http://thehill.com/in-the-know/clinton-confidant-dismisses-msnbc-as-no-longer-fair-and-balanced-2008-05-05.html | archivedate=December 8, 2008}}</ref> criticized MSNBC during and after the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Party primaries]] as covering [[Barack Obama]] more favorably than [[Hillary Clinton]]. Rendell said, "MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign," and called their coverage "absolutely embarrassing".<ref name=Rendell>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0808/Rendell_Obama_coverage_was_embarrassing.html Rendell: Obama coverage was embarrassing].

A study done by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama (14 percent of stories versus 29 percent in the press overall) and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] (73 percent of its coverage versus 57 percent in the press overall).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.journalism.org/node/13436 | title=The Color of News &#124; Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) | website=Journalism.org | date=October 29, 2008 | accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref> MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, "The Power of Change", was criticized for being too similar to Obama's campaign slogan of "Hope and Change".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10msnbc.html | title=MSNBC's Tag for Now: 'The Power of Change' | last=Stelter | first=Brian | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 10, 2008 | accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> After the election, conservative talk show host [[John Ziegler (talk show host)|John Ziegler]] made a documentary entitled ''Media Malpractice.... How Obama Got Elected'', which was very critical of the media's role, especially MSNBC's, in the election. While promoting the documentary, he had an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor [[Contessa Brewer]] about how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed Sarah Palin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/06/10/contessa-brewer-vs-john-ziegler-cut-the-mic/ | title=Contessa Brewer vs. John Ziegler re: Sarah Palin – 'Cut the mic, please' | author=Annie Barrett | date=June 10, 2009 | work=PopWatch Blog | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=November 1, 2009 }}</ref>

During MSNBC's coverage of the Potomac primary, MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, "I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often." This led Fox News to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,483568,00.html |title=Bernie Goldberg on 'Love Affair' Between Obama and Media – Hannity |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=January 27, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724190016/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,483568,00.html |archive-date=July 24, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

====''Rise of the New Right'' documentary====
In June 2010, the MSNBC documentary ''Rise of the New Right'' aired. It featured interviews with [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] figures, including [[Dick Armey]], the former House majority Leader, [[Orly Taitz]], a leading figure in the "[[birther]]" movement, and [[conspiracy theorist]] radio host [[Alex Jones]]. The documentary also showed the [[Michigan Militia]]'s [[Survivalism|survival]] training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky senatorial candidate [[Rand Paul]].<ref name="WeigelNewReight">{{cite news | last=Weigel | first=David | title=MSNBC documentary on the 'New Right' profiles birthers, militias, Alex Jones | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=June 7, 2010 | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/upcoming_msnbc_documentary_on.html| accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref>

The documentary angered [[Tea Party movement]] figures and others on the right. After the documentary aired, [[FreedomWorks]], chaired by Armey, called for a boycott of [[Dawn (brand)|Dawn]] and [[Procter & Gamble]], which advertised during ''Hardball with Chris Matthews''.<ref>{{cite news | last=Weigel | first=David | title=Tea partyers push back against 'The Rise of the New Right' with boycott | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=June 17, 2010 | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/tea_partyers_push_back_against.html | accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Montopoli | first=Brian | title=Tea Party Groups Lash Out at MSNBC Over Special | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=June 17, 2010 | url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20008106-503544.html | accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref> The boycott was ineffective as Procter & Gamble continued to advertise on the show.

====Romney coverage during 2012 election====
A study by the [[Pew Research Center]]'s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that MSNBC's coverage of [[Mitt Romney]] during the final week of the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential campaign]] (68 percent negative with no positive stories in the sample) was far more negative than the overall press, and even more negative than it had been during October 1 to 28, when 5 percent was positive and 57 percent was negative.<ref>{{cite press release | title=THE FINAL DAYS OF THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN 2012: Final Weeks in the Mainstream Press | publisher=Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism | date=November 19, 2012 | url=http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/final_weeks_mainstream_press | accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, their coverage of Barack Obama improved in the final week before the presidential election. From October 1 to 28, 33 percent of stories were positive and 13 percent negative. During the campaign's final week, 51 percent of MSNBC's stories were positive while there were no negative stories at all about Obama in the sample.

===Romney family grandchild===

Political commentator [[Melissa Harris-Perry]] and her guest panel, in a look back on the 2013 segment of [[Melissa Harris-Perry (TV program)|her show]], featured a picture of former Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] and his extended family. Romney was holding on his knee his adopted grandchild, Kieran Romney, an African-American. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian [[Dean Obeidallah]], joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, "One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn’t the same." Obeidallah said, "It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the [Republican National Committee], where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person." Afterwards, Harris-Perry gave an on-air apology as well as apologized in a series of [[Twitter|tweets]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2013/1231/Melissa-Harris-Perry-apologizes-for-Romney-grandchild-jokes-Sincere | newspaper=Christian Science Monitor| first=Peter | last=Grier | title=Melissa Harris-Perry apologizes for Romney grandchild jokes: Sincere? | date=December 31, 2013 | accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-melissa-harris-perry-apologizes-for-mitt-romney-grandchild-comments-20131231,0,3504370.story#axzz2pUw9bwlb | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Patrick | last=Day | title=Melissa Harris-Perry apologizes for Mitt Romney grandchild comments| date=December 31, 2013 | accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref>

=== Coverage of the 2020 Democratic Primary ===
On February 2, 2019, NBC ran a story about presidential candidate [[Tulsi Gabbard]] claiming that her campaign was benefiting from Russian [[state media]], stating that she had received twice as many mentions on [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[Sputnik News]] and [[Russia Insider]] compared to expected front-runners [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Joe Biden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/russia-s-propaganda-machine-discovers-2020-democratic-candidate-tulsi-gabbard-n964261|title=Russia's propaganda machine discovers 2020 Democratic candidate Tulsi Gabbard|last1=Windrem|first1=Robert|last2=Popken|first2=Ben|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>

In March 2019, [[Yashar Ali]], a journalist for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' accused [[Dafna Linzer]], a managing editor at MSNBC, of ceding editorial control to the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Ali, who planned to announce the locations of the DNC debates in advance of MSNBC, received a call attempting to dissuade him with the phrase "let them make a few phone calls," referring to party leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-contributor-accuses-nbc-news-managing-editor-of-unethical-call-about-dnc-debates/|title=HuffPost Contributor Accuses NBC News Managing Editor of 'Unethical' Call About DNC Debates|last=Levine|first=Jon|date=March 29, 2019|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> A source quoted by CNN stated that this approach was necessary for any network that has enough of a relationship with the DNC to host its debates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mailchi.mp/cnn/rs-mar-29-2019|title=Yafshar Ali calls out NBC|date=March 29, 2019|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref>

Candidate [[Andrew Yang]] and his supporters have been critical of MSNBC's coverage of [[Andrew Yang 2020 presidential campaign|his campaign]] and the speaking time allocated to Yang at a November 2019 primary debate hosted by MSNBC.<ref>

===Suspensions of hosts===

====Michael Savage====
[[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]] briefly hosted a weekend talk show in 2003. That July, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a "pig" and a "sodomite", and telling him he "should get [[AIDS]] and die." Savage's show was canceled and he was dismissed from MSNBC shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lowry|first= Brian|title=Savage gets the boot after on-air anti-gay outburst|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 8, 2003|page=E1}}</ref>

====Don Imus====
[[Don Imus]]', radio show ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' was simulcast on MSNBC for over ten years. In 2007, he described members of the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights women's basketball|Rutgers University women's basketball team]] as "some nappy-headed hoes."  The racist remark was met with outrage, and advertisers withdrew from the show, with MSNBC canceling the simulcast. Both Imus and NBC News apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks.<ref>[http://www.today.com/id/17999196 MSNBC drops simulcast of Don Imus show]. msnbc.com. April 11, 2007.</ref>

====Keith Olbermann and Joe Scarborough====
On November 5, 2010, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Keith Olbermann indefinitely without pay for having contributed $2,400 (the maximum personal donation limit) to each of three Democratic Party candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle.<ref>Aujla, Simmi.  "Keith Olbermann suspended after donating to Democrats." Politico.com.

Two weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of [[Joe Scarborough]] for similar misconduct. The ''Morning Joe'' host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann's suspension, Scarborough's was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/11/19/msnbc-suspends-morning-joe-host-scarborough-for-political-donations/ "MSNBC Suspends ‘Morning Joe’ Host Scarborough for Political Donations"] ''Wall Street Journal'' November 19, 2010</ref>
