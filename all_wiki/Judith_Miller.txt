Bill Miller was known for booking iconic Las Vegas performers. His biggest success was getting [[Elvis Presley]] to return to Las Vegas after initially being an unsuccessful  booking.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2002/dec/12/booking-agent-who-brought-elvis-back-to-las-vegas-/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010160606/https://lasvegassun.com/news/2002/dec/12/booking-agent-who-brought-elvis-back-to-las-vegas-/ |archive-date=2017-10-10 |url-status=live}}</ref> Her mother was a "pretty Irish Catholic showgirl."<ref name=parents />

Miller attended [[Ohio State University]], where she was a member of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] sorority.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} She graduated from [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]] in 1969 and received a master's degree in public affairs from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|School of Public and International Affairs]].

==Career at ''The New York Times''==
[[File:Mike Pence and Judith Miller.png|thumb|right|Miller and [[Mike Pence]] in 2005]]
During Miller's tenure at ''[[The New York Times]]'', she was a member of the team that won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]], for its 2001 coverage of global terrorism before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. She and James Risen received the award and one of the cited articles appeared under her byline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2002|title=The 2002 Pulitzer Prize Winners: Explanatory Reporting|publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515092133/http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/2002|archive-date=May 15, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}} With reprints of ten 2001 works.</ref>

Her writing during this period was criticised by Middle-east scholar [[Edward Said]] for evincing an anti-Islamic bias. In his book ''[[Covering Islam]]'' Said stated that Miller's book ''God Has Ninety-Nine Names'' "is like a textbook of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam." He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that "nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject." He concluded Miller "fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn't bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world."<ref name="said">{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Covering Islam: how the media and the experts determine how we see the rest of the world|year=1997|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-75890-7|pages=xxxiv-xliii}}</ref>  However, Miller asserted that in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] she argued that militant [[Islamism]] of the type represented by [[Al Qaeda]] had peaked and was fading into insignificance.<ref name="MillerEvildoers">{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Judith|title=Naming the Evildoers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/books/naming-the-evildoers.html?mcubz=2|accessdate=12 July 2017|website=The New York Times|date=29 September 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831222913/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/books/naming-the-evildoers.html?mcubz=2|archive-date=31 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Anthrax hoax victim===
On October 12, 2001, Miller opened an [[anthrax hoax]] letter mailed to her ''New York Times'' office. The [[2001 anthrax attacks]] had begun occurring in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to [[ABC News]], [[CBS News]], [[NBC News]], and the ''[[New York Post]]'', all in [[New York City]], as well as the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' in [[Boca Raton, Florida]]. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators [[Tom Daschle]] and [[Patrick Leahy]] in Washington. Twenty-two people were infected; five died. In 2008, the government's investigation of these mailings focused on [[Bruce Ivins]], who later committed suicide, with the investigation determining that Ivins acted alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/February/10-nsd-166.html|title=Justice Department and FBI Announce Formal Conclusion of Investigation into 2001 Anthrax Attacks|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2010-07-02|author=Office of Public Affairs, Department of Justice|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628225328/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/February/10-nsd-166.html|archive-date=2010-06-28|url-status=live}}</ref>

Miller was the only major U.S. media reporter, and ''The New York Times'' the only major U.S. media organization, to be victimized by a fake anthrax letter in the fall of 2001. Miller had reported extensively on the subject of biological threats and had co-authored, with Stephen Engelberg and [[William Broad]], a book on bio-terrorism, ''[[Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War]]'', which was published on October 2, 2001. Miller co-authored an article on Pentagon plans to develop a more potent version of weaponized anthrax, "U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits", published in ''The New York Times'' on September 4, 2001, weeks before the first anthrax mailings.<ref>Miller, Judith [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/world/us-germ-warfare-research-pushes-treaty-limits.html "U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201144340/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/04/world/us-germ-warfare-research-pushes-treaty-limits.html |date=2016-12-01 }}, ''The New York Times'', September 4, 2001.</ref>

Miller also participated in a senior-level bio-terror attack simulation on [[Oklahoma City]] conducted on June 22 and June 23, 2001, called "[[Operation Dark Winter]]"; her role was media reporter/observer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2001_dark-winter/about.html|title=About the Exercise: Dark Winter|last=UPMC|first=Center for Biosecurity of|website=www.upmchealthsecurity.org|accessdate=December 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101122739/http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2001_dark-winter/about.html|archive-date=January 1, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Islamic charities search leak===
Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government was considering adding the [[Holy Land Foundation]] to a list of organizations with suspected links to terrorism and was planning to search the premises of the organization. The information about the impending raid was given to Miller by a confidential source. On December 3, 2001, Miller telephoned the Holy Land Foundation for comment, and ''The New York Times'' published an article in the late edition papers and on its website that day. The next day, the government searched HLF's offices. These occurrences led to a lawsuit brought by US Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]],<ref>''New York Times v. Gonzales'', 459 F.3d 160 (2006).</ref> with prosecutors claiming that Miller and her colleague Philip Shenon had queried this Islamic charity, and another, in ways that made them aware of the planned searches.<ref>A brief analysis of the decisions in ''New York Times v.

===The Iraq War===
At ''The New York Times'', Miller wrote on [[National security|security]] issues, particularly about [[Iraq]] and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Many of these stories later turned out to have been based upon faulty information.<ref name=Moore/><ref name="nytimes.com">NYTimes Editors (May 26, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html "FROM THE EDITORS; The Times and Iraq"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025070936/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html |date=2018-10-25 }}, ''The New York Times''</ref> (One of her stories that wasn't disproved reported that inspectors in Iraq "saw nothing to prompt a war.")<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/international/middleeast/31BLIX.html|title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE INSPECTOR; Blix Says He Saw Nothing to Prompt a War|author=Judith Miller|author2=Julia Preston|journal=The New York Times|date=January 31, 2003|access-date=February 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803053626/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/31/international/middleeast/31BLIX.html|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On September 8, 2002, Miller and her ''Times'' colleague [[Michael R. Gordon]] reported the interception of "aluminum tubes" bound for Iraq. Her front-page story quoted unnamed "American officials" and "American intelligence experts" who said the tubes were intended to be used to enrich nuclear material, and cited unnamed "[[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] officials" who claimed that, in recent months, Iraq had "stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and [had] embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an [[atomic bomb]]".<ref name="Gordon and Miller, Sept. 8, 2002">Michael R.

Shortly after Miller's article was published, [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Colin Powell]], and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] appeared on television and pointed to Miller's story in support of their position.<ref name=":0" /> As summarized by ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', "in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration's case for war, and the ''Times'' played a critical part in legitimizing it."<ref name=":0" /> Miller later said of the controversy

In an April 21, 2003 article, Miller, ostensibly on the basis of statements from the military unit in which she was [[Embedded journalism|embedded]], reported claims allegedly made by an Iraqi scientist that Iraq had kept biological and chemical weapons until "right before the invasion."<ref>{{cite news|author=Judith Miller|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/21/international/worldspecial/21CHEM.html|title=Illicit Arms Kept Till Eve of War, an Iraqi Scientist Is Said to Assert|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 21, 2003|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731203131/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/21/international/worldspecial/21CHEM.html|archive-date=July 31, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This report was covered extensively in the press. Miller went on ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' and stated:

<blockquote>Well, I think they found something more than a [[smoking gun]].

There was strong internal dissent amongst other ''Times'' reporters regarding publication of the inflammatory, unsourced accusations, however, and that the military were allowed to censor it before it appeared. A week after it appeared, one ''Times'' insider called Miller's piece "wacky-assed" and complained there were "real questions about it and why it was on page 1."<ref>[https://observer.com/2003/04/off-the-record-35/ Off the Record] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073341/https://observer.com/2003/04/off-the-record-35/ |date=2019-01-25 }}, ''[[New York Observer]]'', Sridhar Pappu, April 28, 2003.

In it she admitted her source regarding the alleged WMDs, according to [[Seymour Hersh]] writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', was none other than [[Ahmed Chalabi]]'s [[Iraqi National Congress]], which claims Pentagon officials passed on to Miller, despite the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] disagreeing with its content.

==Contempt of court==
{{Further|CIA leak grand jury investigation|CIA leak scandal timeline}}
On October 1, 2004, federal Judge [[Thomas F. Hogan]] found Miller in [[contempt of court]] for refusing to appear before a federal grand jury, which was investigating who had leaked to reporters the fact that [[Valerie Plame]] was a CIA operative. Miller did not write an article about the subject at the time of the leak, but others did, notably [[Robert Novak]], spurring the investigation. Judge Hogan sentenced her to 18 months in jail, but stayed the sentence while her appeal proceeded. On February 15, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld Judge Hogan's ruling. On June 17, 2005, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On July 6, 2005, Judge Hogan ordered Miller to serve her sentence at "a suitable jail within the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia". She was taken to [[Alexandria City Jail]] on July 7, 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4654969.stm|title=US reporter jailed in CIA trial|work=[[BBC News]]|date=July 6, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908161257/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4654969.stm|archive-date=September 8, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/politics/06cnd-leak.html|title=Prosecutor in Leak Case Calls for Reporters' Jailing|work=The New York Times|date=July 6, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521043021/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/politics/prosecutor-in-leak-case-calls-for-reporters-jailing.html|archive-date=May 21, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In a separate case, Federal Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] ruled on February 24, 2005, that Miller was not required to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Patrick Fitzgerald, the same prosecutor who had had Miller jailed in the Plame case, argued that Miller's calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller's phone records to confirm the time of the tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor's needs were outweighed by a 'reporter's privilege' to keep sources confidential. On August 1, 2006, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Sweet's decision, holding 2–1 that federal prosecutors could inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge [[Ralph K. Winter, Jr.]] wrote: "No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, much less to indict or not indict, without the reporters' evidence".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/washington/02phones.html?hp&ex=1154577600&en=f960a842e0fe8b0a&ei=5094&partner=homepage|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=U.S. Wins Access to Reporter Phone Records|work=The New York Times|date=August 2, 2006|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901031543/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/washington/02phones.html?hp&ex=1154577600&en=f960a842e0fe8b0a&ei=5094&partner=homepage|archive-date=September 1, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Prior to her jailing for civil contempt, Miller's lawyers argued that it was pointless to imprison her because she would never talk or reveal confidential sources. Under such circumstances, argued her lawyers, jail term would be "merely punitive" and would serve no purpose. Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller's lawyers suggested that "impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her".<ref name="Leonnig July 2">[[Carol D.

On September 17, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Miller had received a "parade of prominent government and media officials" during her first 11 weeks in prison, including visits by former U.S. Republican Senator [[Bob Dole]], NBC News anchor [[Tom Brokaw]], and [[John R.

==Refusal to disclose source==
In July 2005, several months prior to her October 2005 resignation from ''The New York Times'', Miller was jailed for [[contempt of court]] for refusing to testify before a federal [[grand jury]] investigating a [[Political leak|leak]] naming [[Valerie Plame]] as a CIA officer. While Miller never wrote about Plame, she was believed to be in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation. According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official, later revealed to be [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s Chief of Staff, on July 8, 2003. Plame's CIA identity was divulged publicly in a column by conservative political commentator [[Robert Novak]] on July 14, 2003. Novak's source was revealed to have not been Libby, but [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] of the Department of State.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On July 16, 2005, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, which could have extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated.<ref>{{cite news|last1= Kurtz |first1= Howard |last2= Leonnig |first2=Carol D.|author-link2=Carol D.

Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4296090.stm|title=US CIA case reporter will testify |work=BBC News|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=May 21, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170222170130/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4296090.stm |archive-date=February 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

For her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. This was several weeks ''before'' Joseph Wilson's ''New York Times'' editorial was published. This belied the theory that Libby was retaliating against Wilson for his ''Times'' editorial. According to Miller's notes from that earlier meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her July 8, 2003, meeting with Libby contains the name "Valerie Flame [sic]".<ref>Don Van Natta Jr., Adam Liptak & Clifford J.

Miller's grand jury account was the basis for her last article in ''The New York Times''. The newspaper published Miller's first-person account, "My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room", on October 16, 2005.

Miller testified as a witness on January 30, 2007, at the trial of Scooter Libby, which began in January 2007.

On April 3, 2015, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published an [[op-ed]] piece by Miller<ref name=wsjmiller>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-iraq-war-and-stubborn-myths-1428087215|title=The Iraq War and Stubborn Myths|last=Miller|first=Judith|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 3, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705084330/https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-iraq-war-and-stubborn-myths-1428087215|archive-date=July 5, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> in which she defended her comportment during the lead-up to the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], as well as the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's stance and decisions regarding the war. "Officials [of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]] didn't lie, and I wasn't fed a line," she wrote.<ref name=wsjmiller/> Miller acknowledged that "there was no shortage of mistakes about Iraq, and I made my share of them. The newsworthy claims of some of my prewar WMD stories were wrong", but rejected the notion that "I took America to war in Iraq. It was all me", which according to her "continue[d] to have believers".<ref name=wsjmiller/>

Critics subsequently wrote that "Miller's war reporting was disastrously wrong, and now she's trying desperately to spin it all away,".<ref name=salonmill>{{cite web|last=Malloy|first=Simon|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/04/06/judith_millers_pathetic_iraq_apologia_a_disgraced_reporter_rallies_to_her_own_defense/|title=Judith Miller's pathetic Iraq apologia: A disgraced reporter rallies to her own defense|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516173701/http://www.salon.com/2015/04/06/judith_millers_pathetic_iraq_apologia_a_disgraced_reporter_rallies_to_her_own_defense/|archive-date=May 16, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Valerie Plame]] commented that while "no one is crediting [Miller] with starting the Iraq war," and she was "not actually on the team that took us into the biggest, most tragic US foreign policy debacle ever..., [Miller's] attempt to re-write history is both pathetic and self-serving."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ValeriePlameWilson/posts/1073870519295775|title=Dear Judy|work=[[Valerie Plame]]|publisher=[[Facebook]]|date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228153913/https://www.facebook.com/ValeriePlameWilson/posts/1073870519295775|archive-date=February 28, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "in arguing that [[George W.

==Memoir==
In April 2015, Miller published ''The Story: A Reporter's Journey'', a [[memoir]] that focused largely on her reporting during the second Gulf War. Her former colleague [[Neil Lewis (journalist)|Neil Lewis]] characterized most of the reviews as "unreservedly critical".<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/what_we_can_learn_from_judith_miller.php |title=What we can learn from Judith Miller's rehab tour |journal=[[The Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621032912/https://www.cjr.org/first_person/what_we_can_learn_from_judith_miller.php |archive-date=June 21, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Writing in ''The New York Times'', former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter [[Terry McDermott (journalist)|Terry McDermott]] wrote that although "this is not a score-settling book", he found it "sad and flawed".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/books/review-judith-millers-the-story-a-reporters-journey.html |title=Review: Judith Miller's "The Story: A Reporter's Journey" |last=McDermott |first=Terry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 7, 2015 |accessdate=May 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624144014/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/books/review-judith-millers-the-story-a-reporters-journey.html |archive-date=June 24, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Ιn ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Erik Wemple]] wrote that the book's "dynamic" of "Judy Miller against the world" lends her book an aspect that is "both depressing and desperate".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-reporters-defense-of-her-flawed-reporting/2015/04/09/5bf93f14-de15-11e4-a500-1c5bb1d8ff6a_story.html |title=Judith Miller tries, and ultimately fails, to defend her flawed Iraq reporting |last=Wemple |first=Eric |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 9, 2015 |accessdate=May 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063400/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-reporters-defense-of-her-flawed-reporting/2015/04/09/5bf93f14-de15-11e4-a500-1c5bb1d8ff6a_story.html |archive-date=September 1, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A review in ''[[The Columbia Journalism Review]]'' called the book "less a memoir than an [[apologia]] and an assault".<ref name="KleinJM" /> In ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', [[Lloyd Grove]] characterized Miller's work as "self-pitying".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/15/former-nyt-reporter-judith-miller-pleads-her-shaky-case.html |last=Grove |first=Lloyd |title=Former NYT Reporter Judith Miller Pleads Her Shaky Case |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=April 15, 2015 |accessdate=May 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331044959/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/15/former-nyt-reporter-judith-miller-pleads-her-shaky-case.html |archive-date=March 31, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Criticizing Miller's failure to fully take responsibility for the flaws in her reporting, [[Matt Taibbi]] wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': "Most of ''The Story'' is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller's homework.&nbsp;...
