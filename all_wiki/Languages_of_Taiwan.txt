The languages of [[Taiwan]] consist of several varieties of languages under families of [[Austronesian languages]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken in [[Taiwan]]. The [[Formosan languages]], a branch of [[Austronesian languages]], have been spoken by the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] in [[Taiwan]] for thousands of years. Researches on [[historical linguistics]] recognize Taiwan as the [[Urheimat]] (homeland) of the whole [[Austronesian languages]] family owing to the highest internal variety of the [[Formosan languages]]. In the last 400 years, several waves of [[Chinese emigration]]s brought several different [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] into Taiwan. These languages include [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]], and [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]], which became the major languages of today's Taiwan and make Taiwan an important center of [[Hokkien pop]] and [[Mandopop]].

[[Formosan languages]] were the dominant language of [[Prehistory of Taiwan|prehistorical Taiwan]]. The long colonial and immigration [[history of Taiwan]] brought in several languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. Due to its colonial history, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is also spoken and a large number of loanwords from Japanese exist in several languages of Taiwan.

[[History of Taiwan since 1945|After World War II]], a long [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law era]] was held in [[Taiwan]]. Policies of the government in this era suppressed languages other than [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] in public use. This has significantly damaged the evolution of local languages including [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]], [[Formosan languages]] and [[Matsu dialect]]. The situation has slightly changed in the 2000s when the government made efforts to protect and [[Language revitalization|revitalize]] local languages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hubbs|first=Elizabeth|title=Taiwan language-in-education policy: social, cultural and practical implications|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/AZSLAT/article/download/21223/20804|journal=Arizona Working Papers in SLA & Teaching|volume=20|pages=76-95}}</ref> Local languages became part of [[Education in Taiwan|elementary school education]] in [[Taiwan]], laws and regulations regarding local language protection were established for [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] and [[Formosan languages]], and public TV and radio stations exclusively for these two languages were also established.

{{Main|Formosan languages}}

The '''Taiwanese indigenous languages''' or '''Formosan languages''' are the languages of the [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|aboriginal tribes]] of [[Taiwan]]. Taiwanese aborigines currently comprise about 2.3% of the island's population.<ref>Council of Indigenous Peoples, Executive Yuan  ''[http://www.apc.gov.tw/en/statistic/number2.aspx "Statistics of Indigenous Population in Taiwan and Fukien Areas"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830083123/http://www.apc.gov.tw/en/statistic/number2.aspx |date=2006-08-30 }}''.</ref> However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language, after centuries of [[language shift]]. It is common for young and middle-aged Hakka and aboriginal people to speak Mandarin and Hokkien better than, or to the exclusion of, their ethnic languages. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are [[extinct language|extinct]], another five are [[moribund language|moribund]],<ref>Zeitoun, Elizabeth &  Ching-Hua Yu ''[http://aclclp.org.tw/clclp/v10n2/v10n2a2.pdf "The Formosan Language Archive: Linguistic Analysis and Language Processing"]''.

The governmental agency — [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]] — maintains the orthography of the [[writing systems of Formosan languages]]. Due to the era of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]], a large number of [[loanword]]s from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] also appear in Formosan languages. There is also [[Yilan Creole Japanese]] as a mixture of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Atayal language|Atayal]].

All Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Mandarin. In recent decades the government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan [[first language|mother tongue education]] in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing.<ref>Lee, Hui-chi (2004). ''A Survey of Language Ability, Language Use and Language Attitudes of Young Aborigines in Taiwan.''

== Sinitic languages ==
===Taiwanese Mandarin===
{{Main|Taiwanese Mandarin|Standard Chinese}}
Mandarin is commonly known and officially referred to as the '''national language''' ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=國語|p=Guóyǔ|labels=no}}) in [[Taiwan]]. In 1945, following the end of [[World War II]], Mandarin was introduced as the official language and made compulsory in schools. (Before 1945, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was the official language and taught in schools.) Since then, Mandarin has been established as a [[lingua franca]] among the various groups in Taiwan: the majority [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]-speaking [[Hoklo (ethnic group)|Hoklo]] (Hokkien), the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] who have their own [[Hakka Chinese|spoken language]], the [[Taiwanese aboriginals|aboriginals]] who speak aboriginal languages; as well as [[Mainland Chinese]] [[Chinese Nationalist Party retreat to Taiwan|immigrated in 1949]] whose native tongue may be any [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese variant]].

People who emigrated from [[mainland China]] after 1949 (12% of the population) mostly speak [[Mandarin Chinese]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Liao |first=Silvie |date=2008 |url=http://naccl.osu.edu/files/21_liao-s.pdf |title=A Perceptual Dialect Study of Taiwan Mandarin: Language Attitudes in the Era of Political Battle |journal=Proceedings of the 20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics (NACCL-20) |volume=1 |place=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=The Ohio State University |oclc=895153060 |isbn=9780982471500 |page=393 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110315/http://naccl.osu.edu/files/21_liao-s.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-24 }}</ref> [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] is almost universally spoken and understood.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Republic of China Yearbook 2012 |date=2012 |publisher=Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

Taiwanese Mandarin (as with [[Singlish]] and many other situations of a [[Post-creole speech continuum|creole speech community]]) is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers.  Formal occasions call for the [[acrolect]]al level of Standard Chinese of [[Taiwan]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=國語|p=Guóyǔ|labels=no}}), which differs little from the Standard Chinese of [[China]] ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=普通话|t=|p=Pǔtōnghuà|labels=no}}).  Less formal situations may result in the [[basilect]] form, which has more uniquely Taiwanese features.  Bilingual Taiwanese speakers may [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between Mandarin and Taiwanese, sometimes in the same sentence.

Many Taiwanese, particularly the younger generations, speak Mandarin better than Hakka or Hokkien, and it has become a [[lingua franca]] for the island amongst the [[Chinese dialect]]s.{{sfnp|Noble|2005|p=16}}

===Taiwanese Hokkien===
{{Main|Taiwanese Hokkien}}
Commonly known as '''Taiwanese''' ({{lang|zh-tw|臺語}}, {{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|poj=Tâi-gí}}) and officially referred as '''Taiwanese Hokkien''' ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=臺灣閩南語|poj=Tâi-oân Bân-lâm-gú|labels=no}}); [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] is the most-spoken [[native language]] in [[Taiwan]], spoken by about 70% of the population.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cheng |first=Robert L. |date=1994 |chapter=Chapter 13: Language Unification in Taiwan: Present and Future |page=362 |title=The Other Taiwan: 1945 to the Present |editor=Rubinstein, Murray |publisher=M.E.

There are both colloquial and literary [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of Taiwanese.  Colloquial Taiwanese has roots in [[Old Chinese]].  Literary Taiwanese, which was originally developed in the 10th century in Fujian and based on [[Middle Chinese]], was used at one time for formal writing, but is now largely extinct.  Due to the era of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]], a large amount of [[loanword]]s from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] also appear in Taiwanese.  The loanwords may be read in [[Kanji]] through Taiwanese pronunciation or simply use the Japanese pronunciation.  These reasons makes the modern writing Taiwanese in a mixed script of [[traditional Chinese characters]] and Latin-based systems such as [[pe̍h-ōe-jī]] or the [[Taiwanese Romanization System|Taiwanese romanization system]] derived from pe̍h-ōe-jī in official use since 2006.

Recent work by scholars such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20041022000504/http://ws.twl.ncku.edu.tw/hak-chia/l/lou-ek-ki/kongpah-oat.htm Ekki Lu], [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002014759/http://203.64.42.21/iug/ungian/poj/siausit/2002/2002pojgth/lunbun/a1-sakai.pdf Sakai Toru], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20040915015640/http://ws.twl.ncku.edu.tw/hak-chia/l/li-khin-hoann/phok-su/phok-su.htm Lí Khîn-hoāⁿ] (also known as Tavokan Khîn-hoāⁿ or Chin-An Li), based on former research by scholars such as [[Ong Iok-tek|Ông Io̍k-tek]], has gone so far as to associate part of the basic vocabulary of the colloquial language with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] and [[Tai languages|Tai]] language families; however, such claims are not without controversy.  Recently there has been a growing use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media.

Accent differences among Taiwanese dialects are relatively small but still exist.  The standard accent — Thong-hêng accent ({{lang|zh-tw|通行腔}}) is sampled from [[Kaohsiung]] city,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twblg.dict.edu.tw/holodict_new/compile1_3_9_3.jsp|title=臺灣閩南語常用詞辭典編輯凡例|website=twblg.dict.edu.tw|language=zh-tw|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref> while other accents fall into a [[Dialect continuum|spectrum]] between 
* Hái-kháu accent ({{lang|zh-tw|海口腔}}): representing the accent spoken in [[Lukang, Changhua|Lukang]], close to [[Quanzhou]] [[Quanzhou dialect|dialect]] in China, and
* Lāi-po͘ accent ({{lang|zh-tw|內埔腔}}): representing the accent spoken in [[Yilan City|Yilan]], close to [[Zhangzhou]] [[Zhangzhou dialect|dialect]] in China.

Much of Taiwanese Hokkien is mutually intelligible with other dialects of Hokkien as spoken in [[China]] and [[South-east Asia]] (such as [[Singaporean Hokkien]]), but also to a degree with the [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] variant of [[Southern Min]] spoken in Eastern Guangdong, [[China]]. It is, however, mutually unintelligible with Mandarin and other Chinese languages.

===Taiwanese Hakka===

{{Main|Taiwanese Hakka}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
'''Hakka''' ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=客家語|p=Hak-kâ-ngî|labels=no}}) is mainly spoken in Taiwan by people who have [[Hakka people|Hakka]] ancestry.

=== Matsu dialect ===
{{Main|Matsu dialect}}
'''Matsu dialect''' ({{lang|zh-tw|馬祖話}}, ''Mā-cū-huâ'') is the language spoken in [[Matsu islands]].  It is a dialect of [[Fuzhou dialect]], [[Eastern Min]].

== Written and sign languages ==
=== Chinese characters ===
[[Traditional Chinese characters]] is widely used in [[Taiwan]] to write [[Sinitic languages]] including [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]]. The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] maintains standards of writing for these languages, publications including the [[Standard Form of National Characters]] and the recommended characters for Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka.

[[Written vernacular Chinese]] is the standard of [[written Chinese]] used in official documents, general literature and most aspects of everyday life, and has grammar based on [[Standard Chinese|Modern Standard Mandarin]].  Vernacular Chinese is the modern written variant of Chinese that supplanted the use of [[classical Chinese]] in literature following the [[New Culture Movement]] of the early 20th Century, which is based on the grammar of Chinese spoken in ancient times.  In recent times, following the [[Taiwan localization movement]] and an increasing presence of Taiwanese literature, [[written Hokkien]] based on the vocabulary and grammar of [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] is occasionally used in literature and informal communications.

Traditional Chinese characters are also used in Hong Kong and Macau.  A small number of characters are written differently in Taiwan; the [[Standard Form of National Characters]] is the orthography standard used in Taiwan and administered by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]], and has minor variations compared with the [[List of Forms of Frequently Used Characters|standardized character forms]] used in Hong Kong and Macau. Such differences relate to [[Variant Chinese character#Orthodox and vulgar variants|orthodox and vulgar variants]] of Chinese characters.

=== Latin alphabet and Romanization ===
{{Main|Writing systems of Formosan languages|Chinese language romanization in Taiwan}}
{{see also|Taiwanese Romanization System|Taiwanese Hakka Romanization System}}
[[Latin alphabet]] is native to [[Formosan languages]] and partially native to [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]]. With the early influences of European missionaries, writing systems such as [[Sinckan Manuscripts]], [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]], and [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ]] were based on in Latin alphabet.  Currently the official [[Writing systems of Formosan languages|Writing systems]] of [[Formosan languages]] are solely based on Latin and maintained by the [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]].  The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] also maintains Latin based systems [[Taiwanese Romanization System]] for [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], and [[Taiwanese Hakka Romanization System]] for [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]].  The textbooks of [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] and [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] are written in a mixed script of [[Traditional Chinese characters]] and Latin alphabet.

[[Chinese language romanization in Taiwan]] tends to be highly inconsistent.  Taiwan still uses the [[Zhuyin|Zhuyin system]] and does not commonly use the [[Latin alphabet]] as the language phonetic symbols. Traditionally [[Wade–Giles]] is used.  The central government adopted [[Tongyong Pinyin]] as the official romanization in 2002 but local governments are permitted to override the standard as some have adopted [[Hanyu Pinyin]] and retained old romanizations that are commonly used.  However, in August 2008 the central government announced that [[Hanyu Pinyin]] will be the only system of Romanization of Standard Mandarin in Taiwan as of January 2009.

=== Phonetic symbols ===
{{Main|Bopomofo|Taiwanese Phonetic Symbols}}
[[File:Zhuyin and Hanzi location.svg|250px|right]]
''Zhuyin Fuhao'', often abbreviated as ''Zhuyin'', or known as ''Bopomofo'' after its first four letters, is the [[phonetic]] system of [[Taiwan]] for teaching the pronunciation of [[Chinese characters]], especially in [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]. [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] uses 37 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 [[consonant]]s and 16 [[Syllable rime|rimes]]. [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] uses 45 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 [[consonant]]s and 24 [[Syllable rime|rimes]]. There is also a system created for [[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]] language.

These phonetic symbols sometimes appear as [[ruby characters]] printed next to the Chinese characters in young children's [[book]]s, and in editions of classical texts (which frequently use characters that appear at very low frequency rates in newspapers and other such daily fare). In advertisements, these phonetic symbols are sometimes used to write certain particles (e.g., {{Linktext|ㄉ}} instead of {{Linktext|的}}); other than this, one seldom sees these symbols used in mass media adult publications except as a pronunciation guide (or index system) in [[dictionary]] entries.  Bopomofo symbols are also mapped to the ordinary Roman character keyboard (1 = ''bo'', q = ''po'', a = ''mo'', and so forth) used in one [[Chinese input methods for computers|method for inputting Chinese text]] when using a [[computer]]. In more recent years, with the advent of smartphones, it has become increasingly common to see Zhuyin used in written slang terms, instead of typing full characters - for example ''ㄅㄅ'' replacing {{Link text|拜拜}} (bye bye). It is also used to give phrases a different tone, like using ''ㄘ'' for {{Link text|吃}} (to eat) to indicate a childlike tone in the writing.

The sole purpose for Zhuyin in elementary education is to teach standard Mandarin pronunciation to children.  Grade one textbooks of all subjects (including Mandarin) are entirely in zhuyin.  After that year, Chinese character texts are given in annotated form.  Around grade four, presence of Zhuyin annotation is greatly reduced, remaining only in the new character section. [[School]] children learn the symbols so that they can decode pronunciations given in a Chinese dictionary, and also so that they can find how to write words for which they know only the sounds. Even among adults, it is almost universally used in Taiwan to explain pronunciation of a certain character being referred to others.

=== Sign language ===
{{main|Taiwanese Sign Language}}Taiwan has a national [[sign language]], the [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] (TSL), which was developed from [[Japanese Sign Language]] during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]]. TSL has some [[Mutually intelligible languages|mutual intelligibility]] with Japanese Sign Language (JSL) and the [[Korean Sign Language]] as a result (KSL). TSL has about a 60% lexical similarity with JSL.<ref name="fisher501">Fischer, Susan ''et al.'' (2010).

=== Japanese ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The [[Japanese language]] was [[Compulsory education|compulsorily taught]] while [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]] (1895 to 1945). Although fluency is now largely limited to the elderly, most of Taiwan's youth who look to Japan as the trend-setter of the region's [[Youth culture|youth pop culture]] now might know a bit of Japanese through the [[Media of Taiwan|media]], their grandparents, or classes taken from private "[[Cram school#Taiwan|cram schools]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== South-East Asian languages ===
A significant number of immigrants and spouses in [[Taiwan]] are from [[South-East Asia]]. 
* '''[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]''': Indonesian is the most widely spoken language among the approximately 140,000 [[Indonesians in Taiwan]].
* '''[[Javanese language|Javanese]]''': Javanese is also spoken by [[Javanese people]] from Indonesia who are in Taiwan.
* '''[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]''': Tagalog is also widely spoken by [[Filipinos]] by the approximately 108,520 [[Filipinos in Taiwan]].
* '''[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]''': There are somewhere around 200,000 [[Vietnamese in Taiwan]], many of whom speak Vietnamese. There has been some effort, particularly beginning in 2011, to teach Vietnamese as a heritage language to children of Vietnamese immigrants.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01434632.2014.912284 | volume=36 | issue=3 | title=Learning Vietnamese as a heritage language in Taiwan | journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development | pages=255–265| year=2015 | last1=Yeh | first1=Yu-Ching | last2=Ho | first2=Hsiang-Ju | last3=Chen | first3=Ming-Chung }}</ref>

=== European languages ===
* '''[[Dutch language|Dutch]]''': Dutch was taught to the residents of the island during the [[Dutch colonial rule of Taiwan]]. After the withdrawal of Dutch presence in Taiwan, the use of the language disappeared.
*[[Spanish language|'''Spanish''']]: Spanish was mainly spoken by the northern part of the island during the establishment of a [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish colony in Formosa]] until 1642. Many of the countries that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan are Spanish-speaking.

=== Sino-Tibetan languages ===
* '''[[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]''': Cantonese is spoken by many recent and early immigrants from Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Macau. Various Cantonese-speaking communities exist throughout Taiwan, and the use of the language in Taiwan continues to increase. There are a reported 87,719 [[Hongkonger|Hongkongers]] residing in Taiwan as of the early 2010's,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1109891&ctNode=29699&mp=1 |title=臺灣地區居留外僑統計 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |work=統計資料 |publisher=內政部入出國及移民署 |date=December 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307172518/http://www.immigration.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1109891&ctNode=29699&mp=1 |archive-date=7 March 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> however it is likely that this number has increased significantly since.

=== English ===

*'''[[English language|English]]''': English is widely taught as a foreign language, with some large private schools providing English instruction. Taiwan's government proposed to make English a second official language by 2030.<ref> https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3952051</ref>
