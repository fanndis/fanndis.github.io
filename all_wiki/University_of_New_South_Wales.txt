UNSW is one of the founding members of the [[Group of Eight (Australian universities)|Group of Eight]], a coalition of Australian research-intensive universities, and of [[Universitas 21]], a global network of research universities. It has international exchange and research partnerships with over 200 universities around the world.

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:UNSW first council meeting.jpg|thumb|University council's first meeting in 1949]]
The origins of the university can be traced to the [[Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts]] established in 1833 and the Sydney Technical College established in 1878.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/sydney_technical_college|title=Sydney Technical College|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref> These institutions were established to meet the growing demand for capabilities in new technologies as the New South Wales economy shifted from its pastoral base to industries fueled by the industrial age.<ref name=":1" />

The idea of founding the university originated from the crisis demands of World War II, during which the nation's attention was drawn to the critical role that science and technology played in transforming an agricultural society into a modern and industrial one.<ref name="UNSW History1">O'Farrell, ''UNSW, a portrait: the University of New South Wales, 1949-1999'', UNSW Press, 1999, p. 15 {{ISBN|0-86840-417-9}}</ref> The post-war [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor government]] of New South Wales recognised the increasing need to have a university specialised in training high-quality engineers and technology-related professionals in numbers beyond that of the capacity and characteristics of the existing [[University of Sydney]].<ref name="UNSW History1" /> This led to the proposal to establish the Institute of Technology, submitted by the then-New South Wales [[List of New South Wales Government Agencies|Minister for Education]] [[Bob Heffron]], accepted on 9 July 1946.

The university, originally named the "New South Wales University of Technology", gained its statutory status through the enactment of the ''New South Wales University of Technology Act 1949 (NSW)'' by the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] in Sydney in 1949.

=== Early years ===
In March 1948, classes commenced with a first intake of 46 students pursuing programs including [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[mining engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]].<ref>{{cite web |title=University Official Records |publisher= University of New South Wales Records & Archives Office |url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/unitimelineexhibition/1949_1959.html#1949}}</ref> At that time, the thesis programs were innovative. Each course embodied a specified and substantial period of practical training in the relevant industry. It was also unprecedented for tertiary institutions at that time to include compulsory instruction in humanities.<ref name="UNSW History2">O'Farrell, ''UNSW, a portrait: the University of New South Wales, 1949-1999'', UNSW Press, 1999 at p33 {{ISBN|0-86840-417-9}}</ref>

Initially, the university operated from the inner [[Sydney Technical College]] city campus in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]] as a separate institution from the college. However, in 1951, the Parliament of New South Wales passed the ''New South Wales University of Technology (Construction) Act 1951 (NSW)'' to provide funding and allow buildings to be erected at the [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]] site where the university is now located.

===Expansion===
In 1958, the university's name was changed to the "University of New South Wales" to reflect its transformation from a technology-based institution to a generalist university. In 1960, it established faculties of [[UNSW Faculty of Arts|arts]] and [[UNSW Faculty of Medicine|medicine]] and shortly after decided to add the [[UNSW Faculty of Law|faculty of law]], which came into being in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/university-archives/online-archives-search/faculties-and-boards-studies |title=Faculties and Boards of Studies |work=UNSW Records and Archives Office |publisher=UNSW }}</ref>

The university's first director was [[Arthur Denning]] (1949–1952), who made important contributions to founding the university. In 1953, he was replaced by [[Philip Baxter]], who continued as vice-chancellor when this position's title was changed in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/vice-chancellor.html |title=University of New South Wales – UNSW Home – The Vice-Chancellors of the University of New South Wales Exhibition |publisher=Recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Baxter's dynamic, if authoritarian, management was central to the university's first 20 years. His visionary, but at times controversial, energies saw the university grow from a handful to 15,000 students by 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unsw.edu.au/about/pad/history.html |title=History &#124; The University of New South Wales |publisher=Unsw.edu.au |date=5 September 2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> The new vice-chancellor, [[Rupert Myers]] (1969–1981), brought consolidation and an urbane management style to a period of expanding student numbers, demand for change in university style, and challenges of student unrest.

The stabilising techniques of the 1980s managed by the vice-chancellor, [[Michael Birt (biochemist)|Michael Birt]] (1981–1992),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/vice-chancellor.html#birt |title=University of New South Wales – UNSW Home – The Vice-Chancellors of the University of New South Wales Exhibition |publisher=Recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> provided a firm base for the energetic corporatism and campus enhancements pursued by the subsequent vice-chancellor, [[John Niland]] (1992–2002). The 1990s had the addition of fine arts to the university. The university established colleges in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] (1951) and [[Wollongong]] (1961), which eventually became the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] and the [[University of Wollongong]] in 1965 and 1975, respectively.

The former St George Institute of Education (part of the short-lived [[Sydney College of Advanced Education]]) amalgamated with the university from 1 January 1990, resulting in the formation of a School of Teacher Education at the former SGIE campus at [[Oatley, New South Wales|Oatley]]. A School of Sports and Leisure Studies and a School of Arts and Music Education were also subsequently based at St George. The campus was closed in 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A569-SGIE.pdf | title=St George Institute of Education (SGIE), Sydney College of Advanced Education | publisher=UNSW University Archives | access-date=11 January 2019}}</ref>

===Recent history===
In 2012, private sources contributed 45% of the university's annual funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unsw.edu.au/about/pad/history.html |title=History – The University of New South Wales |publisher=unsw.edu.au |date=5 September 2012 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref>

The university is home to the [[Lowy Cancer Research Centre]], one of Australia's largest cancer-research facilities. The centre, costing $127 million, is Australia's first facility to bring together researchers in childhood and adult cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prime Minister opens Lowy Cancer Research Centre at the University of New South Wales|url=http://www.acrf.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Lowy_release_FINAL.pdf|publisher=Australian Cancer Research Foundation|access-date=28 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204093318/http://www.acrf.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Lowy_release_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=4 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/New-cancer-research-centre-for-Sydney/2007/06/25/1182623779331.html New cancer research centre for Sydney]", ''Sydney Morning Herald''. Retrieved on 23 July 2007.</ref>

In 2003, the university was invited by Singapore's [[Economic Development Board]] to consider opening a campus there. Following a 2004 decision to proceed, the first phase of a planned $200 m campus opened in 2007. Students and staff were sent home and the campus closed after one semester following substantial financial losses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/unsw-singapore-campus-doomed-to-fail/story-e6frgcjx-1111113831707 |title=UNSW Singapore campus doomed to fail |newspaper=The Australian |date= 27 June 2007|access-date=14 July 2013}}</ref>

In 2008, it collaborated with two other universities in forming [[The Centre for Social Impact]].  In 2019, the university moved to a trimester timetable as part of UNSW's 2025 Strategy. Under the trimester timetable, the study load changed from offering four subjects per 13-week semester, to three subjects per 10-week term. The change to trimesters has been widely criticised by staff and students as a money-making move, with little consideration as to the well-being of students.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/very-stressful-students-rebel-after-unsw-dumps-semesters-20190606-p51v8c.html|title='Very stressful': students rebel after UNSW dumps semester|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date= 6 June 2019|access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref>

In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, the University of New South Wales recorded the lowest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, with an overall satisfaction rating of 62.9, which was lower than the overall national average of 78.4.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Student Experience Survey |url=https://www.qilt.edu.au/docs/default-source/ses/ses-2019/2019-ses-national-report.pdf?sfvrsn=6486ec3c_10 |access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref> UNSW's low student satisfaction numbers for 2019 was attributed to the university's switch to a trimester system.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Jordan |title=UNSW students least satisfied in the country, survey shows |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/unsw-students-least-satisfied-in-the-country-due-to-trimesters-20200310-p548t0.html |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media |access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref>

On 15 July 2020, the university announced 493 job cuts and a 25 percent reduction in management due to the effects of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] and a $370 million budget shortfall.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brown|first=Natalie|date=2020-07-15|title=COVID-19 strikes again with more cuts|work=[[The Queensland Times]]|url=https://www.qt.com.au/news/covid-19-strikes-again-with-more-cuts/4057954/|access-date=2020-07-15}}</ref>

===Symbols===
The Grant of Arms was made by the [[College of Arms]] on 3 March 1952. The grant reads:
:''Argent on a Cross Gules a Lion passant guardant between four Mullets of eight points Or a Chief Sable charged with an open Book proper thereon the word "SCIENTIA" in letters also sable.''<ref>[http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/archive/historical/UNSWCalendar2002.pdf UNSW Calendar 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202051716/http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/archive/historical/UNSWCalendar2002.pdf |date=2 February 2017 }}, University of New South Wales, page 5, accessed 29 January 2017.</ref>
The lion and the four stars of the [[Southern Cross]] on the [[St George's Cross]] have reference to the [[Coat of arms of New South Wales|State of New South Wales]] which established the university; the open book with ''scientia'' ("knowledge") across its pages is a reminder of its purpose. The placement of ''scientia'' on the book was inspired by its appearance on the arms of the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine]] formed in 1907. Beneath the shield is the motto ''Manu et Mente'' ("With hand and mind"), which was the motto of the [[Sydney Technical College]] from which the university developed.<ref name=unswcoa>{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.unsw.edu.au/index.php/download_file/-/view/74|title=UNSW Symbol Guidelines|publisher=University of New South Wales|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118055659/http://www.facilities.unsw.edu.au/index.php/download_file/-/view/74|archive-date=18 January 2012}}</ref>

An update of the design and colours of the arms was undertaken in 1970, which provided a more contemporary design, yet retained all the arms' heraldic associations. In 1994, the university title was added to the UNSW arms, as was the abbreviation "UNSW", to create the UNSW symbol that is used for everyday and marketing purposes.<ref name=unswcoa/> In late 2013, the university launched a new change to the business name used in all branding and marketing as "UNSW Australia".<ref name =UA>{{cite web |title = Brand Fast Facts |url = http://www.marketingservices.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/Brand%20Fast%20Facts%20Dec%202013.pdf |website=marketingservices.unsw.edu.au |publisher=University of New South Wales |access-date=24 September 2014 |date=December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150301012930/http://www.marketingservices.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/Brand%20Fast%20Facts%20Dec%202013.pdf |archive-date=1 March 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In January 2017 this was changed again to "UNSW Sydney", with the ADFA Canberra campus changed to "UNSW Canberra". The official name of the university, which requires an amending [[act of Parliament]] to the [https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1989/125 University of New South Wales Act 1989] to alter, is unchanged.<ref name="styleguide">{{cite web |title=UNSW Product Style Guide |url=https://bacs.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/UNSW%20Product%20Style%20Guide.pdf |publisher=UNSW Sydney |access-date=17 April 2020 |date=2018}}</ref>

The [[ceremonial mace]] of the university is made of stainless steel with silver facings and a shaft of [[Acacia stenophylla|eumung]] timber. On the head are mounted four silver shields, two engraved with the [[Coat of arms of New South Wales|arms of the State of New South Wales]] and two with the original-design arms of the university. A silver [[Waratah]], NSW's floral emblem, surmounts the head. The mace was donated to the university by [[BHP Billiton|Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited]] and was presented by the company's chairman, [[Colin Syme]], on 6 December 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=Event Program – Presentation of the Mace|date=6 December 1962|publisher=University of New South Wales|url=http://encore.library.uow.edu.au/iii/cpro/app?id=2944366736812714&itemId=1002679&lang=eng&service=blob&suite=def|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118114329/http://encore.library.uow.edu.au/iii/cpro/app?id=2944366736812714&itemId=1002679&lang=eng&service=blob&suite=def|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 January 2015}}</ref> A former NSW Government Architect, [[New South Wales Government Architect##Cobden Parkes (1935 – 1958)|Cobden Parkes]], was appointed as the first official [[mace-bearer]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Farrell|first1=Patrick|title=UNSW, a Portrait: The University of New South Wales, 1949-1999|date=1999|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=Kensington|isbn=0-86840-417-9|page=5}}</ref>

==Campus==
{{See also|UNSW Venues}}[[File:Unsw quadrangle building 2010-05-11.jpg|thumb|right|Quadrangle Building]]The main UNSW campus, where most faculties are situated, is in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], Sydney. [[UNSW Art & Design]] is located in the inner suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], and UNSW Canberra at [[ADFA]] is situated in [[Canberra]].

The main UNSW campus is divided geographically into two areas: upper campus and lower campus. The lower campus area was vested in the university in two lots in December 1952 and June 1954. The upper campus area was vested in the university in November 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/kensington.html |title=University of New South Wales – Records and Archives Office – Development of UNSW Kensington Campus Exhibition |publisher=recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> These two are separated mainly by an elevation rise between the quadrangle and the Scientia building. Roughly 15 minutes are needed to walk from one extreme to the other.

The university also has additional campuses and field stations in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]], [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]], [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]], [[Dee Why, New South Wales|Dee Why]], [[Cowan, New South Wales|Cowan]], [[Manly Vale, New South Wales|Manly Vale]], [[Fowlers Gap, New South Wales|Fowlers Gap]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], [[Port Macquarie]], [[Coffs Harbour]], and [[Bankstown Airport, New South Wales|Bankstown Airport]].

===Arc @ UNSW Limited===
{{anchor|Arc @ UNSW Limited}}
[[File:ARC UNSW logo.png|thumb|right|upright=.9|ARC Logo]]
''Arc @ UNSW Limited'' is the [[Students' union|student organisation]] at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and is a [[Non-profit|not-for-profit]] [[public company]].

In 2005, the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] passed legislation making membership of student unions voluntary for the first time. This policy, known as [[voluntary student unionism]] (VSU), threatened the funding model behind the four UNSW student organisations with compulsory membership provisions.  A report commissioned by the university administration recommended that three of those organisations – the Student Guild of Undergraduates and Postgraduates, the University of New South Wales Union and the College of Fine Arts Students' Association – merge into a single student organisation, a structure in use at the [[University of Melbourne]].<ref>Alexander, Harriet (15 November 2006). [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/11/14/1163266550331.html 'Anger as student body agrees to university workplace deal']. ''Sydney Morning Herald''.</ref>
Arc was established on 15 August 2006 and launched early the following year, taking over the functions of three existing [[Students' union|student organisations]], the UNSW Student Guild, UNSW Union, and COFA Students' Association.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A358-Arc.pdf|publisher=UNSW University Archives |work=Agency details |title=Arc |date=10 May 2013 |access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref>

The organisation supports the activities of student clubs, student volunteer programs such as orientation week, student publications, two student galleries (Kudos Gallery and AD Space), and houses an elected [[student council|student representative council]]. Arc operates the [[Venues at the University of New South Wales#The Roundhouse|Roundhouse]] entertainment venue, The Whitehouse bar and café and the Graduation & Gift Store on UNSW's main campus in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]]. Arc also operates a student support service, providing legal and academic advocacy. Arc@UNSW exists independently from UNSW.

Arc has three constitutional student bodies: 
# the Student Development Committee (SDC) - supporting clubs, volunteer programs, courses and activities,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/get-involved/clubs-and-societies/student-development-committee-(sdc) |title=Student Development Committee |work=Arc |publisher=UNSW | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618183221/http://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/get-involved/clubs-and-societies/student-development-committee-%28sdc%29 | archive-date=18 June 2012}}</ref> 
# the Postgraduate Council (PGC) - representing the postgraduate community at UNSW<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/advice--representation/postgraduate-council |title=Postgraduate Council |work=Arc |publisher=UNSW |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017043312/http://arc.unsw.edu.au/advice--representation/postgraduate-council |archive-date=17 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and

The student organisation is a major service provider on campus, running a number of retail outlets, student media such as ''[[Tharunka]]'' and an entertainment venue, the [[Venues at the University of New South Wales#The Roundhouse|Roundhouse]]. The Arc Student Representative Council represents students to the university and nationally and fights for their rights. Arc also provides support and funding to university clubs and societies and runs student volunteer programs such as Orientation Week.

In 2007, the University of New South Wales Sports Association<ref>[http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/documents/A599-SportsAssociation.pdf ''SportsAssociation'']; [[PDF]]-format;</ref> and UNSW Lifestyle Centre merged to become UNSW Sport and Recreation then later absorbed into Arc @ UNSW to become Arc Sport.  It runs the external sporting facilities and services and supports the 30 UNSW affiliated sporting clubs that compete both at home and abroad.

===''Blitz''===
''Blitz'' is a student publication, published online by Arc @ UNSW, based at the University of New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web|work=UNSW A - Z Guide |publisher=UNSW |url=https://my.unsw.edu.au/student/atoz/Blitz.html |title=Blitz entry |access-date=31 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829005234/https://my.unsw.edu.au/student/atoz/Blitz.html |archive-date=29 August 2007}}</ref> ''Blitz'' under this name first appeared in session 2, 1988, but a similar "what's on" style publication had been issued by the then [[Source (UNSW)|University Union]] since the early 1970s. Initially it consisted of a simple sheet or two of paper, but it evolved into a magazine style format in session two 1994<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/unitimelineexhibition/1970s.html#1970 |title=University Timeline Exhibition: 1970s |work=Records and Archives Office |publisher=UNSW Archives |date=1 October 2013 |access-date=25 November 2013 }}</ref> when a former editor from another student publication on campus, ''[[Tharunka]]'', was hired to found a weekly "what's on" magazine. ''Blitz'' sometimes pays casual contributors for submitted articles and photographs, and employs a student online editor, a student designer, a student TV producer and a student radio producer.

''Blitz'' typically covers the goings-on around campus and conducts interviews and publishes stories relating to current student activities. It widely publicises Arc services and activities on campus. Due to its non-partisan policy, it does not cover political issues, with the exception of [[voluntary student unionism]]. However, in 2004 an edition of ''Blitz'' was withdrawn by the student union because it contained a guide to rolling a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. The editor Janet Duncan claimed there had been censorship of her editorial in the following issue.<ref>{{cite news |title=Student papers feel weight of censorship |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=16 November 2005 }}</ref> Arc @ UNSW announced that the organisation would continue to publish the magazine after the introduction of voluntary student unionism in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=What is VSU? |newspaper=B&T Magazine |date=17 November 2006 }}</ref>

===''Tharunka''===
{{Main|Tharunka}}
''Tharunka,'' meaning  "[[message stick]]" in the language of the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] local to the area, is a [[student newspaper]] originally published by the UNSW [[University of New South Wales Students' Union|Students Union]] from 1953 until 1992, when that body was replaced by the [[University of New South Wales Student Guild]]. The Guild published ''Tharunka'' from 1993 until 2006 and the successor student organisation, Arc @ UNSW Limited, continued the publication of ''Tharunka'' from 2007.

''Tharunka'' is managed by a small editorial team and actively solicits contributions from the UNSW student body. Including staff wages, the publication's budget is under $50,000 per year.<ref name="source.unsw.edu.au">{{cite web|author=O'Halloran, Brett |date=June 2005 |title=The Implications of Voluntary Student Unionism Legislation for UNSW: An Issues Paper with Recommendations |publisher=UNSW |access-date=13 November 2006 |url=http://www.source.unsw.edu.au/vsureport/Report_OHalloran.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105194634/http://www.source.unsw.edu.au/vsureport/Report_OHalloran.pdf |archive-date=5 January 2007 }}</ref>
