{{Politics of the United States}}
The '''president pro tempore of the United States Senate''' (often shortened to '''president pro tem''') is the second-highest-ranking official of the [[United States Senate]]. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section Three of the [[United States Constitution]] provides that the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president of the United States]] is the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|president of the Senate]] (despite not being a senator), and mandates that the Senate must choose a president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to act in the vice president's absence. Unlike the vice president, the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate, able to speak or vote on any issue. Selected by the Senate at large, the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/9|title=Pro Tem: Presidents Pro Tempore of the United States Senate since 1789|author1=Senate Historical Office|author2=With a preface by Senator [[Robert C.

==Power and responsibilities==

Although the position is in some ways analogous to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], the powers of the president pro tempore are far more limited. In the Senate, most power rests with party leaders and individual senators, but as the [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|chamber's presiding officer]], the president pro tempore is authorized to perform certain duties in the absence of the vice president, including ruling on [[point of order|points of order]].<ref name="SenPPT">{{cite web |title=President Pro Tempore |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/President_Pro_Tempore.htm |website=United States Senate |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment to the Constitution]], the president pro tempore and the speaker are the two authorities to whom declarations must be transmitted that the president is unable to perform the duties of the office, or is able to resume doing so.

==History==
===Position established===
The office of president pro tempore was established by the [[Constitution of the United States]] in 1789. Between 1792 and 1886, the president pro tempore was second in the line of [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential succession]], following the vice president and preceding the speaker. Through 1891, the president pro tempore was appointed on an intermittent basis only, when the vice president was not present to preside over the Senate, or at the adjournment of a session of Congress.<ref name="gp">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Hx/CongressionalLeadership.html|title=A Brief History of Congressional Leadership|author=Richard E. Berg-Andersson|date=June 7, 2001|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=November 17, 2009}}</ref> 

The first president pro tempore, [[John Langdon (politician)|John Langdon]], was elected on April 6, 1789,<ref name="SenPPT"/> serving four separate terms between 1789 and 1793. More than twelve senators{{clarify|date=January 2020}} held the office during the Senate's first decade,<ref name="Protem–1">{{cite book| title=Pro tem : presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate since 1789| editor-last=Erickson| editor-first=Nancy| publisher=U.S. Government Printing office| location=Washington, D.C.| date=August 22, 2008| isbn=978-0-16-079984-6| pages=[https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/7 7–10]| chapter=Chapter 1:The Formative Years, 1789–1860| chapter-url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CPUB-110spub18/pdf/GPO-CPUB-110spub18-1-6.pdf| accessdate=July 12, 2018| url=https://archive.org/details/protempresidents00wash/page/7}}</ref> presiding over sessions, signing legislation, and performing routine administrative tasks.

On three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:

*from November 25 to December 7, 1885, following the death of Vice President [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], until [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] was elected president pro tempore.<ref name="Protem–2"/>

When President [[Andrew Johnson]], who had no vice president, was [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached and tried]] in 1868, Senate President pro tempore [[Benjamin Wade|Benjamin Franklin Wade]] was next in line to the presidency. Wade's radicalism is thought by many historians to be a major reason why the Senate, which did not want to see Wade in the [[White House]], acquitted Johnson.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Gene|title=High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson|publisher=William Morrow & Company|year=1977|isbn=0-688-03072-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/highcrimesmisdem00smit}}</ref> The president pro tempore and the speaker of the House were removed from the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] in 1886. Both were restored to it in 1947, though this time with the president pro tempore following the speaker.<ref name="SenPPT"/>

[[William P. Frye]] served as president pro tempore from 1896 to 1911 (the [[Fifty-fourth United States Congress|54th]] through the [[Sixty-second United States Congress|62nd Congress]]), a tenure longer than anyone else. He resigned from the position due to ill health shortly before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult, as Senate Republicans, then in the majority, were split between [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] factions, each promoting its own candidate. Likewise, the Democrats proposed their own candidate. As a result of this three-way split, no individual received a majority vote. It took four months for a compromise solution to emerge: Democrat [[Augustus Octavius Bacon|Augustus Bacon]] served for a single day, August 14, 1911, during the vice president's absence. Thereafter, Bacon and four Republicans—[[Charles Curtis]], [[Jacob Harold Gallinger|Jacob Gallinger]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], and [[Frank B. Brandegee|Frank Brandegee]]—alternated as president pro tempore for the remainder of the Congress.<ref name="SenPPT"/>

===Modern era===
[[File:WHOportTyler.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.80|[[John Tyler]] is the only Senate president pro tempore to also become [[President of the United States]].]]
In January 1945, the [[79th United States Congress|79th Congress]] elected [[Kenneth McKellar (politician)|Kenneth McKellar]], who at the time was the [[Dean of the United States Senate|senator with the longest continuous service]], to be president pro tempore. Since then, it has become customary for the majority party's senior member to hold this position. [[Arthur H. Vandenberg|Arthur Vandenberg]] (from 1947 to 1949) was the last president pro tempore not to be the senior member of the majority party, aside from the single day in December 1980 accorded [[Milton Young]], who was the retiring senior member of the Republican Party, which would hold the majority in the incoming [[97th United States Congress|97th Congress]].<ref name=Davis2012/>

Three presidents pro tempore have gone on to be elected to the office of vice president—[[John Tyler]], [[William R. King]], and [[Charles Curtis]]—of whom Tyler is the only one to become president, assuming the office in April 1841 upon the death of [[William Henry Harrison]].

===Acting president pro tempore===
While the president pro tempore does have other official duties, the holders of the office have, like the vice president, over time ceased presiding over the Senate on a daily basis, owing to the mundane and ceremonial nature of the position.<ref name="gp" /> Furthermore, as the president pro tempore is now usually the most senior senator of the majority party, he most likely also chairs a major Senate committee and has other significant demands on his time. Therefore, the president pro tempore has less time now than in the past to preside daily over the Senate. Instead, junior senators from the majority party are designated acting president pro tempore to preside over the Senate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=Martin B. |last2=Gupta |first2=Dimple |title=The Constitutional Option to Change Senate Rules and Procedures: A Majoritarian Means to Over Come the Filibuster* |journal=Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy |volume=28 |issue=1 |page=211 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Gold_Gupta_JLPP_article.pdf}}</ref> This allows junior senators to learn proper parliamentary procedure.<ref name="cnn" />  The acting president pro tempore is usually reappointed daily by the president pro tempore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleI|title=APPOINTMENT OF A SENATOR TO THE CHAIR - Rules of the Senate - United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202190455/http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleI|archive-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref>

====Permanent acting president pro tempore====
In June 1963, because of the illness of president pro tempore [[Carl Hayden]], Senator [[Lee Metcalf]] was designated permanent acting president pro tempore. No term was imposed on this designation, so Metcalf retained it until he died in office in 1978.<ref name="HAO" />

===Deputy president pro tempore===
[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|[[Hubert Humphrey]] (D-[[List of United States senators from Minnesota|Minnesota]]) was the first Deputy President pro tempore in 1977–1978]]

The ceremonial post of deputy president pro tempore was created for [[Hubert Humphrey]], a former vice president, in 1977 following his losing bid to become the [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Senate majority leader]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualology.com/hallofusa/usvicepresidents/HUBERTHHUMPHREY.COM/ |title=Hubert H. Humphrey |year=2000 |work=virtualology.com |publisher=Evisum Inc. |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref> The Senate resolution creating the position stated that any former president or former vice president serving in the Senate would be entitled to this position. However, since Humphrey, none have served.<ref name="HAO" />

[[George J. Mitchell]] was elected deputy president pro tempore in 1987, because of the illness of president pro tempore [[John C. Stennis]], similar to Metcalf's earlier designation as permanent acting president pro tempore. The office has remained vacant since 1989 and no senator other than Humphrey and Mitchell has held it since its creation.<ref name="HAO" /> Mitchell is the only person to have served as deputy president pro tempore who was neither a former president nor former vice president of the United States.

The post is largely honorary and ceremonial, but comes with a salary increase. By statute, the compensation granted to the position holder equals the rate of annual compensation paid to the president pro tempore, majority leader, and [[Senate Minority Leader|minority leader]]. (See {{UnitedStatesCode|2|6112}}.)<ref name="HAO" />

===President pro tempore emeritus===
[[File:Leahy2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[List of United States senators from Vermont|Vermont]]), former president pro tempore, and current president pro tempore emeritus]]

Since 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore [[emeritus]] has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore. The position has been held by [[Strom Thurmond]] (R-[[List of United States senators from South Carolina|South Carolina]]) (2001–2003), [[Robert Byrd]] (D-[[List of United States senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]]) (2003–2007), [[Ted Stevens]] (R-[[List of United States senators from Alaska|Alaska]]) (2007–2009) and [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[List of United States senators from Vermont|Vermont]]) (2015–present).  From 2009 to 2015, no senator met the requirements for the position.

The position was created for Thurmond when the Democratic Party regained a majority in the Senate in June 2001.<ref>{{USBill|107|SRes|103}}, adopted, June 6, 2001. "Thanking and Electing Strom Thurmond President pro tempore emeritus."</ref> With the change in party control, Democrat [[Robert Byrd]] of [[List of United States senators from West Virginia|West Virginia]] replaced Thurmond as president pro tempore, reclaiming a position he had previously held from 1989 to 1995 and briefly in January 2001. Thurmond's retirement from the Senate on January 3, 2003, coincided with a change from Democratic to Republican control, making Stevens president pro tempore and Byrd the second president pro tempore emeritus. Byrd returned as president pro tempore, and Stevens became the third president pro tempore emeritus, when the Democrats gained control of the Senate in 2007.<ref name="HAO" /> While a president pro tempore emeritus has no official duties, he is entitled to an increase in staff<ref>{{USC|2|6115}}, amended 2003</ref> and advises party leaders on the functions of the Senate.

The office's accompanying budget increase was removed toward the end of the [[113th Congress]], shortly before Patrick Leahy was to become the first holder of the title in six years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lesniewski|first1=Niels|title=Leahy: 'Kind of Petty' Not to Fund Emeritus Office in 'Cromnibus{{'-}}|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/leahy-kind-of-petty-not-to-fund-emeritus-office-cromnibus/|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=[[CQ Roll Call]]|date=December 10, 2014}}</ref>

==Salary==
The salary of the president pro tempore for 2012 was $193,400, equal to that of the majority leaders and minority leaders of both houses of Congress. If there is a vacancy in the office of vice president, then the salary would be the same as that of the vice president, $230,700.<ref name="HAO" />
