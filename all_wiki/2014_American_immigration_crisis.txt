The '''2014 American immigration crisis''' was a surge in unaccompanied children and women from the [[Northern Triangle of Central America]] (NTCA) seeking [[Immigration to the United States | entrance to the United States]] in 2014. According to U.S. law, an unaccompanied alien child refers to a person under 18 years of age, who has no lawful immigration status in the U.S., and who does not have a legal guardian to provide physical custody and care.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=6-USC-2020131692-1066548987&term_occur=1&term_src=title:6:chapter:1:subchapter:IV:part:E:section:279|title=unaccompanied alien child

==Background==
[[File:Central America's Northern Triangle (orthographic projection).png|thumb|The Northern Triangle is composed of these three countries that had the most children leave in 2014: Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador]]
[[File:CentralAmerica'sNorthernTriangleTrianguloNorteDeCentroamerica.png|thumb|'''Central America's Northern Triangle''' or the '''Northern Triangle of Central America''' (Sp:'''Triangulo Norte De Centroamerica''') is a region in Central America composed of three countries which are Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. These countries share a trijunction tripoint border area and are characterized with sharing similar original classical Central American culture, history, society and politics]]From 1980 onwards, the number of immigrants from Central America arriving to the United States has grown substantially. However, most of the people fleeing Central America are those whose countries are plagued by corruption, poverty, and murder. The three countries from Central America with the highest numbers of migrants are Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Other immigrants from different countries in Central America have seen a moderate decrease from 2010 to 2013.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/central-american-immigrants-united-states|title=Central American Immigrants in the United States|first=Jeanne Batalova, Jessica Bolter Allison O’Connor, Jeanne Batalova, and Jessica|last=Bolter|date=August 12, 2019|website=migrationpolicy.org}}</ref> For example, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, and Belize have not had as many immigrants as the other three leading countries in the time frame.

In 2014, the reason this crisis was internationally covered by media outlets, was due to the fact that most of the immigrants were children. Most of these children cross through the [[Guatemala–Mexico border|Guatemala-Mexico border]]. Most of these children also ride on a train called [[El tren de la muerte|"La Bestia"]] because it can transport many people at once without charge. Immigrants from all over Central America rely on this train to take them north, hopeful to see the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican-American border]]. However, La Bestia has drawn international attention. This train and its routes are the epicenter of mass extortion, mutilation, murder, robberies, rape, kidnapping, and sexual assault of Central American immigrants. Immigrants do not report these crimes in fear of being deported back to their native countries. If these immigrant children managed to survive La Bestia and the cartels in Mexico, they now need to find [[Coyotaje|"coyotes]]" to smuggle them across the highly guarded Mexican-American border.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/06/05/318905712/riding-the-beast-across-mexico-to-the-u-s-border|title=Riding 'The Beast' Across Mexico To The U.S. Border|last=Wilson|first=Sayre|date=June 5, 2014|website=National Public Radio|access-date=March 22, 2017}}</ref>

Most women and children from Central America simply crossed the [[Rio Grande]] and turned themselves in to the [[United States Border Patrol]], relying on the belief, partly well founded,<ref name="NYT791422">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/us/immigrant-surge-rooted-in-law-to-curb-child-trafficking.html|title=Immigrant Surge Rooted in Law to Curb Child Trafficking|author1=Carl Hulse|date=July 9, 2014|work=New York Times|author1-link=Carl Hulse}}</ref> that United States immigration and refugee law made special provision for children.

[[File:Mexico train surfing migrants 3.jpg|left|thumb|Immigrants jumping on "La Bestia" that will take them to the Mexican-American border.]] The 2014 uptick in immigration was largely due to a surge in arrivals of [[unaccompanied minor|Unaccompanied Minor Children (UAC's)]], predominately from the [[Northern Triangle of Central America]]. Between 2013 and 2014, the number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border increased nearly 80%, from 38,759 in fiscal year 2013 to 68,541 in fiscal year 2014.<ref name="auto4"/> This influx in unaccompanied minor children has been attributed to a number of factors including the high rates of gang-related violent crime in the [[Northern Triangle of Central America|Northern Triangle]];<ref name="auto1"/> the promulgation of false "permiso" rumors by [[coyote (person)|smugglers]];<ref name="auto3"/><ref name="LA Times"/><ref name="The Economist"/> the growing awareness of H.R.7311 (110th), a 2008 law that granted substantial protections from removal to unaccompanied children from countries that do not share a border with the US;<ref name="NYT - H.R.7311"/><ref name="ACLU - H.R.7311"/><ref name="CNN - H.R.7311 (110th)"/> and a recovering US economy and labor market following the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]].<ref name="auto"/>

In a [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] study of approximately 400 unaccompanied children from Mexico and Central America, 58 percent of UAC's reported being motivated by safety concerns back home, a nearly 450% increase over the 13 percent of Mexican children that reported similar motivations in a 2006 study.<ref name="auto2">Nazario, Sonia.

Although the homicide rates in all three countries had been on the decline since 2011, the murder rates El Salvador and Honduras remained among the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|highest in the world]]. In early 2014, El Salvador experienced another uptick in violence after a gang truce between [[MS-13]] and [[18th Street gang|Barrio 18]] began to collapse. 

Many of the unaccompanied children reported being under the false impression that the Obama Administration was granting permits ("permisos") to children with family members in the US, as long as they arrived by June of 2014.<ref name="auto1"/> It was later determined that these rumors, along with similar rumors about permisos for women who arrived with children, were being promulgated by [[coyote (person)|human smugglers]].<ref name="LA Times"/> While the rumors were false, there were in fact a number of policies in place that offered protection from removal to unaccompanied children from Central America. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a 2008 law intended to protect victims of human trafficking, prevented the immediate deportation of unaccompanied children from Central America. In addition to requiring that the government provide each child with legal representation<ref name="ACLU - H.R.7311"/> and hold hearings on their case, the law also requires that children be released to family members or cared for by the [[Office of Refugee Resettlement]] in the "least restrictive" accommodations possible while their case winds through the courts. The large backlog of cases meant many children would wait several years before receiving their first hearing, and many more before their cases were fully adjudicated, during which they would be allowed to remain in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's Causing The Latest Immigration Crisis?

It has also been suggested that some of the new arrivals incorrectly believed that they would be allowed to apply for [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|DACA]], a 2012 policy that offers protection from deportation for certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. <ref name="auto4"/>

For women, as crime increased in the last decade, sexual assault and rape have become a prevalent issue in the [[Northern Triangle]] as well. In 2014, 40 percent of the people fleeing were women compared to a low 27 percent in recent times.<ref name="auto2"/> The [[United Nations special rapporteur|United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on Violence Against Women showed that in July 2014,  the violent death of women in Honduras shot up at an alarming rate of 263.4 from 2005 to 2013, fueling the migration of women. In 2013, 95 percent of the cases for these women go unsolved and women leaving Honduras also face the same risks on their journey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/talking_points_and_stories|title=Thousands of Girls and Women are Fleeing Rape, Sexual Violence and Torture in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala {{!}} UC Hastings Center for Gender and Refugee Studies|website=cgrs.uchastings.edu|access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>

Organized crime and drug-related violence in these countries have also increased danger for the people living in these areas. Since the 1980s, Colombian smugglers have used Central America, specifically, Honduras as a corridor to the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Mark B.|date=1988|title=Narcos and Politicos: The Politics of Drug Trafficking in Honduras|jstor=165984|journal=Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs|volume=30|issue=2/3|pages=143–165|doi=10.2307/165984}}</ref> Children in schools are forced to smuggle drugs as drug traffickers infiltrate schools.

In addition to violence and crime, food shortages and malnutrition continue to plague the region. It is estimated that half of Guatemalan children are chronically malnourished, resulting in stunted growth and eventually death. While these countries have some of the greatest potential for economic growth, inequality and general incompetency by the government has left these issues either under served or unaddressed completely.<ref name="The Economist2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2009/08/27/a-national-shame|title=A national shame|date=2009-08-27|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-05-21|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

In October 2014, immigrant rights groups filed Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") litigation to compel the release of documents regarding the use of the expedited removal process against families with children, including those detained at the family detention center in Artesia, New Mexico.

=== U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America ===

While the U.S. had numerous domestic policies for dealing with the massive rise in immigration, on July 8, 2014 President Obama also requested funding for "the repatriation and reintegration of migrants to countries in Central America and to address the root causes of migration from these countries." This announcement was the start of a long term U.S. plan to address three "areas of action": security, governance, and prosperity.<ref name="State Department 22">{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/wha/rt/strat/index.htm|title=U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America|website=2009-2017.state.gov}}</ref> Congress has so far granted $1.4 billion contingent on these Central American countries meeting security, corruption, and human rights requirements to receive assistance. When funding was first appropriated for these countries, funding was split fairly evenly between addressing economic and civil concerns and "rule of law" concerns regarding police and judicial institutions. So far none of these countries have met all of the legislative requirements to receive all of the funding allotted to them.<ref name="crsreport2">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44812.pdf |title=Info |publisher=fas.org |accessdate=2019-11-16}}</ref>

In a statement made on the inauguration of Jimmy Morales as the President of Guatemala, the Obama administration addressed certain criteria that the Northern Triangle countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala) would be expected to uphold in order to receive assistance from the United States. These criteria were: Combat corruption and strengthen public institutions, improve civilian jurisdiction and counter activities of criminal organizations, protect human rights, support programs to promote equitable growth, implement effective civil society consultations, and increase government revenues. These criteria have reflected long-standing obstacles for prosperity in these countries, particularly those relating to equality, human rights, and collecting government revenues needed to fund police.<ref name="obamafactsheet2">{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/15/fact-sheet-united-states-and-central-america-honoring-our-commitments|title=FACT SHEET: The United States and Central America: Honoring Our Commitments|date=January 14, 2016|website=whitehouse.gov}}</ref>

While funding for these efforts has been fairly consistent the past two years, the FY2018 budget proposed by President Trump would cut aid to these countries by roughly 30%. It is hard to know what the full implications of this cut to funding would be, but experts have claimed that it would most likely result in [[Democratic backsliding|backsliding]] of any progress made in the governance of these countries.<ref name="crsreport2" />

=== Detention centers ===
[[File:Immigrant Children in Detention Centers 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Unaccompanied minors held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]
One cause of the influx of immigrants with children was word of mouth in Central America that families with children were not detained due to lack of facilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Detention centers with facilities for families with children were built in [[Artesia, New Mexico]], a temporary site that closed in December 2014; one in [[Dilley, Texas]], that is managed by [[Corrections Corporation of America]] and located across 50 acres with a capacity of 2,400 migrants; [[Karnes City, Texas]], with a capacity of 530 people; and a small facility in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]]. The facility in Dilley includes barrack-style housing, a school, a medical clinic, and other facilities. However, migrants in the detention centers were refused bond in order to deter other migrants. In February 2015, a federal court, in a case under appeal, forbade use of deterrence of others as a consideration in refusing bond. [[Jeh Johnson]], Secretary of Homeland Security issued new regulations easing requirements for bonding out reducing the average stay in the facility to 22 days, and some detainees who have been detained 6 months or longer have been released. Johnson believes maintaining some capacity to detain families is necessary to maintain deterrence.<ref name="NYT614152">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/15/us/texas-detention-center-takes-toll-on-immigrants-languishing-there.html|title=Hope and Despair as Families Languish in Texas Immigration Centers|author1=Julia Preston|date=June 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref>

=== From migrants' home countries ===

While acknowledging suggestions that [[immigration reform]] may have helped prompt the influx of child migrants, the Obama administration has also focused attention on measures to be taken by the migrants' home countries to try to stop the flow. In July 2014, President Obama met with the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to seek their cooperation in reducing migration of children and expediting returns. In the summer of 2014, Mexico took actions to keep migrants from using freight trains ("[[El tren de la muerte|La Bestia]]") to travel through Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3929|title=Children, Obama Delays Action|work=Migration News|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-today/contemporary-recent-migration-travel/|title=Migrant Travel Today|publisher=Migration as a Travel Business|quote=Migrants on 'La Bestia' train.}}</ref><ref name="LAT97142">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-mexico-migrants-crackdown-20140907-story.html#page=1|title=Mexico crackdown keeps migrants off trains known as 'La Bestia'|author1=Tracey Wilkenson|date=September 7, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> As of February, 2015, the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the U.S. border, 12,509, during the previous 5 months had dropped while the number deported by Mexico to their home countries, 3,819, had risen by 56% year on year from the same period in fiscal year 2014.

=== From migrants ===

Since the placement of restrictions on illegal immigration through policies pursued by the [[Trump Administration|Trump]] administration, the movement of people from Central America to the United States has shifted to Mexico. The role of Mexico as a transit country between the Northern Triangle and the United States has transformed since the 2016 Presidential election with more people applying for asylum in Mexico than in the U.S. According to a Reuters report, "Mexican asylum data and testimony from migrants in Tenosique suggest that although fewer Central Americans are trying to enter the United States, plenty are still fleeing their poor, violent home countries, with many deciding to stay longer in Mexico, which has traditionally been a transit country."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-central-america/spooked-by-trump-central-american-immigrants-turn-to-mexico-idUSKBN1811BA|title=Spooked by Trump, Central American immigrants turn to Mexico|date=May 5, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
After the 2014 immigration crisis in America, the influx of immigrants from Central America to the United States continued but in lower proportions. Over the early 2010s America and Mexico presented consistent pushback to all immigrants from Central America. America and Mexico both also showed no immediate immigration policy changes even with the crisis. The United States and Mexico have [[Militarized|militarized borders]] and dissuaded immigrants from making the journey as of 2014.<ref name="Martin22"/>

However Central American families and children keep on coming to borders seeking asylum. In the aftermath, the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]] and the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Patrol (CBP)]] detainment of Central American people in the Mexican-American borders increased over 100 percent from late 2015 to early 2016 compared the year before. Also, United States government ordered for the [[deportation]] in 7,700 in 2014 to 2015 without court-hearings. However, there are 62,000 children still awaiting legal proceedings after 2014. In most cases, 94 percent of these children do not have attorneys to represent them in court. However, people from the Northern Triangle continue to immigrate despite the militarization of the CBP, increase in deportations, and the dangerous journey because their homes remain unsafe.<ref name="Martin22" />

== Other issues ==

=== Scamming of relatives ===

On July 23, 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that [[Confidence trick|con artists]] had [[fraud]]ulently obtained confidential information about child immigrants held at military bases in Oklahoma and Texas and had been contacting the children's parents asking for money to facilitate release of the children and reunification with their family. No money is actually required. The matter was reported to be under investigation by the [[FBI]].<ref name="NYT723142">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/world/americas/swindles-target-kin-of-migrants.html|title=Swindlers Target Kin of Migrants|author1=Frances Robles|date=July 23, 2014|work=the New York Times|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}</ref>

=== Trafficking and abuse of migrant children resettled by federal officials ===

In July 2015, a federal indictment revealed a forced-labor ring operating on an egg farm near Marion, Ohio, in which teenagers from Guatemala were being lured with promises of education and then forced to work 12-hour days, six or seven days a week. The teens lived in squalid trailers, were denied their paychecks and threatened with death if they sought help.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/07/13/Portman-demands-child-smuggling-answers.html|title=Portman demands answers on teen-smuggling ring|website=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2016-01-31}}</ref> At least half a dozen of the teenagers found working on the farm had been in the custody of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]' (HHS) [[Office of Refugee Resettlement]], which is charged with the processing, treatment, and placement of unaccompanied migrant children pending the resolution of immigration proceedings. Government officials placed the teens with human traffickers who posed as relatives and friends. Concerns that the Ohio case was indicative of larger, systemic problems led to a Senate inquiry into how human traffickers successfully exploited the federal resettlement processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ohio-immigrant-sponsor-20151115-story.html|title=Is Ohio case of migrant youth trafficking evidence of a 'systemic problem'?|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-01-31}}</ref>

HHS officials failed to run background checks on the sponsors and any secondary caregivers in the households, site visits to the sponsors' homes were not conducted, and in one instance a sponsor was permitted to prevent a child-welfare case worker from visiting with one of the victims.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|url=http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/adequacy-of-the-department-of-health-and-human-services-efforts-to-protect-unaccompanied-alien-children-from-human-trafficking|title=Majority and Minority Staff Report - Protecting Unaccompanied Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses: The Role of the Office of Refugee Resettlement|website=hsgac.senate.gov|access-date=2016-01-31}}</ref> System-wide, the Senate inquiry found similar, serious gaps including weak processes for verifying relationships between children and sponsors, failure to perform background checks, lack of home visits and home studies, and the placement of children without meeting sponsors in person. Other key deficiencies in HHS policies and procedures were an inability to detect when a sponsor is seeking custody of multiple unrelated children and allowing sponsors to deny HHS from providing post-release services to children and barring contact between HHS care providers and the children.

Ultimately, the inquiry concluded that the policies for placing unaccompanied minors exposed them to a risk of trafficking and other abuse at the hands of government-approved sponsors. The Subcommittee identified more than 10 other cases of post-placement trafficking beyond the Ohio case and 15 additional cases with "serious trafficking indicators."<ref name=":02" /> It is unclear how many other unaccompanied minors, placed by HHS, have been victims of trafficking or other abuses. HHS maintains no standardized mechanism of tracking trafficking or abuse cases. However, the findings of the Senate investigation echoed results of an independent investigation by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) in which the AP found more than two dozen children who had been placed with sponsors and subjected to sexual abuse, starvation, labor trafficking, or severe abuse and neglect.<ref name=":12">{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cc07b82ec58145cca37d6ff952f334c1/ap-investigation-feds-failures-imperil-migrant-children|title=AP INVESTIGATION: Feds' failures imperil migrant children|website=The Big Story|language=en-US|access-date=2016-01-31}}</ref>

On January 25, 2016, the AP reported that in response to surges in the number of unaccompanied minors arriving in the U.S. in the past three years, government officials weakened safety standards related to the transfer of children from government shelters into sponsors' homes and the vetting of sponsors. Specifically, the government stopped fingerprinting most adults seeking to claim the children. In April 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettlement also stopped requiring original copies of birth certificates to prove the identity of most sponsors and later it decided not to complete forms that request sponsors' personal and identifying information before sending many of the children to sponsors' homes.<ref name=":12" />

Although the number of unaccompanied youth arriving from Central America declined significantly in 2015, with a 49% drop in the first 8 months of the year when compared to that same period in 2014, the number of young migrants is again on the rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R43599.pdf|title=Unaccompanied Alien Children: An Overview|last=Kandel|first=William|date=August 18, 2015|publisher=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> HHS officials stated that they are strengthening their policies and procedures for placing children and have signed a contract to open more shelters; however, they remain under pressure from the Senate Subcommittee and advocates to both account for documented failings and address their causes.<ref name=":12" />

=== Refugees vs. immigrants terminology ===
In the discussion on the influx of Central Americans into the United States the terms "[[refugee]]" and "[[immigrant]]" have been used interchangeably or synonymously to represent Central Americans entering the country, despite the different legal ramifications of the two terms. The difference in the usage of these terms comes from the different perspectives on the factors motivating movement to the United States, with "push" factors being associated with the terminology of "refugee" and "pull" factors being associated with the terminology of "immigrant". According to Karen Musalo and Eunice Lee,

<blockquote>For those adopting the "push" factor outlook, the crisis is humanitarian one, reflecting human rights violations and deprivations in the region, and the protection needs of refugees (UNHCR 2015b; UNHCR 2014; Musalo et al. 2015) While acknowledging that reasons for migration may be mixed, this view recognizes the seriousness of regional refugee protection needs. For those focusing on "pull" factors, the crisis has its roots in border enforcement policies that were perceived as lax by potential migrants, and that thereby acted as an inducement to migration (Harding 2014; Navarette, Jr. 2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Musalo|first=Karen|last2=Lee|first2=Eunice|date=2017-03-01|title=Seeking a Rational Approach to a Regional Refugee Crisis: Lessons from the Summer 2014 "Surge" of Central American Women and Children at the US-Mexico Border|url=https://doaj.org/|journal=Journal on Migration and Human Security|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=137–179|issn=2330-2488|doi=10.1177/233150241700500108|doi-access=free}}</ref></blockquote>
