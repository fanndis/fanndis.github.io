The footage was taken on June 2 from 2:13 a.m. to 2:16 a.m. All suspects in the video had their faces concealed. Six wore masks, and one had a white shirt wrapped around his face and head. At least two of the men were seen armed with handguns. One person pulled his handgun to target the entrance before joining the others. Another suspect had a cut on his left palm. The reward for additional information that could capture the criminals has been raised by $6,000 since the surveillance video's release.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" />

On June 7, a 24-year-old suspect named Stephan Cannon was arrested. He faces charges of [[first-degree murder]], robbery, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.<ref name="time" /> As of June 18, a total of six persons has been charged, two for murder and four for burglary and stealing.

== Aftermath ==
A small memorial was quickly set up outside the shop, with a handwritten sign stating; "Y'all killed a black man because 'they' killed a black man??? Rest in peace." St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden ordered all the departments officers to wear black mourning bands on their police badges to honor Dorn.<ref name=":3" />

Several [[GoFundMe]] fundraisers quickly sprang up online, although none of them were endorsed by family members. A [[Fundly]] account has been endorsed by the family and they have asked for support of organizations such as CrimeStoppers or [[BackStoppers]].<ref name=":3" />

Dorn's widow, Ann Dorn, spoke in favor of [[Donald Trump]] at the [[2020 Republican National Convention]] with David's two sons Brian and Kielen Powell at her side.  

The officer's daughters, Debra White and Lisa Dorn,  called Ann Dorn and asked her not to speak about their father at the convention and told the ''[[St. Louis American]]'' that their father was a registered Democrat and did not support Trump. "She can be a Trump supporter in her own right, but she should not politicize our father's death for Trump's agenda. He thought Trump is doing many things to ruin our country," Lisa Dorn told the paper. Debra White told the paper that her father opposed much of Trump's rhetoric and policies, including "the things he said about [[Colin Kaepernick]], the [[Trump administration family separation policy|kids locked up in cages]], the racist remarks." Dorn's daughters stated their father did not want to support the "law and order agenda".<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Chris|title=David Dorn’s daughters oppose father’s widow speaking at RNC|url=http://www.stlamerican.com/news/national_news/david-dorn-s-daughters-oppose-father-s-widow-speaking-at-rnc/article_da760964-e7fe-11ea-81fd-8f15f591da91.html|access-date=2020-08-28|website=[[St. Louis American]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Daughters of slain police officer featured at RNC speak out|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPf613KCC0|access-date=2020-08-28|publisher=[[CNN]]|language=en}}</ref>

== Reactions ==
His widow, Ann Marie Dorn, told reporters that her husband was a friend of the owner of the store and would routinely check on the business when the alarm would go off.<ref name=":2" />  She later spoke at the [[2020 Republican National Convention]] about her husband's death, over the objections of their daughters who claimed he was opposed to Donald Trump.<ref>{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Chris |title=David Dorn’s daughters oppose father’s widow speaking at RNC |url=http://www.stlamerican.com/news/national_news/david-dorn-s-daughters-oppose-father-s-widow-speaking-at-rnc/article_da760964-e7fe-11ea-81fd-8f15f591da91.html |accessdate=28 August 2020 |work=St. Louis American |date=26 August 2020}}</ref>
 
The former St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Finch called Dorn a "true public servant".<ref name=":3" />

Missouri Governor [[Mike Parson]] tweeted that Dorn and [[George Floyd]] should not have died, saying that the ensuing violence and criminal activity needed to stop.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bonvillian|first=Crystal|date=June 3, 2020|title=Retired police captain killed on Facebook Live while protecting friend's pawn shop |url=https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/retired-police-captain-killed-facebook-live-while-protecting-friends-pawn-shop/AI3DM5AH7FE25AKZ7A6WVLFVFY/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609210626/https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/retired-police-captain-killed-facebook-live-while-protecting-friends-pawn-shop/AI3DM5AH7FE25AKZ7A6WVLFVFY/|archive-date=June 9, 2020|access-date=2020-06-07 |publisher=[[KIRO-TV]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

The Ethical Society of the Police, an organization which supports black police officers in the United States, tweeted "(Dorn) was murdered by looters at a pawnshop. He was the type of brother that would've given his life to save them if he had to. Violence is not the answer, whether it's a citizen or officer. RIP Captain!"<ref name=":0" />
