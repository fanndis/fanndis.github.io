Voter turnout was the lowest ever in parliamentary elections.<ref>{{Cite web|title=India: parliamentary elections Lok Sabha, 1991|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2145_91.htm|access-date=2020-09-06|website=archive.ipu.org}}</ref> No party could muster a majority in the Lok Sabha, hence INC formed a minority government with the support of other parties, resulting in a stable government for the next 5 years under the new Prime Minister [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]].

==Background==
The 1991 Indian general election were held as the previous Lok Sabha, with Chandra Sekhar at its helm had been dissolved just 16 months after government formation. The elections were held in a polarised environment and are also referred to as the 'Mandal-Mandir' elections after the two most important poll issues, the [[Mandal Commission]] fallout and the [[Ayodhya debate|Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue]].

===Mandal-Mandir Issue===

While the [[Mandal Commission]] report implemented by the VP Singh government gave 27 per cent reservation to the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) in government jobs, it led to widespread violence and protests across the country, with many students in and around Delhi even setting themselves on fire. Mandir represented the hallmark of this election, where there was a debate over the disputed Babri Masjid structure at Ayodhya, which the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] was using as its major election [[manifesto]].

The [[Ayodhya debate|Mandir]] issue led to numerous riots in many parts of the country and the electorate was polarised on caste and religious lines. With the [[National Front (India)|National Front]] falling apart, the Congress managed to make the most of the polarisation, by getting the most seats and forming a minority government.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-04-06|title=History Revisited: How political parties fared in 1991 Lok Sabha election|url=https://zeenews.india.com/lok-sabha-general-elections-2019/history-revisited-how-political-parties-fared-in-1991-lok-sabha-election-2193229.html|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Zee News|language=en}}</ref>

===Rajiv Gandhi Assassination===
A day after the first round of polling took place on 20 May, former prime minister [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated]] while campaigning for [[Margatham Chandrasekar]] at [[Sriperumbudur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Sriperembudur]]. The remaining election days were postponed until mid-June and voting finally took place on 12 and 15 June. Voting was the lowest ever in parliamentary elections with just 53 per cent of the electorate exercising their right to vote.

Since the assassination took place after first phase of polling in 211 of 534 constituencies and the balance constituencies went to polls after the assassination, the 1991 results varied greatly between phases. The congress party did poorly in the pre-assassination constituencies and swept the post-assassination constituencies. The end result was a Congress-led minority government led by [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]], who had previously announced his retirement from politics.

=== Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab ===
76 to 126 people were shot dead during campaign on 17 June 1991 in two attacks by gunmen in Punjab, an area racked by separatist violence. Police reports said the killings, on separate trains, were carried out by Sikh militants.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Crossette|first=Barbara|date=1991-06-17|title=Party of Gandhi Narrowly Ahead in India Election|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/17/world/party-of-gandhi-narrowly-ahead-in-india-election.html|access-date=2020-09-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> No elections were held in [[Indian general election, 1991 (Jammu and Kashmir)|Jammu and Kashmir]] and Punjab, a total of 19 Lok Sabha seats.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/once-upon-a-poll-tenth-lok-sabha-elections-1991/|title=Once Upon a Poll: Tenth Lok Sabha Elections (1991)|date=21 March 2014|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Elections were held in Punjab on 19 February 1992,<ref>{{Cite web|first=Ramesh |last=Vinayak|title=With militant scare and Akali boycott, Punjab elections may be a damp squib|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19920229-with-militant-scare-and-akali-boycott-punjab-elections-may-be-a-damp-squib-765888-2013-06-24|orig-date=February 29, 1992|date=September 3, 2013|access-date=2020-09-06|website=India Today|language=en}}</ref> where INC won 12 out of 13 seats,<ref>{{Cite web|title=1992 India General Elections Results|url=https://www.elections.in/parliamentary-constituencies/1992-election-results.html|access-date=2020-09-06|website=www.elections.in}}</ref> thereby taking their tally in the Lok Sabha up from 232 to 244.{{Politics of India}}
