'''Sanjay Gandhi''' (14 December 1946 – 23 June 1980)<ref name="Dommermuth-Costa 60"/> was an Indian [[politician]] and the son of [[Indira Gandhi]]. He was a member of the [[Nehru–Gandhi family]]. During his lifetime he was widely expected to succeed his mother as head of the [[Indian National Congress]], but following his early death in a plane crash his elder brother [[Rajiv Gandhi|Rajiv]] became their mother's political heir, and succeeded her as [[Prime Minister of India]] after [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|her assassination]]. His wife [[Maneka Gandhi]] and son [[Varun Gandhi]] are leading politicians in the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Rajiv, Indira and Sanjay Gandhi.jpg|thumb|left|Rajiv, Indira and Sanjay Gandhi]]
Sanjay was born in [[New Delhi]], on 14 December 1946, as the younger son of Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi. Like his elder brother [[Rajiv Gandhi]], Sanjay was educated at [[St. Columba's School, Delhi]],  [[Welham Boys' School]], [[Dehra Dun]] and then at the [[Doon School]], [[Dehra Dun]]. Sanjay was also educated at the [[Ecole d'Humanité|Ecole D'Humanité]], an international boarding school in Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Singh|first=Rani|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_g67qLkXfgC&q=ecole+circle+ecole+d%27humanit%C3%A9&pg=PT26|title=Sonia Gandhi: An Extraordinary Life, An Indian Destiny|date=13 September 2011|publisher=St. Martin's Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-230-34053-4|language=en}}</ref> Sanjay did not attend university, but took up automotive engineering as a career and underwent an apprenticeship with [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] in [[Crewe]], [[England]] for three years.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D8gNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KXQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7384,4647920&dq=feroze-gandhi&hl=en First Woman of India] ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', 10 January 1966.</ref><ref name="motoroids_Maruti">{{cite news|url=http://www.motoroids.com/features/maruti-and-sanjay-gandhi-the-history-of-an-illicit-extraordinary-love-affair/|title=Maruti and Sanjay Gandhi: The history of an illicit, extraordinary love affair|publisher=Motoroids}}</ref> He was very interested in sports cars, and also obtained a pilot's licence in 1976.

==Maruti Limited controversy==
In 1971, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Cabinet proposed the production of a "People's car": an efficient indigenous car that middle-class Indians could afford. In June 1971, a company known as Maruti Motors Limited (now [[Maruti Suzuki]]) was incorporated under the Companies Act and Sanjay Gandhi became its Managing Director.<ref name="motoroids_Maruti"/> While Sanjay had no previous experience, design proposals or links with any corporation, he was awarded the contract to build the car and the exclusive production licence. The criticism that followed this decision was mostly directed at Indira, but the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and victory over Pakistan muted the critical voices. The company did not produce any vehicles during his lifetime. A test model put out as a showpiece to demonstrate progress was criticised. Public perception turned against Sanjay, and many began to speculate growing corruption. Sanjay then contacted [[Volkswagen AG]] from West Germany for a possible collaboration, transfer of technology and joint production of the Indian version of the "People's Car", to emulate Volkswagen's worldwide success with the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. During the Emergency, Sanjay became active in politics and the Maruti project went on a back burner. There were accusations of nepotism and corruption. Finally, the [[Janata government|Janata Government]] came to power in 1977 and "Maruti Limited" was liquidated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/emergency-and-the-maruti-story-start-of-a-small-wonder-115070900758_1.html|title=Emergency and Sanjay Gandhi: How Maruti's origin lies in cronyism, corruption and blackmail|publisher=Business Standard|author=Bhupesh Bhandari|date=11 July 2015}}</ref>  A commission was set up by the new government headed by Justice [[Alak Chandra Gupta]] which gave very critical report of the Maruti affair.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/maruti-commission-report-documents-the-story-of-sanjay-gandhis-dream-of-building-an-automobile-empire-gone-awry/1/427779.html|title=Maruti Commission report: no fear to remember|publisher=India Today|author=Sunil Sethi|author2=Prabhu Chawla|name-list-style=amp|date=1 March 2014}}</ref> A year after his death in 1980, and at the behest of Indira, the Union government salvaged Maruti Limited and started looking for an active collaborator for a new company.

==Role during emergency==
[[File:Shaikh Shamim Ahmed with Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|Gandhi with [[Shaikh Shamim Ahmed]]]]
In 1974, the opposition-led protests and strikes had caused a widespread disturbance in many parts of the country and badly affected the government and the economy. On 25 June 1975 following an adverse court decision against her, Indira Gandhi declared a [[The Emergency (India)|national emergency]], delayed elections, censored the press and suspended some constitutional freedoms in the name of national security. Non-Congress governments throughout the country were dismissed. Thousands of people, including several [[freedom fighter]]s like [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] and [[Jivatram Kripalani]] who were against the Emergency were arrested.

In the extremely hostile political environment just before and soon after the Emergency, Sanjay Gandhi rose in importance as Indira's adviser. With the defections of former loyalists, Sanjay's influence with Indira and the government increased dramatically, although he was never in an official or elected position. According to [[Mark Tully]], "His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state."<ref>Mark Tully ''Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle'', p. 55, {{ISBN|81-291-0917-4}}</ref>

It was said that during the Emergency, he virtually ran India along with his friends, especially [[Bansi Lal]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Subodh Ghildiyal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-29/india/28661327_1_slum-clearance-sanjay-gandhi-sterilization|title=Cong blames Sanjay Gandhi for Emergency 'excesses'|publisher=Times Of India|date=29 December 2010|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> It was also quipped that Sanjay Gandhi had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/26022710/Mystery-Called-Sanjay-Gandhi |title=Mystery Called Sanjay Gandhi|publisher=Scribd|date=21 November 2007|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Emergency 'propagandist' who banned Kishore Kumar songs|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/emergency-propagandist-who-banned-kishore-kumar-songs/1127804/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Indian Express|date=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="The Life of Indira Gandhi">{{cite journal|author=Swapan Dasgupta|journal=Third World Quarterly|date=July 1985|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1080/01436598508419863|title=Book reviews|pages=731–778}}</ref>  He "recruited into the party thousands of younger people, many of them hooligans and ruffians, who used threats and force to intimidate rivals and those who opposed Mrs Gandhi's authority or his own."<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul R.

During the emergency, Indira Gandhi declared a 20-point economic programme for development. Sanjay also declared his own much shorter five points program promoting
* [[Literacy]]
* [[Family planning in India|Family planning]]
*[[Tree planting|Tree Planting]]
* Eradication of [[Casteism]] 
* Abolition of [[Dowry system in India|dowry]] 
Later during the emergency Sanjay's programme was merged with Indira's 20-point programme to make a combined twenty-five point programme.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emma Tarlo|title=Unsettling memories : narratives of the emergency in Delhi|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-23122-1|pages=27–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IO1WB2H8UUC&pg=PR5}}</ref>

Out of the five points, Sanjay is now chiefly remembered for the family planning initiative that attracted much notoriety and caused longterm harm to population control in India.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eliza Ann Lehner|title=Conceiving the Impact: Connecting Population Growth and Environmental Sustainability|url=http://mfile.narotama.ac.id/files/Jurnal/Jurnal%202011/Conceiving%20the%20Impact%3B%20Connecting%20Population%20Growth%20and%20Environmental%20Sustainability.pdf|publisher=Harvard College|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor=Warren C.

===Involvement in politics and government===
Although he had not been elected and held no office, Sanjay began exercising his new-found influence with Cabinet ministers, high-level government officials and police officers. While many Cabinet ministers and officials resigned in protest,<ref name="Moro, Javier 2015">Moro, Javier (2015) The red sari. Roli Group, 429 p.</ref> Sanjay reportedly appointed their successors.

In one famous example, [[Inder Kumar Gujral]] resigned from the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]] when Sanjay attempted to direct the affairs of his ministry and give him orders. Gujral is reported to have angrily rebuked Sanjay and refused to take orders from an unelected person.<ref name="Moro, Javier 2015"/> Gujral was replaced by [[Vidya Charan Shukla]], a Sanjay Gandhi acolyte. In another incident, after popular [[Bollywood]] singer [[Kishore Kumar]] refused to sing at a function of the [[Indian Youth Congress]], his songs were banned on [[All India Radio]] upon Gandhi's insistence.<ref>R. Guha (2008). ''India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy''. Pan Macmillan.</ref>

Sanjay stood for his first election to the [[Parliament of India|Indian parliament]] following the lifting of the Emergency in March 1977. This election saw the crushing defeat of not only Sanjay in his constituency of [[Amethi]] but also the wiping out of Indira's Congress party throughout Northern India. However, Sanjay won Amethi for the [[Congress(I)]] in the next general election held in January 1980.

Just one month before his death, he was appointed secretary general of the Congress Party in May 1980.<ref name=mherald>{{cite news|author=Ranjan Gupta|title=Sanjay Gandhi dies in plane crash|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Af5jAAAAIBAJ&pg=1475,7898320&dq=sanjay+gandhi&hl=en|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Reuters via The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 June 1980}}</ref>

===Jama Masjid beautification and slum demolition===
Sanjay Gandhi and Brij Vardhan, accompanied by [[Jagmohan]] the vice-chairman of [[Delhi Development Authority]] (DDA), was reportedly irked during his visit to [[Turkman Gate]] in [[old Delhi]] area that he couldn't see the grand old [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] because of the maze of tenements. On 13 April 1976, the DDA team bulldozed the tenements. Police resorted to firing to quell the demonstrations opposing the destruction. The firing resulted in at least 150 deaths. Over 70,000 people were displaced during this episode. The displaced inhabitants were moved to a new undeveloped housing site across the [[Yamuna]] river.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA171|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense Of Indian Politics|publisher=Pearson Education India |year=2012|page=171|isbn=9788131734650}}</ref>

===Compulsory sterilization program===
In September 1976, Sanjay Gandhi initiated a widespread [[compulsory sterilization]] program to limit population growth. The exact extent of Sanjay Gandhi's role in the implementation of the program is somewhat disputed, with some writers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Independent/Indira.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050106094303/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Independent/Indira.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2005|title=Gandhi|quote="Sanjay Gandhi, started to run the country as though it were his personal fiefdom, and earned the fierce hatred of many whom his policies had victimized.

[[David Frum]] and [[Vinod Mehta]] state that the sterilization programmes were initiated at the behest of the [[IMF]] and the [[World Bank]]: {{quote|text="Forced sterilisation was by far the most calamitous exercise undertaken during the Emergency. The IMF and World Bank had periodically shared their fears with New Delhi about the uncontrolled rise in population levels. India’s democracy was a hurdle: no government could possibly enact laws limiting the number of children a couple could have without incurring punishment at the ballot box. But with democracy suspended, the IMF and World Bank encouraged Indira to pursue the programme with renewed vigour. Indira and Sanjay, the self-styled socialists, inflicting on Indians the humiliation of forced sterilisation in order to appease western loan sharks: the irony was lost on them. Socialism, like much else, had been reduced to a slogan."|author=David Frum|source=reviewing ''The Sanjay Story'' by [[Vinod Mehta]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/29/hold-onto-your-penis.html |title=Hold Onto Your Penis |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=25 February 2014|newspaper=The Daily Beast}}</ref>}}

==Opposition years (1977-1980)==
After losing the 1977 general election, the Congress party split again with Indira Gandhi floating her own Congress(I) faction. She won a by-election from the [[Chikmagalur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Chikmagalur Constituency]] to the [[Lok Sabha]] in November 1978<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maramkal|first1=M-B|title=Chikmagalur remembers Indira Gandhi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/Chikmagalur-remembers-Indira-Gandhi/articleshow/26064352.cms|issue=20 November|publisher=Times of India|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs. Gandhi is Jeered|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19781121&id=nEpOAAAAIBAJ&pg=4709,2645853|website=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=21 November 1978}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/how-fernandes-ran-a-high-voltage-campaign-for-chikkamagaluru-bypoll/articleshow/67745513.cms | title=How Fernandes ran a high-voltage campaign for Chikkamagaluru bypoll - Times of India}}</ref> However, the Janata government's Home Minister, [[Charan Singh]], ordered her and Sanjay arrested on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament.However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people.

===''Kissa Kursi Ka'' case===
''[[Kissa Kursi Ka]]'' is a satirical film directed by [[Amrit Nahata]] that lampooned Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi. The film was submitted to the [[Central Board of Film Certification|Censor Board]] for certification in April 1975. The film had lampooned Sanjay Gandhi's car manufacturing plans, besides Congress supporters like Swami [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]], private secretary to Indira Gandhi [[R.K. Dhawan]], and [[Rukhsana Sultana]]. The board sent the film to a seven-member revising committee, which further sent it to the Government. Subsequently, a show-cause notice raising 51 objections was sent to the producer by the Information and Broadcasting ministry. In his reply submitted on 11 July 1975, Nahata stated that the characters were "imaginary and do not refer to any political party or persons". By the time, [[The Emergency (India)|the Emergency]] had already been declared.<ref name=today06/>

Subsequently, all the prints and the master-print of the film at Censor Board office were picked up, and brought to Maruti factory in [[Gurgaon]] where they were burned. The subsequent [[Shah Commission]], established in 1977 by the Janata party led Government of India,  to enquire into excesses committed in the Indian Emergency found Sanjay guilty of burning the negative, along with [[V.

===Support for Charan Singh===
The Janata coalition under prime minister [[Morarji Desai]] was only united by its hatred of Indira Gandhi.The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting different Congress factions including Congress (I). After a significant exodus from Janata party to Charan Singh faction, Morarji Desai resigned as prime minister in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay promised Singh that Congress(I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions.<ref name="Supporting Charan Singh">{{cite book|last1=de Mesquita|first1=Bruce Bueno|title=The Predictioneer's Game: Using the Logic of Brazen Self-Interest to See and shapte the future|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7977-0|page=xxiii|url={{Google books|8BafGvdAYYEC|page=PA10|keywords=%22charan%20singh%22|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=2010}}</ref><ref name="Charan Singh">{{cite book|last1=Sanghvi|first1=Vijay|title=The Congress, Indira to Sonia Gandhi By|date=2006|publisher=Kalpaz|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-7835-340-1|pages=114–122|url={{Google books|npdqD_TXucQC|page=PA7|keywords=charan|text=|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay. Since Charan Singh refused to drop the charges, Congress withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979.

Before the [[1980 Indian general election|1980 elections]] Gandhi approached the then [[Shahi Imam]] of [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]], [[Syed Abdullah Bukhari]] and entered into an agreement with him on the basis of 10-point programme to secure the support of the Muslim votes.<ref name="AgnihotriRay2002">{{cite book|author1=S.

==Death==
Sanjay Gandhi died instantly from head wounds in an air crash on 23 June 1980 near [[Safdarjung Airport]] in New Delhi. He was flying a new aircraft of the Delhi Flying club, and, while performing an [[aerobatic manoeuvre]] over his office, lost control and crashed. Sanjay was a novice pilot but given to flashy daredevilry and dangerous low-flying. His elder brother Rajiv Gandhi had repeatedly warned Sanjay to wear proper shoes and not Kolhapuri chappals in the cockpit. Sanjay chose to ignore his advice. He was clad in kurta-pyjama and Kolhapuri chappals when he got into the advanced [[Pitts Special|Pitts S-2A]] aircraft. He flew low and indulged in some reckless manoeuvres before crashing. Sanjay died instantly. It took eight surgeons four hours to stitch up his mutilated body.<ref>[Vinod Mehta "The Sanjay Story, 2015 Harper Collins Publishers India.]</ref>

The only passenger in the plane, Captain Subhash Saxena, also died in the crash.<ref name=mherald /> [[WikiLeaks]] has revealed that three attempts were made on his life before he died in the plane crash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Three-attempts-were-made-to-kill-Sanjay-Gandhi-WikiLeaks/articleshow/19485275.cms|title=Three attempts were made to kill Sanjay Gandhi: WikiLeaks |work=The Times of India|date=11 April 2013}}</ref>

Sanjay's death led his mother to induct her other son [[Rajiv Gandhi]] into Indian politics. After the [[assassination of Indira Gandhi]], Rajiv succeeded her as Prime Minister of India.
