Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them; and present in both industrialised and developing nations.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005).

"In fact, socialism has been both centralist and local; organized from above and built from below; visionary and pragmatic; revolutionary and reformist; anti-state and statist; internationalist and nationalist; harnessed to political parties and shunning them; an outgrowth of trade unionism and independent of it; a feature of rich industrialized countries and poor peasant-based communities".</ref> [[Social democracy]] originated within the socialist movement,<ref>Ely, Richard T.

The vast majority of them are laborers, and, as a rule, they expect the violent overthrow of existing institutions by revolution to precede the introduction of the socialistic state. I would not, by any means, say that they are all revolutionists, but the most of them undoubtedly are.

== Etymology ==
For Andrew Vincent, "[t]he word 'socialism' finds its root in the Latin ''sociare'', which means to combine or to share. The related, more technical term in Roman and then medieval law was ''societas''. This latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen".<ref>Andrew Vincent (2010). ''Modern Political Ideologies''.

''Socialism'' was coined by [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], one of the founders of what would later be labelled [[utopian socialism]]. Simon contrasted it to the [[Liberalism|liberal]] doctrine of [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] that emphasized the moral worth of the individual whilst stressing that people act or should act as if they are in isolation from one another. The original utopian socialists condemned this doctrine of individualism for failing to address social concerns during the [[Industrial Revolution]], including [[poverty]], [[oppression]] and vast [[wealth inequality]]. They viewed their society as harming community life by basing society on competition. They presented socialism as an alternative to liberal individualism based on the shared ownership of resources.<ref name="Marvin Perry 1600, p. 540">Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R.

West European social critics, including [[Louis Blanc]], [[Charles Fourier]], Charles Hall, [[Robert Owen]], Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Saint-Simon were the first modern socialists who criticised the poverty and inequality of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

{{main|Paris Commune}}
[[File:Commune 28 mars.jpeg|thumb|The celebration of the election of the Commune on 28 March 1871—the [[Paris Commune]] was a major early implementation of socialist ideas]]
The Paris Commune was a government that ruled Paris from 18 March (formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The Commune elections were held on 26 March. They elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|978-2-13-062078-5}}.</ref> Despite internal differences, the council began to organise public services. It reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly democratic [[social democracy]].

Because the Commune was able to meet on fewer than 60 days in total, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return of all workmen's tools and household items valued up to 20 francs that had been pledged during the siege.<ref name="Milza, Pierre, La Commune">Milza, Pierre, ''La Commune''.</ref> The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner. The Commune nonetheless recognised the previous owner's right to compensation.<ref name="Milza, Pierre, La Commune"/>

[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Mikhail Bakunin]] speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] at the [[Basel Congress (1869)|Basel Congress]] in 1869]]
In 1864, the First International was founded in London. It united diverse revolutionary currents, including socialists such as the French followers of Proudhon,<ref>{{cite book |last=Blin |first=Arnaud |title=The History of Terrorism |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-24709-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar/page/116 116] |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar/page/116 }}</ref> [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English [[trade union]]ists and [[social democrats]]. In 1865 and 1866, it held a preliminary conference and had its first congress in [[Geneva]], respectively. Due to their wide variety of philosophies, conflict immediately erupted. The first objections to Marx came from the mutualists who opposed [[state socialism]]. Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation. But it is desirable to consider some of the factors underlying the final emergence of a predominantly anarchist International in 1872." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). p. 243.</ref> The clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions. The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas.

Bakunin's followers were called [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] and sought to collectivise ownership of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount and kind of labour of each individual. Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. As [[Errico Malatesta]] put it, "instead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one".<ref name="dwardmac.pitzer.edu">{{cite web |title=A Talk About Anarchist Communism Between Two Workers |author=Errico Malatesta |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_Archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html |website=Anarchy Archives |access-date=14 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110015525/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/malatesta/MalatestaATAC.html |archive-date=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Anarcho-communism as a coherent economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Malatesta, [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Emilio Covelli]], [[Andrea Costa]] and other ex-[[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinian]] republicans.<ref name="Nunzio Pernicious pp. 111-113">Nunzio Pernicone, "Italian Anarchism 1864–1892", pp. 111–13, AK Press 2009.</ref> Out of respect for Bakunin, they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after his death.<ref name="marxists.org">James Guillaume, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/bakunin.htm "Michael Bakunin – A Biographical Sketch"]</ref>

As the ideas of Marx and Engels gained acceptance, particularly in central Europe, socialists sought to unite in an international organisation. In 1889 (the centennial of the French Revolution), the Second International was founded, with 384 delegates from twenty countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations.<ref>[http://www.marxisthistory.org/subject/usa/eam/secondinternational.html ''The Second (Socialist) International 1889–1923'']. Retrieved 12 July 2007.</ref> It was termed the Socialist International and Engels was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. Anarchists were banned, mainly due to pressure from Marxists.<ref name="Anarchism 1962 pp. 263">[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962). pp. 263–64</ref> It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned "into a battleground over the issue of [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] versus [[authoritarian socialism]]. Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labour movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as [[H. M. Hyndman]]".<ref name="Anarchism 1962 pp. 263"/>

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution. [[Eduard Bernstein]] was a leading [[social democrat]] in Germany who proposed the concept of [[evolutionary socialism]]. Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define "revolution" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels emphasised ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning, as a first step, the "battle of democracy".<ref>Marx, Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', Selected Works, p. 52</ref>

By 1917, the patriotism of [[World War I]] changed into [[political radicalism]] in Australia, most of Europe and the United States. Other socialist parties from around the world who were beginning to gain importance in their national politics in the early 20th century included the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[French Section of the Workers' International]], the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] and the [[Socialist Party (Argentina)|Socialist Party]] in Argentina, the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Chile)|Socialist Workers' Party]] in Chile and the [[Socialist Party of America]] in the United States.

==== Russian Revolution ====
{{main|February Revolution|October Revolution}}
In February 1917, revolution exploded in Russia. Workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils), the monarchy fell and a [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]] convened pending the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.

Lenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |access-date=30 November 2010}}</ref>

Upon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the Great October Socialist Revolution. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]—the world's first constitutionally socialist state—was established. On 25 January 1918, Lenin declared "Long live the world socialist revolution!" at the [[Petrograd Soviet]]<ref>Lenin, Vladimir. ''Meeting of the Petrograd Soviet of workers and soldiers' deputies 25 January 1918'', Collected works, Vol 26, p. 239. Lawrence and Wishart, (1964)</ref> and proposed an immediate armistice on all fronts and transferred the land of the landed proprietors, the crown and the monasteries to the peasant committees without compensation.<ref>Lenin, Vladimir. ''To workers Soldiers and Peasants'', Collected works, Vol 26, p. 247. Lawrence and Wishart, (1964)</ref>

The day after assuming executive power on 25 January, Lenin wrote ''Draft Regulations on Workers' Control'', which granted workers control of businesses with more than five workers and office employees and access to all books, documents and stocks and whose decisions were to be "binding upon the owners of the enterprises".<ref>Lenin, Vladimir. ''Collected Works'', Vol 26, pp. 264–65. Lawrence and Wishart (1964)</ref> Governing through the elected soviets and in alliance with the peasant-based [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], the Bolshevik government began nationalising banks and industry; and disavowed the national debts of the deposed [[Romanov]] royal régime. It [[sued for peace]], withdrawing from World War I and convoked a [[Constituent Assembly]] in which the peasant [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (SR) won a majority.<ref>

Strictly, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries won whereas the Left Socialist Revolutionaries were in alliance with the Bolsheviks.</ref>

The Constituent Assembly elected SR leader [[Victor Chernov]] President of a Russian republic, but rejected the Bolshevik proposal that it endorse the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers' control and acknowledge the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies. The next day, the Bolsheviks declared that the assembly was elected on outdated party lists<ref>''Declaration of the RSDLP (Bolsheviks) group at the Constituent Assembly meeting 5 January 1918'' Lenin, ''Collected Works'', Vol 26, p. 429.

{{main|Communist International}}
[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], prominent Marxist revolutionary, leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and martyr and leader of the German [[Spartacist uprising]] in 1919]]
The Bolshevik Russian Revolution of January 1918 launched communist parties in many countries and concomitant [[revolutions of 1917–1923|revolutions from 1917–1923]]. Few communists doubted that the Russian experience depended on successful, working-class socialist revolutions in developed capitalist countries.<ref>Bertil, Hessel, Introduction, ''Theses, Resolutions and Manifestos of the first four congresses of the Third International'', pxiii, Ink Links (1980)</ref><ref>"We have always proclaimed, and repeated, this elementary truth of Marxism, that the victory of socialism requires the joint efforts of workers in a number of advanced countries."

Pluto (1975))</ref> In 1919, Lenin and Trotsky organised the world's communist parties into an international association of workers—the Communist International (Comintern), also called the Third International.

The Russian Revolution influenced uprisings in other countries. The [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] replaced Germany's imperial government with a [[republic]]. The revolution lasted from November 1918 until the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]] in August 1919. It included an episode known as the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]<ref>"The Munich Soviet (or "Council Republic") of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though—like most revolutions—its stated goals were not exactly "temporary". Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture, along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B.

By 1920, the [[Red Army]] under Trotsky had largely defeated the royalist [[White movement|White Armies]]. In 1921, [[War Communism]] was ended and under the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) private ownership was allowed for small and medium peasant enterprises. While industry remained largely state-controlled, Lenin acknowledged that the NEP was a necessary capitalist measure for a country unready for socialism. Profiteering returned in the form of "NEP men" and rich peasants ([[kulak]]s) gained power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&SubjectID=1924nepmen&Year=1924 |title=Soviet history: NEPmen |publisher=Soviethistory.org |access-date=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722164645/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&SubjectID=1924nepmen&Year=1924 |archive-date=22 July 2011 }}</ref> Trotsky's role was questioned by other socialists, including ex-Trotskyists.

He then moved towards [[democratic socialism]]<ref>Mattson, Kevin. 2002. ''Intellectuals in Action: The Origins of the New Left and Radical Liberalism, 1945–1970''.

A similar critique of Trotsky's role in the Kronstadt rebellion was raised by American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]. In her essay "Trotsky Protests Too Much", she states, "I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin's rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Trotsky_Protests_Too_Much|title=Trotsky Protests Too Much|first=Emma|last=Goldman|via=Wikisource}}</ref>

==== 4th World Congress of the Communist International ====
{{main|4th World Congress of the Communist International}}
In 1922, the fourth congress of the [[Communist International]] took up the policy of the [[United Front]]. It urged communists to work with rank and file social democrats while remaining critical of their leaders. They criticised those leaders for betraying the working class by supporting the capitalists' war efforts. The social democrats pointed to the dislocation caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the communist parties. The Labour Party rejected the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]'s application to affiliate to them in 1920.

On seeing the Soviet State's growing coercive power in 1923, a dying Lenin said Russia had reverted to "a bourgeois tsarist machine [...] barely varnished with socialism".<ref>[[Victor Serge|Serge, Victor]], ''From Lenin to Stalin'', p. 55.</ref> After Lenin's death in January 1924, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]—then increasingly under the control of [[Joseph Stalin]]—rejected the theory that socialism could not be built solely in the Soviet Union in favour of the concept of [[socialism in one country]]. Despite the marginalised [[Left Opposition]]'s demand for the restoration of Soviet democracy, Stalin developed a bureaucratic, [[authoritarian]] government that was condemned by democratic socialists, anarchists and Trotskyists for undermining the Revolution's ideals.<ref>Serge, Victor, ''From Lenin to Stalin'', p. 52.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Brinton |first=Maurice |author-link=Maurice Brinton |title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control 1917–1921 : The State and Counter-revolution |publisher=[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]] |year=1975 |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |access-date=22 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220120533/http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/russia/sp001861/bolintro.html |archive-date=20 December 2006}}{{self-published source|date=December 2011}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=December 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2011}}

In Spain in 1936, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance.

The Norwegian [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] was established in 1887 and was largely a trade union federation. The party did not proclaim a socialist agenda, elevating [[universal suffrage]] and dissolution of the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]] as its top priorities.

The emergence of this new political entity in the frame of the [[Cold War]] was complex and painful. Several tentative efforts were made to organise newly independent states in order to establish a common front to limit the United States' and the Soviet Union's influence on them.

==== Protests of 1968 ====
{{main|Protests of 1968}}
The protests of 1968 represented a worldwide escalation of social conflicts, predominantly characterised by popular rebellions against military, capitalist and bureaucratic elites who responded with an escalation of [[political repression]]. These protests marked a turning point for the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States which produced revolutionary movements like the [[Black Panther Party]]. The prominent civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] organised the "[[Poor People's Campaign]]" to address issues of economic justice,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington |last=Isserman |first=Maurice |page=[https://archive.org/details/otheramericanlif0000isse/page/281 281] |isbn=978-1-58648-036-3 |publisher=Public Affairs |year=2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/otheramericanlif0000isse/page/281 }}</ref> while personally showing sympathy with democratic socialism.<ref>"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism."{{cite book |title=Liberating Visions: Human Fulfillment and Social Justice in African-American Thought |last=Franklin |first=Robert Michael |page=125 |publisher=Fortress Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-8006-2392-0}}</ref> In reaction to the [[Tet Offensive]], protests also sparked a broad movement in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] all over the United States and even into London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. In 1968, the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held in Carrara by the three existing European federations of [[Anarchist Federation (France)|France]], the [[Italian Anarchist Federation|Italian]] and the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the Bulgarian federation in French exile.

Mass socialist or communist movements grew not only in the United States, but also in most European countries. The most spectacular manifestation of this were the [[May 1968 protests in France]] in which students linked up with strikes of up to ten million workers and for a few days the movement seemed capable of overthrowing the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In many other capitalist countries, struggles against dictatorships, state repression and colonisation were also marked by protests in 1968, such as the beginning of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] in Mexico City and the escalation of guerrilla warfare against the [[military dictatorship in Brazil]]. Countries governed by communist parties had protests against bureaucratic and military elites. In Eastern Europe there were widespread protests that escalated particularly in the [[Prague Spring]] in Czechoslovakia. In response, Soviet Union occupied Czechoslovakia, but the occupation was denounced by the [[Italian Communist Party|Italian]] and [[French Communist Party|French]]<ref name="OSA">{{cite web |last=Devlin |first=Kevin |publisher=Open Society Archives |title=Western CPs Condemn Invasion, Hail Prague Spring |url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/135-2-510.shtml |access-date=20 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> communist parties and the [[Communist Party of Finland]].

In the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]], a social-political youth movement mobilised against "[[bourgeois]]" elements which were seen to be infiltrating the government and society at large, aiming to restore capitalism. This movement motivated [[Maoism]]-inspired movements around the world in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the late 1970s and in the 1980s, the Socialist International (SI) had extensive contacts and discussion with the two powers of the [[Cold War]], the United States and the Soviet Union, about east–west relations and arms control. Since then, the SI has admitted as member parties the Nicaraguan [[FSLN]], the left-wing [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], as well as former communist parties such as the [[Democratic Party of the Left]] of Italy and the [[FRELIMO|Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (FRELIMO). The SI aided social democratic parties in re-establishing themselves when dictatorship gave way to democracy in [[Carnation Revolution|Portugal (1974)]] and [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain (1975)]].

Many social democratic parties, particularly after the Cold War, adopted [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] market policies including [[privatisation]], [[deregulation]] and [[financialisation]]. They abandoned their pursuit of moderate socialism in favour of [[economic liberalism]]. By the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain, [[Brian Mulroney]] in Canada and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile, the Western [[welfare state]] was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained.<ref>Gary Teeple (2000).

In the United Kingdom, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Neil Kinnock]] made a public attack against the [[Entryism|entryist]] group [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] at the 1985 Labour Party conference. Labour ruled that Militant was ineligible for affiliation with the party and it gradually expelled Militant supporters. The Kinnock leadership had refused to support the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|1984–1985 miner's strike]] over pit closures, a decision that the party's left wing and the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] blamed for the strike's eventual defeat. In 1989, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, stating:
<blockquote>Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html|url-status=dead|title=Socialist International – Progressive Politics for a Fairer World|archive-date=22 February 2008}}</ref></blockquote>

In the 1990s, the British Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] enacted policies based on the free market economy to deliver public services via the [[private finance initiative]]. Influential in these policies was the idea of a Third Way which called for a re-evaluation of welfare state policies.<ref>Jane Lewis, Rebecca Surender. ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?''. Oxford University Press, 2004. pp. 3–4, 16.</ref> In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording [[Clause IV]] of its constitution, defining socialism in ethical terms and removing all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: "The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |title=Labour Party Clause Four |publisher=Labour.org.uk |date=30 October 2008 |access-date=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081023/http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies |archive-date=11 July 2007 }}</ref>

=== Africa ===
{{main|African socialism}}
African socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent. [[Julius Nyerere]] was inspired by [[Fabian socialist]] ideals.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ruud van Dijk|author2=William Glenn Gray|author3=Svetlana Savranskaya|author4=Jeremi Suri|author5=Qiang Zhai|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUdmyzkw9q4C&pg=PA880+|year=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-88021-0|page=880}}</ref> He was a firm believer in rural Africans and their traditions and [[ujamaa]], a system of collectivisation that according to Nyerere was present before European imperialism. Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. [[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] that despite major police suppression continues to work for popular people's planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing.

=== Asia ===
{{main|Arab socialism|History of the People's Republic of China|Socialist market economy|Socialist-oriented market economy}}
In Asia, states with socialist economies—such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam—have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets. Forms include the Chinese socialist market economy and the Vietnamese socialist-oriented market economy. They use [[State enterprise|state-owned corporate]] management models as opposed to modelling socialist enterprise on traditional management styles employed by government agencies. In China living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the [[late-2000s recession]], but centralised political control remained tight.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html |title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript |access-date=12 July 2008 |date=11 April 2006 |website=Frontline |publisher=PBS}}</ref> [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] in his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'', later supported by other academics,<ref>[[Andrei Lankov]].

=== Europe ===
The United Nations ''[[World Happiness Report]] 2013'' shows that the happiest nations are concentrated in Northern Europe, where the [[Nordic model]] is employed, with Denmark topping the list. This is at times attributed to the success of the Nordic model in the region that has been labelled social democratic in contrast with the conservative continental model and the liberal Anglo-American model. The Nordic countries ranked highest on the metrics of real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, generosity and freedom from corruption.<ref>Carolyn Gregoire (10 September 2013).

[[Anti-capitalism]], [[The Northeastern Anarchist|anarchism]] and the [[anti-globalisation movement]] rose to prominence through events such as protests against the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in Seattle.

== Social and political theory ==
{{main|Types of socialism}}
Early socialist thought took influences from a diverse range of philosophies such as civic [[republicanism]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]], [[romanticism]], forms of [[materialism]], [[Christianity]] (both Catholic and Protestant), [[natural law]] and [[natural rights theory]], [[utilitarianism]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] political economy.<ref>Andrew Vincent. Modern political ideologies. Wiley-Blackwell publishing. 2010. pp. 87–88</ref> Another philosophical basis for a lot of early socialism was the emergence of [[positivism]] during the [[European Enlightenment]]. Positivism held that both the natural and social worlds could be understood through scientific knowledge and be analysed using scientific methods. This core outlook influenced early social scientists and different types of socialists ranging from anarchists like [[Peter Kropotkin]] to technocrats like [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint Simon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11291/Socialism-Socialism-during-its-Mature-Phase.html |title=Socialism during its "mature phase" |year=2013 |publisher=Science Encyclopedia}}</ref>

[[File:Claude Henri de Saint-Simon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henri de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]], early French socialist]]
The fundamental objective of socialism is to attain an advanced level of material production and therefore greater productivity, efficiency and rationality as compared to capitalism and all previous systems, under the view that an expansion of human productive capability is the basis for the extension of freedom and equality in society.<ref>''Socialism and the Market: The Socialist Calculation Debate Revisited''. Routledge Library of 20th Century Economics, 2000. p. 12. {{ISBN|978-0-415-19586-7}}.</ref> Many forms of socialist theory hold that human behaviour is largely shaped by the social environment. In particular, socialism holds that social [[mores]], values, cultural traits and economic practices are social creations and not the result of an immutable natural law.<ref>{{cite book |last=Claessens |first=August |title=The logic of socialism |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-104-23840-7 |page=15 |quote=The individual is largely a product of his environment and much of his conduct and behavior is the reflex of getting a living in a particular stage of society.}}</ref><ref>Ferri, Enrico, "Socialism and Modern Science", in ''Evolution and Socialism'' (1912), p. 79. "Upon what point are orthodox political economy and socialism in absolute conflict? Political economy has held and holds that the economic laws governing the production and distribution of wealth which it has established are natural laws ... not in the sense that they are laws naturally determined by the condition of the social organism (which would be correct), but that they are absolute laws, that is to say that they apply to humanity at all times and in all places, and consequently, that they are immutable in their principal points, though they may be subject to modification in details. Scientific socialism holds, the contrary, that the laws established by classical political economy, since the time of Adam Smith, are laws peculiar to the present period in the history of civilized humanity, and that they are, consequently, laws essentially relative to the period of their analysis and discovery."</ref> The object of their critique is thus not human avarice or human consciousness, but the material conditions and man-made social systems (i.e. the economic structure of society) that gives rise to observed social problems and inefficiencies. [[Bertrand Russell]], often considered to be the father of analytic philosophy, identified as a socialist. Russell opposed the class struggle aspects of Marxism, viewing socialism solely as an adjustment of economic relations to accommodate modern machine production to benefit all of humanity through the progressive reduction of necessary work time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |url=http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html |title=In Praise of Idleness |year=1932}}</ref>

Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature and define freedom as a state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions.<ref>Bhargava. ''Political Theory: An Introduction''. Pearson Education India, 2008. p. 249.</ref> The socialist concept of individuality is intertwined with the concept of individual creative expression. Karl Marx believed that expansion of the productive forces and technology was the basis for the expansion of human freedom and that socialism, being a system that is consistent with modern developments in technology, would enable the flourishing of "free individualities" through the progressive reduction of necessary labour time. The reduction of necessary labour time to a minimum would grant individuals the opportunity to pursue the development of their true individuality and creativity.<ref>{{cite web |last=Marx |first=Karl |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch14.htm |title=The Grundrisse |year=1857–1861|quote=The free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them.}}</ref>

=== Criticism of capitalism ===
{{main|Anti-capitalism|Criticism of capitalism}}
Socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products such as high-pressure advertisement to be sold at a profit, thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.<ref>[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html "Let's produce for use, not profit"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html|date=16 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Magdoff |first1=Fred |last2=Yates |first2=Michael D. |url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/091109magdoff-yates.php |title=What Needs To Be Done: A Socialist View |magazine=Monthly Review|access-date=23 February 2014|date=November 2009 }}</ref>

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need and therefore a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that "making money", or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand (the production of [[use-value]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |title=Let's produce for use, not profit |access-date=18 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html |archive-date=16 July 2010 }}</ref> The fundamental criterion for economic activity in capitalism is the accumulation of capital for reinvestment in production, but this spurs the development of new, non-productive industries that do not produce use-value and only exist to keep the accumulation process afloat (otherwise the system goes into crisis), such as the spread of the [[Financialization|financial industry]], contributing to the formation of economic bubbles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rdwolff.com/content/economic-crisis-socialist-perspective |title=Economic Crisis from a Socialist Perspective &#124; Professor Richard D.

Socialists view [[private property]] relations as limiting the potential of [[productive forces]] in the economy. According to socialists, private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralised, socialised institutions based on private appropriation of revenue''—''but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs—until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant.<ref>Engels, Fredrich.

Excessive disparities in income distribution lead to social instability and require costly corrective measures in the form of redistributive taxation, which incurs heavy administrative costs while weakening the incentive to work, inviting dishonesty and increasing the likelihood of tax evasion while (the corrective measures) reduce the overall efficiency of the market economy.<ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197–198">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (pp. 197–98)</ref> These corrective policies limit the incentive system of the market by providing things such as [[minimum wage]]s, [[Unemployment benefit|unemployment insurance]], taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labour, resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production.

Early socialists ([[utopian socialists]] and [[Ricardian socialists]]) criticised capitalism for concentrating [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[wealth]] within a small segment of society.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism 'socialism' in Encyclopædia Britannica (2009)] Retrieved 14 October 2009, from ''www.britannica.com'', Encyclopædia Britannica Online: , "Main" summary: "Socialists complain that capitalism necessarily leads to unfair and exploitative concentrations of wealth and power in the hands of the relative few who emerge victorious from free-market competition—people who then use their wealth and power to reinforce their dominance in society."</ref> In addition, they complained that capitalism does not use available [[technology]] and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.<ref name="Engels Selected Works 1968, p. 40"/>

=== Marxism ===

{{quote box|quote=At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.

[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that socialism would emerge from historical necessity as capitalism rendered itself obsolete and unsustainable from increasing internal contradictions emerging from the development of the [[productive forces]] and technology. It was these advances in the productive forces combined with the old [[social relations of production]] of capitalism that would generate contradictions, leading to working-class consciousness.<ref name="ComparingEconomic">''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62, ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.</ref>

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The writings of [[Karl Marx]] provided the basis for the development of [[Marxism|Marxist]] political theory and [[Marxian economics]]]]
Marx and Engels held the view that the consciousness of those who earn a wage or salary (the [[working class]] in the broadest Marxist sense) would be moulded by their conditions of [[wage slavery]], leading to a tendency to seek their freedom or [[emancipation of labour|emancipation]] by overthrowing ownership of the means of production by capitalists and consequently, overthrowing the state that upheld this economic order. For Marx and Engels, conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a [[classless society]] in which the [[withering away of the state|state would wither away]]. The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede [[communism]]. The major characteristics of socialism (particularly as conceived by Marx and Engels after the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871) are that the [[proletariat]] would control the means of production through a [[socialist state|workers' state]] erected by the workers in their interests. Economic activity would still be organised through the use of incentive systems and social classes would still exist, but to a lesser and diminishing extent than under capitalism.

For orthodox Marxists, socialism is the lower stage of communism based on the principle of "from each according to his ability, [[to each according to his contribution]]" while upper stage communism is based on the principle of "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]", the upper stage becoming possible only after the socialist stage further develops economic efficiency and the automation of production has led to a superabundance of goods and services.<ref name="KS">{{cite book |last=Schaff |first=Kory |title=Philosophy and the Problems of Work: A Reader|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham, Md |year=2001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mdLh5EMehwgC&pg=PA224 224] |isbn=978-0-7425-0795-1}}</ref><ref name="WA">{{cite book |last=Walicki |first=Andrzej |title=Marxism and the leap to the kingdom of freedom: the rise and fall of the Communist utopia |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, Calif |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8047-2384-8 |page=95}}</ref> Marx argued that the material productive forces (in industry and commerce) brought into existence by capitalism predicated a cooperative society since production had become a mass social, collective activity of the working class to create commodities but with private ownership (the relations of production or property relations).

=== Role of the state ===
{{see also|Anti-statism|Marx's theory of the state|State socialism}}
Socialists have taken different perspectives on the [[State (polity)|state]] and the role it should play in revolutionary struggles, in constructing socialism and within an established socialist economy.

In the 19th century, the philosophy of state socialism was first explicitly expounded by the German political philosopher [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]. In contrast to Karl Marx's perspective of the state, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to "wither away". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for achieving socialism.{{sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}

Preceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialists including [[reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], anarchists and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. Following the victory of Leninism in Russia, the idea of "state socialism" spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually state socialism came to be identified with the [[Soviet economic model]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Screpanti and Zamagni|title=An Outline on the History of Economic Thought |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford|quote=It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism. But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production. |ref=p. 295}}</ref>

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] rejected the association of socialism and social ownership with state ownership over the means of production because the state as it exists in its current form is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework. Schumpeter argued that there would be different institutions within socialism than those that exist within modern capitalism, just as [[feudalism]] had its own distinct and unique institutional forms. The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to commercial society (capitalism) and attempting to place them within the context of a future socialist society would amount to a distortion of these concepts by using them out of context.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-156161-0 |page=169 |quote=But there are still others (concepts and institutions) which by virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor of a particular institutional framework. It is extremely dangerous, in fact it amounts to a distortion of historical description, to use them beyond the social world or culture whose denizens they are. Now ownership or property—also, so I believe, taxation—are such denizens of the world of commercial society, exactly as knights and fiefs are denizens of the feudal world. But so is the state (a denizen of commercial society).}}</ref>

=== Utopian versus scientific ===
{{main|Scientific socialism|Utopian socialism}}
Utopian socialism is a term used to define the first currents of modern socialist thought as exemplified by the work of [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html |title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism |publisher=Public Broadcasting System |access-date=15 December 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as reactionary.<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper |first=Hal |title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms |year=1990 |publisher=Monthly Review Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-85345-798-5 |pages=1–21}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a negative term in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"/>

Religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]] are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorised as [[Religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Similarly, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorised as "utopian socialist".

For Marxists, the development of capitalism in Western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because according to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' "[w]hat the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers",<ref>Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto''.</ref> namely the working class, which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society.

=== Reform versus revolution ===
{{main|Reformism|Revolutionary socialism}}
Revolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socioeconomic structure of society. Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of ''revolution''. Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an [[impossibilist]] stance, believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces. Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into [[trade union]]s and making demands of the capitalists. Therefore, [[Leninists]] advocate that it is historically necessary for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leninist Concept of the Revolutionary Vanguard Party |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/partyPR46.html |website=WRG |access-date=9 December 2013}}</ref> ''Revolution'' is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection,<ref>Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no. 2 (April–June 1973)</ref> but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class.

Reformism is generally associated with [[social democracy]] and [[gradualist]] [[democratic socialism]]. Reformism is the belief that socialists should stand in parliamentary elections within capitalist society and if elected use the [[machinery of government]] to pass political and social reforms for the purposes of ameliorating the instabilities and inequities of capitalism. Within socialism, ''reformism'' is used in two different ways. One has no intention of bringing about socialism or fundamental economic change to society and is used to oppose such structural changes. The other is based on the assumption that while reforms are not socialist in themselves, they can help rally supporters to the cause of revolution by popularizing the cause of socialism to the working class.<ref name="Parker">{{cite news|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2002/no-1171-march-2002/reformism-or-socialism|title=Reformism – or socialism?|last=Parker|first=Stan|date=March 2002|work=Socialist Standard|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref>

The debate on the ability for social democratic reformism to lead to a socialist transformation of society is over a century old. Reformism is criticized for being paradoxical as it seeks to overcome the existing economic system of capitalism while trying to improve the conditions of capitalism, thereby making it appear more tolerable to society. According to [[Rosa Luxemburg]], capitalism is not overthrown, "but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm|title=Do We Support Reformist Demands?|last=Hallas|first=Duncan|work=Controversy: Do We Support Reformist Demands?|publisher=International Socialism|date=January 1973|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> In a similar vein, Stan Parker of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] argues that reforms are a diversion of energy for socialists and are limited because they must adhere to the logic of capitalism.<ref name="Parker"/> French social theorist [[Andre Gorz]] criticized reformism by advocating a third alternative to reformism and social revolution that he called "[[non-reformist reforms]]", specifically focused on structural changes to capitalism as opposed to reforms to improve living conditions within capitalism or to prop it up through economic interventions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/363/do-we-need-reform-or-revolution|title=Do we need reform of revolution?|last=Clifton|first=Lois|work=Socialist Review|date=November 2011|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref>

== Economics ==
{{main|Socialist economics}}
{{see also|Production for use}}
Socialist economics starts from the premise that "individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another. Furthermore, everything that people produce is in some sense a social product, and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it. Society as whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members".<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The original conception of socialism was an economic system whereby production was organised in a way to directly produce goods and services for their utility (or use-value in [[Classical economics|classical]] and [[Marxian economics]]), with the direct allocation of resources in terms of physical units as opposed to financial calculation and the economic laws of capitalism (see [[law of value]]), often entailing the end of capitalistic economic categories such as [[Renting|rent]], [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and money.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=20 |quote=According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories—such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent—and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognised the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilise the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}</ref> In a fully developed socialist economy, production and balancing factor inputs with outputs becomes a technical process to be undertaken by engineers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gregory and Stuart |first=Paul and Robert |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition: "Socialist Economy" |publisher=George Hoffman |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-618-26181-9 |page=117 |quote=In such a setting, information problems are not serious, and engineers rather than economists can resolve the issue of factor proportions.}}</ref>

[[Market socialism]] refers to an array of different economic theories and systems that use the market mechanism to organise production and to allocate factor inputs among socially owned enterprises, with the economic surplus (profits) accruing to society in a [[social dividend]] as opposed to private capital owners.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-415-24187-8 |page=70 |quote=Market socialism is a general designation for a number of models of economic systems. On the one hand, the market mechanism is utilised to distribute economic output, to organise production and to allocate factor inputs.

The ownership of the [[means of production]] can be based on direct ownership by the users of the productive property through [[worker cooperative]]; or [[commonly owned]] by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production; or [[public ownership]] by a state apparatus. Public ownership may refer to the creation of [[state-owned enterprises]], [[nationalisation]], [[municipalisation]] or autonomous collective institutions. Some socialists feel that in a socialist economy, at least the "[[Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy|commanding heights]]" of the economy must be publicly owned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/product-description/068483569X |title=Excerpt from Commanding Heights |access-date=30 November 2010}}</ref> However, [[economic liberals]] and [[right libertarians]] view private ownership of the [[means of production]] and the market exchange as natural entities or moral rights which are central to their conceptions of freedom and liberty and view the economic dynamics of capitalism as immutable and absolute, therefore they perceive public ownership of the means of production, [[cooperatives]] and [[economic planning]] as infringements upon liberty.<ref name="milton">{{cite web |url=http://www.sangam.org/taraki/articles/2006/11-25_Friedman_MGR.php?uid=2075 |title=On Milton Friedman, MGR & Annaism |publisher=Sangam.org |access-date=30 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Bellamy |first=Richard |title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory00ball |url-access=limited |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-56354-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory00ball/page/n71 60]}}</ref>

Management and control over the activities of enterprises are based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximise occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.<ref name="The Political Economy of Socialism, 1982. p. 197">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (p. 197): "The sandglass (socialist) model is based on the observation that there are two fundamentally different spheres of activity or decision making. The first is concerned with value judgments, and consequently each individual counts as one in this sphere. In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organisation; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labour. Such an organisation involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy."</ref>

The role and use of money in a hypothetical socialist economy is a contested issue. According to the [[Austrian school of economics|Austrian school]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], an economic system that does not use [[money]], financial calculation and [[Market price|market pricing]] would be unable to effectively value [[capital good]]s and coordinate production and therefore these types of socialism are impossible because they lack the necessary information to perform economic calculation in the first place.<ref>Ludwig Von Mises, ''Socialism'', p. 119</ref><ref name="Mises">{{cite book |title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth |access-date=8 September 2008 |last=Von Mises |first=Ludwig |author-link=Ludwig von Mises |year=1990 |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}</ref> Socialists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Robert Owen]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated various forms of [[labour voucher]]s or labour credits, which like money would be used to acquire articles of consumption, but unlike money they are unable to become [[Financial capital|capital]] and would not be used to allocate resources within the production process. Bolshevik revolutionary [[Leon Trotsky]] argued that money could not be arbitrarily abolished following a socialist revolution. Money had to exhaust its "historic mission", meaning it would have to be used until its function became redundant, eventually being transformed into bookkeeping receipts for statisticians and only in the more distant future would money not be required for even that role.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/ch04.htm ''Leon Trotsky: The Revolution Betrayed''] (1936).

=== Planned economy ===
{{main|Planned economy}}
{{quote box|quote=The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. [...] I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilised in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.<ref>[http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php ''Why Socialism?''] by [[Albert Einstein]], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', May 1949</ref>|author=—[[Albert Einstein]], ''[[Why Socialism?]]'', 1949|align=right|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7}}
A planned economy is a type of economy consisting of a mixture of public ownership of the means of production and the coordination of production and distribution through [[economic planning]]. A planned economy can be either decentralised or centralised. [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregory and Stuart|first=Paul and Robert|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition|publisher=George Hoffman|year=2004|isbn=978-0-618-26181-9|pages=120–21}}</ref>

The most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as "command economies", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ericson|first=Richard E.|title=Command Economy|url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|access-date=9 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an "administered" or "managed" economy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nove|first=Alec|title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0-04-335049-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove/page/78 78]|quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J.

Although central planning was largely supported by [[Marxist–Leninists]], some factions within the Soviet Union before the rise of [[Stalinism]] held positions contrary to central planning. Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.<ref>''Writings 1932–33, p. 96'', Leon Trotsky.</ref> [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].<ref name="hayek">F.

=== Self-managed economy ===
{{main|Decentralised planning|Economic democracy|Workers' self-management}}
A self-managed, decentralised economy is based on autonomous self-regulating economic units and a decentralised mechanism of resource allocation and decision-making. This model has found support in notable classical and neoclassical economists including [[Alfred Marshall]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Jaroslav Vanek]]. There are numerous variations of self-management, including labour-managed firms and worker-managed firms. The goals of self-management are to eliminate exploitation and reduce [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Hara |first=Phillip |title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2 |publisher=Routledge |date= 2003 |isbn=978-0-415-24187-8 |pages=8–9 |quote=One finds favorable opinions of cooperatives also among other great economists of the past, such as, for example, John Stuart Mill and Alfred Marshall...In eliminating the domination of capital over labour, firms run by workers eliminate capitalist exploitation and reduce alienation.}}</ref> [[Guild socialism]] is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry through the medium of trade-related [[guild]]s "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism |title=Guild Socialism |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=11 October 2013}}</ref> It originated in the United Kingdom and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century.<ref name="britannica.com"/> It was strongly associated with [[G.

One such system is the cooperative economy, a largely free [[market economy]] in which workers manage the firms and democratically determine remuneration levels and labour divisions. Productive resources would be legally owned by the [[cooperative]] and rented to the workers, who would enjoy [[usufruct]] rights.<ref>Vanek, Jaroslav, ''The Participatory Economy'' (Ithaca, NY.: Cornell University Press, 1971).</ref> Another form of decentralised planning is the use of [[cybernetics]], or the use of computers to manage the allocation of economic inputs.

[[Michel Bauwens]] identifies the emergence of the open software movement and [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer production]] as a new alternative [[mode of production]] to the capitalist economy and centrally planned economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources and the production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital.<ref name="Ctheory">{{cite news |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499 |title=The Political Economy of Peer Production |date=12 January 2005 |publisher=CTheory}}</ref>

The economy of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] established a system based on market-based allocation, social ownership of the means of production and self-management within firms.

The [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that "re-organising production so that workers become collectively self-directed at their work-sites" not only moves society beyond both capitalism and [[state socialism]] of the last century, but would also mark another milestone in human history, similar to earlier transitions out of slavery and feudalism.<ref>[[Richard D.

"The disappearances of slaves and masters and lords and serfs would now be replicated by the disappearance of capitalists and workers.

=== State-directed economy ===
{{main|State socialism}}
{{see also|Dirigisme|Nationalization|Public ownership|State capitalism|Steady-state economy}}
State socialism can be used to classify any variety of socialist philosophies that advocates the ownership of the [[means of production]] by the [[State (polity)|state apparatus]], either as a transitional stage between capitalism and socialism, or as an end-goal in itself. Typically, it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society and the public interest instead of workers' councils or workplace democracy.

A state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century. This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlee's administration. In the biography of the 1945 United Kingdom Labour Party Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]], [[Francis Beckett]] states: "[T]he government [...] wanted what would become known as a mixed economy".<ref>Beckett, Francis, ''Clem Attlee'', (2007) Politico's.</ref>

Nationalisation in the United Kingdom was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry (i.e. with compensation). [[British Aerospace]] was a combination of major aircraft companies [[British Aircraft Corporation]], [[Hawker Siddeley]] and others. [[British Shipbuilders]] was a combination of the major shipbuilding companies including [[Cammell Laird]], [[Govan Shipbuilders]], [[Swan Hunter]] and [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]], whereas the nationalisation of the coal mines in 1947 created a coal board charged with running the coal industry commercially so as to be able to meet the interest payable on the bonds which the former mine owners' shares had been converted into.<ref>{{cite book |author=Socialist Party of Great Britain |author-link=Socialist Party of Great Britain |title=The Strike Weapon: Lessons of the Miners' Strike |publisher=Socialist Party of Great Britain |location=London |year=1985 |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/pdf/ms.pdf |access-date=28 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614065637/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/pdf/ms.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hardcastle |first=Edgar |author-link=Edgar Hardcastle |title=The Nationalisation of the Railways |journal=[[Socialist Standard]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1947 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hardcastle/1947/02/railways.htm |access-date=28 April 2007}}</ref>

=== Market socialism ===
{{main|Market socialism}}
Market socialism consists of publicly owned or cooperatively owned enterprises operating in a [[market economy]]. It is a system that uses the market and [[Price system|monetary prices]] for the allocation and accounting of the [[means of production]], thereby retaining the process of [[capital accumulation]]. The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. p. 142: "It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large."</ref> In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a [[social dividend]], eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. [[Neoclassical economist]] [[Léon Walras]] believed that a socialist economy based on state ownership of land and natural resources would provide a means of public finance to make income taxes unnecessary.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=21 |quote=For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref> Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.

While major socialist political movements include anarchism, communism, the labour movement, Marxism, social democracy and syndicalism, independent socialist theorists, [[utopian socialist]] authors and academic supporters of socialism may not be represented in these movements. Some political groups have called themselves ''socialist'' while holding views that some consider antithetical to socialism. The term ''socialist'' has also been used by some politicians on the [[political right]] as an epithet against certain individuals who do not consider themselves to be socialists and against policies that are not considered socialist by their proponents. There are many variations of socialism and as such there is no single definition encapsulating all of socialism. However, there have been common elements identified by scholars.<ref>{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|pp=1–3}}</ref>

In his ''Dictionary of Socialism'' (1924), Angelo S. Rappoport analysed forty definitions of socialism to conclude that common elements of socialism include general criticism of the social effects of [[private ownership]] and control of capital—as being the cause of poverty, low wages, unemployment, economic and social inequality and a lack of economic security; a general view that the solution to these problems is a form of collective control over the [[means of production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] and [[Means of exchange|exchange]] (the degree and means of control vary amongst socialist movements); an agreement that the outcome of this collective control should be a society based upon [[social justice]], including social equality, economic protection of people and should provide a more satisfying life for most people.<ref>{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|pp=1–2}}</ref>

In ''The Concepts of Socialism'' (1975), [[Bhikhu Parekh]] identifies four core principles of socialism and particularly socialist society, namely sociality, social responsibility, cooperation and planning.<ref name="Peter Lamb 2006. p. 2">{{harvnb|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=2}}</ref> In his study ''Ideologies and Political Theory'' (1996), [[Michael Freeden]] states that all socialists share five themes: the first is that socialism posits that society is more than a mere collection of individuals; second, that it considers human welfare a desirable objective; third, that it considers humans by nature to be active and productive; fourth, it holds the belief of human equality; and fifth, that history is progressive and will create positive change on the condition that humans work to achieve such change.<ref name="Peter Lamb 2006. p. 2"/>

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

The [[authoritarian]]–[[libertarian]] struggles and disputes within the socialist movement go back to the First International and the expulsion in 1872 of the anarchists, who went on to lead the [[Anti-authoritarian International]] and then founded their own libertarian international, the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]].<ref>Hahnel, Robin (2005).

According to anarchists such as the authors of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'', anarchism is one of the many traditions of socialism. For anarchists and other anti-authoritarian socialists, socialism "can only mean a classless and anti-authoritarian (i.e. libertarian) society in which people manage their own affairs, either as individuals or as part of a group (depending on the situation). In other words, it implies self-management in all aspects of life", including at the workplace.<ref name="McKay 2008">{{cite book|editor-last=McKay|editor-first=Iain|year=2008|section=Isn't libertarian socialism an oxymoron?|title=An Anarchist FAQ|volume=I|location=Stirling|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-902593-90-6|oclc=182529204}}</ref> Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005).

Democratic socialism represents any socialist movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who "argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145–63 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265|s2cid=144916176 }} Other texts which use the terms ''democratic socialism'' in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref> According to Christopher Pierson, "[i]f the contrast which 1989 highlights is not that between socialism in the East and liberal democracy in the West, the latter must be recognized to have been shaped, reformed and compromised by a century of social democratic pressure". Pierson further claims that "social democratic and socialist parties within the constitutional arena in the West have almost always been involved in a politics of compromise with existing capitalist institutions (to whatever far distant prize its eyes might from time to time have been lifted)". For Pierson, "if advocates of the death of socialism accept that social democrats belong within the socialist camp, as I think they must, then the contrast between socialism (in all its variants) and liberal democracy must collapse. For ''actually existing'' liberal democracy is, in substantial part, a product of socialist (social democratic) forces".<ref>Pierson, Christopher (1995).

Modern democratic socialism is a broad political movement that seeks to promote the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Some democratic socialists support social democracy as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is relegated to the indefinite future. According to [[Sheri Berman]], Marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just, better future.<ref>Berman, Sheri (2006). ''The Primacy of Politics: Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century''. Cambridge University Press. p. 153. {{ISBN|9780521817998}}.</ref>

The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences. The major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics in that contemporary social democrats support a welfare state and unemployment insurance as well as other practical, progressive reforms of capitalism and are more concerned to administrate and humanise it. On the other hand, democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to humanise capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|year=2006|url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archive-date=17 June 2012  }} "Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state—pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)"</ref>

=== Ethical and liberal socialism ===
{{main|Ethical socialism|Liberal socialism}}

=== Leninism and precedents ===
{{main|Authoritarian socialism|Blanquism|Leninism|Marxism–Leninism}}
Blanquism is a conception of revolution named for [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]]. It holds that socialist revolution should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators.<ref>[http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/blanquism.php WisdomSupreme.com definition of Blanquism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629144204/http://www.wisdomsupreme.com/dictionary/blanquism.php |date=29 June 2017 }}, last retrieved 25 April 2007</ref> Upon seizing power, the revolutionaries introduce socialism.<ref>[http://www.newyouth.com/archives/theory/glossary/b.html#Blanquism NewYouth.com entry for Blanquism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821163359/http://www.newyouth.com/archives/theory/glossary/b.html#Blanquism |date=21 August 2008 }}, last retrieved 25 April 2007</ref> [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]]<ref name="bern">{{cite web |author=Lenin |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch06.htm#s2 |title=The State and Revolution |year=1917}}</ref> criticised Lenin, stating that his conception of revolution was elitist and Blanquist.<ref>Rosa Luxemburg as part of a longer section on Blanquism in her "Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy" (later published as "Leninism or Marxism?"), writes: "For Lenin, the difference between the [[Social democracy]] and Blanquism is reduced to the observation that in place of a handful of conspirators we have a class-conscious proletariat. He forgets that this difference implies a complete revision of our ideas on organisation and, therefore, an entirely different conception of centralism and the relations existing between the party and the struggle itself. Blanquism did not count on the [[direct action]] of the working class. It, therefore, did not need to organise the people for the revolution. The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup. Indeed, to assure the success of the revolutionary conspiracy, it was considered wiser to keep the mass at some distance from the conspirators.Rosa Luxemburg, [http://www.marx.org/archive/luxemburg/1904/questions-rsd/ch01.htm ''Leninism or Marxism?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927072108/http://www.marx.org/archive/luxemburg/1904/questions-rsd/ch01.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}, [http://www.marx.org Marx.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928115854/http://marx.org/ |date=28 September 2011 }}, last retrieved 25 April 2007</ref> Marxism–Leninism combines Marx's [[scientific socialist]] concepts and Lenin's [[anti-imperialism]], [[democratic centralism]] and [[vanguardism]].<ref>''Marxism–Leninism''.

According to Arthur Lipow, Marx and Engels were "the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism", described as a form of "socialism from below" that is "based on a mass working-class movement, fighting from below for the extension of democracy and human freedom". This [[type of socialism]] is contrasted to that of the "authoritarian, antidemocratic creed" and "the various totalitarian collectivist ideologies which claim the title of socialism" as well as "the many varieties of 'socialism from above' which have led in the twentieth century to movements and state forms in which a despotic '[[new class]]' rules over a statified economy in the name of socialism", a division that "runs through the history of the socialist movement". Lipow identifies [[Bellamyism]] and [[Stalinism]] as two prominent authoritarian socialist currents within the history of the socialist movement.<ref>Lipow, Arthur (1991).

=== Religious socialism ===
{{main|Religious socialism}}
[[Christian socialism]] is a broad concept involving an intertwining of Christian religion with socialism.

[[Islamic socialism]] is a more [[Spirituality|spiritual]] form of socialism. Muslim socialists believe that the teachings of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] are compatible with principles of [[Social equality|equality]] and [[public ownership]], drawing inspiration from the early Medina welfare state he established. Muslim socialists are more conservative than their Western contemporaries and find their roots in [[anti-imperialism]], [[anti-colonialism]] and [[Arab nationalism]]. Islamic socialists believe in deriving legitimacy from political [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] as opposed to religious texts.

Many socialists were early advocates for [[LGBT rights]]. For early socialist [[Charles Fourier]], true freedom could only occur without suppressing passions, as the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. Writing before the advent of the term "homosexuality", Fourier recognised that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and ''androgénité''. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that "affirming one's difference" can actually enhance social integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desbazeille|first=Michèle Madonna|date=1990|title=Le Nouveau Monde amoureux de Charles Fourier : une écriture passionnée de la rencontre|journal=Romantisme|volume=20|issue=68|pages=97–110|doi=10.3406/roman.1990.6129|issn=0048-8593}}</ref><ref>[[Charles Fourier]], ''Le Nouveau Monde amoureux'' (written 1816–18, not published widely until 1967: Paris: Éditions Anthropos). pp. 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463.</ref> In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man Under Socialism]]'', he advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McKenna|first=Neil|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=giD2qu4C-sUC}}|title=The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde|date=5 March 2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-3492-4|language=en}} According to McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organisation that aimed to legalise homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of "the Cause".</ref> [[Edward Carpenter]] actively campaigned for homosexual rights.

Eco-socialism is a political strain merging aspects of socialism, Marxism or libertarian socialism with green politics, ecology and [[alter-globalisation]].

De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]].

Many [[green parties]] around the world such as the [[GreenLeft|Dutch Green Left Party]] (GroenLinks) employ eco-socialist elements. Radical [[red-green alliance]]s have been formed in many countries by eco-socialists, radical greens and other radical left groups. In [[Denmark]], the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] was formed as a coalition of numerous radical parties. Within the [[European Parliament]], a number of leftist parties from Northern Europe have organised themselves into the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

=== Syndicalism ===
{{main|Syndicalism}}
{{see also|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
Syndicalism operates through industrial trade unions. It rejects [[state socialism]] and the use of establishment politics. Syndicalists reject state power in favour of strategies such as the [[general strike]]. Syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production. Some Marxist currents advocate syndicalism, such as [[De Leonism]]. Anarcho-syndicalism views syndicalism as a method for workers in [[capitalist society]] to gain control of an economy. The [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] was largely orchestrated by the anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]].<ref>[[Sam Dolgoff]]. ''[[The Anarchist Collectives|The Anarchist Collectives Workers' Self-management in the Spanish Revolution 1936–1939]]''. Free Life Editions; 1st edition (1974)</ref> The [[International Workers' Association]] is an international federation of anarcho-syndicalist [[labour unions]] and initiatives.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticism of socialism}}
Socialism is criticized in terms of its [[Socialist economics|models of economic organization]] as well as its political and social implications. Other critiques are directed at the [[socialist movement]], [[Socialist Party|parties]] or existing [[Socialist state|states]]. Some criticisms occupy theoretical grounds (such as in the [[economic calculation problem]] and the [[socialist calculation debate]]) while others support their criticism by examining historical attempts to establish socialist societies. Because of socialism's many varieties, most critiques focused on a specific approach. Proponents of one approach typically criticize others.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}
