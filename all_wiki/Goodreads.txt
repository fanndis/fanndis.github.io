The website's offices are located in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.insidebayarea.com/news/ci_22954537/book-lovers-seething-over-amazon-acquisition-goodreads | newspaper = Inside Bay area | title = Book lovers seething over Amazon acquisition of Goodreads| date = April 4, 2013 }}.</ref> The company is owned by the online retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/business/media/amazon-to-buy-goodreads.html|title=Amazon to Buy Social Site Dedicated to Sharing Books|last=Kaufman|first=Leslie|date=March 28, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 16, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Founders===
Goodreads founders
Otis Chandler and Elizabeth Khuri Chandler first met whilst studying at Stanford (Engineering and English respectively). After university Chandler initially worked as a programmer in on-line businesses,<ref>https://stanfordmag.org/contents/book-buddies</ref> including dating sites,<ref> https://mixergy.com/interviews/goodreads-otis-chandler/</ref> and Khuri Chandler as a journalist.<ref> https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/a-well-read-trojan-goodreads-co-founder-builds-a-literary-community/</ref>

===Foundation and mission===
Goodreads was founded in 2006. The idea came about when Otis Chandler (Co-Founder) was browsing through his friend's bookshelf. He wanted to integrate this scanning experience and to create a space where people could write reviews regarding the books that they read<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Goodreads|url=https://www.goodreads.com/about/us|access-date=2020-12-01|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref> 

Goodreads' stated mission is "to help people find and share books they love ... [and] to improve the process of reading and learning throughout the world."<ref name = "Goodreads About us" /> Goodreads addressed what publishers call the "discoverability' problem" by guiding consumers in the digital age to find books they might want to read.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/books/goodreadscom-is-growing-as-a-popular-book-site.html|title=Goodreads.com Is Growing as a Popular Book Site|last=Kaufman|first=Leslie|date=February 12, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>

===Early years===
During its first year of business, the company was run without any formal funding. In December 2007, the site received funding estimated at $750,000 from [[angel investors]].<ref name="TCAngel" /> This funding lasted Goodreads until 2009, when Goodreads received two million dollars from True Ventures.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn | title =What Goodreads will do with its new millions|url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2009/12/goodreads-venture-capital-millions.html |access-date= August 6, 2012| newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= December 14, 2009}}</ref> 

In October 2010, the company opened its [[application programming interface]], which enabled developers to access its ratings and titles.<ref>{{cite web|work=Read write Web|date=October 2010|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/10/goodreads-launches-social-read.php|title=Goodreads Launches Social Reading API|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126035249/http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/10/goodreads-launches-social-read.php|archive-date=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, Goodreads acquired Discovereads, a book recommendation engine that employs "machine learning algorithms to analyze which books people might like, based on books they've liked in the past and books that people with similar tastes have liked."<ref name = "Miller 2011" /><ref name = "hopkins1">{{cite web| last= Hopkins| first= Curt| title = Goodreads Buys Recommendation Service Discovereads | url = http://readwrite.com/2011/03/10/goodreads_buys_recommendation_service_discovereads | publisher = ReadWrite| date= March 10, 2011}}</ref> After a user has rated 20 books on its five-star scale, the site will begin making recommendations. Otis Chandler believed this rating system would be superior to Amazon's, as Amazon's includes books a user has browsed or purchased as gifts when determining its recommendations.<ref name = "Miller 2011" /><ref name="hopkins1"/> Later that year, Goodreads introduced an algorithm to suggest books to registered users and had over five million members.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news|last=Frassica|first=Matt|title=For ebook devotees, reading is a whole new experience|url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2011-07-03-digital-library-ebooks_n.htm |work= [[The Courier-Journal|The Louisville Courier Journal]]| publisher= [[USA Today]] | access-date =July 28, 2011|date= July 2, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s Macy Halford noted that the algorithm wasn't perfect, as the number of books needed to create a perfect recommendation system is so large that "by the time I'd got halfway there, my reading preferences would have changed and I'd have to start over again."<ref>{{cite web|last=Halford|first= Macy|date=November 2011 | title= Getting Good at Goodreads|url = http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/getting-good-at-goodreads-1.html |work= The New Yorker|access-date=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

===2013 acquired by Amazon===
In March 2013, Amazon made an agreement to acquire Goodreads in the second quarter of 2013 for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1801563&highlight= | title = Amazon.com to Acquire Goodreads | publisher = Corporate IR | access-date = March 28, 2013 | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141004075809/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1801563&highlight= | archive-date = October 4, 2014 | url-status = dead }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family | title = Goodreads | contribution = Exciting News About Goodreads: We're Joining the Amazon Family!}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/business/media/amazon-to-buy-goodreads.html?_r=0 |title= Amazon to Buy Social Site Dedicated to Sharing Books |work= [[The New York Times]] | first = Leslie | last = Kaufman | date = March 28, 2013 |access-date=March 29, 2013}}</ref> Amazon had previously purchased the competitor [[Shelfari]] in 2008,<ref name="BB">{{cite news|last=Kaufman |first=Leslie |date=March 29, 2013 |title=Amazon to Buy Social Site Dedicated to Sharing Books |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/business/media/amazon-to-buy-goodreads.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 26, 2019 }}</ref> with the Goodreads purchase "stunning" the book industry.

===2014–2019===
In January 2016, Amazon announced that it would shut down Shelfari in favor of Goodreads, effective March 16, 2016. Users were offered the ability to export data and migrate accounts.<ref name=AmazonKillsShelfari>{{cite web|website=The Reader's Room|title=Amazon Kills Shelfari |url=http://thereadersroom.org/2016/01/12/amazon-kills-shelfari/ |date= January 12, 2016 }}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}} In April 2016, Goodreads announced that over 50 million user reviews had been posted to the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the-digital-reader.com/2016/04/07/goodreads-reaches-new-milestone-fifty-million-reviews/|title=Goodreads Reaches New Milestone: Fifty Million Reviews|work=The Digital Reader}}</ref>

The site provides default bookshelves—read, currently-reading, to-read—and the opportunity to create customized shelves to categorize a user's books.<ref>{{cite web | title = Groups| url = https://www.goodreads.com/group |work=Goodreads | access-date=November 15, 2011}}</ref>

=== Content access ===

Members can receive the regular newsletter featuring new books, suggestions, author interviews, and poetry. If a user has written a work, the work can be linked on the author's profile page, which also includes an author's blog.<ref>{{cite web|last= Strickland|first= Jonathan|title= How Goodreads Works | url = http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/networks/goodreads.htm | work =How Stuff Works |access-date=November 29, 2012|date= July 14, 2009}}</ref> Goodreads organizes offline opportunities as well, such as in-person book exchanges and "literary pub crawls".<ref>{{cite news|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|title=Goodreads reaches 10 million users|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/14/news/la-jc-goodreads-reaches-10-million-users-20120813 |work=Los Angeles Times| access-date=November 29, 2012|date=August 14, 2012}}</ref>

=== User interaction ===
The website facilitates reader interactions with authors through the interviews, giveaways, authors' blogs, and profile information. There is also a special section for authors with suggestions for promoting their works on Goodreads.com, aimed at helping them reach their target audience.<ref>{{cite web| title = Author Program | url= https://www.goodreads.com/author/program| work= Goodreads |access-date=November 29, 2012}}</ref> By 2011, "seventeen thousand authors, including [[James Patterson]] and [[Margaret Atwood]]" used Goodreads to advertise.<ref name="Miller 2011" />

Users can add each other as "Friends", enabling easy sharing of reviews, posts, book recommendations, and messages.

Additionally, Goodreads has a presence on [[Facebook]], [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]], and other social networking sites.<ref name="techcrunch1">{{cite web|last= Ha | first = Anthony|title= Reading Is Alive And Well At Social Reading Site Goodreads, Which Just Hit 10M Members|url= https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/13/goodreads-10-million-members/ |work= Tech Crunch| publisher= AOL Tech| access-date= November 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title= Goodreads | url = https://twitter.com/goodreads | work = Twitter | access-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Goodreads |url= http://pinterest.com/goodreads/ | work = Pinterest | access-date =December 20, 2012}}</ref> Linking a Goodreads account with a social networking account like Facebook enables the ability to import contacts from the social networking account to Goodreads, expanding one's Goodreads "Friends" list. There are settings available, as well, to allow Goodreads to post straight to a social networking account, which informs, e.g., Facebook friends, what one is reading or how one rated a book.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goodreads|url=http://www.goodreads.com/|website=Goodreads|access-date=June 15, 2014}}</ref>

=== Reading challenge ===
Users can set themselves an annual reading challenge which constitutes a target number of books to be read in each year. A tracker is added to the users homepage which provides a progress bar given as the percentage of the target. The tracker also informs the user whether they are "on track to complete" their reading challenge and states the number of books "behind-" or "ahead- of schedule" they are. In 2018, over 4 million users set themselves a reading challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/show/7501-2018-reading-challenge|title=2018 Reading Challenge|website=Goodreads|access-date=December 27, 2018}}</ref>

Book catalog data was seeded with large imports from various closed and open data sources, including individual publishers, Ingram,<ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 9, 2017|title=Goodreads Librarians Group – New Ingram Import|url=https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/894961-new-ingram-import|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref> Amazon (before 2012 and after 2013),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1620164-large-book-data-import|title=Goodreads Librarians Group – Adding New Books: Large Book Data Import (showing 1-50 of 472)|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/776968-amazon-is-going-away-as-a-data-source| title= Amazon is going away as a data source| quote=At Goodreads, we make it a priority to use book information from the most reliable and open data sources}}</ref> [[Worldcat]] and the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/766331-announcement-goodreads-to-import-worldcat-library-of-congress-data-to|author= Patrick |title= Goodreads Librarians Group discussion – Announcement: Goodreads to Import WorldCat & Library of Congress Data Tonight|date=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

Goodreads librarians improve book information on the website, including editing book and author information and adding cover images. Goodreads members can apply to become volunteer librarians after they have 50 books on their profile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/help/show/6-what-is-a-goodreads-librarian|title=What is a goodreads librarian?|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref> Goodreads librarians coordinate on the Goodreads Librarian Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/220-goodreads-librarians-group|title=Goodreads Librarians Group|website=Goodreads|access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>

=== Amazon requirements controversy ===
In January 2012, Goodreads switched from using Amazon's public Product Advertising API for book [[metadata]] (such as title, author, and number of pages) to book wholesaler Ingram. Goodreads felt Amazon's requirements for using its API were too restrictive, and the combination of Ingram, the [[Library of Congress]], and other sources would be more flexible. Some users worried that their reading records would be lost, but Goodreads had a number of plans in place to ease the transition and ensure that no data was lost, even for titles that might be in danger of deletion because they were available only through Amazon, such as Kindle editions and self-published works on Amazon.<ref>{{cite web|last=Owen|first=Laura Hazard|title=As Goodreads Ends Sourcing From Amazon, Users Fear Lost Books|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/01/27/419-as-goodreads-ends-agreement-with-amazon-users-fear-lost-books/|work=Paid Content: The Economics of Digital Content|publisher=Gigaom|access-date=November 29, 2012|date=January 27, 2012}}</ref> In May 2013, as a result of Goodreads' acquisition by Amazon, Goodreads began using Amazon's data again.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rivka|title=The Announcement You've All Been Waiting For |url=https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1338564-the-announcement-you-ve-all-been-waiting-for|work=Goodreads Librarians Group forums|publisher=goodreads.com|access-date=July 17, 2013|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>

== Competition and review fairness ==
In 2012, after a reviewer wrote a poor review of [[The Selection|a novel]], [[Kiera Cass|the novel's author]] and publisher discussed publicly on Twitter how to "knock it off" the front page of the novel's Goodreads page. This sparked a furor about the relationship between authors and reviewers on Goodreads.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Jolie C |title=Professionals and nonprofessionals on Goodreads: Behavior standards for authors, reviewers, and readers|journal=[[New Media & Society]]|date=July 9, 2016|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2305–2322 r|doi=10.1177/1461444815582141}}</ref>  That same year, Goodreads received criticism from users about the availability and tone of reviews posted on the site,<ref name=SALON>{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Laura|title=How Amazon and Goodreads could lose their best readers |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/10/23/how_amazon_and_goodreads_could_lose_their_best_readers/ |work=Salon |date=October 23, 2013 |access-date=August 5, 2017}}</ref> with some users and websites stated that certain reviewers were harassing and encouraging attacks on authors.

And while much of this might seem like nothing more than petty playground behavior between children who honestly do not have a clear good guy or bad guy, keep in mind that several e-book retailers incorporate the Goodreads' API into their sales pages, effectively posting book reviews that many in the Goodreads community know to be false, and nothing more than an act of revenge against an author; real-world sales decisions have been made by consumers based on these reviews.|Mercy Pilkington|Good E-Reader News<ref>{{cite web| last=Pilkington|first=Mercy|title=Goodreads Modifies User Terms to Prevent Author Bullying, Reviewers Outraged |url=http://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/goodreads-modifies-user-terms-to-prevent-author-bullying-reviewers-outraged |publisher=goodereader.com |date=September 21, 2013 |access-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>}}

Regarding the 2013 Amazon acquisition of Goodreads, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Goodreads was a rival to Amazon as a place for discovering books" and that this deal "consolidates Amazon's power to determine which authors get exposure for their work".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Leslie |date=March 28, 2013 |title=Amazon to Buy Goodreads |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/business/media/amazon-to-buy-goodreads.html |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>

== Goodreads Choice Awards ==
The Goodreads Choice Awards is a yearly award program, first launched on Goodreads in 2009. Users are able to vote for the books that Goodreads has nominated and are also able to nominate books of their choosing, released in the given year. The majority of books that Goodreads itself nominates are from Goodreads authors.  The final voting round collects the top 10 books from 20 different categories.<ref>{{cite news|title=Goodreads launches its 2012 awards|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/30/entertainment/la-et-jc-goodreads-launches-2012-readers-choice-awards-20121030 |access-date=November 27, 2012|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Carolyn|last=Kellogg|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Some feel that Goodreads' dominant position, coupled with limited development by Amazon, has prevented better tools emerging for personalized book recommendations. Some also feel that Goodreads is biased towards political liberals.<ref> https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon</ref>

==Curiosity==
