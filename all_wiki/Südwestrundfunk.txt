==History==
[[File:Süddeutscher Rundfunk 1924.jpg|thumb|Program guide of Süddeutsche Rundfunk AG (SÜRAG) Stuttgart (18 September 1924)]]
{{Main|History of Südwestrundfunk}}
SWR was established in 1998 through the merger of ''Süddeutscher Rundfunk'' (SDR, Southern German Broadcasting), formerly headquartered in Stuttgart, and ''Südwestfunk'' (SWF, South West Radio), formerly headquartered in Baden-Baden. The existence of two public broadcasting corporations in southwest Germany was a legacy of the [[Allied occupation of Germany]] after the [[Second World War]]. The French Military Government established SWF as the sole public broadcaster in their occupation zone. This area was later divided into the [[States of Germany|states]] of [[South Baden]], Württemberg-Hohenzollern and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The American Military Government established SDR in [[Württemberg-Baden]]. When [[South Baden|Baden]], Württemberg-Hohenzollern and [[Württemberg-Baden]] merged to form [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952, the corporations were not merged, although SDR and SWF operated several joint services.

The two corporations had intended to merge in 1990, but the merger was pushed back by the [[German reunification|reunification process]].

== Finances ==

[[television licence|Licensing fees]] required for radio and TV sets are €17.50 per month, as of 1 April 2015.
These fees are not collected directly by the SWR but by the [[Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio]] that is a common organisation of [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], its members, [[ZDF]] and [[Deutschlandradio]].

In 2016, the SWR received over {{currency|1 billion|EUR}} from these fees, out of nearly {{currency|8 billion|EUR}} collected in total that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/e175/e5042/Jahresbericht_2016.pdf|title=Jahresbericht 2016|publisher=ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice|page=33|language=de|date=June 2017|accessdate=3 May 2018}}</ref>
