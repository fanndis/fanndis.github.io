'''Timothy James Pawlenty''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|n|t|i}};<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ap.org/Minnesota/prono.html |title=Minnesota Pronunciation Guide |publisher=Associated Press in Minnesota |author=Baenen, Jeff |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722194213/http://www.ap.org/minnesota/prono.html |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> born November 27, 1960) is an American businessman and politician. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he served as the [[List of Governors of Minnesota|39th]] [[governor of Minnesota]] from 2003 to 2011. From 1993 to 2003 he served in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]], where he was [[Minnesota House Majority Leader|majority leader]] for two terms. In 2011, he ran for the Republican presidential nomination and was subsequently a leading contender to be [[Mitt Romney]]'s running mate before serving as co-chair of Romney's campaign.

Pawlenty was born in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] and raised in nearby [[South St. Paul, Minnesota|South St. Paul]]. He graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]] and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] His early career included stints as a labor law attorney and the vice president of a [[software as a service]] company. After settling in [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]] with his wife, Pawlenty was appointed to the city's Planning Commission and was elected to the Eagan City Council at the age of 28. In 1992 he was elected to represent District 38B, in suburban [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]]. He was reelected four times and was voted majority leader by House Republicans in 1998.

After narrowly winning the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2002, Pawlenty won the three-way general election. He was reelected in 2006 by a margin of less than one percent. His campaign platform focused on balancing the budget without raising taxes. During Pawlenty's governorship, he did not raise income taxes, but did increase some taxes and user fees. His administration advocated for numerous public works projects, including work on the [[Northstar Line|Northstar Commuter Rail Line]] and the construction of [[Target Field]] (a [[Major League Baseball]] stadium in [[Minneapolis]]). He signed a bill mandating 20% [[gasohol|ethanol in gasoline]] by 2013. He cut health care costs in an attempt to balance the budget and borrowed funds from the state's K-12 education and low income programs. He signed an executive order rejecting federal funds related to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. He also led worldwide trips for business leaders and trade delegations to explore trade opportunities. In the 2007–08 term, Pawlenty served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]].

Pawlenty was rumored to be a contender for both the Republican [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|presidential]] and [[Republican Party vice presidential candidate, 2008|vice presidential]] nominations in the 2008 election, and he ran for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican presidential nomination]] from May to August 2011. After withdrawing from that race, he became a finalist to join [[Mitt Romney]] on the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 ticket]] as a [[Republican Party vice presidential candidates, 2012|vice presidential candidate]].<ref name="cnn20120812cland">{{cite news

In the general election, Pawlenty faced two strong opponents. His main rival was veteran [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party|Democratic–Farmer–Labor]] (DFL) state senator [[Roger Moe]]. Former Democratic Congressman [[Tim Penny]] ran on the [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] ticket (Governor [[Jesse Ventura]], a member of the Independence Party, chose not to seek reelection).

===State budget===
Pawlenty was elected in 2002 on a platform of balancing the state's budget without raising taxes. He emphasized his campaign and first term with the [[Taxpayers League of Minnesota]] slogan "no new taxes."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citypages.com/2005-01-19/news/minnesota-eats-itself/|title=Minnesota Eats Itself Another Pawlenty budget, another round of bloodletting|author=Britt Robson|date=January 19, 2005|newspaper=City Pages|accessdate=August 31, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924103101/http://www.citypages.com/2005-01-19/news/minnesota-eats-itself/|archive-date=September 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His governorship was characterized by a historically low rate of spending growth. According to the Minnesota Management and Budget Department, general-fund expenditures from 2004 to 2011 increased an average of 3.5% per two-year term, compared to an average of 21.1% from 1960 to 2003 (these numbers are not inflation-adjusted).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/budget/report-spend/mar11.pdf |title=Historical expenditures: General fund and all funds |publisher=Minnesota Management and Budget Department |date=March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/01/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-he-brought-minnesota-state-spend/ |title=Tim Pawlenty said he brought Minnesota state spending growth down 'to about 1.7 percent per year.' |work=[[PolitiFact.com]] |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=April 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="mpr-spendingclaim">{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/polinaut/archive/2011/01/poligraph_pawle_4.shtml |title=PoliGraph: Pawlenty spending claim lacks context |work=MPR News |publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] |date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> [[University of Minnesota]] political science professor Larry Jacobs said that slowing state spending and opposing tax increases were Pawlenty's signature issues.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sharpiro|first=Walter|title=The Tragedy of TIm Pawlenty: He Did Everything Right.

In his first year as governor, Pawlenty inherited a projected two-year budget deficit of $4.3&nbsp;billion, the largest in Minnesota's history.<ref name="stpaul-wins" /> After a contentious budget session with a Democrat-controlled [[Minnesota Senate|Senate]], he signed a package of fee increases, spending reductions, and government reorganization that eliminated the deficit. It reduced the rate of funding increases for state services, including transportation, social services, and welfare, and enacted a perennial proposal to restructure city aid based on immediate need rather than historical factors. Pawlenty agreed to several compromises, abandoning a public employee wage freeze and property tax restrictions.<ref name="stpaul-wins">{{cite news |title=Pawlenty wins, but risks attached – his no-new-taxes pledge may become a liability later |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=June 1, 2003 |author=Salisbury, Bill}}</ref>

During his second term, Pawlenty erased a $2.7-billion deficit by cutting spending, shifting payments, and using one-time federal stimulus money.<ref name="Scheck-MPR" /> His final budget (2010–11) was the state's first two-year period since 1960 in which net government expenditures decreased. Pawlenty has claimed this as "the first time in 150 years" that spending was cut, but fact-checkers disputed this claim as no public budget records before 1960 are known to exist.<ref name="mpr-spendingclaim" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/12/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-2009-we-cut-state-spending-real-/ |title=Tim Pawlenty said in 2009, 'we cut state spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years' |work=[[PolitiFact.com]] |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>

Some criticized Pawlenty for providing a short-term budget solution but coming up short in his long-term strategy as governor.

After the ruling, as the 2010 legislative session drew to a close, Pawlenty vetoed a budget that would have fixed a $2.9-billion deficit by adding a new tax bracket for six-figure incomes.

In 2011, Pawlenty shut down an [[Islamic finance]] program that was part of a larger program to increase home ownership in Minnesota. His spokesperson said the program accommodated the [[Riba|Muslim ban on interest]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tim Pawlenty: I shut down Sharia loan program|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20047261-503544.html|publisher=[[CBS News]] | first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=March 25, 2011}}</ref> Adam Sorensen from [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] questioned whether this was a case of double standards, pointing out New York's [[kosher]] food regulations, [[Blue Laws]] that prohibit alcohol sales on Sundays, and Pawlenty's own creation of "The Governor's Council On Faith-Based And Community Initiatives".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Is There a Double Standard in Tim Pawlenty's Disavowal of Sharia-Compliant Mortgages?|url=http://swampland.time.com/2011/03/25/is-there-a-double-standard-in-tim-pawlentys-disavowal-of-sharia-compliant-mortgages/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=March 25, 2011}}</ref>

===Education===
In the budget process, Pawlenty made an effort to preserve education funding while cutting other government spending. In 2009, he bolstered education funding with federal stimulus grants. Despite this, education funding fell from $9,700 to $8,400 per student (adjusted for inflation) during his tenure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/mark-dayton/mark-dayton-says-gov-tim-pawlenty-cut-education-sp/ |title=Mark Dayton says Gov.

In 2010, Pawlenty vetoed a bill that the legislature had passed 110 to 20 (HF 3164), calling for Minnesota State Colleges & Universities (MnSCU) to revamp its credit-transferring system within five years to fix "minimal loss of credits for transferring students" who had been losing between 10 and 30 percent of their credits.<ref name="Schumacher">{{cite news|author=Schumacher, Lawrence|date=May 3, 2010|url=http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/news/2010/05/03/pawlenty-nixes-college-student-credit-transfer-fix|title=Pawlenty nixes college student credit transfer fix|work=Twin Cities Daily Planet|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Pawlenty found it "unnecessary" because MnSCU was fixing its system already "through internal actions and policy changes".<ref name="Schumacher" />

Pawlenty favored raising fees and imposing toll lanes on roads as the primary means of discouraging excessive traffic. During his term, the [[carpool lane]]s of [[Interstate 394]] leading into downtown Minneapolis were converted into [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes.

===Crime===
Crime in Minnesota was a high-profile political issue during Pawlenty's governorship. When crime rates in [[Minneapolis]] spiked 16% from 2004 to 2005, city officials blamed Pawlenty for large cuts to state aid, which they said restricted public safety resources. He in turn criticized the city for poorly allocating its funding.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-147471900/crime-jumps-politicos-trade.html |title=When crime jumps, politicos trade blame: experts say one elected official can't do much to raise—or lower—crime rates |author=Stassen-Berger, Rachel E. |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=June 26, 2006 |page=A1}}</ref>

Pawlenty made two large efforts to expand penalties for [[sexual offender]]s. In response to his first proposal in 2005, the state legislature passed a large package of sentencing reforms. One new instrument was the possibility of a life sentence without parole for serious offenders. Pawlenty expressed disapproval of the courts' reluctance to use this option: only seven people received such a sentence in its first two years of implementation.<ref name="stpaul-sexcrimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-218654761/pawlenty-time-get-tougher.html |title=Pawlenty: Time to get tougher on sex crimes – Some offenders would get 25 years; others, even more |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=February 10, 2010 |author=Hoppin, Jason |page=A1}}</ref> He pushed for even harsher sentences in 2010, increasing the presumptive sentence for first-degree sex offenses from 12 years to 25 and increasing it further for repeat offenders. At the same time he advocated a $90-million expansion of the state's [[civil commitment]] program for sexual offenders, maintaining that the increased criminal sentences would keep the commitment program's cost under control.<ref name="stpaul-sexcrimes" /> According to the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', "A report on Minnesota's sex-offender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the Pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee to reflect the former governor's skepticism about the effectiveness of treatment and to delete arguments for expanded community resources for offenders."<ref>{{cite news |author=Ludeman, Cal |date=February 7, 2011 |url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/115534414.html?page=all&prepage=1&c=y |title=Details on sex offender program deleted |work=[[Star Tribune]] |accessdate=January 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402085227/http://www.startribune.com/politics/115534414.html?page=all&prepage=1&c=y |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Early in 2006, after issuing a study that estimated the cost of [[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration to the state]] as approximately $188&nbsp;million, Pawlenty announced a program for changing the way the state dealt with persons who were in the United States illegally. Pawlenty said that the economic benefits of illegal immigration did not justify the illegal behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/jan-june06/immigration_3-22.html|title=Minnesota's Immigration Debate|publisher=Twin Cities Public Broadcasting|author=Jim Lehrer|date=March 22, 2006}}</ref> Pawlenty's extensive proposal included the designation of 10 state law enforcement officials as the Minnesota Illegal Immigration Enforcement Team, "trained to question, detain and arrest suspected illegal immigrants" with a focus on "such crimes as human trafficking, identity theft, methamphetamine distribution and terrorism." He rounded out his proposal with tougher penalties for false identification, and instituting a fine of up to $5,000 for employers of illegal immigrants. His proposal was challenged by DFL senators who preferred increased legal immigration to punitive action.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-140480158/illegal-immigration-real-issue.html |title=Illegal immigration a 'real issue': Pawlenty defends crackdown, but not all agree with tactics |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date=January 4, 2006 |author=Salisbury, Bill |page=A1}}</ref>

===Energy policy and climate change===

Minnesota has mandated a 10% mixture of [[gasoline]] and [[ethanol]] ([[gasohol]]) since 1997. Pawlenty has also lobbied the Governors' Ethanol Coalition to mandate higher ethanol use nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCallum |first=Laura |title=Pawlenty pumps ethanol|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=September 26, 2005|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/26_mccalluml_ethanol/|accessdate=August 6, 2007}}</ref>

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] Republican governors were not supportive of Pawlenty's presentation on [[clean energy]] to the governor's association, which he gave in cooperation with [[Ed Rendell]], who was the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|governor of Pennsylvania]] and the National Governors Association's Democratic vice-chairman. With [[Kathleen Sebelius]] of Kansas, Pawlenty was co-chair of the association's energy committee. The effort received "adamant opposition" from governors of oil producing states.<ref name="Novak" />

In 2007, Governor Pawlenty signed the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007 into law and, along with six other Midwestern governors, the [[Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord]].   These directed state agencies to develop a plan to reduce [[greenhouse gases]], and "develop a market-based and multi-sector [[cap-and-trade]] mechanism".<ref name="FactCheckCap">{{cite web|title=Pawlenty's Political Climate Change|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2011/01/pawlentys-political-climate-change/|work=Fact-Check.org}}</ref>  However, by 2009 Pawlenty had reversed his position and called cap-and-trade "overly bureaucratic" and a potential "disaster".<ref name="FactCheckCap"/>  By 2011, Pawlenty's position had changed sufficiently to state "the weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes."<ref>{{cite news|last=herb|first=jeremy|title=Remarks highlight Pawlenty's climate shift|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/126811373.html?refer=y|accessdate=August 10, 2012|newspaper=minneapolis star tribune|date=August 4, 2011}}</ref>

===Health===
In 2004, Minnesota's ''[[Star Tribune]]'' newspaper opined that the credibility of Pawlenty's commissioner of health, Dianne Mandernach, suffered when a website posting by the department suggested that abortion might have a role in breast cancer. She also angered many when it was learned she had delayed releasing government research on cancer in miners. In 2007, Mandernach resigned.<ref>{{cite news

In 2005, Pawlenty asked a U.S. Senate subcommittee to allow his [[MinnesotaCare]] health plan to expand and continue allowing state residents and employees to import cheaper Canadian prescription drugs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/02/16_scheckt_drugimports/|title=Measuring the success of Canadian drug imports|author=Tom Scheck|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=February 16, 2005|accessdate=September 12, 2008}}</ref>

In 2007, Pawlenty signed into law the 2007 Omnibus Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill, which provided funding for the Health Care Transformation Task Force, a panel of health care experts charged with exploring ways to reduce health care spending, improve quality, and ensure that Minnesota develops a universal health care plan by 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/State-Health-Reform1.pdf|title=The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured|publisher=The Henry J.

Later in his tenure he used health care funding cuts as a mechanism to balance the state budget.  After years of assuring doctors that the state "sick tax" would be used only to fund health welfare programs, in 2009 Pawlenty recommended a 3% cut in physician reimbursements from the state and asked that the sick tax be put instead into the state's general budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mnmed.org/News/NewsFullStory/tabid/2266/ArticleID/3246/CBModuleId/3348/Default.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904000519/http://www.mnmed.org/News/NewsFullStory/tabid/2266/ArticleID/3246/CBModuleId/3348/Default.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |title=Pawlenty uses veto power to cut health care |publisher=Mnmed.org |accessdate=October 31, 2010 }}</ref> Pawlenty used a line-item veto to remove $381 million from health and human services funding, a removal which could lead to 35,000 Minnesotans' losing their General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC) health insurance in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|author=Scheck, Tom|title=Pawlenty, lawmakers remain at odds over budget issues|date=May 15, 2009|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/05/15/lawmakers_assess_impact_of_pawlentys_budget_vetoes/|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio News|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> [[Hennepin County Medical Center]]—the largest provider of health care to Minnesota's poor and uninsured—closed two clinics, reduced its staff and reduced access to non-emergency services.<ref>{{cite news|author=Williams, Chris (Associated Press)|date=November 18, 2009|title=HCMC approves big cuts in 2010 budget|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/11/18/hcmc-to-adopt-2010-budget-deep-cuts-expected/|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}</ref> State Senator [[Linda Berglin]] wrote a bill that would extend GAMC funding.<ref>{{cite news|author=McIntee, Mike |title=Vets To Feel Governor Pawlenty's GAMC Cuts |url=http://theuptake.org/2010/02/09/vets-to-feel-governor-pawlentys-gamc-cuts/ |date=February 9, 2010 |publisher=The Uptake |accessdate=February 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806222742/http://theuptake.org/2010/02/09/vets-to-feel-governor-pawlentys-gamc-cuts/ |archive-date=August 6, 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, he refused federal health care funds including more than $1 billion to expand the number of Minnesotans covered by Medicaid, $68 million for a high-risk insurance pool, $1 million to help set up an insurance exchange where consumers could shop for health coverage, and $850,000 for teenage pregnancy prevention. Pawlenty accepted a $500,000 abstinence-only sex-education grant that would require $350,000 in matching state money.

===Book tour and political positions===
[[File:Tim Pawlenty by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Pawlenty at a book signing in February 2011 in Phoenix, Arizona.]]

He thinks the [[United States Supreme Court]] decided ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' wrongly, abortion being a state, not a federal, matter. He opposes [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]], and said on talk radio "... I have been a public supporter of maintaining [[Don't ask, don't tell]] and I would support reinstating it as well".<ref name="Fischer">{{cite AV media|people=Bryan Fischer and Tim Pawlenty|title=AFA's Bryan Fischer Interviews Tim Pawlenty|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiK5EIjO1uA|publisher=YouTube (Google)|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>

In December 2010, Pawlenty was one of three U.S. governors who publicly declared solidarity with the Christian-right group [[Family Research Council]].<ref name="FRC">{{cite news|author=Duffy, J.P.|title=FRC, Members of Congress, Governors, and Conservative Leaders Release Open Letter Calling for Civil Debate, End to Character Assassination|url=http://www.frc.org/pressrelease/frc-members-of-congress-governors-and-conservative-leaders-release-open-letter-calling-for-civil-debate-end-to-character-assassination|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}</ref>

Pawlenty's tour was in Minneapolis, San Francisco and Dallas, and it ended January in Iowa where the Iowa Caucuses were scheduled for February 6, 2012.  "That will come up fast," he said, "if I do run." In Minneapolis, speaking to Pat Kessler of [[WCCO-TV]] who asked about his feelings regarding a potential run for president by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Michele Bachmann]], "I have a lot of respect for Michele Bachmann … Whether she runs or not, it's gonna be a big field. There's gonna be five, six, seven, eight people running … Whoever wants to run can run. The more, the merrier."<ref name="Weiner" />

In a December 2010 column in ''The Wall Street Journal'', Pawlenty argued in favor of the historical benefits of "private sector" [[labor unions]] and strongly against "public sector" labor unions, whose collective bargaining rights he would like to see curbed: "The rise of the labor movement in the early 20th century was a triumph for America's working class. In an era of deep [[economic anxiety]], unions stood up for hard-working but vulnerable families, protecting them from physical and economic exploitation." He also criticized modern unions: "The moral case for unions—protecting working families from exploitation—does not apply to public employment... Unionized public employees are making more money, receiving more generous benefits, and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever-higher taxes, deficits and debt."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703766704576009350303578410 |title=Government Unions vs. Taxpayers |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 13, 2010 |author=Pawlenty, Tim}}</ref>
