'''Brigitte Zypries''' (born 16 November 1953) is a German lawyer and [[politician]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). Between 2017 and 2018, she served as Minister for Economics and Energy in the government of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]]; she was the first woman to hold that office in German history.

Zypries had previously been Parliamentary State Secretary since December 2013, charged with the coordination of Germany's aviation and space policies. She was [[Federal Minister of Justice (Germany)|Federal Minister of Justice]] of Germany from 2002 to 2009 and State Secretary at the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] from 1998 to 2002.

== Early life and education ==
Zypries studied law at the [[University of Giessen]] from 1972 to 1977, and took her first legal state exam in 1978. Then followed in-service training in the regional court district of Gießen, and in 1980 the second state exam. Until 1985 she worked at the University of Giessen.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
* 1985–1988: Assistant head of division at State Chancellery of [[Hesse]]
* 1988–1990: Member of academic staff at the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]
* 1991: Head of division of the State Chancellery of [[Lower Saxony]]
* 1995–1997: Head of department of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony
* to 1998: Active in the Ministry for Women, Labour and Social Affairs of Lower Saxony

=== State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior, 1998-2002===
Following the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal elections]], in the first cabinet of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]], Zypries became [[Secretary of State|State Secretary]] in the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] under [[Otto Schily]]. From September 1999, she chaired the State Secretary Committee for the management of the Federal Government program "Modern State – Modern Administration".

=== Federal Minister of Justice, 2002 – 2009 ===
Following the [[2002 German federal election|2002 federal elections]], Zypries became [[Federal Minister of Justice (Germany)|Federal Minister of Justice]] in the second cabinet of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]], succeeding [[Herta Däubler-Gmelin]]. Between 2007 and 2009, she was also one of 32 members of the [[Federalism commission (Germany)|Second Commission on the modernization of the federal state]] (''Föderalismuskommission II''), which had been established to reform the division of powers between federal and state authorities in Germany.

In 2003, Zypries represented the German government before the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] when the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] challenged a German law allowing authorities to eavesdrop on conversations in private homes. While law-enforcement officials and the government argue that the law helps fight organized crime and terrorism, opponents contend it violates constitutional privacy guarantees and has not allowed authorities to crack a single major case.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/02/world/top-german-court-hears-a-challenge-to-eavesdropping.html Top German Court Hears a Challenge To Eavesdropping] ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 2, 2003.</ref>

In 2005, the German government suffered a major setback in its efforts to combat terrorism after the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled that the country's implementation of the [[European Arrest Warrant]] was unconstitutional. The court said the EU idea was compatible with Germany's constitution, but that the law drafted by Zypries was sloppily written and did not go far enough in framing the leeway offered to prosecutors by the European Arrest Warrant.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/german-papers-germany-released-al-qaida-terror-suspect-a-365819.html German Papers: Germany Released al-Qaida Terror Suspect] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', July 19, 2005.</ref> Just hours after the ruling, German police released terrorism suspect [[Mamoun Darkazanli]], who had been held awaiting extradition to [[Spain]] where he is believed to have been linked to [[al-Qaida]] activities.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/german-papers-germany-released-al-qaida-terror-suspect-a-365819.html German Papers: Germany Released al-Qaida Terror Suspect] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', July 19, 2005.</ref> When German economics minister [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] decided to outsource the drafting of new bankruptcy legislation in 2009, Zypries criticized that Guttenberg wasted taxpayers’ money and that it was the responsibility of her ministry, not his, to oversee the preparation of the legislation.<ref>Judy Dempsey (August 26, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/world/europe/27germany.html In Dull German Race, ’08 Dinner Is an Issue] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> In 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that a law requiring telecommunications companies to [[Data retention|retain data]] from telephone, email and Internet traffic is unconstitutional; the law had been introduced by Zypries as implementation of an EU guideline.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/taking-on-the-internet-giants-germany-applies-brakes-to-google-co-a-682790.html Taking on the Internet Giants: Germany Applies Brakes to Google & Co.] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', March 11, 2010.</ref>

In the negotiations to form a government following the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal elections]], Zypries led the SPD's delegations in the working groups on justice, consumer protection, and internal affairs; her co-chairs from the CDU/CSU were [[Wolfgang Bosbach]], [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], respectively.<ref>Timot Szent-Ivanyi (October 25, 2005), [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/koalitionsverhandlungen---union-und-spd-haben-bei-der-zweiten-runde-die-finanzfragen-in-angriff-genommen--denn-die-not-ist-gross---auch-die-der-sozialkassen--gutverdiener-sollen-hoehere-kassenbeitraege-zahlen,10810590,10330710.html Gutverdiener sollen höhere Kassenbeiträge zahlen] ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]''.</ref>

After German prosecutors had issued arrest warrants in 2007 for 13 suspected [[CIA]] operatives believed to have been involved in the abduction of [[Khaled el-Masri]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] in late 2003 as well as in his being taken via [[Baghdad]] to a secret CIA prison in [[Afghanistan]] in January 2004, Zypries soon decided not to further pursue the CIA agents. Though their names were still on an [[Interpol]] wanted persons list, the United States stated that it would not recognize its validity. Zypries explained that the US government had made clear to her that it would neither arrest nor hand over the agents. In the end, she concluded that, given the slim chances of success, it made no sense to even try to get them extradited.<ref>Matthias Gebauer and John Goetz (December 9, 2010), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-cia-s-el-masri-abduction-cables-show-germany-caved-to-pressure-from-washington-a-733860.html The CIA's El-Masri Abduction: Cables Show Germany Caved to Pressure from Washington] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref>

On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, Zypries participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Israel in Jerusalem in March 2008.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/bilateral/pages/bilateral%20agreements%20reached%20at%20first%20israeli-german%20intergovernmental%20consultations%2017-mar-2008.aspx Bilateral agreements reached at first Israeli-German intergovernmental consultations] [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], press release of March 17, 2008.</ref>

In the case of [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] in 2009, Zypries said that the German government was willing to press charges against the bishop if he did not clearly retract his comments.<ref>Rachel Donadio (February 27, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/world/europe/28bishop.html Vatican Calls the Apology of a Bishop Insufficient] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

In 2009, Zypries led the resistance to the [[Google Books Library Project]] in Germany. In the daily ''[[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]]'', she accused [[Google]] of behaving in a "simply unlawful" way.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/digital-library-controversy-google-gives-ground-at-eu-hearing-a-647700.html Digital Library Controversy: Google Gives Ground at EU Hearing] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', September 8, 2009.</ref>

=== Member of Parliament, 2009 – 2017 ===
Between 2009 and 2013, Zypries served on the German [[Bundestag]]’s Committee on the Election of Judges (''Wahlausschuss''), which is in charge of appointing judges to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]. From 2009, she was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] (BGH), the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]] (BVerwG), the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Fiscal Court]] (BFH), the [[Federal Labour Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]] (BAG), and the [[Federal Social Court of Germany|Federal Social Court]] (BSG).

Ahead of the [[2013 German federal election|2013 elections]], [[Peer Steinbrück]] included Zypries in his [[shadow cabinet]] for the Social Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent [[Angela Merkel]] as chancellor. During the campaign, Zypries served as shadow minister for consumer protection. In the negotiations to form a so-called [[Grand coalition|Grand Coalition]] following the elections, she led the SPD delegation in the working group on digital policy; her co-chair was [[Dorothee Bär]] of the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]].

Following the formation of the grand coalition in December 2013, Zypries was appointed Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy. In January 2014, she became the government's coordinator for aviation and space policies.

In February 2014, Zypries accompanied German [[President of Germany|President]] [[Joachim Gauck]] on a state visit to [[India]] – where they met with [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] and [[Sonia Gandhi]], among others – and [[Myanmar]].<ref>Anne Merholz (February 5, 2014), [http://www.bild.de/politik/ausland/gauck-joachim/so-exotisch-ist-die-indienreise-des-bundespraesidenten-34554728.bild.html Großes Staatsbankett für Gauck] ''[[Bild]]''.</ref>

In June 2016, Zypries announced that she would not stand in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal elections]] but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.<ref>[http://www.fr-online.de/darmstadt/darmstadt-zypries-tritt-nicht-mehr-an,1472858,34327946.html Zypries tritt nicht mehr an] ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', June 5, 2016.</ref>

===Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, 2017 – 2018===
In a [[cabinet reshuffle]] following the nomination of [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] as candidate for the federal presidency, Zypries was appointed Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy on 27 January 2017. She succeeded Sigmar Gabriel, who took the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs from Steinmeier.

During her time in office, Zypries led the government's efforts to save Germany's then second-largest airline [[Air Berlin]]. When the company filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] in August 2017, she authorized a bridging loan of 150 million euros ($176 million) to allow Air Berlin to keep its planes in the air for three months and secure the jobs of its 7,200 workers in Germany while negotiations with [[Lufthansa]] continue.<ref>Madeline Chambers and Joseph Nasr (August 15, 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-berlin-lufthansa-idUSKCN1AV14E Germany provides 150 million euro bridging loan to insolvent Air Berlin] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In the negotiations to form a [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|fourth]] coalition government under [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] following the [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal elections]], Zypries led the working group on economic affairs, alongside [[Thomas Strobl]] and [[Alexander Dobrindt]].

==Later career==
Since 2019, Zypries has been serving as [[Ombudsman|ombudsperson]] for BDIU, the national association of Germany's credit management, debt collection and debt purchase sector.<ref>[http://www.inkasso.de/node/1452 Inkassounternehmen wählen Brigitte Zypries einstimmig zur Ombudsfrau] Bundesverband Deutscher Inkasso-Unternehmen (BDIU), press release of April 12, 2019.</ref>

== Political positions ==
Zypries is considered a proponent of regulating more tightly access to Internet platforms such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Apple Inc.]]’s [[iTunes]]. A joint letter to the [[European Commission]] in November 2014, signed by Zypries and her French counterpart [[Axelle Lemaire]] on behalf of the German and French governments, suggested “essential” digital platforms should potentially be brought under existing rules for telecoms markets, a standalone regulation or specially tailored antitrust rules.<ref>Alex Barker, Jeevan Vasagar and Michael Stothard (November 27, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a5689f7a-7653-11e4-a704-00144feabdc0.html Euro-MPs eye action to break up Google] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

Zypries is a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/statements/page/4/|title=Statements|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Controversies ==
Ending a nasty diplomatic dispute between the United States and Germany, Zypries announced at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in 2006 that the German government was dropping its decades-long resistance to opening the archives kept at the [[International Tracing Service]] in the town of [[Bad Arolsen]].<ref>David Stout (April 19, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/world/europe/19nazi.html Germany Agrees to Open Holocaust Archive] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

On 3 June 2007, Zypries caused some controversy by saying at a meeting of [[G8]] [[justice minister]]s in [[Munich]] that it should be assumed that missing [[United Kingdom|British]] child [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]] was abducted by a gang that passes on children to be abused.<ref>{{cite news| title = Madeleine paedophile gang theory 'is likely'| publisher = [[The Scotsman]]| date = 2007-06-03 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=867592007}}</ref>

In response to a 2007 meeting between chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and the [[Dalai Lama]], China canceled a high-level meeting on the protection of intellectual property rights of Chinese legal experts and Zypries in retaliation. A statement from the German Justice Ministry later said the meeting was called off "for technical reasons."<ref>Judy Dempsey (September 23, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/world/europe/23iht-berlin.4.7609899.html Despite censure from Beijing, Merkel meets with Dalai Lama in Berlin] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> The opposition [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], which was in coalition with then-Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s Social Democrats from 1998 to 2005, also praised Merkel's stance.<ref>Judy Dempsey (September 23, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/world/europe/23iht-berlin.4.7609899.html Despite censure from Beijing, Merkel meets with Dalai Lama in Berlin] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>
