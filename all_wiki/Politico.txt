''Politico Magazine'' published an article in April 2017 purporting to show long-term links among U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/the-happy-go-lucky-jewish-group-that-connects-trump-and-putin-215007|title=The Happy-Go-Lucky Jewish Group That Connects Trump and Putin|date=April 9, 2017|work=Politico}}</ref> The article was widely condemned, with the head of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[Jonathan Greenblatt]], saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zalman|first1=Jonathan|title=Politico's Dubious Chabad Story Receives Widespread Criticism|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/229930/politicos-dubious-chabad-story-receives-widespread-criticism|date=April 10, 2017|work=Tablet Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Politico goes full 'Elders of Zion,' silenced by the college mob & other comments|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/10/politico-goes-full-elders-of-zion-silenced-by-the-college-mob-other-comments/|work=New York Post|date=April 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Politico says Chabad is Trump's partner in – something.

In March 2019 Politico was accused again of [[anti-semitism]] when an article depicting imagery of presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] next to money trees was published. Sanders, one of two [[Jew]]ish candidates for the [[2020 US presidential election]], was targeted for the amount of wealth he accumulated over his lifetime.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mediaite.com/donald-trump/aoc-calls-out-politico-for-anti-semitic-tweet-labeling-bernie-sanders-as-rich-and-cheap|title=AOC Calls Out Politico for ‘Anti-Semitic’ Tweet Labeling Bernie Sanders as 'Rich' and 'Cheap'|date=March 25, 2019|newspaper=Mediaite}}</ref> Politico staff writer Michael Kruse wrote the article detailing the senator's wealth, writing that Sanders "might still be cheap", according to one of the senator's friends, "but he's sure not poor", apparently combining two anti-Semitic tropes (Jews are cheap; Jews are rich). Politico's official Twitter account used the quote to share the story; the tweet was later deleted.<ref>"AOC Blasts Politico for 'Money Trees' Next to Bernie Sanders", Newsmax, Monday May 27, 2019; https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/aoc-politico-bernie-sanders-anti-semitism/2019/05/27/id/917725/</ref>

== Ideology and influence ==
In a 2007 opinion piece, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] watchdog group [[Media Matters for America]] accused ''Politico'' of having a "Republican tilt".<ref name="PolMM">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0307/3013.html|title=Media Matters Response|date=March 6, 2007|work=Politico|author=Harris, John F.|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> A 2012 study found that the percentage of ''Politico'' readers who identify as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]—29%—is equal to the percentage who identify as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/2012/many-politics-sites-draw-partisan-audiences-but-politico-strikes-a-perfect-balance/172183/|title=Many politics sites draw partisan audiences, but Politico strikes a perfect balance|last=Sonderman|first=Jeff|date=April 30, 2012|website=Poynter Institute|access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>

Multiple commentators have credited ''Politico''{{'}}s original organizational philosophy—namely, prioritizing scoops and publishing large quantities of stories—with forcing other, more-established publications to make a number of changes, such as increasing their pace of production and changing their tone.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/opinion/sunday/douthat-how-the-post-was-lost.html|title=How the Post Was Lost|last=Douthat|first=Ross|date=August 10, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 28, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kraushaar|first=Josh|date=June 2009|title=Online News Leads Presidential Campaign Cycle |journal=Journalism Studies|volume=10|issue=3|pages=435–438|doi=10.1080/14616700902987256}}</ref>
