In [[psychology]], the '''psyche''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|aɪ|k|i}} is the totality of the [[human mind]], [[Consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Amoroso|first=Richard|title=Unified Field Mechanics Ii: Formulations And Empirical Tests - Proceedings Of The Xth Symposium Honoring Noted French Mathematical Physicist Jean-pierre Vigier|last2=Gianni|first2=Albertini|last3=Kauffman|first3=Louis|last4=Peter|first4=Rowlands|publisher=World Scientific|year=2018|isbn=978-981-323-203-7|location=Singapore|pages=601}}</ref> Carl Jung also included in this definition the overlap and tension between the personal and the collective elements in man.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Perroni|first=Emilia|title=Play: Psychoanalytic Perspectives, Survival and Human Development|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415682077|location=East Sussex|pages=136}}</ref> 

Psychology is the scientific or objective study of the psyche. The word has a long history of use in [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], dating back to ancient times, and represents one of the fundamental concepts for understanding human nature from a scientific point of view. The English word [[soul]] is sometimes used synonymously, especially in older texts.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hillman J (T Moore, Ed.) |title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1989 |page=20 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The basic meaning of the Greek word ψυχή (''psyche'') was "life", although unsupported,<ref>Henry George Liddell and Ridley Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dyuxh%2F entry "psyche"].</ref> some have claimed it is derived from the verb ψύχω (''psycho'', "to blow").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dundes|first=Lauren|title=The Psychosocial Implications of Disney Movies|publisher=MDPI|year=2019|isbn=978-3-03897-848-0|location=Basel|pages=205}}</ref> Derived meanings included "spirit", "soul", "ghost", and ultimately "self" in the sense of "conscious personality" or "psyche".<ref>See p.187-197, 204 of {{Citation

==Ancient psychology==
The idea of the psyche is central to the philosophy of [[Plato]]. Scholars translate the Platonic conceptualization of the term as "soul" in the sense that he believed that it is immortal.<ref>{{Cite book|last=King|first=D. Brett|title=History of Psychology: Ideas and Context, Fifth Edition|last2=Woody|first2=William Douglas|last3=Viney|first3=Wayne|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780205963041|location=Oxon|pages=60}}</ref> In his [[Phaedo]], Plato has [[Socrates]] give four arguments for the immortality of the soul and life after death following the separation of the soul from the body.<ref>Plato, ''Phaedo'' 69e-84b.</ref> Plato's Socrates also states that after death the Psyche is better able to achieve wisdom and experience the [[Platonic forms]] since it is unhindered by the body.<ref>Plato, ''Phaedo'' 59c-69e</ref>

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote an influential [[On the Soul|treatise on the psyche]], called in Greek {{lang|grc|Περὶ Ψυχῆς}} (''Peri Psyches''), in [[Latin]] ''De Anima'' and in English ''On the Soul''. In this work, he used the concept of the soul to explain certain functions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Polansky|first=Ronald|title=Aristotle's De Anima: A Critical Commentary|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-139-46605-9|location=Cambridge|pages=104}}</ref> Since - for him - the soul is motion, it needs an explanatory principle for bodily motion.<ref name=":0" /> Aristotle's theory of the "three souls (psyches)" (vegetal, animal, and rational) would rule the field of psychology until the 19th century. Prior to Aristotle, a number of Greek writings used the term ''psyche'' in a less precise sense.<ref>Cf. Rohde, ''Psyche'', Chapters I and VII. Also see the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche|Eros and Psyche]], where Psyche was the embodiment of the soul.</ref> In late antiquity, [[Galen|Galenic medicine]] developed the idea of three "spirits" (''[[pneuma]]'') corresponding to Aristotle's three souls. The ''pneuma psychikon'' corresponded to the rational soul. The other two pneuma were the ''pneuma physicon'' and the ''pneuma zoticon''.

==Medieval psychology==
The term ''psyche'' was [[Latin (language)|Latinized]] to ''anima'', which became one of the basic terms used in [[Thomas Aquinas#Psychology|medieval psychology]]. ''Anima'' would have traditionally been rendered in English as "soul" but in modern usage the term "psyche" is preferable.<ref>Simon Kemp, ''Medieval Psychology''; Simon Kemp, ''Cognitive Psychology in the Middle Ages''; Anthony Kenny ''Aquinas on Mind''.</ref>

==Phenomenology==
19th century psychologists such as [[Franz Brentano]] developed the concept of the psyche in a more subjective direction.

==Psychoanalysis==
In [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]], the psyche refers to the forces in an individual that influence [[cognition|thought]], [[behavior]] and [[Personality psychology|personality]].<ref>Cf. Reed, Edward S., 1998, on the narrowing of the study of the psyche into the study of the mind. Especially [https://books.google.com/books?id=kK2OUFOCZcoC&pg=PP17&dq=Reed,+Edward+S.,+on+the+narrowing+of+the+study+of+the+psyche+into+the+study+of+the+mind.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMqrK1kLngAhXHo1kKHcEJBXEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=%20narrowing%20of%20the%20study%20of%20the%20psyche%20into%20the%20study%20of%20the%20mind.&f=false Preface, page xv].</ref>

===Freudian school===
{{Main|Id, ego, and super-ego}}
[[Sigmund Freud]], the father of psychoanalysis, believed that the psyche—he used the word ''Seele'' ('soul', but also 'psyche') throughout his writings—was composed of three components:<ref>{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Arthur S.|author2=Reber, Emily S.|title=Dictionary of Psychology|publisher=Penguin Reference|year=2001|location=New York|isbn=0-14-051451-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar00rebe_0}}</ref>

* The id, which represents the instinctual drives of an individual and remains largely [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].It does not respect the rules of society. 

* The super-ego, which represents a person's conscience and their internalization of societal norms and morality.
* The ego, which is conscious and serves to integrate the drives of the id with the prohibitions of the super-ego. Freud believed this conflict to be at the heart of [[neurosis]].

Freud's original terms for the three components of the psyche, in German, were ''das Es'' (lit. the 'It'), ''das Ich'' (lit. the 'I'), and ''das Über-Ich'' (lit. the 'Over-I' or 'Upper-I'). According to [[Bruno Bettelheim]], the Latin terms were proposed by Freud's English translators, probably to make them seem more 'medical' since, at the time, Latin was prevalent in medical terminology. Bettelheim deplores what he sees as pseudoscientific, Latin terms.<ref>''Freud and Man's Soul'', Vintage Books, 1984, pp.52-62.</ref>

===Jungian school {{anchor|Jung psyche def}}===
[[Carl Jung]] wrote much of his work in German. Jung was careful to define what he meant by psyche and by soul (''Seele'').

<blockquote>
I have been compelled, in my investigations into the structure of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], to make a conceptual distinction between ''soul'' and ''psyche''. By psyche, I understand the totality of all psychic processes, [[conscious]] as well as unconscious. By soul, on the other hand, I understand a clearly demarcated functional complex that can best be described as a "personality". (Jung, 1971: Def. 48 par. 797)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
[In previous translations, and in this one as well, ''psyche''—for which Jung in the German original uses either ''Psyche'' or ''Seele''—has been used with reference to the totality of ''all'' psychic processes (cf. Jung, ''Psychological Types'', Def. 48); i.e., it is a comprehensive term. ''Soul'', on the other hand, as used in the technical terminology of analytical psychology, is more restricted in meaning and refers to a "function complex" or partial personality and never to the whole psyche. It is often applied specifically to "anima" and "animus"; e.g., in this connection it is used in the composite word "soul-image" (''Seelenbild''). This conception of the soul is more primitive than the Christian one with which the reader is likely to be more familiar. In its Christian context it refers to "the transcendental energy in man" and "the spiritual part of man considered in its moral aspect or in relation to God." ...  — Editors.] (Jung, 1968: note 2 par. 9)
</blockquote>

==Cognitive psychology==
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology}}
The word "[[mind]]" is preferred by cognitive scientists to "psyche". The mind is a set of cognitive faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, language and memory. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/mind | title = mind – definition of mind in English | website=lexico.com| publisher= Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref> It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.
