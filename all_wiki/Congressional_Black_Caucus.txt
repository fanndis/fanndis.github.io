The '''Congressional Black Caucus''' ('''CBC''') is a [[Caucuses of the United States Congress|caucus]] made up of most [[African Americans|African-American]] members of the [[United States Congress]]. Representative [[Karen Bass]] from [[California]] has chaired the caucus since 2019.<ref name=cbcleaders /><ref name=sourcecbc /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasentinel.net/congressional-black-caucus-chair-cedric-richmond-say-goodbye-to-seat-as-he-prepares-to-pass-chair-to-rep-karen-bass.html|title=Congressional Black Caucus Chair Cedric Richmond Says Goodbye to Seat as he Prepares to Pass "Chair" to Rep.

==History==
===Founding===
The predecessor to the caucus was founded in January 1969 as the '''Democratic Select Committee''' by a group of African-American members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], including [[Shirley Chisholm]] of New York, [[Louis Stokes]] of [[Ohio]] and [[Bill Clay|William L. Clay]] of [[Missouri]]. African-American representatives had begun to enter the House in increasing numbers during the 1960s, and they had a desire for a formal organization.<ref name="Creation"/> Further, Congressional redistricting in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement resulted in the number of black Congressmembers from nine to thirteen.<ref name="Creation"/> The first chairman, [[Charles Diggs]], served from 1969 to 1971.

This organization was renamed the Congressional Black Caucus in February 1971 on the motion of [[Charles B. Rangel]] of New York. The thirteen founding members of the caucus were [[Shirley Chisholm]], [[Bill Clay|William L. Clay Sr.]], [[George W. Collins]], [[John Conyers]], [[Ron Dellums|Ronald Dellums]], [[Charles Diggs]], [[Augustus F. Hawkins]], [[Ralph Metcalfe]], [[Parren Mitchell]], [[Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.|Robert Nix]], [[Charles Rangel]], [[Louis Stokes]], and Washington, D.C,. delegate [[Walter E. Fauntroy|Walter Fauntroy]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = History|url = https://cbc-butterfield.house.gov/history|website = Congressional Black Caucus|access-date = February 6, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160327060750/https://cbc-butterfield.house.gov/history|archive-date = March 27, 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> Chisholm referred to the group as "unbought and unbossed".<ref name="nyt-taylor-end-black-politics">{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Keeanga-Yamahtta |title=Opinion: The End of Black Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/opinion/sunday/black-politicians-george-floyd-protests.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=16 June 2020 |date=June 13, 2020}}</ref>

President [[Richard Nixon]] refused to meet with the newly-formed group, and so the CBC chose to boycott the 1971 [[State of the Union]] address, leading to their first joint press coverage.<ref name="Creation"/> On March 25, 1971, Nixon finally met with the CBC, who presented him with a 32-page document including "recommendations to eradicate racism, provide quality housing for African-American families, and promote the full engagement of African-Americans in government".<ref name="Creation"/> All the members of the caucus were included on the [[master list of Nixon political opponents]].{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

On June 5, 1972, shortly before the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] would nominate [[George McGovern]] for president, the CBC wrote and released two documents: the [[Black Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Black Bill of Rights]].<ref name="nyt-taylor-end-black-politics"/> [[Louis Stokes]] read a preamble and both documents into the record of the House of Representatives.<ref name="Creation"/> The Black Bill of Rights includes sections on jobs and the economy, foreign policy, education, housing, public health, minority enterprise, drugs, prison reform, black representation in government, civil rights, voting rights in the District of Columbia, and the military.<ref name="GPO-CRECB-1972-pt15-7-3">{{USCongRec|1972|E19754|date=June 5, 1972}}</ref> These documents were inspired by the [[National Black Political Convention]] and its own manifesto, ''The Gary Declaration: Black Politics at the Crossroads''<ref name="gary-declaration">{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/primary/gary-declaration-national-black-political-convention-1972 |title=Gary Declaration, National Black Political Convention, 1972 {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> (also called the Black Agenda).

In 1977, the organization was involved in the founding of [[TransAfrica]], an education and advocacy affiliate that was formed to act as a resource on information on the African continent and its Diaspora.<ref name="TransAfrica">{{cite web|title=TransAfrica|url=http://africanactivist.msu.edu/organization.php?name=TransAfrica|website=African Activist Archives|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=April 17, 2016}}</ref> They worked closely with this organization to start the national anti-[[apartheid]] movement in the US, [[Free South Africa Movement]] (characterized by sit-ins, student protests, it became the longest lasting civil disobedience movement in U.S history) and to devise the legislative strategy for the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986]] that was subsequently passed over [[Ronald Reagan]]'s veto. The organization continues to be active today and works on other campaigns.<ref name="TransAfrica"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Senate Rebukes Reagan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yuxSAAAAIBAJ&dq=anti-apartheid%20act%20senate&pg=6111%2C354872|accessdate=February 20, 2016|work=The Courier|date=October 3, 1986|page=28}}</ref>

===Funding===
In late 1994, after [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] [[Republican Revolution|attained a majority in the House]], the House passed House Resolution 6 on January 4, 1995, which prohibited “the establishment or continuation of any legislative service organization..."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/104/bills/hres6/BILLS-104hres6ath.pdf|title=thomas.loc.gov 104th Congress, H.Res.6, Section 222}}</ref> This decision was aimed at 28 organizations, which received taxpayer funding and occupied offices at the Capitol, including the CBC. Then-chairman [[Kweisi Mfume]] protested the decision. The CBC reconstituted as a Congressional Member Organization.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cortés|first1=Carlos E.|title=Multicultural America: A Multimedia Encyclopedia|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452276267|page=1118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ1zAwAAQBAJ|chapter=House of Representatives, U.S.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ1zAwAAQBAJ&q=%22Congressional+Black+Caucus%22+%22Congressional+Member+Organization%22&pg=PA1118}}</ref>

==Goals==
The [[Congressional caucus|caucus]] describes its goals as "positively influencing the course of events pertinent to African Americans and others of similar experience and situation", and "achieving greater equity for persons of African descent in the design and content of domestic and international programs and services."

The CBC encapsulates these goals in the following priorities: closing the achievement and opportunity gaps in education, assuring quality health care for every American, focusing on employment and economic security, ensuring justice for all, retirement security for all Americans, increasing welfare funds, and increasing equity in foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Priorities of the Congressional Black Caucus for the 109th Congress|url=http://www.house.gov/watt/cbc/cbcpriorities.htm|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|accessdate=April 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230080634/http://www.house.gov/watt/cbc/cbcpriorities.htm|archive-date=December 30, 2005}}</ref>

Representative [[Eddie Bernice Johnson]] (D–TX), has said:

<blockquote>The Congressional Black Caucus is one of the world's most esteemed bodies, with a history of positive activism unparalleled in our nation's history. Whether the issue is popular or unpopular, simple or complex, the CBC has fought for thirty years to protect the fundamentals of democracy. Its impact is recognized throughout the world. The Congressional Black Caucus is probably the closest group of legislators on the Hill. We work together almost incessantly, we are friends and, more importantly, a family of freedom fighters. Our diversity makes us stronger, and the expertise of all of our members has helped us be effective beyond our numbers.</blockquote>

[[Mark Anthony Neal]], a professor of [[African-American]] studies and popular culture at [[Duke University]], wrote a column in late 2008 that the Congressional Black Caucus and other African-American-centered organizations are still needed, and should take advantage of "the political will that [[Obama]]'s campaign has generated."<ref name="neal duke">{{cite news |first=Camille |last=Jackson |title= Hitting the Ground Running |url=http://today.duke.edu/2008/12/obama_experts.html |publisher=[[Duke University]] This Month at Duke |date = December 19, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2009 }}</ref>

The caucus has grown steadily as more black members have been elected. At its formal founding in 1971, the caucus had thirteen members.<ref name="Creation" /> As of 2019, it had 55 members, including two who are non-voting members of the House, representing the [[District of Columbia]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].

===Senate members===
As of 2019, there have been eight African-American senators since the caucus's founding. The six black U.S. senators, all Democrats, who are or have been members of the Congressional Black Caucus are Senator [[Cory Booker]] of New Jersey, elected in 2013, and Senator [[Kamala Harris]] of California, elected in 2016, both currently serving; former senators [[Carol Moseley Braun]] (1993–1999), [[Barack Obama]] (2005–2008), and [[Roland Burris]] (2008–2010), all of Illinois; and former senator [[Mo Cowan]] (2013) of Massachusetts. Burris was appointed by [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois governor]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] in December 2008 to fill Obama's seat for the remaining two years of his Senate term after Obama was elected [[president of the United States]]. Cowan was appointed to temporarily serve until a special election after [[John Kerry]] vacated his Senate seat to become U.S. secretary of state.

Senator [[Edward Brooke]], a Republican who represented Massachusetts in the 1960s and 1970s, was not a member of the CBC. In 2013, Senator [[Tim Scott]], Republican of South Carolina, also chose not to join the CBC after being appointed to fill [[Jim DeMint]]'s Senate seat.

===African-American Republicans in the CBC===
The caucus is officially non-partisan; but, in practice, the vast majority of African Americans elected to Congress since the CBC's founding have been [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]. Eight black [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] have been elected to Congress since the caucus was founded in 1971: Senator [[Edward Brooke]] of Massachusetts (1967–1979), [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[Melvin H. Evans]] of the Virgin Islands (1979–1981), Representative [[Gary Franks]] of Connecticut (1991–1997), Representative [[J. C. Watts]] of Oklahoma (1995–2003), Representative [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] of Florida (2011–2013), Senator [[Tim Scott]] of South Carolina (2013–present), Representative [[Will Hurd]] of Texas (2015–present), and Representative [[Mia Love]] of Utah (2015–2019). Of these eight, only Evans, Franks, West, and Love joined the CBC; currently, the caucus includes no Republicans.

Edward Brooke was the only serving African-American U.S. senator when the CBC was founded in 1971, but he never joined the group and often clashed with its leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9905?ret=True|work=History, Art & Archives: United States House of Representatives|title=Brooke, Edward William, III|date=January 3, 2015|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> In 1979 [[Melvin H. Evans]], a non-voting delegate from the Virgin Islands, became the first Republican member in the group's history. [[Gary Franks]] was the first Republican voting congressman to join in 1991, though he was at times excluded from CBC strategy sessions, skipped meetings, and threatened to quit the caucus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/rep.-allen-west-and-the-congressional-black-caucus/article/554707|first=Fred|last=Barnes|title=Rep.

In [[2014 United States House of Representatives elections|2014]], two African-American Republicans were elected to the House. Upon taking office, [[Will Hurd]] from Texas declined to join the caucus, while [[Mia Love]] from Utah, the first black Republican congresswoman, joined.<ref name="Congressional Black Caucus Members">{{cite web|title=Congressional Black Caucus Members|url=http://cbc-butterfield.house.gov/members/|publisher=Congressional Black Caucus|accessdate=January 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114081523/http://cbc-butterfield.house.gov/members/|archive-date=January 14, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>[[File:African Americans in US House.svg|thumb|Map of congressional districts represented by African-Americans in the [[116th United States Congress|116th Congress]]]]

=== Non-black membership ===
All past and present members of the caucus have been African-American. In 2006, while running for Congress in a [[Tennessee]] district which is 60% black, [[Steve Cohen]], who is white and Jewish, pledged to apply for membership in order to represent his constituents. However, after his election, his application was refused.<ref name="Hearn">{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2389.html| title= Black Caucus: Whites Not Allowed|first=Josephine| last= Hearn| date=January 23, 2007| accessdate=January 23, 2007| publisher=Politico.com}}</ref> Although the bylaws of the caucus do not make race a prerequisite for membership, former and current members of the caucus agreed that the group should remain "exclusively black". In response to the decision, Cohen referred to his campaign promise as "a social faux pas" because "It's their caucus and they do things their way. You don't force your way in. You need to be invited."<ref name="Hearn"/>

Representative [[Lacy Clay]], a Democrat from Missouri and the son of Representative [[Bill Clay]], a co-founder of the caucus, said: "Mr. Cohen asked for admission, and he got his answer. He is white and the caucus is black. It is time to move on. We have racial policies to pursue and we are pursuing them, as Mr. Cohen has learned. It is an unwritten rule. It is understood." Clay also issued the following statement:

<blockquote>Quite simply, Representative Cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept—there has been an unofficial Congressional White Caucus for over 200 years, and now it is our turn to say who can join 'the club.' He does not, and cannot, meet the membership criteria unless he can change his skin color. Primarily, we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population, and we will not allow white America to infringe on those objectives.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2008/08/should-a-white-guy-get-to-join-the-black-caucus/5612/ |journal=The Atlantic|title=Should a white guy get to join the black caucus?|date=August 8, 2008|author=Ta-Nehisi Coates|author-link=Ta-Nehisi Coates}}</ref></blockquote>

Later the same week, Representative [[Tom Tancredo]], a Republican from Colorado, objected to the continued existence of the CBC as well as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]] arguing that "It is utterly hypocritical for Congress to extol the virtues of a color-blind society while officially sanctioning caucuses that are based solely on race. If we are serious about achieving the goal of a colorblind society, Congress should lead by example and end these divisive, race-based caucuses."<ref name="msnbctancredo">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16812597|title=Tancredo: Abolish black, Hispanic caucuses|date=January 25, 2007|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=April 19, 2009}}</ref>
