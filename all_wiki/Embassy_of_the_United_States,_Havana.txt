==History==
[[File:Havanna 1973 buidling of the former US embassy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Embassy on the [[Malecón, Havana|Malecón]] in the distance beyond the José Martí Anti-Imperialist Platform, ca. 1973.]]
The current [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] was designed in the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]]—[[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist style]] by the architectural firm [[Harrison & Abramovitz]]. It is a long and six-story concrete and glass building, completed in 1953. The gardens were designed by Californian [[landscape architect]] [[Thomas Dolliver Church]]. The contractor for the building was Jaime Alberto Mitrani, PE, also a professor of civil engineering at the University of Havana. The embassy complex is located directly on the Malecón and the [[José Martí Anti-Imperialist Platform]], in proximity to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Cuba)|Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].

After the U.S. diplomatic mission became defunct in 1961, the building was not used by American personnel until the opening of the interests section on September 1, 1977.<ref>[http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/sites/international_history_politics/shared/working_papers/WPIHP-Fischer.pdf Talking to the Bearded Man: The Swiss Mandate to Represent U.S. Interests in Cuba, 1961–1977.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729112440/http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/sites/international_history_politics/shared/working_papers/WPIHP-Fischer.pdf |date=July 29, 2014 }} [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]].</ref> In 1963, [[Prime Minister of Cuba]] [[Fidel Castro]] ordered the confiscation of the complex, but action was never taken by the [[Politics of Cuba|Cuban government]], though it still claimed right to the property in 2012.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/realestate/cuba-streetscapes-the-new-york-accented-architecture-of-havana.html?_r=0 Havana's New York Accent.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810182411/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/realestate/cuba-streetscapes-the-new-york-accented-architecture-of-havana.html?_r=0 |date=August 10, 2014 }} ''New York Times''.</ref>

During the period that the complex served as an interests section, the U.S. was represented by [[Switzerland]], and the Swiss maintained both the embassy complex and its effects. Renovations were completed on the complex in 1997.

The building was upgraded from an interests section and returned to its original role as the United States Embassy in Cuba, on July 20, 2015.<ref name="cnne"/><ref name="pole"/><ref name="reopen"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/americas/cuba-us-embassy-diplomatic-relations.html|title=U.S. and Cuba Reopen Long-Closed Embassies|date=July 20, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720151932/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/americas/cuba-us-embassy-diplomatic-relations.html|archivedate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> On August 14, 2015, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] officially reopened it; eight [[United States Congress|congressional]] lawmakers involved in the policy change attended,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2165325/john-kerry-flies-to-cuba-to-raise-flag-at-newly-opened-u-s-embassy/|title=John Kerry in Cuba as flag raised over U.S. Embassy|first1=Michael |last1=Weissenstein |first2=Bradley|last2=Klapper|date=August 14, 2015|work=Global News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815054043/http://globalnews.ca/news/2165325/john-kerry-flies-to-cuba-to-raise-flag-at-newly-opened-u-s-embassy/|archivedate=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/14/politics/cuba-embassy-opening-john-kerry-visit/|title=Kerry to reopen embassy in Cuba but tensions remain|first=Elise|last=Labott|publisher=CNN|date=August 14, 2015|work=CNN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817001809/http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/14/politics/cuba-embassy-opening-john-kerry-visit|archivedate=August 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/14/cuba-congressional-delegation-who-traveled-with-john-kerry-to-havana/|title=Cuba congressional delegation: Who traveled with John Kerry to Havana|author=Karoun Demirjian|date=August 14, 2015|work=Washington Post|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815055857/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/14/cuba-congressional-delegation-who-traveled-with-john-kerry-to-havana/|archivedate=August 15, 2015}}</ref> and the three Marines (Larry C.
