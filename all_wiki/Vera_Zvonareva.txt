==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2012}}

===1999–2002: Early career, ITF titles and Top 50===
Zvonareva started to compete on the [[ITF Women's Circuit]] in 1999, debuting at an [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tournament in Tbilisi, Georgia. She won three qualifying matches there to reach the main draw before losing in the first round. The next year, she won an ITF event in Moscow, Russia without dropping a set, despite being unranked. The event was just the second event she had played in her professional career. Five weeks later, she made her WTA-level debut at the [[Tier I]] tournament in Moscow, beating world No. 148 [[Elena Bovina]], before losing to world No. 11 [[Anna Kournikova]] in the second round. In 2001, she failed to qualify for WTA events in [[Sony Ericsson Open|Key Biscayne, Florida]] and Moscow, but reached a semifinal at the ITF tournament in [[Civitanova Marche|Civitanova]], Italy. During this time, she also showed her adeptness in juniors' competition by winning the [[Dunlop Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] under-18s event in 2000 and 2001.

In 2002 Zvonareva won her second ITF title in Naples, Florida and in July reached her first singles final on the WTA Tour at Palermo, losing to [[Mariana Díaz Oliva]] in three sets. She also achieved semifinal finishes in Warsaw and Sopot, plus a quarterfinal finish in Bol, Croatia. Zvonareva won three qualifying matches at the French Open to reach the main draw for the first time at a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament. She lost there in the fourth round to eventual champion [[Serena Williams]], 6–4, 0–6, 1–6. Her ranking was high enough for a direct entry into [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where she lost in the second round to the 23rd seed [[Iva Majoli]], 6–7(5), 2–6. At the [[2002 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Zvonareva lost to world No. 7 [[Kim Clijsters]] in the third round, 6–1, 5–7, 4–6. Her ranking rose into the top 100 after the French Open and into the top 50 after the US Open.

===2003–2004: French Open singles quarterfinal, Top 10 debut and first Grand Slam doubles title===
In 2003 Zvonareva won the title at the Tier III event in [[Croatian Bol Ladies Open|Bol]], beating [[Conchita Martínez Granados]] in the final, and reached three other semifinals (including the Tier II event in Linz). She defeated a top-10 player for the first time when she beat world no. 10 [[Anastasia Myskina]] in Berlin. At the French Open, Zvonareva defeated world No. 3 [[Venus Williams]] in the fourth round, before losing in the quarterfinals to world No. 76 [[Nadia Petrova]]. Her French Open results caused her ranking to enter the top 20. She reached the quarterfinals in six out of the seven [[Tier I]] events she contested. Her debut for the [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russian Fed Cup team]] was in the World Group quarterfinals against [[Slovenia Fed Cup team|Slovenia]]. Russia won 5–0, but lost to France 3–2 in the semifinals. In doubles, she reached her first WTA final at Moscow with Myskina. She ended the year ranked world No. 13.

In 2004 Zvonareva won her first career Grand Slam title, winning the [[mixed doubles (tennis)|mixed doubles]] competition at the [[2004 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] with [[Bob Bryan]].

In the final of the Memphis event, Zvonareva trailed hometown favorite [[Lisa Raymond]] 5–2 in the third set, before saving three match points and winning the last five games of the match to win the title, 4–6, 6–4, 7–5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/2/players/playerprofiles/PlayerBio2.asp?PlayerID=260142 |title=The Latest Top 20 WTA Rankings as of December 2013 – Sony Ericsson WTA Tour |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> In addition to this, she reached the semifinals of three Tier I tournaments in [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Rome]], [[Acura Classic|San Diego]], and [[Rogers Cup (tennis)|Montreal]]. She lost in San Diego to fellow Russian Anastasia Myskina in a match that featured a final set tiebreak that ended 17–15. Zvonareva and Myskina teamed in the final of the [[2004 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]], playing in the crucial final rubber against [[Marion Bartoli]] and [[Émilie Loit]], which the pair won, 7–6(5), 7–5, to seal Russia's first Fed Cup title.

Zvonareva ended 2004 the year ranked world No. 11. In August, she reached her then-career high of world No. 9. Because of several withdrawals, Zvonareva was able to compete at the [[2004 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]], an event reserved for the top eight players in the world. She was unable to win a match and exited at the round-robin stage.

===2005: First injury===
Zvonareva obtained an invitation from the Hong Kong Tennis Patrons' Association to play in the [[Hong Kong Tennis Classic|Watsons Water Champions Chellenge 2005]]. She defended her [[Cellular South Cup|Memphis title]], defeating [[Meghann Shaughnessy]], but she was injured in the second half of 2005 (from June to December).

===2007: Second injury===
The [[2007 WTA Tour|2007 season]] was a year of mixed fortune for Zvonareva. At the [[2007 Indian Wells Masters|2007 Pacific Life Open]], she stunned world No. 1 [[Maria Sharapova]], who was the defending champion, 4–6, 7–5, 6–1, in the fourth round, marking her first victory over a reigning world no. 1. However, she fell in the next round to [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]]. At her next tournament, the [[2007 Family Circle Cup|Family Circle Cup]], she was forced to retire when playing [[Dinara Safina]] and down a set, due to a left wrist injury. This injury kept her out of the European clay-court season, the grass-court season, and most of the North American hard-court season. On returning to the tour, she reached the third round of the US Open, losing to Serena Williams. At the remaining tournaments on her schedule, she reached the quarterfinals or better at four out of five, with semifinal finishes in Luxembourg and Quebec.

Zvonareva began the year by losing to wildcard [[Marina Erakovic]], then ranked world No. 153, at the [[WTA Auckland Open|ASB Classic]] in Auckland, New Zealand. She then reached the final of the Tier IV [[Moorilla Hobart International]] in Australia, where she did not play the final against [[Eleni Daniilidou]] because of an ankle injury. This injury also forced her to retire in her first round match at the Australian Open against [[Ai Sugiyama]], trailing 3–6, 1–1.

She then reached the final of the Tier I [[Qatar Total Open]] in Doha, beating Dinara Safina, [[Sybille Bammer]], and Li Na along the way.

Two weeks later, Zvonareva was seeded eighth at the US Open, but lost in the second round to [[Tatiana Perebiynis]] of Ukraine, 3–6, 3–6.

To finish off the year, Zvonareva qualified for the year-end [[Sony Ericsson Championships]] (open to the top eight players) for the second time in her career.
