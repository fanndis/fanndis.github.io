==History of Russian language in Ukraine==
{{Main|History of the Russian language in Ukraine}}
The East Slavic languages originated in the language spoken in [[Rus (region)|Rus]] in the [[Middle Ages | medieval period]]. Significant differences in spoken language in different regions began to be noticed{{by whom|date= September 2014}} after the division of the Rus lands between the [[Golden Horde]] (from about 1240) and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The Lithuanian  state eventually allied with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] of 1569-1795. Muscovites under the Golden Horde developed what became the modern Russian language; people in the northern Lithuanian sector developed [[Belarusian language | Belorussian]], and in the southern (Polish) sector Ukrainian.

Note that the ethnonym ''Ukrainian'' for the southern eastern Slavic people did not become well-established until the 19th century, although English-speakers (for example) called those peoples' land ''Ukraine'' in English from before the 18th century. The area was generally known in the West as "[[Ruthenia]]", and the people as "Ruthenians"{{citation needed|date= July 2014}} (The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] traces the word "Ukrainian" in English back as far as 1804, and records its application to the Ukrainian language from 1886<ref>{{oed | Ukrainian}}</ref>). The Russian imperial centre, however, preferred the names "Little" and "White" Russias for the Ukrainian and [[Belarus]]ian lands respectively, as distinct from [[Great Russia]].

No definitive geographical border separated people speaking Russian and those speaking Ukrainian - rather gradual shifts in vocabulary and pronunciation marked the areas between the historical cores of the languages. Since the 20th century, however, people have started to identify themselves with their spoken vernacular and to conform to the literary norms set by academics.{{citation needed|date= July 2014}}

===Russian settlers===
The first new waves of Russian settlers onto what is now Ukrainian territory came in the late-16th century to the empty lands of [[Slobozhanshchyna]] (in the region of [[Kharkiv]]) that [[Tsardom of Russia| Russia]] gained from the [[Golden Horde| Tatars]],<ref name="kongr" /> although Ukrainian peasants from the west escaping harsh exploitative conditions outnumbered them.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages%5CS%5CL%5CSlobidskaUkraine.htm|title= Slobidska Ukraine|website= www.encyclopediaofukraine.com|accessdate= December 28, 2017}}</ref>

More [[Russian speakers]] appeared in the northern, central and eastern territories of modern Ukraine during the late 17th century, following the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack Rebellion]] (1648–1657) which [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led against Poland. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to a massive movement of Ukrainian settlers to the Slobozhanshchyna region, which converted it from a sparsely inhabited frontier area to one of the major populated regions of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Following the [[Pereyaslav Rada]] of 1654 the modern northern and eastern parts of Ukraine came under the hegemony of the Russian Tsardom. This brought the first significant, but still small, wave of Russian settlers into central Ukraine (primarily several thousand soldiers stationed in garrisons,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> out of a population of approximately 1.2 million<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&pg=PA149|title= Ukraine: A History|first= Orest|last= Subtelny|date= December 28, 2017|publisher= University of Toronto Press|accessdate= December 28, 2017|via= Google Books}}</ref> non-Russians). Although the number of Russian settlers in Ukraine prior to the 18th century remained small, the local upper-classes within the part of Ukraine acquired by Russia came to use the Russian language widely.

Beginning in the late 18th century, large numbers of Russians settled in newly-acquired lands in what is now southern Ukraine, a region then known as [[Novorossiya]] ("New Russia"). These lands - previously known as the [[Wild Fields]] - had been largely empty prior to the 18th century due to the threat of [[Crimean Khanate| Crimean Tatar]] raids, but once St Petersburg had eliminated the Tatar state as a threat, Russian nobles were granted large tracts of fertile land for working by newly-arrived peasants, most of them ethnic Ukrainians but many of them  Russians.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30071/Ukraine#404474.hook|title= Ukraine - History, Geography, People, & Language|website= britannica.com}}</ref>

===Dramatic increase of Russian settlers===
[[File:Dialektologicheskaia Karta 1914 goda.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Linguistic map.

The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in the urban Russian population in present-day Ukraine, as ethnic Russian settlers moved into and populated the newly industrialised and growing towns.  At the beginning of the 20th century the Russians formed the largest ethnic group in almost all large cities within Ukraine's modern borders, including  [[Kiev]] (54.2%), Kharkiv (63.1%), [[Odessa]] (49.09%), [[Mykolaiv]] (66.33%), [[Mariupol]] (63.22%), [[Luhansk]], (68.16%), [[Kherson]] (47.21%), [[Melitopol]] (42.8%), [[Dnipro | Ekaterinoslav]], (41.78%), [[Kropyvnytskyi]] (34.64%), [[Simferopol]] (45.64%), [[Yalta]] (66.17%), [[Kerch]] (57.8%), [[Sevastopol]] (63.46%).<ref name="dnistr 342">Дністрянський М.С.

Лівів Літопис, видавництво ЛНУ імені Івана Франка, 2006, page 342 {{ISBN|966-7007-60-X}}</ref> The Ukrainian migrants who settled in these cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu (particularly with Russian-speaking administration) and needed to adopt the Russian language.

===Suppression and fostering of the Ukrainian language===
{{main|Russification of Ukraine}} 
The [[Russian Empire]] promoted the [[Russification |spread of the Russian language]] among the native Ukrainian population, actively refusing to acknowledge the existence of a Ukrainian language.

Alarmed by the threat of [[Ukrainian nationalism | Ukrainian separatism]] (in its turn influenced by the 1863 [[January Uprising|demands of Polish nationalists]]), the [[List of Ministers of Interior of Imperial Russia | Russian Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Pyotr Valuev]] in 1863 issued a [[Valuev Circular |secret decree]] that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the Ukrainian language<ref name="Miller">{{cite book| author= Miller, Alexei | title= ''The Ukrainian Question. The Russian Empire and Nationalism in the Nineteenth Century | location= Budapest-New York | publisher = Central European University Press | year = 203 | ISBN = 963-9241-60-1 }}</ref> as non-grammatical, but allowed all other texts, including fiction.  The Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1876 expanded this ban by issuing the [[Ems Ukaz]] (which lapsed in 1905).  The Ukaz banned all Ukrainian-language books and song-lyrics, as well as the importation of such works.  Furthermore, Ukrainian-language public performances, plays, and lectures were forbidden.<ref name=Magosci>{{cite book| author= Magoscy, R. | title= A History of Ukraine| location = Toronto | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1996}}</ref>  In 1881 the decree was amended{{by whom?|date=February 2020}} to allow the publishing of lyrics and dictionaries, and the performances of some plays in the Ukrainian language with local officials' approval.  Ukrainian-only troupes were, however, forbidden. Approximately 9% of the population{{which?|date=February 2020}} spoke Russian at the time of the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897.{{cn|date=February 2020}} as opposed to 44.31% of the total population of the Empire.<ref>{{cite web |script-title= ru:Первая всеобщая перепись населения Российской Империи 1897 г.

Thus Ukrainians in the [[Soviet era]] were entitled to study and learn in the Ukrainian language. During the Soviet times, the attitude to Ukrainian language and culture went through periods of promotion (policy of "[[korenization]]", {{circa | 1923}}  to {{circa | 1933}}), suppression (during the subsequent period of [[Stalinism]]), and renewed [[Ukrainization]] (notably in the epoch of [[Khrushchev]], {{circa | 1953}} to 1964). Ukrainian cultural organizations, such as theatres or the [[National Writers' Union of Ukraine|  Writers' Union]], were funded by the central administration.{{which?|date=February 2020}} While officially there was no [[state language]] in the Soviet Union until 1990, Russian in practice had an implicitly privileged position as the only language widely spoken across the country.

===Ukrainization in modern Ukraine===
{{main|Ukrainization}}
{{see also|Russian book ban in Ukraine}}
Since the [[Euromaidan]] of 2013-2014, the Ukrainian government has issued several laws aimed at encouraging Ukrainization in the media, in education and in other spheres.

In February 2017, the Ukrainian government banned the commercial importation of books from Russia, which had accounted for up to 60% of all titles sold in Ukraine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/14/ukraine-publishers-speak-out-against-ban-on-russian-books |title=Ukraine publishers speak out against ban on Russian books |first=Danuta |last=Kean |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 February 2017 | quote = Ukrainian publishers have reacted angrily to their government's ban on importing books from Russia, claiming it will create a black market and damage the domestic industry.

On May 23, 2017, [[Ukrainization#Mass media|the Ukrainian parliament approved the law]] that most broadcast content should be in Ukrainian (75% of national carriers and 50% of local carriers).

[[Ukrainization#2017 law "On Education"|The 2017 law on education]] provides that Ukrainian language is the language of education at all levels except for one or more subjects that are allowed to be taught in two or more languages, namely [[English language|English]] or one of the other [[official languages of the European Union]] (i.e., excluding Russian).<ref name=law>[http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2145-19/page Про освіту] | від 05.09.2017 № 2145-VIII (Сторінка 1 з 7)</ref> The law does state that persons belonging to the [[indigenous peoples of Ukraine]] are guaranteed the right to study at public pre-school institutes and primary schools in "the language of instruction of the respective indigenous people, along with the state language of instruction" in separate classes or groups.<ref name=law/> The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) has expressed concern with this measure and with the lack of "real consultation" with the representatives of national minorities.<ref name=PACE>{{cite web|url= http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=24218&lang=en|title= PACE - Resolution 2189 (2017) - The new Ukrainian law on education: a major impediment to the teaching of national minorities' mother tongues|website= assembly.coe.int | quote = The Parliamentary Assembly is concerned about the articles relating to education in minority languages of the new Education Act adopted on 5 September 2017 by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) and signed on 27 September 2017 by the Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko.

There is a large difference between the numbers of people whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday [[lingua franca|communication language]]. Another thing to keep in mind is that the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.

===2001 Census===
According to official data from the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian census]], the Russian language is native for 29.6% of Ukraine's population (about 14.3 million people).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/|title=Results / General results of the census| accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=[[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] }}</ref> Ethnic [[Russians]] form 56% of the total Russian-native-language population, while the remainder are people of other ethnic background: 5,545,000 [[Ukrainians]], 172,000 [[Belarusians]], 86,000 [[Jews]], 81,000 [[Greeks]], 62,000 [[Bulgarians]], 46,000 [[Moldovans]], 43,000 [[Tatars]], 43,000 [[Armenians]], 22,000 [[Poles]], 21,000 [[Germans]], 15,000 [[Crimean Tatars]].

Therefore, the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine forms the largest linguistic group in modern Europe with its language being non-official in the state.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The Russian-speaking population of Ukraine constitutes the largest [[Russophone]] community outside the [[Russian Federation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Russian language in Ukrainian politics==

The Russian language in Ukraine is recognized as the language of a national minority but not as a state language. It is explicitly mentioned in the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] adopted by the parliament in 1996.

{{main|Legislation on languages in Ukraine}}
The issue of Russian receiving the status of second official language has been the subject of extended controversial discussion ever since Ukraine became independent in 1991. In every Ukrainian election, many politicians, such as former president [[Leonid Kuchma]], used their promise of making Russian a second state language to win support. The recent [[President of Ukraine]], [[Viktor Yanukovych]] continued this practice when he was opposition leader. But in an interview with [[Kommersant]], during the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]]-campaign, he stated that the status of Russian in Ukraine "is too politicized" and said that if elected President in 2010, he would "have a real opportunity to adopt a law on languages, which implements the requirements of the [[European Charter of regional languages]]". He implied these law would need 226 votes in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] (50% of the votes instead of the 75% of the votes needed to change the [[constitution of Ukraine]]).<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=1289144 "Доверия к Тимошенко у меня нет и быть не может"], [[Kommersant]] (December 9, 2009)</ref> After his early 2010 election as President, Yanukovych stated (on March 9, 2010) "Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language".<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/61283/ Yanukovych: Ukraine will not have second state language], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 9, 2010)</ref> At the same time, he stressed that it also necessary to develop other regional languages.<ref>[http://podrobnosti.ua/power/2010/03/09/670765.html Янукович: Русский язык не будет вторым государственным ], [[Подробности]] (March 9, 2010 13:10)</ref>

In 1994, a referendum took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast]] and the [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the (central) [[Ukrainian government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thekievtimes.ua/society/372400-donbass-zabytyj-referendum-1994.html|title=Донбасс: забытый референдум-1994|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/18807/|title=Киев уже 20 лет обманывает Донбасс: Донецкая и Луганская области еще в 1994 году проголосовали за федерализацию, русский язык и евразийскую интеграцию|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref>

Former president [[Viktor Yushchenko]], during his [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 Presidential campaign]], also claimed a willingness to introduce more equality for Russian speakers.

===Russian literature in Ukraine===
[[File:H. L. Oldie.jpg|thumbnail|270px|[[H. L.

Historically, many famous writers of Russian literature were born and lived in Ukraine. [[Nikolai Gogol]] is probably the most famous example of shared Russo-Ukrainian heritage: Ukrainian by descent, he wrote in Russian, and significantly contributed to culture of both nations. Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] was born in [[Kiev]], as well as poet [[Ilya Erenburg]]. A number of notable Russian writers and poets hailed from [[Odessa]], including [[Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Isaak Babel]]. Russian child poet [[Nika Turbina]] was born in [[Yalta]], Crimea.

A significant number of contemporary authors from Ukraine write in Russian.<ref name="pentacle">{{cite book |last1=Oldie |first1=H.L. |last2=Dyachenko |first2=Marina and Sergey |last3=Valentinov |first3=Andrey|year=2005 |script-title=ru:Пять авторов в поисках ответа (послесловие к роману "Пентакль") |trans-title=Five authors in search for answers (an afterword to Pentacle) |language= ru|location=Moscow |publisher=Eksmo |isbn=5-699-09313-3 |quote=Украиноязычная фантастика переживает сейчас не лучшие дни. ...

Outside science fiction and fantasy, there is also a number of Russophone realist writers and poets.

According to H. L. Oldie, writing in Russian is an easier way for Ukrainian authors to be published and reach a broader audience. The authors say that it is because of Ukraine's ineffective book publishing policy: while Russian publishers are interested in popular literature, Ukrainian publishers rely mostly on [[grant (money)|grant]] givers.<ref name="pentacle"/> Many Ukrainian publishers agree and complain about low demand and low profitability for books in Ukrainian, compared to books in Russian.<ref>[http://archive.kontrakty.ua/gc/2006/25/3-zaplati-za-kapitalizaciyu.html  Книгоиздание в Украине: мнения экспертов] - «Контракты» №25 Июнь 2006г.</ref>

====On the Internet====
Russian is by far the preferred language on websites in Ukraine (80.1%), followed by English (10.1%), then Ukrainian (9.5%). The Russian language version of [[Wikipedia]] is five times more popular within Ukraine than the Ukrainian one, with these numbers matching those for the 2008 Gallup poll cited above (in which 83% of Ukrainians preferred to take the survey in Russian and 17% in Ukrainian.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13758/ukraine-s-ongoing-struggle-with-its-russian-identity|title=Ukraine's Ongoing Struggle With Its Russian Identity|website=www.worldpoliticsreview.com|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref>
