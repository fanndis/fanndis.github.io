Democratic and human rights have been major issues since the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty to China]] in 1997. The [[one country, two systems]] principle allows the [[Hong Kong government]] to administer all areas of government except foreign relations and (military) defence separately from the national [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]. Many Hong Kong citizens became concerned about democratic development when the first [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] appeared to have mishandled this issue. Other democracy-related issues involving [[human rights in Hong Kong|human rights]] and [[universal suffrage]] (in this case the right to elect Hong Kong leaders through general elections under universal suffrage with no curtailment from the central government of China) became the new focal point for the [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy camp]]. Attempts to bring Hong Kong citizens to the negotiating table by the British during the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration|Sino-Anglo discussions]] were rejected by Beijing in the late 1980s.  The last governor [[Chris Patten]] faced a great deal of opposition in changing the [[British Hong Kong|former colony]]'s political system. However, China has been criticized for infringement of the "one country, two systems" policy.

Since the election of [[Leung Chun-ying]] as Chief Executive in 2012, democratic development has come to a halt. The [[Umbrella Revolution]] was triggered by students disaffected by the continued stalling by Beijing, and particularly the [[831 decision|pronouncement of the NPCSC]] on 31 August 2014 that said Hong Kong had to accept an electoral process for the Chief Executive in 2017 in which up to three candidates would be pre-approved by the [[Election Committee]] – an [[electoral college]] widely seen to be loyal to Beijing authorities.<ref name=20140901NYTrestricts>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html |title=China Restricts Voting Reforms for Hong Kong |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 2014 |author1=Buckley, Chris |author2=Forsythe, Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005805/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html?_r=0 |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name="International Business Times">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/pro-democracy-protests-erupt-hong-kong-over-controversial-electoral-decision-1675068 |title=Pro-Democracy Protests Erupt in Hong Kong Over Controversial Electoral Decision |date=1 September 2014 |work=International Business Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220160848/http://www.ibtimes.com/pro-democracy-protests-erupt-hong-kong-over-controversial-electoral-decision-1675068 |archive-date=20 December 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

{{Politics of Hong Kong}}

===19th century===
In 1856, then governor Sir [[John Bowring]] proposed that the constitution of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] be changed to increase membership to 13 members, of whom five would be elected by landowners enjoying rents exceeding 10 pounds.  This timid attempt at an extremely limited form of [[democracy]] (there were only 141 such electors, of whom half were non-British)<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowring|first=Philip|title=Free Trade's First Missionary: Sir John Bowring in Europe and Asia|date=2014|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|place=Hong Kong|isbn=9789888208722}}</ref>{{rp|164}} was rejected by the [[Colonial Office]] on the basis that Chinese residents had no respect "for the main principles upon which social order rests."<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hong Kong Biography|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|last=Munn|first=Christopher Munn|editor=May Holdsworth and Christopher Munn|isbn=9789888083664|date=2012|place=Hong Kong}}</ref>{{rp|43}}

Popular grassroots movements were regarded as being greatly discomforting by the authorities.  When Asian workers rioted in 1884 after some of their number were fined for refusing to work for French traders, the Peace Preservation Ordinance was enacted, outlawing membership of any organisation deemed "incompatible with the peace and good order of the colony".<ref name=Norton>{{cite book|title=History of the Laws and Courts of Hong Kong, Vol. 2|last=Norton-Kyshe|first=James William|date=1898|publisher=T Fisher Unwin|place=London}}</ref>{{rp|376}}<ref name="Chung">{{cite book|last=Horrocks|first=Robert James|title=The Guangzhou-Hong Kong Strike 1925–26|publisher=University of Leeds}}</ref>{{rp|84}}  Censorship was imposed on the press.<ref name="Chung"/>{{rp|88}}

Hong Kong's non-elites repeatedly demonstrated their political engagement.  They showed their unwillingness to come under government controls and took strike action frequently to protect their freedoms.  General and coolie strikes erupted in 1844, 1858, 1862, 1863, 1872, 1888 and 1894.<ref name="Chung"/>{{rp|87,89}}

In June 1896, then governor Sir [[William Robinson (governor)|William Robinson]] sought the direct views of residents on the proposed membership of the Sanitary Board.  In the plebiscite taken of British residents, which excluded members of the Imperial and Civil Services, the vast majority favoured a board with a majority of members elected by residents.  The plebiscite was seen by the Secretary of State as a threat to the [[Crown colony|Crown Colony]] status of Hong Kong and ignored.  Robinson flatly rejected it despite having initiated it, concluding that direct administration of the services could be "more effectively dealt with" by government than by an elected board.<ref name=Norton />{{rp|470}}

===20th century to WWII===

In response to the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese revolution]], the [[Societies Ordinance]] was passed, which required registration of all organisations and resurrected the key test seen in the 1884 legislation for ruling them unlawful.  The ordinance went further than its predecessor by explicitly targeting chambers of commerce.  The administration was particularly concerned about suppressing any activity which might contribute to Hong Kong playing an active role in the tumult across the border.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chung|first=S|title=Chinese Business Groups in Hong Kong and Political Change in South China 1900–1925|publisher=Springer|date=1998|isbn=9780230501768|page=42}}</ref>  The ordinance banned the free association of workers in unions, imposing restrictive bureaucracy on registration and stringent monitoring of meetings proposed.<ref name="Chung"/>{{rp|84–85}}

In the 1920s, workers were organised through labour-contractors who, in parallel with the trading system which enriched the all-powerful [[comprador]]s, provided a communication channel between the management of foreign hongs and their workers, but entirely for the benefit of the labour contractors.  Workers were powerless and roundly exploited under the system.<ref name="Chung"/>{{rp|85–86}}

In 1936, the Sanitary Board was reconstituted as the [[Urban Council]] and included eight appointed non-Official members, including three of Chinese extraction.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hong Kong: Society in Transition|last=Jarvie|first=I C|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136234262}}</ref>

===Post-World War II===
In 1946, shortly after the war, critical voices were raised against colonialism. Governor [[Mark Aitchison Young|Sir Mark Young]] proposed a 48-member Municipal Council with significant competence to govern, one-third elected by non-Chinese, one third by Chinese institutions and one-third by Chinese individuals, known as the "[[Young Plan (Hong Kong)|Young Plan]]", believing that, "to counter the Chinese government's determination to recover Hong Kong, it was necessary to give local inhabitants a greater stake in the territory by widening the political franchise to include them."<ref name="Tsang 2004, pp. 143–144">Tsang 2004, pp. 143–144</ref>
The reform failed because of much resistance from expatriate companies, a new conservative and mistrustful governor, and London's fears of Hong Kong becoming a political battleground between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).

[[Alexander Grantham]] took over as [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]] in 1947, after [[Mark Aitchison Young|Sir Mark Young]] resigned due to ill health. Grantham, a civil servant of many years' standing, was not a supporter of democratic reforms in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Butenhoff|1999|p=22}} Grantham considered Young's plan ill-conceived {{sfn|Tsang|1995|p=129}} as he mistrusted the Chinese and doubted their loyalty to Britain and the Crown. He could not see the Young Plan changing that.{{sfn|Loh|2006|p=27}} He blocked the reform process and redrafted the proposals in a two-year stalemate.

===1950s===
When [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists defeated the nationalists in the [[Chinese Civil War]], democratic reform in Hong Kong was no longer a priority for London.{{sfn|Butenhoff|1999|p=22}}  The [[Foreign Office]] was concerned not so much that the [[Central People's Government]] would object to democratic changes in Hong Kong, but that Grantham's plan would give them reason to complain that the reforms were "undemocratic".{{sfn|Tsang|2007|p=208}} 
British-educated lawyer and unofficial legislator [[Man-kam Lo]] revised the proposals of 1949 with much support from Grantham. This alternative to the Young Plan, at first approved by the British Government at the end of 1950, was then shelved in 1951 at the recommendation of the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office was concerned that reform at the height of the [[Korean War]] would trigger propaganda campaigns by the Communists and could be used by them as an excuse to reclaim Hong Kong.{{sfn|Tsang|1995|p=90–1}}

By 1952, the post-war recession began to take its toll on Hong Kong and the 1946 pledge of wide self-determination was forgotten.{{sfn|Tsang|1995|p=91}} Grantham convinced London to scrap all plans for political reform on the basis that it did not "interest the British electorate".  Later, when confronted by the Hong Kong public, he blamed London.{{sfn|Loh|2006|p=27}} All major democratic reforms for Hong Kong were dropped by British Cabinet decision. In October 1952, the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Oliver Lyttelton]] announced that the time was "inopportune for...constitutional changes of a major character".{{sfn|Tsang|1995|p=92}}

====Democratisation of Urban Council====
Ultimately, however, Governor Grantham allowed minor reform proposals {{sfn|Chan|2010|p=6–7}} and, as a result, two pre-war existing seats in the virtually powerless Urban Council were directly elected in 1952; this was doubled to four the following year.  In 1956, the body became semi-elected but on a restricted franchise, which had expanded from some 9,000 registered voters in 1952 to only about 250,000 eligible voters 14 years later.  Eligibility reached about half a million in 1981 but only 34,381 bothered to register,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Government and Politics of Hong Kong|last=Miners|first=Normal|place=Hong Kong|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1981}}</ref>{{rp|224}} probably on account of the fact that the body's powers extended only to cleaning, running bathhouses and public lavatories, hawker control, supervising beaches, burying the dead, and the like.

Records declassified in 2014 show discussions about self-government between British and Hong Kong governments resumed in 1958, prompted by the [[Indian independence movement|British expulsion from India]] and growing anti-colonial sentiment in the remaining Crown Colonies. [[Zhou Enlai]], representing the CPC at the time, warned, however, that this "conspiracy" of self-governance would be a "very unfriendly act" and that the CPC wished the present colonial status of Hong Kong to continue. China was facing increasing isolation in a [[Cold War]] world and the party needed Hong Kong for contacts and trade with the outside world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/the-secret-history-of-hong-kongs-democratic-stalemate/381424/#disqus_thread|title=The Secret History of Hong Kong's Democratic Stalemate|author=Gwynn Guilford|date=14 October 2014|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=29 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020133012/http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/the-secret-history-of-hong-kongs-democratic-stalemate/381424/#disqus_thread|archive-date=20 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vjmedia.com.hk/articles/2014/01/11/60039|title=為何英國不早給香港民主？英國檔案提供的答案|publisher=vjmedia|accessdate=29 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101215641/http://www.vjmedia.com.hk/articles/2014/01/11/60039|archive-date=1 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=qz>{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/279013/the-secret-history-of-hong-kongs-stillborn-democracy/|title=The secret history of Hong Kong's stillborn democracy|author=Gwynn Guilford|work=Quartz|accessdate=29 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024122307/http://qz.com/279013/the-secret-history-of-hong-kongs-stillborn-democracy/|archive-date=24 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 1960s ===
China's leaders explicitly wanted to "preserve the colonial status of Hong Kong".<ref name=qz/> [[Liao Chengzhi]], a senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said in 1960 that China "shall not hesitate to take positive action to have Hong Kong, [[Kowloon]] and [[New Territories]] liberated" should the status quo (i.e. colonial administration) be changed. The warning killed any democratic development for the next three decades.<ref name=20141028nyt>Jacobs, Andrew (27 Oct 2014).

''The New York Times''</ref>

=== 1970s ===
In the absence of democratic legitimacy, the colonial government slowly implemented a system of formal advisory bodies, integrating interest groups into the policy-making process during the 1970s, which enabled grievances and controversies to be discussed and resolved.<ref name=2014radical216>Cheng (2014), p.216.</ref>

===1980s===
Although full universal suffrage was never granted by the British to its colony before the handover in 1997, some democratic reform began in 1984. Following the historic meeting in 1979 between [[Deng Xiaoping]] and then governor [[Murray MacLehose]], a [[Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong]] was issued by the colonial government in July 1984. It included proposals aimed at developing a system of more localised government, which included the introduction of indirect elections to the LegCo (Legislative Council) the following year.<ref name=20091114scmp>Cheung, Gary (14 November 2009), "Universal suffrage an elusive goal", ''South China Morning Post''</ref> The [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] stated that "the legislature of the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] shall be constituted by elections"; then British Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] further promised the democratic process would start "in the years immediately ahead", but they stalled due to opposition from Beijing, local business interests as represented by Executive Council, and the British Foreign Office under the pretext that it would bring chaos to Hong Kong.<ref name=20140905nury>Vittachi, Nury (5 September 2014) [http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/hong-kong-city-broken-promises/ "Hong Kong, City of Broken Promises"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029093709/http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/hong-kong-city-broken-promises/ |date=29 October 2014 }}. ''Asia Sentinel''</ref> Declaring that "full weight be given to representation of the economic and professional sectors essential to future confidence and prosperity of Hong Kong", the government proposed 12 legislators, who were – being members of the Legislative Council – elected by nine trade-based seats, or "functional bodies" – commercial, industrial, financial, labour, social services, education, legal, medical and engineering – the following year. [[Martin Lee]] and [[Szeto Wah]], later to become leading democrats, were among those elected in 1985.<ref name=20100118scmp>Cheung, Gary (18 Jan 2010), "Functional seats plan mooted a month after Deng, MacLehose met", ''South China Morning Post''</ref>

Democracy activists – pressure groups, religious groups and community organisations – attended a mass rally at [[Ko Shan Theatre]] in [[Hung Hom]] in November 1986. The rally was a milestone in Hong Kong's fledgling pro-democracy movement. One of the participating groups, calling themselves the 'group of 190', demanded direct elections for LegCo in 1988, and a faster pace of democratic development after the Handover.<ref name=20091114scmp/>

In 1987, many surveys indicated that there was more than 60% popular support for direct elections. The government, under governor David Wilson, issued another [[1988 Hong Kong electoral reform|green paper in 1987]] proposing direct [[1988 Hong Kong legislative election|LegCo elections for 1988]]. However, the proposal was ruled out after a government consultation concluded that people were 'sharply divided' over its introduction that year.<ref name=20141019scmpbow>{{cite web|url=http://scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1618427/how-hong-kongs-business-elite-have-thwarted-democracy-150|title=How Hong Kong's business elite have thwarted democracy for 150 years|work=South China Morning Post|accessdate=29 October 2014|date=18 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103174852/http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1618427/how-hong-kongs-business-elite-have-thwarted-democracy-150|archive-date=3 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> As Xinhua stepped up its presence in Hong Kong by opening district offices, [[Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong)|pro-Beijing forces]] worked actively to stifle the implementation of direct elections for the legislature in 1988 by initially identifying supporters, fielding candidates and targeting opponents aiming to win at the district board elections.<ref name=2014radical214>Cheng (2014), p.214.</ref> The Hong Kong government was criticised for manipulating the views of Beijing-friendly groups to ensure that no clear mandate for direct elections in 1988 emerged.

===1990s until the handover===
After the departure of Governor David Wilson in 1992, Chris Patten the new governor of Hong Kong, began moves to unilaterally democratise the territory by allowing for the election of half the Legislative Council by universal suffrage, and in the process incurring the wrath of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Patten had judged that: "People in Hong Kong are perfectly capable of taking a greater share in managing their own affairs in a way that is responsible, mature, restrained, sensible".<ref name=20141028nyt/> During the final days of British rule, the British wanted to play the political game; the Patten administration legislated for labour rights and collective bargaining. However, the legislation was cancelled by the provisional legislature upon taking office in 1997.<ref name=2014radical218>Cheng (2014), p.218.</ref> Patten's push for reform was strongly opposed at the time by vested interests within LegCo and by former ambassador to China [[Percy Cradock]].<ref name=20141019scmpbow/> Patten's moves created a hostile climate that lasted until Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997.<ref name=20141028nyt/> Nevertheless, Patten extracted undertakings from a PRC representative:<blockquote>How Hong Kong develops democracy (Remember that the people did not have democracy under colonization of the British) in the future is a matter entirely within the sphere of Hong Kong's autonomy, and the central government cannot intervene. <br/>— [[Lu Ping]], (as quoted in the ''People's Daily'', 18 March 1993)<ref name=20141028nyt/><ref name=20140905nury/></blockquote> The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated the following year that the democratic election of all Legislative Council members by universal suffrage was "a question to be decided by the Hong Kong SAR itself and it needs no guarantee by the Chinese Government".<ref name=20140905nury/>

==Post-1997==
Under what Beijing called the '[[one country, two systems]]' model, the move towards greater democracy has stalled.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The Legislative Council set up by Patten to be partially elected by universal suffrage was dismantled by the PRC and replaced by an entirely unelected [[provisional Legislative Council|provisional legislature]].<ref name=20140905nury/> [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|Elections in May 1998]] to fill a new legislature saw only 20 seats directly elected, with the remainder determined by a layered selection procedure designed to ensure maximum representation by [[Pro-establishment camp|pro-establishment parties]] at the expense of pan-democrats.<ref name=20140905nury/> An article in ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' argued that "Hong Kong's political development has lagged in the face of well-documented PRC efforts to impede progress toward direct elections, universal suffrage, and other democratizing reforms that Beijing fears might loosen its control."<ref>Ming Sing, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/v020/20.1.sing.html Hong Kong’s Democrats Hold Their Own] ''Journal of Democracy'' Volume 20, Number 1.

During the [[1996 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|1996 election]] a 400-member [[Election Committee|Selection Committee]] ({{Lang|zh|推選委員會}}) voted for a [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] to govern Hong Kong after 1997.<ref name="Chan">Chan, Ming K.

Following a massive protest against a proposal to implement [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Article 23]], which took place on 1 July 2003 and attracted half a million marchers, Beijing appointed [[Zeng Qinghong]] to oversee policy issues for Hong Kong.<ref name=yeung2008/> In April 2004, [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] (DAB) spokesman Lau Kwong-wah set aside without explanation the party's 2012 declared goal for universal suffrage, one day after fellow DAB member Chan Kam-lam reiterated on the campaign trail the party's plan to amend the party platform for the third time to promise full democracy in 2012.<ref name=hks-support/> On 26 April, Beijing reneged on earlier promises to allow Hong Kong the right to determine the timetable to universal suffrage.<ref name=frank>Ching, Frank (20 September 2010) "Historical context may clarify reform debate", ''South China Morning Post''</ref> when the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) ruled out universal suffrage before 2012.<ref name=yeung2008>Yeung, Rikkie.

Pan-democrat groups such as the [[Article 45 Concern Group]] and the Hong Kong Government agree on the interpretation that [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45]] indicates universal suffrage as the ultimate aim.

===2004 referendum proposal===
Following the April NPC ruling against the introduction of universal suffrage before 2012, the pan-democratic camp mooted the idea of a referendum to gauge the level of popular support for universal suffrage in 2007–8.

At the first meeting of the new Legislative Council Constitutional Affairs Panel on 18 October, chairman [[Lui Ming-wah]] was ambushed by pan-democrats in a surprise vote on constitutional reforms. After debating for over three hours, when democrats outnumbered pro-government lawmakers, [[Fernando Cheung]] raised a motion proposing a public referendum on whether people supported the government's 'go-slow proposals' or whether both elections should be by universal suffrage. The panel chairman stalled on the vote for more than 15 minutes, allowing the pro-government legislators to be called back to vote. However, the meeting descended into chaos and no vote was taken; the meeting was adjourned to the following month. Democrats called on Lui to resign from his post for his abuse of procedure.<ref name=rebuff>Ng, Michael (19 October 2004).

On 29 November, the motion tabled by Fernando Cheung before the full Legislative Council, calling for a referendum on the introduction of universal suffrage in 2007–08, was scuppered by the pro-Beijing camp – DAB, the Liberal Party and the Alliance – by 31 votes to 20.

===2005 reform package===
{{main|2005 Hong Kong electoral reform}}
The government issued its blueprint for the so-called 'district council model' for electing the chief executive and the legislature in 2007 and 2008. It suggests increasing the number of LegCo seats from 60 to 70. Of the 10 new seats, five would go to geographical constituencies. The remaining five would be elected by 529 district council members, including 102 government appointees.<ref name=crunch>Yeung, Chris (21 Dec 2005) OpEd: "Crunch time", ''South China Morning Post''</ref><!-- more to be milked from this source on the reasons for govt failure -->

Chief Secretary [[Donald Tsang]]'s fourth report on political reform on 15 December launched a three-month consultation over the methods for electing the chief executive and the legislature in 2007–08.  It looked into the size and composition of the Election Committee and LegCo. Tsang indicated he would not consider any proposals which were in conflict with the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]'s veto of universal suffrage in April.<ref>Yau, Cannix & Ng, Michael (16 December 2004) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15295&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041216&sear_year=2004 "Push to change democracy timetable 'a waste of time'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165459/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=15295&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20041216&sear_year=2004 |date=29 June 2011 }}. ''The Standard''</ref>

At the last minute, the government revised its offer aimed at securing votes for the blueprint's passage. The government promised to phase out one-third of the appointed seats, or 34, in 2008. The remaining two-thirds would be abolished no later than 2016.<ref name=crunch/><!-- more to be milked from this source on the reasons for govt failure -->

=== Pan-democrats' blueprint ===
In March 2007, the pan-democrats published their own blueprint, the 'mainstream transitional proposal' drawn up with the support of 21 legislators in accordance with the principles of equal and universal suffrage and as a reflection of public opinion. They proposed that 400 elected district councillors join the existing 800-member Election Committee, making up a total of 1,200 members. The nominations threshold would be set at 50 EC members, and the candidate for CE would be elected in a one-person, one-vote election. Ultimately, the nomination committee would be scrapped. For the legislature, they proposed returning half of LegCo's seats by direct election in single-seat constituencies, with the other half determined by proportional representation.<ref>Leung, Ambrose; Hung, Denise & Lee, Klaudia (3 Mar 2007) "Democrats agree on suffrage road map", ''South China Morning Post''</ref>

===NPCSC resolution===
After the failure to achieve universal suffrage in 2007, the target of the pan-democrats shifted to 2012; the pro-Beijing camp stated its preference for 2017. The Pan-democrats were concerned over the lack of details regarding governance in Hong Kong after July 2047, when the [[One country, two systems]] 50-year guarantee of autonomy granted by the Basic Law expires.

On 29 December 2007, the NPCSC resolved:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081223214014/http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/2211/longtitle.html Decision Of The Standing Committee Of The National People's Congress On Issues Relating To The Methods For Selecting The Chief Executive Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region And For Forming The Legislative Council Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region In The Year 2012 And On Issues Relating To Universal Suffrage (Adopted By The Standing Committee Of The Tenth National People's Congress At Its Thirty-First Session On 29 December 2007)], Hong Kong Legal Information Institute</ref> <blockquote>that the election of the fifth Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by universal suffrage; that after the Chief Executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of...universal suffrage...

</blockquote>
The decision stipulated that:
<blockquote>The bills on the amendments to the method for selecting the Chief Executive and the proposed amendments to such bills shall be introduced by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Legislative Council; such amendments must be made with the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all the members
of the Legislative Council and the consent of the Chief Executive</blockquote> The ''Asia Times'' remarked that both proposals for LegCo and for the Chief Executive "hedged in with so many ifs and buts that there is no guarantee of Hong Kong getting anything at all...

=== Standing Committee decision on electoral reform ===
{{main|2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong}}
On 31 August 2014, the tenth session of the Standing Committee in the twelfth [[National People's Congress]] set limits for the [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]] and [[2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2017 Chief Executive election]].  While notionally allowing for universal suffrage, the decision imposes the standard that "the Chief Executive shall be a person who loves the country and loves Hong Kong," and stipulates "the method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage must provide corresponding institutional safeguards for this purpose". The decision states that for the 2017 Chief Executive election, a nominating committee, mirroring the present 1,200-member [[Election Committee]] be formed to nominate two to three candidates, each of whom must receive the support of more than half of the members of the nominating committee. After the popular election of one of the nominated candidates, the Chief Executive-elect "will have to be appointed by the Central People's Government." The process of forming the 2016 Legislative Council would be unchanged, but following the new process for the election of the Chief Executive, a new system to elect the Legislative Council via universal suffrage would be developed with the approval of Beijing.<ref name="news.xinhuanet.com">{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-08/31/c_133609238.htm |title=Full text of NPC decision on universal suffrage for HKSAR chief selection |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011034750/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-08/31/c_133609238.htm |archive-date=11 October 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>
