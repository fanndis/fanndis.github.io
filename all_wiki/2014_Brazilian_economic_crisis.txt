That recovery continued until 2020, when the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil|COVID-19 pandemic]] began to impact the economy again.

The economic crisis occurred alongside a political crisis that resulted in the [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff |impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff]]. These events combined caused mass popular dissatisfaction with the political system.

The cause of the crisis was the aforementioned political crisis, as well as the [[Commodity_price_shocks#Second_half_of_2014|2014 commodity price shock]], which negatively affected Brazil's exports and reduced the entrance of foreign capital into the economy. However, the most important cause was internal, which is associated with economic measures that didn't achieve the expected results. Adopted in 2011, these measures are known as the ''{{ill|Nova Matriz Econômica|pt|Nova Matriz Econômica|vertical-align=sup}}'' ("New Economic Matrix", in a free translation).

During the economic crisis, high unemployment rates were reported throughout the country, and there was widespread uncertainty regarding Brazil's economic future following a series of political scandals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/pib-positivo-e-saida-tecnica-da-recessao-mas-recuperacao-e-incerta-entenda.ghtml|title=PIB positivo é 'saída técnica' da recessão, mas recuperação é incerta; entenda|date=2017-06-01|author=Darlan Alvarenga|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=G1}}</ref> In the first quarter of 2017, Brazil's GDP rose by 1%.

== Context ==
=== Economic ===
Brazil's economy is largely dependent on the export of [[commodities]], particularly iron ore, petroleum and soy. From the late 1990s till 2012, prices for these export commodities rose significantly (partly because of increasing demand from [[China]]), resulting in about two decades of economic growth. As a result of the economic crisis, Brazil's GDP dropped sharply, leading to high unemployment.<ref name="agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br">{{Cite web|url=https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2016-05/crise-internacional-e-problemas-internos-sao-causas-do-desemprego-no-brasil|title=Crise internacional e problemas internos são causas do desemprego no Brasil|date=2016-05-01|website=Agência Brasil|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> During [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s left-wing presidency from 2003 to 2010, the government redistributed wealth through welfare programs and raised the [[minimum wage]] in order to increase consumption.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal|title=Entenda a crise econômica|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2016-05/entenda-crise-economica|journal=Agência Brasil |date=15 May 2016 |author=Giselle Garcia |agency=[[Agência Brasil]]}}</ref>

In response to critics of Lula's [[Socialist economics|socialist economic]] stance, his successor, Dilma Rousseff (president during the crisis), introduced [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] tax exemptions and subsidies. These policies are widely acknowledged as a major factor in the 2014–16 economic crisis.<ref name="book" />

=== Political ===
The economic crisis was followed and intensified by a political crisis. In 2014, a series of corruption scandals uncovered by [[Operation Car Wash]] engulfed many influential politicians. In the presidential election of the same year, President [[Dilma Rousseff]] was re-elected to a second term, defeating the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]] candidate [[Aécio Neves]] by a narrow margin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Na disputa mais acirrada da história, Dilma é reeleita presidente do Brasil - 26/10/2014 - Poder|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2014/10/1537894-dilma-e-reeleita-presidente-do-brasil.shtml|work=Folha de S.Paulo|accessdate=2019-06-09}}</ref> The result was not recognized by a section of the opposition and provoked popular discontent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crise econômica e corrupção marcarão a nova presidência|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2014/10/26/politica/1414356634_215134.html|work=EL PAÍS|date=2014-10-27|accessdate=2019-06-09|first=Antonio Jiménez|last=Barca}}</ref> Due to the disputed legitimacy of the election, the Operation Car Wash investigation, and the economic crisis; dissatisfaction with the government became widespread.

== Causes ==
===Slowdown of the Chinese economy and fall in commodity prices===
According to Steve Tobin, a researcher at the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), decreased external [[demand]] for Brazilian products, particularly from China, plus the fall in commodity prices, contributed to the crisis.<ref name="agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br"/> Silvia Matos, a researcher at the Brazilian think-tank and university [[Getúlio Vargas Foundation]], concluded that external factors were responsible for 30% of the crisis.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjY8DwAAQBAJ|title=A Crise de Crescimento do Brasil|author=FGV|publisher=Elsevier Brasil|language=pt-BR|isbn=9788535266382|date=2016-05-05}}</ref> During the downturn, the Brazilian economy exhibited structural weaknesses that had never been seen before, such as low [[productivity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crise internacional e problemas internos são causas do desemprego no Brasil|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/economia/noticia/2016-05/crise-internacional-e-problemas-internos-sao-causas-do-desemprego-no-brasil|journal=Agência Brasil}}</ref>

=== Macroeconomic policy errors ===
[[Image:Entrevistas_Diversas_(14879045080).jpg|thumb|[[Guido Mantega]], Finance Minister, during the first Dilma administration. In July 2012, he admitted for the first time that the government had put into practice a new "macroeconomic matrix".<ref>{{cite web|title=Mantega indica novo modelo econômico|url=https://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,mantega-indica-novo-modelo-economico-imp-,896017|work=Estadão|location=Brasília|author=Beatriz Abreu|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>]]

Although decreasing prices for Brazil's exports contributed to the economic crisis, there is a consensus that the primary cause was internal. [[Gustavo Franco]], former president of the [[Central Bank of Brazil]], has asserted that the crisis was entirely self-inflicted by a series of "local macroeconomic measures that went wrong."<ref>{{cite web|title=A crise brasileira não vem de fora, ela foi autoinfligida|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2015/03/25/economia/1427322429_883162.html|work=El País |date=27 March 2015}}</ref> These measures are collectively known as the ''{{ill|Nova Matriz Econômica|pt|Nova Matriz Econômica|vertical-align=sup}}'' ("New Economic Matrix").

Previously, the government had played a major role in the expansion of the internal market by stimulating consumption, raising the national minimum wage, transferring wealth and expanding credit. By the end of Lula's administration, entrepreneurs and industrialists began to question the sustainability of these policies. They complained about the national industry's declining share of Brazilian GDP.<ref name="book" />

In response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the Brazilian industry become more competitive internationally. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies which ultimately failed to stimulate industry. Productivity, after growing by 2.7% in 2010, fell by 0.9% and 3.7% in the following two years, shrinking government revenues and thus requiring reductions in public investment.<ref name="book" />

=== Political instability ===
In the same year the crisis began, a major corruption scheme involving top politicians and major companies such as the oil giant [[Petrobras]] was uncovered by [[Operation Car Wash]]. It is estimated that Operation Car Wash caused Brazil's GDP to contract by 1 to 1.5%.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2017-06-02|title=A Lava Jato está corroendo o PIB. E daí?|url=https://www.istoedinheiro.com.br/lava-jato-esta-corroendo-o-pib-e-dai/|journal=Isto É Dinheiro|publisher=Editora três}}</ref>

== Consequences ==
=== Unemployment ===
[[File:Evolução do desemprego 2012-2017.png|thumb|355px|The unemployment rate from 2012 to 2017. Each vertical line corresponds to a month.<ref name="desemprego">{{cite web|url=https://br.advfn.com/indicadores/pnad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106064226/https://br.advfn.com/indicadores/pnad|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-11-06|title=Desemprego {{!}} Pnad {{!}} IBGE|date=2017-11-06|accessdate=2017-11-26}}</ref>]]
Before the recession, Brazil's [[unemployment]] rate hovered around 6.8% for most of 2014, but began increasing in February 2015, resulting in a 2015 average of 8.5%. The economy lost more than 1.5 million jobs throughout 2015, fueling public discontent against the political establishment and the political leadership of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]] and President [[Dilma Rousseff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/brazil-s-unemployment-jumps-in-2015-adding-to-rousseff-s-woes|title=Brazil's unemployment jumps in 2015, adding to Rousseff's woes|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref> The unemployment rate continued to rise throughout 2016 to finish the year at 12.0%, with 12.3 million people unemployed and an estimated 2.8 million private-sector jobs cut over the preceding two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economy-employment-idUSKBN15F1LE|title=Brazil's jobless rate ends 2016 at 12 percent with 12.3 million unemployed|publisher=Reuters|date=1 February 2017}}</ref>

Young people were affected most by the worsening job market. While the overall unemployment rate was 12.7% in the first quarter of 2019, the rate in people from 14 to 17 years was 44.5% and 27.3% for people from 18 to 24 years.

Experts expressed concern for the unintended economic and social repercussions for Brazil's younger population, as the economic crisis decreased social security contributions and depreciated [[human capital]] (caused by the decrease in the technical capacity of future workers).<ref>{{cite web |title=Desemprego deixa herança maldita aos jovens e cicatrizes no país |url=https://exame.abril.com.br/economia/desemprego-deixa-heranca-maldita-aos-jovens-e-cicatrizes-no-pais/ |work=Exame|date=28 June 2019|author=Ligia Tuon|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Recession ===

At the end of the second quarter of 2014, the country was in a technical [[recession]]. According to some Brazilian economists, a technical recession is negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters. It is different from an actual recession, in which the situation of the country depreciates significantly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Entenda o que a recessão técnica significa para a economia|url=https://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,entenda-o-que-a-recessao-tecnica-significa-para-a-economia,384664|work=Estadão|author=Alessandra Corrêa|date=9 June 2009}}</ref> Finance Minister, [[Guido Mantega]], lessened the economic result and, in comparison to Europe, declared that:

{{quote|[In Brazil] we're talking about two trimesters [of negative GDP growth], and we know that the economy is in motion. Recession is when there are rising unemployment and decreasing income. Here we have the opposite.|Guido Mantega, Finance Minister<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2014/08/entenda-o-que-e-recessao-tecnica.html|work=G1|date=29 August 2014|accessdate=7 December 2016|title=Entenda o que é recessão técnica|location=São Paulo}}</ref>|title=|source=}}

Regardless of Mantega's statements, specialists had already spotted signs that a strong recession was well underway, citing the technical recession and later, the small growth of 0.5% at the end of 2014. The expectations were confirmed in the next year when the economy shrunk by 3.5%. In 2016, there was another sharp decrease of 3.3%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Como o Brasil entrou (e pode sair) da maior recessão da história|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/economia/como-o-brasil-entrou-e-pode-sair-da-maior-recessao-da-historia/|accessdate=24 June 2017|work=EXAME|date=7 March 2017|author=João Pedro Caleiro}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Como o Brasil entrou, sozinho, na pior crise da história|work=Época|accessdate= 24 June 2017|author1=Graziele Oliveira |author2=Marcos Coronato|url=http://epoca.globo.com/ideias/noticia/2016/04/como-o-brasil-entrou-sozinho-na-pior-crise-da-historia.html|date=4 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=3 July 2017|title=Brasil vive a pior recessão da história|url=http://g1.globo.com/jornal-hoje/noticia/2017/03/brasil-vive-pior-recessao-da-historia.html|accessdate=2017-06-01|work = Jornal Hoje|author1=Renata Capucci |author2=Larissa Castro}}</ref> In the first trimester of 2017, the GDP rose for the first time after eight consecutive trimesters of negative growth.<ref name="jn">{{cite journal|date=2017-06-01|title=PIB do primeiro trimestre cresce 1% após oito quedas seguidas|language=pt|trans-title=First quarter GDP grows 1% after eight straight falls|url=http://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2017/06/pib-do-primeiro-trimestre-cresce-1-apos-oito-quedas-seguidas.html|journal=Jornal Nacional|accessdate= 24 June 2017}}</ref>

The recession caused a [[fiscal crisis]] and an increasing [[budget deficit]] which, according to Bloomberg, was "the largest-ever primary budget gap ... as a two-year [[economic recession]] sapped tax collection while expenses grew further."<ref>

</ref> The government deficit reached 5.8 billion [[Brazilian real|reais]] (US$1.7 billion) in the first three months of 2016, the widest reported since December 2001. The two-year fiscal deterioration can be explained by the decrease in government revenue from taxes as a result of the recession, while government expenses have been growing constantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/brazil-records-worst-ever-first-quarter-budget-deficit|title=Brazil records worst-ever first quarter budget deficit|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref>

=== Increase in economic inequality ===
[[File:Gini da Renda do Trabalho nos Domicílios per Capita.png|355px|thumb|Evolution of the [[Gini coefficient]] in Brazil from 2012 to 2019. Source:Ibre/FGV<ref name="IBRE" />]]
A 2019 study by the [[Instituto Brasileiro de Economia]] (Ibre), part of [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] (FGV), obtained by the magazine [[Valor Econômico]], showed that the [[Gini coefficient]], which measures the economic inequality in society from 0 to 1, had increased year after year since 2015 and reached its peak in March 2019.

In 7 years, the accumulated wealth of the top 10% rose by 8.5%, while that of the 40% poorest dropped 14%. The research showed that people with lower incomes suffered the effects of the crisis more intensely and recovered from the crisis slower.<ref>{{cite web|title=Desigualdade de renda no Brasil atinge o maior patamar já registrado, diz FGV/IBRE|url=https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2019/05/21/desigualdade-de-renda-no-brasil-atinge-o-maior-patamar-ja-registrado-diz-fgvibre.ghtml|work=G1|accessdate=2019-05-22|date=21 May 2019}}</ref><ref name="Valor">{{cite web|title=Desigualdade de renda no Brasil sobe pelo 17º trimestre consecutivo|url=https://www.valor.com.br/brasil/6265917/desigualdade-de-renda-no-brasil-sobe-pelo-17-trimestre-consecutivo|work=Valor Econômico|date=2019-05-19|accessdate=2019-05-22|author=Bruno Villas Bôas|location=Rio de Janeiro}}</ref><ref name="IBRE">{{cite web |title=Levantamento do FGV IBRE aponta desigualdade recorde na renda do trabalho |url=https://portalibre.fgv.br/navegacao-superior/noticias/levantamento-do-fgv-ibre-aponta-desigualdade-recorde-na-renda-do-trabalho.htm |work=IBRE/FGV |accessdate=23 May 2019 |date=21 May 2019}}</ref>

According to an Ibre researcher, Daniel Duque, the recovery of the job market benefited the most qualified and experienced, reinforcing inequality. Many underqualified people gave up trying to get a job, and the loss of hope was at a "[...] record high, and it helps to explain why, even after the decrease in unemployment, inequality kept rising."<ref name="Valor" />

=== Emigration ===
{{main|Brazilian diaspora}}

The number of declarations of definitive departure from the country began to grow in the first year of crisis and has increased steadily ever since, according to [[Receita Federal do Brasil|Receita Federal]]. Among the countries that received the most Brazilian citizens were [[Japan]] and [[Canada]], which, due to low unemployment and aging populations among other reasons, needed a boost to decrease the age of the workforce.<ref name=":4" />

According to a JBJ Partners employee (a company specialized in expatriation to the [[United States]]), many who fled Brazil were qualified workers:

{{quote|We're talking about qualified people. The profile of the immigrant is no longer that of the poor individual looking for better opportunities.

An [[OECD]] report shows an even higher number {{Citation needed|reason= Stub sentence - needs comparative material|date=April 2020}} <!-- In comparison to what? -->. In 2016 80,000 Brazilians emigrated legally to one of the member states of the OECD, whereas 99,000 did so in 2017.

In early 2017, there were already signals that the economy was beginning to recover, however, it was agreed that the process would be long and slow.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recuperação da economia brasileira será longa e lenta, aponta 'FT'|url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,recuperacao-da-economia-brasileira-sera-longa-e-lenta-aponta-ft,70001658076}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Recuperação da economia brasileira ainda é lenta, diz presidente do Itaú|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2017/04/1876544-recuperacao-da-economia-brasileira-ainda-e-lenta-diz-presidente-do-itau.shtml}}</ref>

In June 2017, a 1% rise in GDP in the first quarter of the year was reported.<ref name="jn"/> It was the first rise of the GDP after eight consecutive falls (two years).<ref name=":0">

In countries with similar size and wealth, there were a few, but less severe crisis in the same period. In 2015, among [[OECD]] countries, only [[Russia]] went through a recession. Even after the economic sanctions imposed by other countries due to the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|conflict in Ukraine]], Russia's GDP fell by only 4% in two years (2015 and 2016). Few other countries in this period were going through a recession, which reinforces the argument that the crisis in Brazil was mainly due to local causes.<ref name="book">{{Cite book|last=Carvalho|first=Laura|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XppWDwAAQBAJ|title=Valsa brasileira: Do boom ao caos econômico|date=2018-05-08|publisher=Editora Todavia S.A|isbn=978-85-93828-63-8|language=pt-BR}}</ref>

In comparison to other crises in Brazil, it was verified that the 2014 crisis was not the deepest, as previously thought. After the GDP values for 2015 and 2016 were reviewed by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), the economy shrank by 8.2% in the period, in contrast to the 8.5% in the 1981 recession. Despite not being the deepest, the crisis was long. It was also followed by the slowest economic recovery in Brazilian history.<ref name="book" />

According to Codace (committee part of [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]]), the 1981 crisis lasted nine trimesters, reached its peak in the first trimester of 1983 and, since then, took seven trimesters for the GDP the reach its pre-crisis level. Later, the 1989-1992 crisis lasted 11 trimesters and the recovery time was the same: seven trimesters. This crisis, however, had a lower intensity, with an accumulated decrease in the GDP of 7.7%.<ref name="book" />

In turn, the GDP after the 2014 crisis was expected to reach the pre-crisis level in 2022, according to an optimistic estimate, with 20 trimesters of recovery in total. When taking into account not only the GDP, but also the employment rate, the recovery will be even slower. In addition to the sluggish recovery, the new jobs will be of lower quality, including informal and autonomous labor.<ref name="book" />
