==History==
[[File:August 21, 1983 - Aquino Shot Dead!.JPG|left|thumb|The front page of ''Manila Bulletin'', when it was still known as ''Bulletin Today'', on the day after [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]]'s assassination.]]
[[File:Manila Bulletin logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|Former Logo Used from 1991-2019.]]

''Manila Bulletin'' was founded in 1900 by Carlson Taylor as a shipping journal. In 1957, the newspaper was acquired by Swiss expatriate named Hans Menzi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://philippinefolio.com/list-of-books/book-9-give-and-take/29/|title=Book 9: Give and Take, Part 2|first=Larry|last=Henares|work=Philippine Folio|access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref> 

On occasion the editorial policy of the ''Manila Bulletin'' has met objection from civil authorities. During [[World War II]] the newspaper's editor, [[Roy Anthony Cutaran Bennett]], was imprisoned and tortured by the Japanese for his statements opposing the militarist expansion of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. The ''Manila Bulletin'' (as ''Bulletin Today'' from 1972-1986) survived the martial law era of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] as an alleged propaganda tool.

Following the Menzi's death in 1984, [[Chinese Filipino]] business mogul [[Emilio Yap]] became the new chairman of the Bulletin. Yap was invited by Menzi to become a shareholder in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/owners/individual-owners/detail/owner/owner/show/the-yap-family/|title=Media Ownership Monitor: The Yap family|work=The Vera Files|access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref><ref name=pstar>{{cite news|first=Charmie Joy |last=Pagulong|title=Emilio Yap, 88  |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/04/08/1310056/emilio-yap-88 |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] |date=2014-04-08 |access-date=2014-05-04}}</ref>  The company has been listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange since 1990, and had revenues of approximately US$45 million in 2004. Besides its flagship it publishes two other daily tabloids, ''[[Tempo (newspaper)|Tempo]]'' and ''[[Balita (newspaper)|Balita]]'', as well as nine magazines such as the ''[[Philippine Panorama]]'', ''[[Bannawag]]'', ''[[Liwayway]]'', ''[[Bisaya Magasin|Bisaya]]'' and a host of other journals in [[English language|English]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]]. It also publishes a number of lifestyle magazines such as Wedding Essentials, Style Weekend, GARAGE Magazine, Agriculture Magazine, Digital Gen, Going Places and Animal Scene.

The editorial is also featured in its sister papers ''Tempo'' ([[English language|in English]]) and ''Balita'' ([[Tagalog language|in Tagalog]]). To further enhance its image as a newspaper which presents positive news articles, the ''Bulletin'' recently introduced a new marketing tagline, "There's good news here". In 2015, they adopted the marketing tagline "Be Fully Informed" which is still being used throughout 2016.

In addition, it maintains the oldest news website in the Philippines.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} To date, it is the largest subscriber to the [[Philippine News Agency]] among newspapers.

[[File:Manila_Bulletin_Chinese_Edition_front_page_06212020.png|thumb|Front page of the paper's Chinese edition]]

On June 2020, ''Manila Bulletin'' unveiled its Chinese-language online edition, thus becoming the first major Philippine print news outlet to have an online Chinese edition that would cater to the Filipino-Chinese population and the Chinese diaspora [i.e. Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGO) workers] in the Philippines.

==Reception==
On December 22, 2007, survey results by Nielsen Media Research's Nielsen Media Index Study (Enhanced Wave 2), covering the whole year of 2007, showed that the ''Manila Bulletin'' was the choice of 47 "of those who said they had read a broadsheet" with 1.17 million readers. This was lower than rivals ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' (53% with 1.3 million readers), and higher than ''[[The Philippine Star]]'' (42% or 1.05 million readers). Nielsen [[statistical survey|survey]] also showed that the ''[[Philippine Panorama|Panorama]]'' came in second with 35% readership, below ''Sunday Inquirer Magazine'' (39% readership), and above ''Starweek'' (12%).<ref>{{cite news|title=Nielsen survey shows Inquirer is top newspaper |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=108388 |work=Inquirer.net |agency=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211215118/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=108388 |archive-date=December 11, 2009 }}</ref>

Latest Q2 2016 Nielsen Consumer and Media View results put Manila Bulletin, with 48% share of the total Broadsheet market, as the most read Broadsheet in the Philippines. Philippine Daily Inquirer comes in second at 38%, followed by Philippine Star at 14%. Manila Bulletin also had the most number of loyal readers with 42% of its readers not reading any other broadsheet title.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Results from the global survey [[2020 Digital News Report]], an annual project of the [[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]] at [[Oxford University]], revealed that Manila Bulletin, together with The Philippine Star and [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]], was the second most trusted brand at 68%, behind only [[GMA Network]]'s 73%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newman |first1=Nic |last2=Fletcher |first2=Richard |last3=Schulz |first3=Anne |last4=Andı |first4=Simge |last5=Nielsen |first5=Rasmus Kleis |title=Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2020 |url=https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf |website=Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism |access-date=6 August 2020 |page=100 |date=2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Yvonne T. |title=Interest in news high, but trust low in the Philippines—2020 Digital News Report |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/16/20/interest-in-news-high-but-trust-low-in-the-philippines2020-digital-news-report |access-date=6 August 2020 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=16 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617005240/https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/16/20/interest-in-news-high-but-trust-low-in-the-philippines2020-digital-news-report |archive-date=17 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==Controversy==
On June 5, 2008, a Filipino [[blog]]ger sued the ''Bulletin'' for copyright infringement. The photo blogger had discovered that photos that he had taken and posted online had been used by the ''Manila Bulletin'' in the  "Travel & Tourism" section of its March 21, 2007 issue. Apparently, the photographs had been altered and used by the newspaper without the original photographer's consent and without attribution or compensation.<ref name="Yuga20080611">{{cite web | last = Olandres | first = Abe | title = Filipino Photographer sues Manila Bulletin | publisher = Yugatech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews | date = 2008-06-11 | url = http://www.yugatech.com/blog/pinoy-bloggers/filipino-photographer-sues-manila-bulletin/ | access-date =2009-01-05 }}</ref> A month later, the newspaper filed a [[counter-suit]] against the blogger claiming "exemplary and moral damages". The ''Manila Bulletin'' claimed that its use (and alteration, creating [[derivative work]]s) of the photographs constituted [[fair use]].<ref name="Yuga20080709">{{cite web | last = Olandres | first = Abe | title = Manila Bulletin files counter suit against Photoblogger | publisher = Yugatech: Philippine Technology News and Reviews | date = 2008-07-09 | url = http://www.yugatech.com/blog/pinoy-bloggers/filipino-photographer-sues-manila-bulletin/ | access-date =2009-01-05 }}</ref>
