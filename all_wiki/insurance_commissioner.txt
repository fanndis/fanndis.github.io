An '''insurance commissioner''' (or '''commissioner of insurance''') is a [[public official]] in the [[Executive Branch|executive branch]] of a [[U.S. state|state]] or [[Territories of the United States|territory]] in the [[United States]] who, along with his or her office, [[regulation|regulate]] the [[insurance industry]]. The powers granted to the office of an insurance commissioner differ in each state. The office of an insurance commissioner is established either by the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] or by [[statute]]. While most insurance commissioners are appointed, in some [[jurisdiction]]s they are elected.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=State Commissioners - 2014| url=http://www.naic.org/documents/members_state_commissioners_elected_appointed.pdf| website=naic.org|publisher=NAIC| accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> The office of the insurance commissioner may be part of a larger regulatory agency, or an autonomous department.

Insurance law and regulation is established individually by each state. In order to better coordinate insurance regulation among the states and territories, insurance commissioners are members of the [[National Association of Insurance Commissioners]] (NAIC).<ref>{{Cite web|title = About the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)|url = http://www.naic.org/index_about.htm|website = www.naic.org|accessdate = 2015-08-18}}</ref>

== Duties and powers of insurance commissioners  ==
The purpose of insurance commissioners is to maintain fair pricing for insurance products, protecting the solvency of insurance companies, preventing unfair practices by insurance companies, and ensuring availability of insurance coverage.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Purpose of Insurance Regulation: A Preliminary Inquiry in the Theory of Insurance Law|url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/mnlr45&id=489|website = heinonline.org|accessdate = 2015-08-18|last = Kimball|first = Spencer|date = 1961}}</ref> In order to accomplish these goals, each state grants several powers to insurance commissioners and their offices, including:<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://archive.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/263/rand.pdf|title = Insurance Regulation in the United States: Regulatory Federalism and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners|last = Randall|first = Susan|date = 1999|journal = Florida State University Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150611212837/http://archive.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/downloads/263/rand.pdf|archive-date = 2015-06-11|url-status = dead}}</ref>
