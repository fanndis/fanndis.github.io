'''PeopleSoft, Inc.''' was a company that provided [[human resource management systems]] (HRMS), Financial Management Solutions (FMS), [[Supply Chain Management|supply chain management]] (SCM), [[Customer Relationship Management|customer relationship management]] (CRM), and [[enterprise performance management]] (EPM) software, as well as software for manufacturing, and student administration to large [[corporation]]s, governments, and organizations. It existed as an independent corporation until its acquisition by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2005. The PeopleSoft name and product line are now marketed by Oracle.

PeopleSoft Financial Management Solutions (FMS) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) are part of the same package, commonly known as Financials and Supply Chain Management (FSCM).

PeopleSoft Campus Solutions (CS) is a separate package developed as a student information system for colleges and universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/peoplesoft-enterprise/campus-solutions-1915256.pdf|title=PeopleSoft Campus Solutions|last=|first=|date=|website=Oracle|access-date=April 7, 2018}}</ref>

== History ==
Founded in 1987 by Ken Morris and [[David Duffield]], PeopleSoft was originally headquartered in [[Walnut Creek, California]], before moving to [[Pleasanton, California]]. Duffield envisioned a [[client–server]] version of Integral Systems popular [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] HRMS package. He cofounded PeopleSoft after leaving Integral Systems which was also based in Walnut Creek. It should not be confused with [[Integral Systems]] of Columbia, Maryland, a different company. The company's sole venture backing came from IBM.<ref>{{cite web|title=PeopleSoft Inc.- Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on PeopleSoft Inc.|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/16/PeopleSoft-Inc.html|work=Reference for Business|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>  George J. Still, Jr. from [[Norwest Venture Partners]] joined the Board of Directors.<ref>{{cite web|title=George J.

PeopleSoft expanded its product range to include a financials module in 1992, distribution in 1994, and manufacturing in 1996 after the acquisition of Red Pepper.<ref name="CS"/>

== Product design ==

===Application architecture===
The original architecture for the PeopleSoft is a suite of products built on a [[client–server]] (two-tier) approach with a dedicated [[client (computing)|client]].<ref name="CS" /> With the release of version 8, the entire suite was rewritten as an [[n-tier]] [[World Wide Web|web]]-centric design called PeopleSoft Internet Architecture (PIA).<ref name="CS"/> The new format allowed all of a [[company]]'s business functions to be accessed and run from within a [[web browser]].<ref name="CTS">{{cite book

Originally, a small number of security and system setup functions still needed to be performed on a [[fat client|fat-client]] machine; however, this is no longer{{when|date=June 2016}} the case.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The PeopleSoft application suite can function as an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system, similar to [[SAP ERP|SAP]], but can also be used for single modules - for example, [[Student administration system|Student Administration]] or HCM ([[Human Capital Management]]) alone.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

PeopleSoft uses a functionality now known as Integration Broker<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://peoplesofttutorial.com/understanding-peoplesoft-integration-broker-introduction-part-1/|title=Understanding PeopleSoft Integration Broker – Introduction (Part 1)|date=2013-03-11|work=PeopleSoft Tutorial|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}</ref> to communicate with different modules (known as pillars).  In addition Integration Broker can be utilized for web services calls between PeopleSoft and other applications.

===Development platform===
Implementation focuses on PeopleSoft's proprietary [[PeopleTools]] technology. PeopleTools includes many different components used to create web-based applications: a scripting language known as [[PeopleCode]], design tools to define various types of [[metadata]], standard security structure, [[batch processing|batch-processing]] tools, and the ability to interface with a [[SQL]] database. The [[metadata]] describes data for user interfaces, tables, messages, security, navigation, portals, etc. This set of tools can make the PeopleSoft suite [[platform-independent]].

=== Components ===
Before PIA version 8.0, Components were called Panel Groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psoftsearch.com/peoplesoft-component/ |title=Peoplesoft Component |website=psoftsearch.com }}</ref>

== JD Edwards ==
In 2003, PeopleSoft performed a friendly [[merger]] with smaller rival [[JD Edwards]].<ref name="JDE acquisition">{{cite web| title=PeopleSoft to buy J.D. Edwards| first=Margaret| last=Kane| url=http://news.cnet.com/PeopleSoft-to-buy-J.D.-Edwards/2100-1014_3-1011938.html| website=CNET |date=2 June 2003| accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref> The latter's similar product line,  ''World'' and ''OneWorld'', targeted mid-sized companies too small to benefit from PeopleSoft's applications. JD Edwards' software used the [[Configurable Network Computing]] architecture, which shielded applications from both the [[operating system]] and the database back-end. PeopleSoft branded the OneWorld product ''PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne''.<ref>{{cite web| title=PeopleSoft integrates J.D. Edwards software| first=Matt| last=Hines| url=http://news.cnet.com/PeopleSoft-integrates-J.D.-Edwards-software/2100-1012_3-5124022.html| website=CNET |date=15 December 2003| accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref>

== Oracle Corporation acquisition==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=April 2009}}

Beginning in 2003, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] began to maneuver for control of the PeopleSoft company.  In June 2003, Oracle made a $13 billion bid in a hostile corporate [[takeover]] attempt. In February 2004, Oracle decreased their bid to approximately $9.4 billion; this offer was also rejected by PeopleSoft's [[board of directors]]<!--comment
Previous sentence says $9.4 billion is a 33% increase on $13 billion, assuming this is a typo but will eave for someone else to edit ...-->. Complicating Oracle's takeover attempt was PeopleSoft's [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]], allowing their customers to potentially receive refunds of 2–5 times the amount they had paid in the case of a takeover.<ref>{{cite web |work=The Register |title=Oracle chokes on PeopleSoft's poison pill |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/11/oracle_chokes_on_peoplesofts_poison/ |date=11 November 2003}}</ref>

Later that month, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] filed [[lawsuit|suit]] to block Oracle, on the grounds that the acquisition would break [[antitrust]] laws. In September 2004, the suit was rejected by a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal judge]], who found that the Justice Department had not proven its antitrust case. In October, the same decision was handed down by the [[European Commission]]. Although Oracle had reduced its offer to $7.7 billion in May, it again raised its bid in November to $9.4 billion.

In December 2004, Oracle announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire PeopleSoft for approximately $10.3 billion.  A month after the acquisition of PeopleSoft, Oracle cut over half of PeopleSoft's workforce, laying off 6,000 of PeopleSoft's 11,000 employees.<ref name=staff>{{cite web|title=Oracle to PeopleSoft: The pink slip's in the mail |website=CNET |date=14 January 2005 |url=http://news.cnet.com/Oracle-to-PeopleSoft-The-pink-slips-in-the-mail/2100-1014_3-5536612.html |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>

Oracle moved to capitalize on the perceived strong brand loyalty within the JD Edwards user community by rebranding former JD Edwards products. Thus PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne became JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and PeopleSoft World became JD Edwards World. {{citation needed|reason=Information not included in sources on this page.|date=January 2016}}

Oracle announced in 2005 that [[Oracle Fusion Applications|Fusion Applications]] would combine the best aspects of the PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, and Oracle Applications and merge them into a new product suite. {{citation needed|reason=Information not included in sources on this page.|date=January 2016}}

Oracle would later slow the release cadence for PeopleSoft applications, instead releasing "Feature Packs" to add functionality.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/358786 |title=Oracle Announces Oracle’s PeopleSoft Financials and Supply Chain Management 9.1 Feature Pack |date=11 April 2011 |publisher=Oracle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Oracle PeopleSoft Continuous Delivery Model |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zE4aOobdr0 |via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Security==

PeopleSoft applications, which address complex business requirements, have some known issues in terms of online security. PeopleSoft is used by Fortune 500 companies and government organizations, and almost 50% of them are vulnerable and can be hacked via the internet, as researchers state.<ref name="ERPScan">{{cite press release |url=https://erpscan.com/press-center/news/tokenchpoken-attack-on-oracle-peoplesoft-affecting-nearly-half-of-large-enterprises-and-government-organizations/ |title=TokenChpoken attack on Oracle PeopleSoft affecting nearly half of large enterprises and government organizations |date=29 June 2015 |publisher=ERPScan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821160528/https://erpscan.com/press-center/news/tokenchpoken-attack-on-oracle-peoplesoft-affecting-nearly-half-of-large-enterprises-and-government-organizations/ |archive-date=2018-08-21}}</ref>

The risk factor lies in existing vulnerabilities of Oracle PeopleSoft systems that could enable data breaches at businesses, government organizations, and universities.<ref>{{cite web| title=Oracle PeopleSoft attack could enable big data breaches| first=Adam| last=Greenberg| url=https://www.scmagazine.com/peoplesoft-systems-vulnerable-to-tokenchpoken/article/532415/| publisher=CS Media|date=6 July 2015| accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>  Because of this, companies using PeopleSoft applications are under constant threat of cyber attacks.<ref>{{cite web| title=Password reset sites expose crackable PeopleSoft creds| first=Darren| last=Pauli|  url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/05/28/password_reset_sites_expose_crackable_peoplesoft_creds/| website=The Register|date=28 May 2015| accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>

According to the research<ref>{{cite web |title=Oracle PeopleSoft applications are under attacks |url=https://erpscan.com/wp-content/uploads/presentations/2015-Hack-In-Paris-Oracle-PeopleSoft-applications-are-under-attacks.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118151138/https://erpscan.com/wp-content/uploads/presentations/2015-Hack-In-Paris-Oracle-PeopleSoft-applications-are-under-attacks.pdf |archive-date=2018-11-18 |publisher=ERPScan}}</ref> on public-facing Oracle PeopleSoft applications and their vulnerabilities, systems available online are susceptible to the TokenChpoken attack. A TokenChpoken attack, which affects systems that use Single Sign-On (SSO), is possible because an authentication cookie (PS_TOKEN) used by PeopleSoft applications can be forged. When the PS_TOKEN is identified by a "brute force" TokenChpoken attack, it is possible to log in under a system account and gain access to all data from the compromised system.

Since 2010, several cases have been reported of PeopleSoft security breaches. In March 2013, Salem State University in Massachusetts alerted 25,000 students and employees that their Social Security Numbers might have been compromised in a database breach. Similarly, in February 2016, the University of Central Florida disclosed that over 63,000 student Social Security numbers had been compromised.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucf.edu/datasecurity/ |title=Intrusion into UCF Network Involves Personal Data |publisher=University of Central Florida |date=May 19, 2016}}</ref>{{better source|reason=cited source doesn't explicitly mention PeopleSoft|date=April 2018}}

All organizations that use PeopleSoft (including companies specialized in charity, food, manufacturing, retail, transport, etc.) stay vulnerable to TokenChpoken and other interventions if they do not pay due attention to security.<ref>{{cite web| title= PeopleSoft vulnerabilities elevate ERP security issues | first=Michael| last=Mimoso| url=https://threatpost.com/peoplesoft-vulnerabilities-elevate-erp-security-issues/113061/| publisher=Threatpost|date=29 May 2015| accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>
