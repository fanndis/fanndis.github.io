The '''Scottish Government''' ({{native name|gd|'''Riaghaltas na h-Alba'''}}) is the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] government of [[Scotland]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Scottish Parliament 1999-2009: The First Decade |last=Jeffery |first=Charlie  |publisher=Luath Press |year=2009 |isbn=1906817219}}</ref>

The government is led by the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], who selects the Cabinet Secretaries, who attend Cabinet, and Ministers with the approval of [[Scottish Parliament|Parliament]].<ref name="First Minister">{{cite web| title=The First Minister of Scotland| url=http://www.firstminister.gov.scot| date=8 March 2015| publisher=The Scottish Government| accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="cabinet">{{cite web| title=The Scottish Cabinet| url=http://www.gov.scot/About/14944| date=4 July 2012| publisher=The Scottish Government| accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> Government ministers all sit in parliament, and are accountable to it. The government is dependent on parliament to pass primary legislation.

The Government was established in 1999 as the ''Scottish Executive'' under the [[Scotland Act 1998]], which created a devolved administration of [[Scotland]] in line with the result of the [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997 referendum on Scottish devolution]].<ref name="establishment">{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/44/enacted| title=Scotland Act 1998| publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]| accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref> Following increasing use of the name "Government" in place of "Executive" during the first decade of the 21st century, its name was formally changed in law to Scottish Government by the [[Scotland Act 2012]].

==Responsibilities==
{{Politics of Scotland}}
The Scottish Government has power over so-called devolved matters, which are matters not reserved to the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] by Schedule 5 to the [[Scotland Act 1998]], as amended by subsequent revisions to the devolution settlement in the [[Scotland Act 2012]] and [[Scotland Act 2016]].

The original set of devolved matters under the Scotland Act 1998 included:<ref name="Devolved Matters">{{cite web| url= http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/Education/18642.aspx | title= What is Devolution? | publisher=Scottish Parliament| accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>

*Most aspects of [[Transport Scotland|transport]]
*[[Scottish Environmental Protection Agency|Environment]]

The members of the government have substantial influence over [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999|legislation]] in Scotland, putting forward the majority of bills that are successful in becoming Acts of the Scottish Parliament.<ref name="works">{{cite web| title=How the Scottish Parliament Works| url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/visitandlearn/9981.aspx| publisher=gov.scot| accessdate=23 October 2013| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014213042/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/visitandlearn/9981.aspx| archivedate=14 October 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

{{about|the current Scottish Government|previous ones|List of Scottish Governments}}
{{Redirect|Scottish ministers|the pre-1999 use of the term|Scottish Office}}

The government is led by the [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister]]. The [[Scottish Parliament]] nominates one of its members to be appointed as first minister by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|head of state]].<ref name="Fasjj32">{{cite web | url=https://firstminister.gov.scot/about/appointment-role/ | title=Appointment and Role | publisher=Office of the First Minister of Scotland | work=firstminister.gov.scot | date=5 February 2015 | accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> He or she is assisted by various Cabinet secretaries with individual [[Ministry (government department)|portfolios]], who are appointed by the first minister with the approval of Parliament. Junior ministers are similarly appointed to assist Cabinet secretaries in their work. The Scottish law officers, the [[lord advocate]] and [[Solicitor General for Scotland|solicitor general]], can be appointed without being a member of the Scottish Parliament, however, they are subject to Parliament's approval and scrutiny. Law officers are also appointed by the head of state on the recommendation of the first minister.<ref name="Fasjj32" /> The first minister, Cabinet secretaries, junior ministers and the law officers are known collectively as the "Scottish Ministers".
The Scottish Government uses a government structure that has a dual executive structure of a Cabinet that invokes collective decision-making, as well as non-cabinet members as junior ministers. A Cabinet secretary is a member of the Government who partakes in Cabinet, whereas junior ministers assist Cabinet secretaries but are not part of the Scottish Cabinet.

The '''Scottish Cabinet''' is the group of ministers who are collectively responsible for all Scottish Government policy. While parliament is in session, the cabinet meets weekly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2008/11/12105442/5 |title=Guide to Collective Decision Making |publisher=Scottish Government |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> Normally meetings are held on Tuesday afternoons in [[Bute House]], the [[official residence]] of the [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister]]. The cabinet consists of the cabinet secretaries, excluding the Scottish law officers (the lord advocate and the solicitor general). The lord advocate attends meetings of the cabinet only when requested by the first minister, and he is not formally a member.<ref name="excluded">{{cite news| title=Lord Advocate excluded from new Cabinet| url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/lord-advocate-excluded-from-new-cabinet-1-748499| work=[[The Scotsman]]| date=22 May 2007| accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

The cabinet is supported by the Cabinet Secretariat, which is based at [[St Andrew's House]].

===Cabinet Sub-Committees===

There are currently two sub-committees of Cabinet:<ref name="subcommittees">{{cite web| url=http://www.gov.scot/About/14944/CabinetSub-Committees| title=Current Cabinet Sub-Committees| publisher=The Scottish Government|date=13 December 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>

* Cabinet Sub-Committee on [[List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999|Legislation]]
** Membership: the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, the Minister for Parliamentary Business, and the Lord Advocate.
* [[Scottish Government Resilience Room]] (SGoRR) Cabinet Sub-Committee
** Membership: Cabinet Secretary for Justice (Chair), the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and the Lord Advocate.

For several years prior to the [[Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games]] there had been a third sub-committee of Cabinet:
* Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan Delivery Group
** Membership: Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing (Chair), Minister for Community Safety, Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution, Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, Minister for Environment, Minister for Housing and Communities, Minister for Public Health and Sport, Minister for Schools and Skills, and the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change.

== Civil Service ==
<!---Linked from [[Template:Politics of Scotland]]--->

Scottish Government also includes a civil service that supports the Scottish ministers. According to 2012 reports, there are 16,000 civil servants working in core Scottish Government directorates and agencies.<ref name="service">{{cite news |title=Independent Scotland civil service '£700m a year' |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/independent-scotland-civil-service-700m-a-year-1-2954225 |date=5 June 2013 |last=Peterkin |first=Tom |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> The civil service is a matter [[Reserved matter|reserved]] to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] at Westminster (rather than [[devolved]] to [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]]): Scottish Government civil servants work within the rules and customs of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]], but serve the devolved administration rather than [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]].<ref name="faq">{{cite web |title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/FAQs | date=26 June 2012 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

===Permanent Secretary===
{{main|Office of the Permanent Secretary (Scotland)}}
The [[permanent secretary]] is the most senior Scottish civil servant, leads the strategic board, and supports the [[First Minister of Scotland|first minister]] and cabinet. The current permanent secretary is [[Leslie Evans]], who assumed the post in July 2015.

The permanent secretary is a member of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]], and therefore takes part in the permanent secretaries management group of the Civil Service<ref name="permanent">{{cite web |title=Permanent Secretary |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/People/strategic-board/Permanent-Secretary |date=1 May 2013 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref> and is answerable to the most senior civil servant in Britain, the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] (not to be confused with Scottish Government cabinet secretaries), for his or her professional conduct. He or she remains, however, at the direction of the Scottish ministers.

===Directorates===
{{main|Directorates of the Scottish Government}}
"Directorates" are the [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] of the Scottish Government. They serve to execute government policy. Unlike in the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], cabinet secretaries, the equivalent of British government [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|secretaries of state]], do not lead the directorates, and have no direct role in their operation. Instead, the directorates are grouped together into six "Directorates General", each run by a senior civil servant who is titled a "Director-General". As of July 2017, there are six Directorates General:
*[[Constitution and External Affairs Directorates]]
*[[Economy Directorates]]
*[[Education, Communities and Justice Directorates]]
*[[Health and Social Care Directorates]]
*[[Organisational Development and Operations Directorates]]
*[[Scottish Exchequer Directorates]]

Supporting these directorates are a variety of other corporate service teams and professional groups.<ref name="directorates">{{cite web |title=Directorates |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/Directorates |date=23 August 2013 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

The [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] serves as an independent [[prosecutor|prosecution service]] in Scotland, and is a ministerial department of the Scottish Government. It is headed by the [[Lord Advocate]], who is responsible for prosecution, along with the [[Procurator fiscal|procurators fiscal]], under [[Scots law]].

===Strategic Board===
The [[Strategic board of the Scottish Government|strategic board]] is composed of the permanent secretary, the six directors-general, two chief advisers (scientific and economic) and four non-executive directors. The board is responsible for providing support to the government through the permanent secretary, and is the executive of the Scottish civil service.<ref name=SB>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/strategic-board |title=Strategic Board |date=29 May 2013 |publisher=The Scottish Government |accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

===Executive Agencies===
{{main|Executive agencies of the Scottish Government}}
To deliver its work, there are 9 [[Executive agencies of the Scottish Government|executive agencies]] established by ministers as part of government departments, or as departments in their own right, to carry out a discrete area of work. These include, for example, the [[Scottish Prison Service]] and [[Transport Scotland]]. Executive agencies are staffed by civil servants.

There are two non-ministerial departments that form part of the Scottish administration, and therefore the devolved administration, but answer directly to the Scottish Parliament rather than to ministers: these are the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] and the [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]].

===Public Bodies===
{{main|Scottish public bodies}}
The Scottish Government is also responsible for a large number of [[Scottish public bodies|non-departmental public bodies]]. These include executive NDPBs (e.g. [[Scottish Enterprise]]); advisory NDPBs (e.g. the [[Scottish Law Commission]]); [[tribunal]]s (e.g. the [[Children's Panel]] and [[Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland]]); and [[nationalised industries]] (e.g. [[Scottish Water]]).  These are staffed by public servants, rather than civil servants.

The Scottish Government is also responsible for some other public bodies that are not classed as non-departmental public bodies, such as [[NHS Scotland|NHS Boards]], Visiting Committees for Scottish Penal Establishments or [[HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland]].

== Offices ==
The main building of the Scottish Government is [[St Andrew's House]], which is located on [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]] in Edinburgh. Some other government departments are based at [[Victoria Quay, Scotland|Victoria Quay]] in [[Leith]], Saughton House on Broomhouse Drive, and Atlantic Quay on Broomielaw, Glasgow. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has its head offices, and the Lord Advocate's Chambers, at [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]] in central Edinburgh.

There are numerous other Edinburgh properties occupied by the Scottish Government. The Security Branch is based in the old Governor's House on the site of the former Calton Gaol, next door to St Andrew's House on Regent Road. The Government Car Service for Scotland also has its Edinburgh offices on Bonnington Road, in Leith. Other offices are scattered around central Edinburgh, including [[Bute House]] on Charlotte Square, the official residence of the first minister.

New St Andrew's House, above and behind Edinburgh's St James' Centre, was once a large [[Scottish Office]] building, which was occupied from 1973 until 1997, when the last remaining staff moved to Victoria Quay.

The first minister has use of the [[Scotland Office]] building, [[Dover House]] in [[Whitehall]] when necessary.<ref name="dover">{{cite press release| title=Dover House base for Scottish Secretary and Advocate General| url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/1999/03/92100572-43bf-4f95-8abd-63c3e5191ffa| date=8 March 1999| publisher=The Scottish Government| accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

== Name change ==

[[Image:Scottish Executive logo (bilingual).png|thumb|right|300px|The Scottish Executive's original logo, shown with English and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] caption. The logo was replaced in September 2007, with the name changed to "Scottish Government", and the [[Flag of Scotland]] used instead of the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom#Scotland|Royal Arms]]. The original logo is still used by the [[Scotland Office]].]]

The original Scotland Act 1998 gave the name "Scottish Executive" as the legal term for the devolved government. In January 2001, the then First Minister [[Henry McLeish]] suggested changing the official name from "Scottish Executive" to "Scottish Government". The reaction from the [[British Government]] and from some [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members and [[Scottish Labour]] MPs was allegedly hostile.<ref name="britten">{{cite news| last=Britten| first=Nick| title=Fury at bid to rename Scottish Executive| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=10 January 2001| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1314138/Fury-at-bid-to-rename-Scottish-Executive.html| accessdate=23 October 2013| quote=Henry McLeish, the First Minister, threatened to set himself on a collision course with [[Tony Blair]] by wanting to rename the Executive the Scottish Government. The proposal caused an immediate split in Labour ranks and left McLeish facing allegations of arrogance and over-ambition. [[Scotland Office]] minister [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] said that the First Minister should think carefully about using the term "government". He said: "Maybe they should take time to look at how other countries with two tiers of government handle this. Nobody in Germany has any difficulty distinguishing between the government and the devolved administrations."}}</ref> This reaction was in contrast to a 2001 public survey by then-Labour chief whip [[Tom McCabe]], which showed that only 29% of the Scottish public wanted the title Scottish Executive to remain.<ref name=bbcrename>{{cite news| title=Scottish Executive renames itself|publisher=BBC News | date= 3 September 2007| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6974798.stm| accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

Scottish politicians, including the Labour first minister, had often referred to the executive as the "government" and this trend increased following the [[2007 Scottish Parliament general election|2007 election]], when the SNP took office and Labour were in opposition for the first time. On 2 September 2007, the SNP minority government announced that the Scottish Executive was to be retitled as the "Scottish Government".

The renaming was decided unilaterally by the minority government; as a consequence, the SNP was criticised by the three [[Unionism (Scotland)|Unionist]] opposition parties for acting without allowing for parliamentary scrutiny, debate or approval of their plan. However, the term "Scottish Government" has since then become common currency among all of the political parties in Scotland and the rest of the UK.<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-10/sor0225-02.htm Scottish Parliament. Official Report]. 25 February 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605141228/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-10/sor0225-02.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}</ref> The official Gaelic title, ''Riaghaltas na h-Alba'', has always meant "Government of Scotland".

"Scottish Executive" remained the legal name under section 44(1) of the [[Scotland Act 1998]] until 2 July 2012. Neither the Scottish Government nor the Scottish Parliament were able to change the legal name, as this required the [[British Parliament]] to amend the Scotland Act. Section 12(1) of the [[Scotland Act 2012]], which came into effect on 3 July 2012, formally changed the legal title to "Scottish Government".

At the same time that the Scottish Government began to use its new name, a new emblem was adopted. The earlier version featured the old name and a version of the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom#Scotland|Royal Arms for Scotland]], but without the [[motto]], the [[Helmet|helm]], the [[mantling]], the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], the war-cry above the crest, or the flags of [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Flag of England|England]] carried by the [[supporters]]. In the rendering used, both supporters appeared to be crowned with the [[Crown of Scotland]], whereas in the Royal Arms, the Scottish [[unicorn]] is usually shown crowned with the Scottish Crown, and the English lion with [[St Edward's Crown]].

In the September 2007 re-branding, this depiction of the [[Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom#Scotland|Royal Arms]] was replaced by one of the [[Flag of Scotland]].<ref name="aib">{{cite web| url=http://www.aib.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Resource/Doc/4/0001039.pdf| title=Annual Report and Accounts: 2009–10| publisher=[[Accountant in Bankruptcy]]| date=4 August 2010| page=61| accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>  In 2016, a refreshed version of the Scottish Government logo was launched and used on all government websites and letters of correspondence as part of the national Gaelic Language Plan.

== List of successive Scottish Governments ==
{{Main list|List of Scottish Governments}}
