An '''ESPY Award''' (short for '''Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Award''') is an accolade currently presented by the American [[broadcast television]] network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and previously [[ESPN]] (as of the [[2017 ESPY Awards]] the latter still airs them in the form of replays), to recognize individual and team athletic achievement and other sports-related performance during the calendar year preceding a given annual ceremony. The first ESPYs were awarded in 1993. Because of the ceremony's [[ESPY Awards#Ceremonies|rescheduling]] prior to the 2002 iteration thereof, awards presented in 2002 were for achievement and performances during the seventeen-plus previous months. As the similarly styled [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] (for music), [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] (for television), [[Academy Award]] (for film), and [[Tony Award|Tony]] (for theater), the ESPYs are hosted by a contemporary celebrity; the style, though, is lighter, more relaxed and self-referential than many other awards shows, with comedic sketches usually included.

From the show's inception to 2004, ESPY Award winners were chosen only through voting by fans. Since 2004, sportswriters, broadcasters, sports executives, and sportspersons, collectively experts; or [[List of ESPN personalities|ESPN personalities]] also vote.  Award winners have been selected thereafter exclusively through online fan balloting conducted from amongst candidates selected by the ESPY Select Nominating Committee.

==Charitable role==
A portion of the proceeds from sales of tickets to the event devolves on the [[Jim Valvano#V Foundation|V Foundation]], a charity established by [[college basketball|collegiate basketball]] [[head coach|coach]] and television commentator [[Jim Valvano]] to promote [[cancer research]].  Valvano announced the creation of the charitable foundation during his acceptance of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]] during the inaugural ESPY telecast on March 3, 1993, fifty-five days before Valvano's death from [[Carcinoma|metastatic adenocarcinoma]].

==Design==
The ESPY Award statuette was designed and created by sculptor [[Lawrence Nowlan]].<ref name=bmta>{{cite news|title=Sculptor commissioned to complete Joe Frazier statue has died|url=http://www.timesargus.com/article/20130802/NEWS03/708029923/0/FEATURES10|work=[[Barre Montpelier Times Argus]]|date=2013-08-02|accessdate=2013-08-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221231935/http://www.timesargus.com/article/20130802/NEWS03/708029923/0/FEATURES10|archivedate=2014-02-21}}</ref>

==Ceremonies==

===Timing===
Between 1993 and 2001, the ceremony was held each year in either February or March and was broadcast recorded on ESPN.

Between 2002 and 2019, the ceremony was conducted on the Wednesday in July following the [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]; as it marks the only day of the year that none of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional leagues]] or college sports programs have games scheduled for that day—the [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Football League]], and [[National Hockey League]] are not [[season (sports)|in-season]] (though the NBA does have its post-draft training camp [[NBA Summer League]] going on and NFL teams are getting ready for [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]]), colleges are [[summer vacation|in recess for the summer]], and MLB does not contest games on the day following its all-star game—major sports figures (except for cycling, which has the [[Tour de France]], and golf, where [[The Open Championship]] usually starts that evening)- are available to attend. The show aired on the subsequent Sunday four days later, although the results were reported publicly by [[ESPN.com]].

In 2010, the ceremony was aired live by ESPN for the first time since 2003. In 2015, the ESPY Awards moved to network television, airing on ESPN's corporate sister [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

===Location===
The first seven editions of the ESPYs were held in [[New York City]]—in 1993 and 1994 at [[Madison Square Garden]] and from 1995 through 1999, at [[Radio City Music Hall]].  The awards relocated to [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], for two years beginning in 2000, and ultimately settled at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].  In 2006, it was announced that the awards would move in 2008 to the [[Microsoft Theater]] (formerly the Nokia Theatre), to be situated as the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] headquarters of ESPN at [[LA Live]], adjacent to the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], California.

===Hosts===
The ceremonies have been hosted variously by comedians, television and film actors, and sportspeople.  American film actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] is the only individual to have hosted four times (in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2009). Comedian [[Dennis Miller]], actor and singer [[Jamie Foxx]], and talk show host and comedian [[Seth Meyers]] are the only others to have hosted the show more than once.
