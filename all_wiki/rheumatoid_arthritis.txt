<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Rheumatoid arthritis ''' ('''RA''') is a long-term [[autoimmune disorder]] that primarily affects [[synovial joint|joints]].<ref name=NIH2014/> It typically results in warm, swollen, and [[pain]]ful joints.<ref name=NIH2014/> Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest.<ref name=NIH2014/> Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body.<ref name=NIH2014/> The disease may also affect other parts of the body.<ref name=NIH2014/> This may result in a [[anemia|low red blood cell count]], [[pleurisy|inflammation around the lungs]], and [[pericarditis|inflammation around the heart]].<ref name=NIH2014/> Fever and low energy may also be present.<ref name=NIH2014>{{cite web|title=Handout on Health: Rheumatoid Arthritis|url=http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp|website=National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|access-date=July 2, 2015|date=August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630212818/http://niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Rheumatic_Disease/default.asp|archive-date=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.<ref name=Majithia2007/>

===Joints===
[[File:Rheumatoid arthritis joint.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|A diagram showing how rheumatoid arthritis affects a joint]]

[[Arthritis]] of joints involves [[inflammation]] of the [[synovial membrane]]. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected ([[polyarthritis]]). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the [[hand]]s, [[foot|feet]] and [[cervical spine]], but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved.<ref name=Davidson2014/>{{rp|1098}} [[Synovitis]] can lead to [[Tether (cell biology)|tethering]] of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing [[deformity]] and loss of function.<ref name=Majithia2007/> The [[fibroblast-like synoviocyte]]s (FLS), highly specialized mesenchymal cells found in the [[synovial membrane]], have an active and prominent role in these pathogenic processes of the rheumatic joints.<ref name="nygaard">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nygaard G, Firestein GS | s2cid = 218573182 | title = Restoring synovial homeostasis in rheumatoid arthritis by targeting fibroblast-like synoviocytes | journal = Nature Reviews.

RA typically manifests with signs of inflammation, with the affected joints being swollen, warm, painful and stiff, particularly early in the morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity. Increased stiffness early in the morning is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as [[osteoarthritis]]. In arthritis of non-inflammatory causes, signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less prominent.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Suresh E | title = Diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis: what the non-specialist needs to know | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 97 | issue = 9 | pages = 421–4 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15340020 | pmc = 1079582 | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.97.9.421 }}</ref>
The pain associated with RA is induced at the site of inflammation and classified as [[nociceptive]] as opposed to [[neuropathic]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaffo A, Saag KG, Curtis JR | title = Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 63 | issue = 24 | pages = 2451–65 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17158693 | pmc = 5164397 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp050514 }}</ref> The joints are often affected in a fairly symmetrical fashion, although this is not specific, and the initial presentation may be asymmetrical.<ref name=Davidson2014>{{cite book|editor1-last=Walker|editor1-first=Brian R.|editor2-last=Colledge|editor2-first=Nicki R.|editor3-last=Ralston|editor3-first=Stuart H.|editor4-last=Penman|editor4-first=Ian D. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine|date=2014|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7020-5035-0|edition=22nd}}</ref>{{rp|1098}}

As the pathology progresses the inflammatory activity leads to tendon tethering and erosion and destruction of the joint surface, which impairs range of movement and leads to [[deformity]]. The fingers may suffer from almost any [[deformity]] depending on which joints are most involved. Specific [[Deformity|deformities]], which also occur in [[osteoarthritis]], include [[ulnar deviation]], [[boutonniere deformity]] (also "buttonhole deformity", [[flexion]] of proximal interphalangeal joint and extension of distal [[Interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joint]] of the hand), [[swan neck deformity]] (hyperextension at proximal interphalangeal joint and flexion at distal interphalangeal joint) and "Z-thumb." "Z-thumb" or "Z-deformity" consists of [[hyperextension]] of the interphalangeal joint, fixed flexion and [[subluxation]] of the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]] and gives a "Z" appearance to the thumb.<ref name=Davidson2014 />{{rp|1098}} The [[hammer toe]] [[deformity]] may be seen. In the worst case, joints are known as [[arthritis mutilans]] due to the mutilating nature of the deformities.<ref name="McGraw Hill">{{cite book |last1=Shah |first1=Ankur | name-list-style = vanc |date=2012|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=United States|isbn=978-0-07174889-6|pages = 2738|edition=18th}}</ref>

===Skin===
The [[rheumatoid nodule]], which is sometimes in the skin, is the most common non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA.<ref name=Tur2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Turesson C | title = Extra-articular rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Current Opinion in Rheumatology | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 360–6 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23425964 | doi = 10.1097/bor.0b013e32835f693f }}</ref> It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a "[[necrotizing]] [[granuloma]]". The [[initial]] pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of [[fibrinoid necrosis]] that may be [[fissure]]d and which corresponds to the [[fibrin]]-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading [[macrophages]] and [[fibroblasts]], corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of [[connective tissue]] containing clusters of [[lymphocyte]]s and [[plasma cell]]s, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the [[olecranon|elbow]], the [[calcaneal tuberosity|heel]], the [[metacarpophalangeal joints|knuckles]], or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF ([[rheumatoid factor]]) [[titer]], ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziff M | title = The rheumatoid nodule | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 761–7 | date = June 1990 | pmid = 2194460 | doi = 10.1002/art.1780330601 }}</ref>

Several forms of [[vasculitis]] occur in RA, but are mostly seen with long-standing and untreated disease. The most common presentation is due to involvement of small- and medium-sized vessels. Rheumatoid vasculitis can thus commonly present with skin ulceration and vasculitic nerve infarction known as [[mononeuritis multiplex]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Genta MS, Genta RM, Gabay C | title = Systemic rheumatoid vasculitis: a review | journal = Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 88–98 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17023257 | doi = 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2006.04.006 }}</ref>

Other, rather rare, skin associated symptoms include [[pyoderma gangrenosum]], [[Sweet's syndrome]], drug reactions, [[erythema nodosum]], lobe [[panniculitis]], [[atrophy]] of finger skin, [[palmar erythema]], and skin fragility (often worsened by corticosteroid use).{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[Diffuse alopecia areata]] (Diffuse AA) occurs more commonly in people with rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name=":1" /> RA is also seen more often in those with relatives who have AA.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Khan Mohammad Beigi |first=Pooya |s2cid=46954629 | name-list-style = vanc |date=2018|title=Alopecia Areata|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72134-7|isbn=978-3-319-72133-0}}</ref>

===Lungs===
[[Lung fibrosis]] is a recognized complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It is also a rare but well-recognized consequence of therapy (for example with [[methotrexate]] and [[leflunomide]]). [[Caplan's syndrome]] describes lung nodules in individuals with RA and additional exposure to [[coal]] dust. [[Exudate|Exudative]] [[pleural effusion]]s are also associated with RA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim EJ, Collard HR, King TE | title = Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: the relevance of histopathologic and radiographic pattern | journal = Chest | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 1397–1405 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19892679 | pmc = 2818853 | doi = 10.1378/chest.09-0444 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Balbir-Gurman A, Yigla M, Nahir AM, Braun-Moscovici Y | title = Rheumatoid pleural effusion | journal = Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 368–78 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16765714 | doi = 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2006.03.002 }}</ref>

===Heart and blood vessels===
People with RA are more prone to [[atherosclerosis]], and risk of [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) and [[stroke]] is markedly increased.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe F, Mitchell DM, Sibley JT, Fries JF, Bloch DA, Williams CA, Spitz PW, Haga M, Kleinheksel SM, Cathey MA | title = The mortality of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 481–94 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8147925 | doi = 10.1002/art.1780370408 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aviña-Zubieta JA, Choi HK, Sadatsafavi M, Etminan M, Esdaile JM, Lacaille D | title = Risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 1690–7 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19035419 | doi = 10.1002/art.24092 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alenghat FJ | title = The Prevalence of Atherosclerosis in Those with Inflammatory Connective Tissue Disease by Race, Age, and Traditional Risk Factors | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 20303 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842423 | pmc = 4740809 | doi = 10.1038/srep20303 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...620303A }}</ref>
Other possible complications that may arise include: [[pericarditis]], [[endocarditis]], left ventricular failure, valvulitis and [[fibrosis]].<ref name="Gupta">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta A, Fomberstein B |title=Evaluating cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Journal of Musculoskeletal Medicine |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=481–94 |year=2009 |url=http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/content/article/1145622/1433094 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723164920/http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/content/article/1145622/1433094 |archive-date=2012-07-23 }}</ref> Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel when they have angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce cardiovascular risk, it is crucial to maintain optimal control of the [[inflammation]] caused by RA (which may be involved in causing the cardiovascular risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.<ref name="Gupta"/>

===Blood===
[[Anemia]] is by far the most common abnormality of the blood cells which can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. The chronic inflammation caused by RA leads to raised [[hepcidin]] levels, leading to [[anemia of chronic disease]] where iron is poorly absorbed and also sequestered into [[macrophages]]. The red cells are of normal size and color (normocytic and normochromic). A [[neutropenia|low white blood cell count]] usually only occurs in people with [[Felty's syndrome]] with an enlarged liver and spleen. The mechanism of neutropenia is complex. An [[thrombocytosis|increased platelet count]] occurs when inflammation is uncontrolled.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Rather more common is the indirect effect of [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]], which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by [[lymphocyte]] infiltration of [[lacrimal gland|lacrimal]] and [[salivary gland]]s. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to [[keratitis]] and loss of vision as well as being painful. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as [[nasolacrimal duct]] blockage is important.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==== Liver ====
Liver problems in people with rheumatoid arthritis may be due to the underlying disease process or as a result of the medications used to treat the disease.<ref name="Selmi2011" /> A coexisting autoimmune liver disease, such as [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] or [[autoimmune hepatitis]] may also cause problems.<ref name="Selmi2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Selmi C, De Santis M, Gershwin ME | title = Liver involvement in subjects with rheumatic disease | journal = Arthritis Research & Therapy | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 226 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21722332 | pmc = 3218873 | doi = 10.1186/ar3319 }}</ref>

==== Neurological ====
[[Peripheral neuropathy]] and [[mononeuritis multiplex]] may occur. The most common problem is [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. [[Rheumatoid disease of the spine]] can lead to [[myelopathy]]. [[Atlanto-axial joint|Atlanto-axial]] [[subluxation]] can occur, owing to erosion of the [[odontoid process]] and/or [[transverse ligament]]s in the [[cervical spine]]'s connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to [[vertebrae]] slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to [[quadriplegia]] or even death.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wasserman BR, Moskovich R, Razi AE | title = Rheumatoid arthritis of the cervical spine--clinical considerations | journal = Bulletin of the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–48 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22035393 | url = http://hjdbulletin.org/files/archive/pdfs/222.pdf }}</ref>

==== Constitutional symptoms ====
[[Constitutional symptoms]] including [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], low grade [[fever]], [[malaise]], [[morning stiffness]], [[loss of appetite]] and [[loss of weight]] are common systemic manifestations seen in people with active RA.

==== Bones ====
Local [[osteoporosis]] occurs in RA around inflamed joints. It is postulated to be partially caused by inflammatory [[cytokines]]. More general osteoporosis is probably contributed to by immobility, systemic cytokine effects, local cytokine release in bone marrow and corticosteroid therapy.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Risk factors ==
RA is a systemic (whole body) autoimmune disease. Some genetic and environmental factors affect the risk for RA.

===Genetic===
A family history of RA increases the risk around three to five times; as of 2016, it was estimated that genetics may account for between 40 and 65% of cases of seropositive RA, but only around 20% for seronegative RA.<ref name=Lancet2016/>  RA is strongly associated with genes of the inherited tissue type [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) antigen. [[HLA-DR4]] is the major genetic factor implicated – the relative importance varies across ethnic groups.<ref name="Elsevier"/>

[[Genome-wide association studies]] examining [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s have found around one hundred genes associated with RA risk, with most of them involving the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] system (particularly [[HLA-DRB1]]) which controls recognition of self versus nonself molecules; other mutations affecting co-stimulatory immune pathways, for example [[CD28]] and [[CD40]], cytokine signaling, lymphocyte receptor activation threshold (e.g., [[PTPN22]]), and innate immune activation appear to have less influence than HLA mutations.<ref name=Lancet2016/><ref name="pmid131669381">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghorban KH, Ezzeddini R, Eslami M, Yousefi B, Sadighi Moghaddam B, Tahoori MT, Dadmanesh M, Salek Farrokhi A | title = PTPN22 1858 C/T polymorphism is associated with alteration of cytokine profiles as a potential pathogenic mechanism in rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Immunology Letters | volume = 216 | pages = 106–113 | date = December 2019 | pmid = 31669381 | doi = 10.1016/j.imlet.2019.10.010 | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165247819303918#! }}</ref>

===Negative findings===
No infectious agent has been consistently linked with RA and there is no evidence of disease clustering to indicate its infectious cause,<ref name="Elsevier">{{cite book| vauthors = Doherty M, Lanyon P, Ralston SH |title=Musculosketal Disorders-Davidson's Principle of Internal Medicine| publisher=Elsevier|pages=1100–1106|edition=20th}}</ref> but [[periodontal disease]] has been consistently associated with RA.<ref name=Lancet2016/>

==Pathophysiology==
RA primarily starts as a state of persistent cellular activation leading to [[autoimmunity]] and [[immune complex]]es in joints and other organs where it manifests.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The clinical manifestations of disease are primarily inflammation of the [[synovial membrane]] and joint damage, and the fibroblast-like synoviocytes play a key role in these pathogenic processes.<ref name=nygaard/> Three phases of progression of RA are an initiation phase (due to non-specific inflammation), an amplification phase (due to [[T cell]] activation), and chronic inflammatory phase, with tissue injury resulting from the [[cytokines]], [[Interleukin 1|IL–1]], [[TNF-alpha]] and [[Interleukin 6|IL–6]].<ref name="McGraw Hill"/>

===Non-specific inflammation===
Factors allowing an abnormal immune response, once initiated, become permanent and chronic. These factors are [[genetic disorder]]s which change regulation of the [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]].<ref name=Lancet2016/> Genetic factors interact with environmental risk factors for RA, with cigarette smoking as the most clearly defined risk factor.<ref name=Sugiyama2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sugiyama D, Nishimura K, Tamaki K, Tsuji G, Nakazawa T, Morinobu A, Kumagai S | s2cid = 11303269 | title = Impact of smoking as a risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–81 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19174392 | doi = 10.1136/ard.2008.096487 | url = http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/repository/90001457.pdf }}{{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Padyukov L, Silva C, Stolt P, Alfredsson L, Klareskog L | title = A gene-environment interaction between smoking and shared epitope genes in HLA-DR provides a high risk of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 50 | issue = 10 | pages = 3085–92 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15476204 | doi = 10.1002/art.20553 | url = http://rsp.ima-press.net/rsp/article/view/1939 }}{{subscription}}</ref>

Other environmental and hormonal factors may explain higher risks for women, including onset after childbirth and hormonal medications. A possibility for increased susceptibility is that negative feedback mechanisms &ndash; which normally maintain tolerance &ndash; are overtaken by positive feedback mechanisms for certain antigens, such as IgG Fc bound by [[rheumatoid factor]] and citrullinated fibrinogen bound by [[Anti-citrullinated protein antibody|antibodies to citrullinated peptides]] (ACPA - Anti–citrullinated protein antibody). A debate on the relative roles of B-cell produced immune complexes and T cell products in inflammation in RA has continued for 30 years, but neither cell is necessary at the site of inflammation, only autoantibodies to IgGFc, known as rheumatoid factors and ACPA, with ACPA having an 80% specificity for diagnosing RA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hua C, Daien CI, Combe B, Landewe R | title = Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis | journal = RMD Open | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = e000406 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28155923 | pmc = 5237764 | doi = 10.1136/rmdopen-2016-000406 }}</ref> As with other autoimmune diseases, people with RA have abnormally glycosylated antibodies, which are believed to promote joint inflammation.<ref name="immune_glycan">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin ME, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity: a critical review | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 }}{{subscription}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}

===Amplification in the synovium===
Once the generalized abnormal immune response has become established &ndash; which may take several years before any symptoms occur &ndash; plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes produce rheumatoid factors and ACPA of the IgG and IgM classes in large quantities. These activate macrophages through Fc receptor and complement binding, which is part of the intense inflammation in RA.<ref>{{Cite book|vauthors=Boldt AB, Goeldner I, de Messias-Reason IJ |pmid=22397030|title=Relevance of the lectin pathway of complement in rheumatic diseases|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-394317-0.00012-1|volume=56|journal=Adv Clin Chem|pages=105–53|year=2012|series=Advances in Clinical Chemistry|isbn=9780123943170}}{{subscription}}</ref> Binding of an autoreactive antibody to the Fc receptors is mediated through the antibody's N-glycans, which are altered to promote inflammation in people with RA.<ref name = "immune_glycan"/>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}

Cytokines and chemokines attract and accumulate immune cells, i.e. activated T- and B cells, monocytes and macrophages from activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes, in the joint space.

The aggressive phenotype of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis and the effect these cells have on the microenvironment of the joint can be summarized into hallmarks that distinguish them from healthy fibroblast-like synoviocytes. These hallmark features of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis are divided into 7 cell-intrinsic hallmarks and 4 cell-extrinsic hallmarks.<ref name=nygaard/> The cell-intrinsic hallmarks are: reduced apoptosis, impaired contact inhibition, increased migratory invasive potential, changed epigenetic landscape, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, genomic instability and mutations, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism.  The cell-extrinsic hallmarks of FLS in RA are: promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion, contributes to cartilage degradation, induces synovial angiogenesis, and recruits and stimulates immune cells.<ref name=nygaard/>

[[X-ray]]s of the hands and feet are generally performed when many joints affected. In RA, there may be no changes in the early stages of the disease or the x-ray may show [[osteopenia]] near the joint, soft tissue swelling, and a smaller than normal joint space. As the disease advances, there may be bony erosions and subluxation. Other medical imaging techniques such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and ultrasound are also used in RA.<ref name="McGraw Hill"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Takase-Minegishi K, Horita N, Kobayashi K, Yoshimi R, Kirino Y, Ohno S, Kaneko T, Nakajima H, Wakefield RJ, Emery P | title = Diagnostic test accuracy of ultrasound for synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Rheumatology | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–58 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28340066 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/kex036 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Technical advances in ultrasonography like high-frequency transducers (10&nbsp;MHz or higher) have improved the spatial resolution of ultrasound images depicting 20% more erosions than conventional radiography. Color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound are useful in assessing the degree of synovial inflammation as they can show vascular signals of active synovitis. This is important, since in the early stages of RA, the synovium is primarily affected, and synovitis seems to be the best predictive marker of future joint damage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schueller-Weidekamm |first1=Claudia | name-list-style = vanc |date=Apr 29, 2010 |title=Modern ultrasound methods yield stronger arthritis work-up |journal=Diagnostic Imaging |volume=32 |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/ultrasound/modern-ultrasound-methods-yield-stronger-arthritis-work }}</ref>

===Blood tests===
When RA is clinically suspected, a physician may test for [[rheumatoid factor]] (RF) and [[anti-citrullinated protein antibodies]] (ACPAs measured as anti-CCP antibodies).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Westwood OM, Nelson PN, Hay FC | title = Rheumatoid factors: what's new? | journal = Rheumatology | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 379–85 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16418203 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/kei228 | doi-access = free }}{{subscription}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}}
It is positive in 75-85%, but a  negative RF or CCP antibody does not rule out RA, rather, the arthritis is called ''[[seronegative]]'', which is in about 15-25% of people with RA.<ref name=Nishimura>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishimura K, Sugiyama D, Kogata Y, Tsuji G, Nakazawa T, Kawano S, Saigo K, Morinobu A, Koshiba M, Kuntz KM, Kamae I, Kumagai S | s2cid = 6640507 | title = Meta-analysis: diagnostic accuracy of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor for rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 146 | issue = 11 | pages = 797–808 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17548411 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-146-11-200706050-00008 }}{{subscription}}</ref> During the first year of illness, rheumatoid factor is more likely to be negative with some individuals becoming seropositive over time.

Therefore, the test is not [[Specificity (tests)|specific]] for RA.<ref name="McGraw Hill"/>

Hence, new serological tests check for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies ACPAs. These tests are again positive in 61-75% of all RA cases, but with a specificity of around 95%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van Venrooij WJ, van Beers JJ, Pruijn GJ | s2cid = 11858403 | title = Anti-CCP antibodies: the past, the present and the future | journal = Nature Reviews.

The new criterion is not a diagnostic criterion but a classification criterion to identify disease with a high likelihood of developing a chronic form.<ref name="McGraw Hill"/> However a score of 6 or greater unequivocally classifies a person with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

These new classification criteria overruled the "old" ACR criteria of 1987 and are adapted for early RA diagnosis. The "new" classification criteria, jointly published by the [[American College of Rheumatology]] (ACR) and the [[European League Against Rheumatism]] (EULAR) establish a point value between 0 and 10. Four areas are covered in the diagnosis:<ref name=acr-eular/>
* joint involvement, designating the [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s, [[proximal interphalangeal joint]]s, the [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joint]] of the thumb, second through fifth [[metatarsophalangeal joint]] and [[wrist]] as ''small joints'', and [[shoulder]]s, [[elbow]]s, [[hip joint]]s, [[knee]]s, and [[ankle]]s as ''large joints'':
** Involvement of 1 large joint gives 0 points
** Involvement of 2–10 large joints gives 1 point
** Involvement of 1–3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) gives 2 points
** Involvement of 4–10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) gives 3 points
** Involvement of more than 10 joints (with involvement of at least 1 small joint) gives 5 points
* serological parameters – including the [[rheumatoid factor]] as well as [[anti-citrullinated protein antibody|ACPA]] – "ACPA" stands for "anti-citrullinated protein antibody":
** Negative RF ''and'' negative ACPA gives 0 points
** Low-positive RF ''or'' low-positive ACPA gives 2 points
** High-positive RF ''or'' high-positive ACPA gives 3 points
* acute phase reactants: 1 point for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]], or elevated [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] value (c-reactive protein)
* duration of [[arthritis]]: 1 point for symptoms lasting six weeks or longer

The new criteria accommodate to the growing understanding of RA and the improvements in diagnosing RA and disease treatment. In the "new" criteria serology and [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune diagnostics]] carries major weight, as ACPA detection is appropriate to diagnose the disease in an early state, before joints destructions occur. Destruction of the joints viewed in radiological images was a significant point of the ACR criteria from 1987.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnett FC, Edworthy SM, Bloch DA, McShane DJ, Fries JF, Cooper NS, Healey LA, Kaplan SR, Liang MH, Luthra HS | title = The American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 315–24 | date = March 1988 | pmid = 3358796 | doi = 10.1002/art.1780310302 }}</ref> This criterion no longer is regarded to be relevant, as this is just the type of damage that treatment is meant to avoid.

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Synovial fluid analysis}}
Several other medical conditions can resemble RA, and need to be distinguished from it at the time of diagnosis:<ref name=Merckmanual>{{cite book | editor=Berkow R | title=The Merck Manual | edition=16th | publisher=Merck Publishing Group | year=1992 | pages=1307–08 | isbn=978-0-911910-16-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/merckmanualofdia16berk }}{{subscription}}</ref>
* Crystal induced arthritis ([[gout]], and [[pseudogout]]) – usually involves particular joints (knee, MTP1, heels) and can be distinguished with an aspiration of joint fluid if in doubt. Redness, asymmetric distribution of affected joints, pain occurs at night and the starting pain is less than an hour with gout.
* [[Osteoarthritis]] – distinguished with [[X-ray]]s of the affected joints and blood tests, older age, starting pain less than an hour, asymmetric distribution of affected joints and pain worsens when using joint for longer periods.
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) – distinguished by specific clinical symptoms and blood tests (antibodies against double-stranded DNA)
* One of the several types of [[psoriatic arthritis]] resembles RA – nail changes and skin symptoms distinguish between them
* [[Lyme disease]] causes erosive arthritis and may closely resemble RA – it may be distinguished by blood test in endemic areas
* [[Reactive arthritis]] – asymmetrically involves heel, [[sacroiliac]] joints and large joints of the leg. It is usually associated with [[urethritis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[iritis]], painless buccal ulcers, and [[keratoderma blennorrhagica]].
* [[Axial spondyloarthritis]] (including [[ankylosing spondylitis]]) – this involves the spine, although an RA-like symmetrical small-joint polyarthritis may occur in the context of this condition.
* [[Hepatitis C]] – RA-like symmetrical small-joint polyarthritis may occur in the context of this condition. Hepatitis C may also induce rheumatoid factor auto-antibodies.

Rarer causes which usually behave differently but may cause joint pains:<ref name=Merckmanual/>
* [[Sarcoidosis]], [[amyloidosis]], and [[Whipple's disease]] can also resemble RA.
* [[Hemochromatosis]] may cause hand joint arthritis.
* Acute rheumatic fever can be differentiated by a migratory pattern of joint involvement and evidence of antecedent [[streptococcal]] infection.
* Bacterial arthritis (such as by ''[[Streptococcus]]'') is usually asymmetric, while RA usually involves both sides of the body symmetrically.
* [[Gonococcal]] arthritis (a bacterial arthritis) is also initially migratory and can involve [[tendon]]s around the wrists and ankles.

Sometimes arthritis is in an undifferentiated stage (i.e. none of the above criteria is positive), even if synovitis is witnessed and assessed with ultrasound imaging.

===Monitoring progression===

Many tools can be used to monitor remission in rheumatoid arthritis.
*DAS28: ''Disease Activity Score of 28 joints'' ({{visible anchor|DAS28}}) is widely used as an indicator of RA disease activity and response to treatment. Joints included are ([[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally]]): [[proximal interphalangeal joint]]s (10 joints), [[metacarpophalangeal joint]]s (10), [[wrist]]s (2), [[elbow]]s (2), [[shoulder]]s (2) and [[knee]]s (2). When looking at these joints, both the number of joints with tenderness upon touching (TEN28) and swelling (SW28) are counted. The [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) is measured and the affected person makes a subjective assessment (SA) of disease activity during the preceding 7 days on a scale between 0 and 100, where 0 is "no activity" and 100 is "highest activity possible". With these parameters, DAS28 is calculated as:<ref name=Prevoo1995/>
<math>DAS28=0.56 \times \sqrt{TEN28} + 0.28 \times \sqrt{SW28} + 0.70 \times \ln(ESR) + 0.014 \times SA</math>

From this, the disease activity of the affected person can be classified as follows:<ref name=Prevoo1995>{{cite journal | vauthors = Prevoo ML, van 't Hof MA, Kuper HH, van Leeuwen MA, van de Putte LB, van Riel PL | title = Modified disease activity scores that include twenty-eight-joint counts.

===Disease modifying agents===
[[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) are the primary treatment for RA.<ref name=ACR2015/> They are a diverse collection of drugs, grouped by use and convention. They have been found to improve symptoms, decrease joint damage, and improve overall functional abilities.<ref name=ACR2015/>  DMARDs should be started early in the disease as they result in disease remission in approximately half of people and improved outcomes overall.<ref name=ACR2015/>

The following drugs are considered as DMARDs: [[methotrexate]], [[hydroxychloroquine]], [[sulfasalazine]], [[leflunomide]], TNF-alpha inhibitors ([[Certolizumab pegol|certolizumab]], [[infliximab]] and [[etanercept]]), [[abatacept]], and [[anakinra]]. [[Rituximab]] and [[tocilizumab]] are monoclonal antibodies and are also DMARDs.<ref name=ACR2015/> Use of tocilizumab is associated with a risk of increased cholesterol levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Isaacs D | title = Infectious risks associated with biologics | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 764 | pages = 151–8 | date = 2010-07-07 | pmid = 23654064 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd008331.pub2 }}</ref>

The [[American College of Rheumatology]] states that no herbal medicines have health claims supported by high-quality evidence and thus they do not recommend their use.<ref name=ACRCAM/> There is no scientific basis to suggest that herbal supplements advertised as "natural" are safer for use than conventional medications as both are chemicals. Herbal medications, although labelled "natural", may be toxic or fatal if consumed.<ref name=ACRCAM>{{cite web|title=Herbal Remedies, Supplements and Acupuncture for Arthritis|url=http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/Diseases_And_Conditions/Herbal_Remedies,_Supplements_and_Acupuncture_for_Arthritis/|publisher=American College of Rheumatology|access-date=May 3, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505001915/http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/Diseases_And_Conditions/Herbal_Remedies,_Supplements_and_Acupuncture_for_Arthritis/|archive-date=May 5, 2013}}</ref>

The course of the disease varies greatly. Some people have mild short-term symptoms, but in most the disease is progressive for life. Around 25% will have subcutaneous nodules (known as [[rheumatoid nodule]]s);<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health| vauthors = Carlson KJ, Eisenstat SA, Ziporyn TD  |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2004|location=Cambridge, MA|via=Credo Reference}}</ref> this is associated with a poor prognosis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arthritis and You|last=Ali|first=Naheed | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781442219014|location=Lanham, MD|pages=[https://archive.org/details/arthritisyoucomp0000alin/page/138 138]|url=https://archive.org/details/arthritisyoucomp0000alin/page/138}}</ref>

===Prognostic factors===
Poor prognostic factors include,
* Persistent synovitis
* Early erosive disease
* Extra-articular findings (including subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules)
* Positive serum RF findings
* Positive serum anti-CCP autoantibodies
* Carriership of HLA-DR4 "Shared Epitope" alleles
* Family history of RA
* Poor functional status
* Socioeconomic factors
* Elevated acute phase response (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP])
* Increased clinical severity.

===Mortality===
RA reduces lifespan on average from three to twelve years.<ref name="Wasserman"/> Young age at onset, long disease duration, the presence of other health problems, and characteristics of severe RA—such as poor functional ability or overall health status, a lot of joint damage on x-rays, the need for hospitalisation or involvement of organs other than the joints—have been shown to associate with higher mortality.<ref>Kitas, George (4 April 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924153339/http://www.rheumatoid.org.uk/article.php?article_id=112 Why is life span shortened by Rheumatoid Arthritis?] National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society</ref> Positive responses to treatment may indicate a better prognosis.

===Etymology===
Rheumatoid arthritis is derived from the Greek word ''ῥεύμα-rheuma (nom.), ῥεύματος-rheumatos (gen.)'' ("flow, current"). The suffix -''oid'' ("resembling") gives the translation as ''joint inflammation that resembles [[rheumatic fever]]''. Rhuma which means watery discharge might refer to the fact that the joints are swollen or that the disease may be made worse by wet weather.<ref name=Paget2002/>
