According to research published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, children can suffer the effects of Postpartum Depression. If a mother experiences Postpartum Depression that goes untreated, it can have adverse effects on her children. When a child is in infancy, these problems can include unusual amounts of crying (colic) and not having normal sleeping patterns. These problems can have a cyclical effect, meaning that they can further agitate the mothers Postpartum Depression and can even lead to the mother further developing Postpartum Depression. These cyclical effects can affect the way the mother maintains her relationship with her child. These can include the stopping of breastfeeding, as well as negative emotions such as withdrawal, disengagement, and even hostility. If a mother develops a hostile relationship, it can lead to extreme outcomes such as infanticide.

As the child grows older, Postpartum Depression can lead to the child experiencing irregularities in cognitive processes, behaviors, and emotions. In addition to these abnormalities, children who grew up around Postpartum Depression also are susceptible to developing violent tendencies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pearlstein |first1=Teri |title=Postpartum Depression |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937808022710?casa_token=hPhQNnWDvYUAAAAA:ViBmkbbkea9qFiQhmDyqMoiegkutiFmgaGUF2b-oaiZXvCHI2CCdjLV9QCCR1uZmBaJ4aR9MyoA |website=Science Direct |publisher=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |accessdate=11/20/2020}}</ref>

==Causes==
The cause of PPD is unknown. Hormonal and physical changes, personal and family history of depression, and the stress of caring for a new baby all may contribute to the development of postpartum depression.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Postpartum Depression|url=https://medlineplus.gov/postpartumdepression.html|access-date=2020-09-25|website=medlineplus.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=NIMH » Perinatal Depression|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/perinatal-depression/index.shtml|access-date=2020-09-25|website=www.nimh.nih.gov}}</ref>

Of these risk factors a history of depression, and cigarette smoking have been shown to have additive effects.<ref name=McCoy-200604 /> Some studies have found a link with low levels of DHA in the mother.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hibbeln JR | title = Seafood consumption, the DHA content of mothers' milk and prevalence rates of postpartum depression: a cross-national, ecological analysis | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 69 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 15–29 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12103448 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00374-3 }}</ref>

These above factors are known to [[correlation|correlate]] with PPD. This correlation does not mean these factors are causal. Rather, they might both be caused by some third factor. Contrastingly, some factors almost certainly attribute to the cause of postpartum depression, such as lack of social support.<ref>The causal role of lack of social support in PPD is strongly suggested by several studies, including O'Hara 1985, Field et al. 1985; and Gotlib et al. 1991.</ref> The relationship between breastfeeding and PPD is not clear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dias CC, Figueiredo B | title = Breastfeeding and depression: a systematic review of the literature | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 171 | pages = 142–54 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25305429 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2014.09.022 | hdl = 1822/41376 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>

Women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more resources, such as financial. Rates of PPD have been shown to decrease as income increases.<ref name="Segre"/>  Women with fewer resources may be more likely to have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, increasing risk of PPD. Women with fewer resources may also include single mothers of low income. Single mothers of low income may have more limited access to resources while transitioning into motherhood.

Studies have also shown a correlation between a mother's [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and postpartum depression. African American mothers have been shown to have the highest risk of PPD at 25%, while Asian mothers had the lowest at 11.5%, after controlling for social factors such as age, income, education, marital status, and baby's health. The PPD rates for First Nations, Caucasian and Hispanic women fell in between.<ref name="Segre">{{cite journal | vauthors = Segre LS, O'Hara MW, Losch ME |s2cid=144993416 |doi=10.1080/02646830600643908 |title=Race/ethnicity and perinatal depressed mood |year=2006 |journal=Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=99–106}}</ref>

Migration away from a cultural community of support can be a factor in PPD. Traditional cultures around the world prioritize organized support during postpartum care to ensure the mother's mental and physical health, wellbeing, and recovery.<ref name=Den2007 />

One of the strongest predictors of paternal PPD is having a partner who has PPD, with fathers developing PPD 50% of the time when their female partner has PPD.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singley|first=Daniel |s2cid=21726189 | name-list-style = vanc |date=2015|title=Men's Perinatal Mental Health in the Transition to Fatherhood|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bc94f60f5d169855bfea2bce5a17c48ee546e2f6|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=46|issue=5|pages=309–319|doi=10.1037/pro0000032}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==

===Criteria===
Postpartum depression in the DSM-5 is known as "depressive disorder with peripartum onset". Peripartum onset is defined as starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. There is no longer a distinction made between depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy or those that occur after delivery.<ref name="American Psychiatric Association">{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association.|location=Arlington, VA}}</ref> Nevertheless, the majority of experts continue to diagnose postpartum depression as depression with onset anytime within the first year after delivery.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non-childbirth related [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or [[minor depressive disorder|minor depression]]. The criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms, within a two-week period:<ref name="American Psychiatric Association"/>
* Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, nearly every day, for most of the day or the observation of a depressed mood made by others
* Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
* Weight loss or decreased appetite
* Changes in sleep patterns
* Feelings of restlessness
* Loss of energy
* Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
* Loss of concentration or increased indecisiveness
* Recurrent thoughts of death, with or without plans of suicide

===Differential diagnosis===

====Postpartum blues====
{{Main|Postpartum blues}}
Postpartum blues, commonly known as "baby blues," is a transient postpartum mood disorder characterized by milder depressive symptoms than postpartum depression. This type of depression can occur in up to 80% of all mothers following delivery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/understanding-postpartum-depression-basics |title=The Basics of Postpartum Depression |access-date=2015-04-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415013254/http://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/understanding-postpartum-depression-basics |archive-date=2015-04-15 }}</ref> Symptoms typically resolve within two weeks.

====Psychosis====
[[Postpartum psychosis]] is not a formal diagnosis, but is widely used to describe a [[Emergency psychiatry|psychiatric emergency]] that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies, in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts ([[mania]]), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery; the symptoms vary and can change quickly.<ref name="LancetRev2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones I, Chandra PS, Dazzan P, Howard LM | s2cid = 44481055 | title = Bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia in pregnancy and the post-partum period | journal = Lancet | volume = 384 | issue = 9956 | pages = 1789–99 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25455249 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61278-2 }}</ref>  It is different from postpartum depression and from [[maternity blues]].<ref name="RoyColl2014">{{cite web|title=Postpartum Psychosis|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/postpartumpsychosis.aspx|publisher=Royal College of Psychiatrists|access-date=27 October 2016|date=2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024152200/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/postpartumpsychosis.aspx|archive-date=24 October 2016}}</ref>  It may be a form of [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name="WesselooRev2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wesseloo R, Kamperman AM, Munk-Olsen T, Pop VJ, Kushner SA, Bergink V | title = Risk of Postpartum Relapse in Bipolar Disorder and Postpartum Psychosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 173 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–27 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26514657 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15010124 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  It is important not to confuse psychosis with other symptoms that may occur after delivery, such as delirium. Delirium typically includes a loss of awareness or inability to pay attention.<ref name="DSM5" />

About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors; but a prior history of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis, or a family history put some at a higher risk.<ref name=LancetRev2014/>

Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization, where treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medications, [[mood stabilizer]]s, and in cases of strong risk for suicide, [[electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref name=LancetRev2014/>

The most severe symptoms last from 2 to 12 weeks, and recovery takes 6 months to a year.<ref name=LancetRev2014/> Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition immediately after delivery are at a much higher risk of suicide during the first year after delivery.<ref name="OrsoliniRev2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Orsolini L, Valchera A, Vecchiotti R, Tomasetti C, Iasevoli F, Fornaro M, De Berardis D, Perna G, Pompili M, Bellantuono C | display-authors = 6 | title = Suicide during Perinatal Period: Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Clinical Correlates | journal = Frontiers in Psychiatry | volume = 7 | pages = 138 | date = 12 August 2016 | pmid = 27570512 | pmc = 4981602 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00138 }}</ref>

===Medication===
A 2010 review found few studies of medications for treating PPD noting small sample sizes and generally weak evidence.<ref name=":1" /> Some evidence suggests that mothers with PPD will respond similarly to people with [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name=":1" /> There is evidence which suggests that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) are effective treatment for PPD.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal | vauthors = Molyneaux E, Howard LM, McGeown HR, Karia AM, Trevillion K | s2cid = 205165659 | title = Antidepressant treatment for postnatal depression | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD002018 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25211400 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002018.pub2 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ba38cb23b0176612a1e5b9a7266723b301c1f4d3 }}</ref> The first-line anti-depressant medication of choice is sertraline, an SSRI, as very little of the it passes into the [[breast milk]] and, as a result, to the child.<ref name="Ste2019"/> However, a recent study has found that adding [[sertraline]] to psychotherapy does not appear to confer any additional benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonagh MS, Matthews A, Phillipi C, Romm J, Peterson K, Thakurta S, Guise JM | s2cid = 1508392 | title = Depression drug treatment outcomes in pregnancy and the postpartum period: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 124 | issue = 3 | pages = 526–34 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25004304 | doi = 10.1097/aog.0000000000000410 }}</ref> Therefore, it is not completely clear which antidepressants, if any, are most effective for treatment of PPD, and for whom antidepressants would be a better option than non-pharmacotherapy.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

Some studies show that [[hormone therapy]] may be effective in women with PPD, supported by the idea that the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels post-delivery contribute to depressive symptoms.<ref name=":1" /> However, there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of [[Venous thrombosis|blood clots]], which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Postpartum VTE Risk Highest Soon After Birth|first=Norra|last=MacReady | name-list-style = vanc |date=April 7, 2014|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823218|work=[[Medscape]]|access-date=2017-10-31|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206205347/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823218|archive-date=2017-02-06}}</ref> Additionally, none of the existing studies included women who were breastfeeding.<ref name=":1" /> However, there is some evidence that the use of estradiol patches might help with PPD symptoms.<ref name=Fri2019 />

In 2019, the FDA approved [[brexanolone]], a synthetic analog of the [[neurosteroid]] [[allopregnanolone]], for use [[intravenous]]ly in postpartum depression. Allopregnanolone levels drop after giving birth, which may lead to women becoming depressed and anxious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bench-bedside-nimh-research-leads-brexanolone-first-ever-drug-specifically-postpartum-depression|title=Bench-to-bedside: NIMH research leads to brexanolone, first-ever drug specifically for postpartum depression|date=2019-03-20|website=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|language=EN|access-date=2019-08-02}}</ref> Some trials have demonstrated an effect on PPD within 48 hours from the start of infusion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Press Announcements - FDA approves first treatment for post-partum depression |url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm633919.htm |website=www.fda.gov |access-date=23 March 2019 }}</ref> Other new allopregnanolone analogs under evaluation for use in the treatment of PPD include SAGE-2017 and ganaxolone.<ref name=Fri2019 />

People's oxygen levels are to be monitored with a [[Pulse oximetry|pulse oximeter]]. Side effects of the medication include dry mouth, sleepiness, somnolence, flushing and loss of consciousness. It is also important to monitor for early signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors.<ref name=":03" />

=== Breastfeeding ===
Antidepressant medications are generally considered safe to use during breastfeeding.<ref name="NIMH » Postpartum Depression Facts"/> Most antidepressants are excreted in breast milk. However, there are limited studies showing the effects and safety of these antidepressants on breastfed babies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=O'Connor|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Rossom|first2=Rebecca C.|last3=Henninger|first3=Michelle|last4=Groom|first4=Holly C.|last5=Burda|first5=Brittany U.|last6=Henderson|first6=Jillian T.|last7=Bigler|first7=Keshia D.|last8=Whitlock|first8=Evelyn P. | name-list-style = vanc |date=January 2016|title=FDA Antidepressant Drug Labels for Pregnant and Postpartum Women|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0085176/|journal=PubMed Health|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105195610/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0085176/|archive-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> Regarding allopregnanolone, very limited data did not indicate a risk for the infant.<ref>{{cite web |title=FDA Prescribing Information for Brexanolone |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/211371lbl.pdf |access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>

===Other===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has shown efficacy in women with severe PPD that have either failed multiple trials of medication-based treatment or cannot tolerate the available antidepressants.<ref name=":02"/> Tentative evidence supports the use of [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cole J, Bright K, Gagnon L, McGirr A | title = A systematic review of the safety and effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of peripartum depression | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume = 115 | pages = 142–150 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31129438 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2019.05.015 }}</ref>

'''<big>United States</big>'''

Within the United States, the prevalence of postpartum depression was lower than the global approximation at 11.5% but varied between states from as low as 8% to as high as 20.1%.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Ko|first=Jean Y.|date=2017|title=Trends in Postpartum Depressive Symptoms — 27 States, 2004, 2008, and 2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6606a1.htm|journal=MMWR.

While US prevalence decreased from 2004 to 2012, it did not decrease among American Indian/Alaska Native women or those with full term, low-birthweight infants.<ref name=":12" />

Even with the variety of studies, it is difficult to find the exact rate as approximately 60% of US women are not diagnosed and of those diagnosed approximately 50% are not treated for PPD.<ref name=":12" /> Cesarean section rates did not affect the rates of PPD.

'''<big>Issues in Reporting Prevalence</big>'''

Most studies regarding PPD are done using self-report screenings which are less reliable than clinical interviews.  This use of self-report may have results that underreport symptoms and thus postpartum depression rates.<ref name=":05" /><ref name=":12" />

=== Media ===
Certain cases of postpartum mental health concerns received attention in the media and brought about dialogue on ways to address and understand more on postpartum mental health. Andrea Yates, a former nurse, became pregnant for the first time in 1976.<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last=Coodley|first=Lauren|date=2002|title=Commentary on Andrea Yates: Postpartum depression: Voice from a historian|url=|journal=Pediatric Nursing|volume=28|pages=|via=}}</ref> After giving birth to five children in the coming years, she suffered severe depression and had many depressive episodes. This led to her believing that her children needed to be saved, and that by killing them, she could rescue their eternal souls. She drowned her children one by one over the course of an hour, by holding their heads under water in their family bathtub. When called into trial, she felt that she had saved her children rather than harming them and that this action would contribute to defeating Satan.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Kimberly|date=2003|title=TO SAVE HER CHILDREN'S SOULS: THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ANDREA YATES AND POSTPARTUM-RELATED INFANTICIDE|url=|journal=Thomas Jefferson Law Review|volume=25|pages=|via=}}</ref>

This was one of the first public and notable cases of postpartum psychosis,<ref name=":22" /> which helped create dialogue on women's mental health after childbirth. The court found that Yates was experiencing mental illness concerns, and the trial started the conversation of mental illness in cases of murder and whether or not it would lessen the sentence or not. It also started a dialogue on women going against “maternal instinct” after childbirth and what maternal instinct was truly defined by.<ref name=":32" />

Yates' case brought wide media attention to the problem of filicide,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Sara G.|date=February 2007|title=An Overview of Filicide|journal=Psychiatry (Edgmont)|volume=4|issue=2|pages=48–57|issn=1550-5952|pmc=2922347|pmid=20805899}}</ref> or the murder of children by their parents. Throughout history, both men and women have perpetrated this act, but study of maternal filicide is more extensive.
