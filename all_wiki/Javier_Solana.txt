'''Francisco Javier Solana de Madariaga''' ({{IPA-es|fɾanˈθisko xaˈβjeɾ soˈlana ðe maðaˈɾjaɣa|lang}}; born 14 July 1942) is a Spanish [[Physics|physicist]] and Socialist politician. After serving in the Spanish government as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Foreign Affairs Minister]] under [[Felipe González]] (1992–1995) and as the [[Secretary General of NATO]] (1995–1999), he was appointed the [[European Union]]'s [[High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy]], [[Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union|Secretary General of the Council of the European Union]] and [[Secretary-General]] of the [[Western European Union]] and held these posts from October 1999 until December 2009.

==Background and career as a physicist==
Solana was born in [[Madrid]], Spain. He comes from a prominent Spanish family, being a first cousin, twice removed, of diplomat, writer, historian, and pacifist [[Salvador de Madariaga]]<ref>[http://www.luissolana.com/?page_id=2 Biography of Luis Solana (brother of Javier Solana) at his blog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612104540/http://www.luissolana.com/?page_id=2 |date=12 June 2007 }} (in Spanish):{{quote|Heredó de su abuelo materno [Rogelio de Madariaga y Castro] la revista "España Económica", publicación que dio cabida a jóvenes economistas críticos con el régimen de Franco.

Solana studied at the [[Colegio del Pilar (Madrid)|Nuestra Señora del Pilar School]], an exclusive Catholic [[Society of Mary (Marianists)|Marianist]] secondary school, before going to [[Complutense University]] (UCM). There as a student in 1963 he suffered sanctions imposed by the authorities for having organised an opposition forum at the so-called Week of University Renovation. In 1964 he clandestinely joined the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE), which had been illegal under Franco since the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939. In the same year he graduated and then spent a year furthering his studies at [[Spain's Higher Council for Scientific Research]] (CSIC) and in the United Kingdom.

In 1965 he went to the United States, where he spent six years studying at various universities on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/europa/espana/javier_solana_madariaga|title=CIDOB|work=CIDOB|access-date=4 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905204601/http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/europa/espana/javier_solana_madariaga|archive-date=5 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> He visited the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]], and then enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences of the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. There, he taught physics classes as a teaching assistant and carried on independent research; he also joined in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protests]] against the [[Vietnam War]] and was president of the Association of Foreign Students. He received his doctorate in physics from Virginia in 1971 with a thesis on ''Theory of the Elementary Excitation Spectrum of [[Superfluid]] [[Helium]]: the [[Roton]] Lifetime'', extending his planned stay in the US by a year in order to continue his research. Returning to Spain he became a lecturer in [[solid-state physics]] at the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]], UAM, and then in 1975 he became a professor at Complutense University. During these years he published more than 30 articles. For a time he worked as assistant to [[Nicolás Cabrera]], whom he had met when Cabrera was professor at the University of Virginia. The last PhD [[dissertation]]s that he directed were in the early 1990s.

==Spanish politics==
On returning to Spain in 1971 Solana joined the Democratic Co-ordination of Madrid as the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) representative.

In 1976, during PSOE's first national congress inside Spain since the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], he was elected Secretary of the party's Federal Executive Commission, and also Secretary for Information and Press, remaining in the post for five years. He was a close personal friend of the party's leader [[Felipe González]], and is considered one of the PSOE leaders responsible for the transformation of the party in the post-Franco era. In 1976 he represented the PSOE at a [[Socialist International]] congress held in [[Suresnes]], France, and again when it was held in Spain in 1977. On 20 May 1977 he accompanied González in visiting [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] at the Zarzuela Palace.

He became a representative of a teachers' union in the Complutense University, and in this role won a [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|parliamentary]] seat for PSOE on 15 June 1977 and represented [[Madrid (Congress of Deputies constituency)|Madrid region]] until December 1995. On 23 February 1981 he was in the [[Cortes Generales|parliament]] when it was taken over for 18 hours in an attempted [[23-F|coup]] by gunmen led by [[Antonio Tejero]].

On 28 October 1982 PSOE won a historic victory with 202 out of 350 seats in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|lower house]]. On 3 December, along with the other members of González's first cabinet, Solana was sworn in as Minister for Culture, where he remained until moving to the Ministry of Education in 1988. In July 1983 he adhered to the position of [[Alfonso Guerra]] calling for an exit of Spain from [[NATO]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1983/07/20/espana/427500002_850215.html|journal=[[El País]]|title=Los ministros Solana, Maravall, Lluch y Campo coinciden con Guerra en que España no debe permanecer en la OTAN|date=20 July 1983|first=Juan|last=Roldán}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4847684.pdf|page=298|title= España en democracia: Actas del IV Congreso de Historia de Nuestro Tiempo|editor=Carlos Navajas Zubeldía & Diego Iturriaga Barco (Coords.)|year=2014|isbn=978-84-617-1203-8 <!--págs. 293-305-->|chapter=OTAN de entrada No. El PSOE y el uso político de la integración española en el Pacto Atlántico o cómo hacer de la necesidad virtud, 1980-1986|first=Carlos Ángel|last=Ordás}}</ref> On 5 July 1985 he was made the Spokesman for the Government for three years.

He was made Minister for Foreign Affairs on 22 July 1992, the day before the opening of the II [[Organization of Ibero-American States|Ibero-American]] conference of [[head of state|heads of state]] in Madrid, replacing the terminally ill [[Francisco Fernández Ordóñez]]. On 27–28 November 1995, while Spain held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the Council of the EU]], Solana convened and chaired the [[Barcelona Conference]]. A treaty was achieved between the twenty-seven nations in attendance with Solana gaining credit for what he called "a process to foster cultural and economic unity in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]]".

It was during these thirteen years as a cabinet minister that Solana's reputation as a discreet and diplomatic politician grew. By going to the foreign Ministry in the later years of González administration he avoided the political scandals of corruption, and of the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|dirty war]] allegedly being fought against [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], that characterised its last years. Towards the end of 1995, Solana – the only surviving member of González's original cabinet – was talked about in the press as a possible candidate to replace him and lead the PSOE in the following March elections. Instead, he made the leap to international politics.

During and after his spell as NATO secretary general (see below) Solana continued to play an active role in PSOE and Spanish politics. In June 1997, at the 34th PSOE Congress, Solana left their Executive Commission and joined their Federal Committee, being re-elected in second place three years later. By supporting [[Colin Powell]]'s 5 February 2003 speech to the UN Security council which claimed that Iraq had [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD's]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Solana contradicted the position of his party leader [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], who opposed the [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] government of [[José María Aznar]]'s support for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Solana is seen, along with González, as representing the older wing of the party. On 15 February 2005 he criticised the [[Juan José Ibarretxe|Plan Ibarretxe]] for its position on [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] independence, saying that its call for separate Basque representation within the EU had no place within the proposed EU constitution.

==NATO==

On 5 December 1995, Solana became the new [[Secretary General of NATO|Secretary-General]] of [[NATO]], replacing [[Willy Claes]] who had been forced to resign in a corruption scandal. His appointment created controversy as, in the past, he had been an opponent of NATO. He had written a pamphlet called ''50 Reasons to say no to NATO'', and had been on a US subversives list.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO. When PSOE came to power later that year, Solana and the party changed their previous anti-NATO positions into an [[Atlanticism|atlanticist]], pro-NATO stance. On 12 March 1986 Spain held a [[1986 Spanish NATO membership referendum|referendum]] on whether to remain in NATO, with the government and Solana successfully campaigning in favour. When criticised about his anti-NATO past, Solana argued that he was happy to be its representative as it had become disassociated from its [[Cold War]] origins.

Solana immediately had to deal with the [[Balkans]] NATO mission Operation ''Joint Endeavour'' that consisted of a multinational peacekeeping ''[[Implementation Force]]'' (IFOR) of 60,000 soldiers which took over from a United Nations mission on 20 December.
This came about through the [[Dayton Agreement]], after NATO had bombed selected targets in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (positions held by [[Army of Republika Srpska|VRS]]) the previous August and September. He did this by deploying the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] (ARRC). In December 1996 the ARRC was again activated, with IFOR being replaced by a 32,000-strong [[Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Stabilisation Force]] (SFOR) operating under codenames ''Joint Guard'' and later ''Joint Forge''.

During Solana's term, NATO reorganised its political and military structure and changed its basic strategies. He gained the reputation of being a very successful, diplomatic Secretary General who was capable of negotiating between the differing NATO members and between NATO and non-NATO States. In December 1995 France partially returned to the military structure of NATO, while in November 1996 Spain joined it. On 27 May 1997, after 5 months of negotiations with Russian foreign minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]], an agreement was reached resulting in the Paris NATO–Russia Founding Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25468.htm|title=NATO - Official text: Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation signed in Paris, France, 27-May.-1997|publisher=NATO}}</ref> On the same day, Solana presided over the establishment of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] to improve relations between European NATO and non-NATO countries.

Keeping the peace in the former [[Yugoslavia]] continued to be both difficult and controversial. IFOR and SFOR had received a lot of criticism for their inability to capture the [[Bosnian Serb]] leaders [[Radovan Karadžić]] and [[Ratko Mladić]]. In late 1998 the conflict in [[Kosovo]], between the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] authorities and the [[Kosovar Albanian]] guerilla [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] deteriorated, culminating in the [[Račak massacre]] on 15 January 1999, in which 45 [[Albanians]] were killed. NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a proper military peacekeeping force under their auspices, to forcibly restrain the two sides.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} On 30 January 1999, NATO announced that it was prepared to launch air strikes against Yugoslav targets. On 6 February, Solana met both sides for negotiations at the [[Château de Rambouillet]], but they were unsuccessful.

On 24 March, NATO forces launched air attacks on military and civilian targets in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Solana [[Legitimacy of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|justified the attacks]] on humanitarian grounds, and on the responsibility of NATO to keep peace in Europe and to prevent recurrences of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] similar to those which [[Bosnian genocide|occurred]] during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995).

Solana and NATO were criticised for the civilian casualties caused by the bombings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2000/02/nato207.htm|title=New Figures on Civilian Deaths in Kosovo War(Human Rights Watch Press Release, Feb. 7, 2000)|website=www.hrw.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Current+News176.htm|title=Error 404|date=24 February 2012|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224230203/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/Kosovo/Kosovo-Current%20News176.htm|archivedate=24 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
On 23–24 April, the [[North Atlantic Council]] met in Washington D.C. where the [[Heads of State]] of the member nations agreed with the ''New Strategic Concept'', which changed the basic defensive nature of the organisation and allowed for NATO intervention in a greater range of situations than before.

On 10 June, Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo, and NATO stopped its attacks, which ended the [[Kosovo War]]. The same day [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] authorised NATO to activate the [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|ARRC]], with the [[Kosovo Force]] launching Operation ''Joint Guardian'' and occupying the province on 12 June. Solana left NATO on 6 October 1999, two months ahead of schedule, and was replaced by [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]].

==EU foreign policy chief==
After leaving NATO, Solana took up a role in the [[European Union]]. Earlier in the year, on 4 June 1999, he was appointed by the [[List of European Councils#Cologne 1999|Cologne European Council]] as Secretary-General of the [[Council of the European Union]]. An administrative position but it was decided that the Secretary-General would also be appointed [[High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP). In this role he represented the EU abroad where there was an agreed common policy. He took up the post on 18 October 1999, shortly after standing down from NATO. The post has a budget of €40 million, most of which goes to Balkan operations. From 25 November 1999 he was also appointed Secretary-General of [[Western European Union]] (WEU), overseeing the transfer of responsibilities from that organisation to the CFSP. In 2004 his 5-year mandate was renewed. He has also become president of the [[European Defence Agency]].

The [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration claimed in May 2000 that Solana was the fulfilment of [[Henry Kissinger]]'s famous desire to have a phone number to talk to Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In December 2003 Solana released the [[European Security Strategy]], which sets out the main priorities and identifies the main threats to the security of the EU, including terrorism. On 25 March 2004 Solana appointed [[Gijs de Vries]] as the anti-terrorist co-ordinator for the CFSP, and outlined his duties as being to streamline, organise and co-ordinate the EU's fight against terrorism.

On 29 June 2004 he was designated to become the EU's first "Union Minister for Foreign Affairs", a position created by the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitutional Treaty]] combining the head of the [[CFSP]] with that of the [[European Commissioner for External Relations]]. It would give a single voice to foreign policy and combine the powers and influence of the two posts with a larger budget, more staff and a coherent diplomatic corps. The position (colloquially known as "Mr. Europe") has been partly maintained in the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Reform Treaty]] as ''[[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]]'', but Solana is not going to take the post as he announced that he would step down at the end of his term.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120914043812/http://www.rnw.nl/ar/node/10170 EU's Solana to step down<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In late 2004, Solana held secret negotiations with [[Hamas]] leaders, saying that he met them at a time when there seemed to be an opportunity for progress, and were to "pass a clear message of what the international community wants", and said that the meetings occurred "months" before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4040571.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - EU denies secret talks with Hamas|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

===Foreign affairs===
[[File:Javier Solana Colin Powell.jpg|thumb|Solana with [[Colin Powell]] in April 2003]]

He has negotiated numerous Treaties of Association between the European Union and various Middle Eastern and [[Latin American]] countries, including [[Bolivia]] and [[Colombia]]. Solana played a pivotal role in unifying the remainder of the former Yugoslavian federation. He proposed that [[Montenegro]] form a union with [[Serbia]] instead of having full independence, stating that this was done to avoid a [[domino effect]] from [[Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]] independence demands. Local media sarcastically named the new country "Solania".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

On 21 January 2002 Solana said that the detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]] should be treated as prisoners of war under the [[Geneva Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Solana urges POW status for Afghan captives|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/solana-urges-pow-status-for-afghan-captives-1.411034|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref> The EU has stated that it hopes to avoid another war like the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraqi invasion]] through this and future negotiations, and Solana has said the most difficult moments of his job were when the United Kingdom and France, the two permanent EU [[Security Council]] members, were in [[Iraq disarmament crisis|disagreement]].

The so-called [[Vilnius letter]], a declaration of support by eastern European countries for the United States' aim of régime change in Iraq, and [[the letter of the eight]], a similar letter from the UK, Italy, and six second-tier countries, are generally seen {{By whom|date=December 2010}} as a low-water mark of the CFSP.

Solana has played an important role working toward a resolution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and continues to be a primary architect of the "[[Road Map for Peace]]," along with the UN, Russia, and the United States in the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. On 22 July 2004 he met [[Ariel Sharon]] in Israel. Sharon had originally refused to meet Solana, but eventually accepted that, whether he liked it or not, the EU was involved in the Road Map. He criticised Israel for obstructing the [[2005 Palestinian presidential election|Palestinian presidential election]] of 9 January 2005, but then met Sharon again on 13 January.

In November 2004 he assisted the United Kingdom, France and Germany in negotiating a nuclear material enrichment freeze with [[Iran]]. In the same month he was involved in mediating between the two presidential candidates in the [[Post-election developments in Ukraine, 2004|post-election developments]] in Ukraine, and on 21 January 2005 he invited Ukraine's new President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] to discuss future EU membership.<ref name=Waging>Clark, Wesley K. ''Waging Modern War''. New York: Perseus Books Group, 2001–2002, p. 15</ref>

In 2010, after he had left office, he signed a petition along with 25 other EU leaders directed at his successor, [[Catherine Ashton]], calling for EU sanctions on [[Israel]] in response to continued settlement construction in the [[West Bank]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11968304|title=Former EU leaders urge sanctions for Israel settlements|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>
