{{Main|History of Imperial College London}}

=== 19th century ===
The earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the [[Royal College of Chemistry]], founded in 1845, with the support of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]].<ref name=":52"/>  This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the [[Royal School of Mines]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/RoyalSchoolOfMines.aspx|title=Royal School of Mines – Imperial College|website=architecture.com|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915014903/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/RoyalSchoolOfMines.aspx|archive-date=15 September 2012}}</ref> The [[Imperial College School of Medicine|medical school]] has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being [[Charing Cross Hospital Medical School]] which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at [[Westminster Hospital]] in 1834, and [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] in 1851.<ref name="timeline">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/history/college-developments/|title=A timeline of College developments|website=imperial.ac.uk|publisher=Imperial College London|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ballantyne|first=John|date=August 2004|title=St Mary's: the History of a London Teaching Hospital|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=97|issue=8|pages=405–406|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1079568|doi=10.1258/jrsm.97.8.405-a}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/charingcross.html|title=Lost Hospitals of London|website=ezitis.myzen.co.uk|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>

In 1851, the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] was organised as an exhibition of [[culture]] and [[Manufacturing|industry]] by [[Henry Cole]] and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, [[Queen Victoria]].  An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in [[South Kensington]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chr.org.uk/Museums/albertopolis2.htm|title=Albertopolis – the wisdom of Prince Albert|website=chr.org.uk|publisher=Cultural Heritage Resources|access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref> Within the next 6 years the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry and in 1881 for the Royal School of Mines, the opening of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in 1881, and in 1888 the [[Imperial Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp233-247#h2-0003|title=Imperial College|website=british-history.ac.uk|publisher=British History Online|access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref>

In 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]], taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/RoyalCollegeOfScience.aspx|title=Royal College of Science ─ Imperial College|website=architecture.com|publisher=Royal Institute of British Architects|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002170240/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/TheStoryOf/ImperialCollege/RoyalCollegeOfScience.aspx|archive-date=2 October 2012}}</ref> The school was renamed the [[Royal College of Science]] by [[Royal Consent|royal consent]] in 1890.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWwKWnp9vaoC&pg=PA38|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Abbreviations|isbn=9780192800732|language=en|year=1992}}</ref> The Central Institution of the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], was opened as a [[Mechanics' Institutes|technical education]] school on [[Exhibition Road]] by the [[George V|Prince of Wales]] in early 1885.<ref name=":10" />

===20th century===
At the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that [[Great Britain|Britain]] was falling behind [[Germany]] in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]] in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as – if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – their Central Technical College.<ref name="bh">{{cite book|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp233-247|title=Imperial College|date=1975|work=Survey of London: Volume 38, South Kensington Museums Area|publisher=London County Council|editor=F.

On 8 July 1907, [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] granted a [[Royal Charter]] establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the [[University of London]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issue=1959|volume=76|url=https://archive.org/details/paper-doi-10_1038_076056a0|pages=56–57|date=16 May 1907|title=Imperial College of Science and Technology|doi=10.1038/076056a0|bibcode=1907Natur..76...56.|doi-access=free}}</ref> The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910.<ref name=":10" /><ref name="UoLHistRec">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyPiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA85|title=University of London, the Historical Record|date=1912|publisher=University of London Press|page=85}}</ref> The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the [[Imperial Institute]], the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] in July 1909.<ref name="bh" />

As students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-1643261/page/n1|title=The London Imperial College of Science and Technology|pages=209–210|date=28 February 1919|volume=XLIX| issue=1261|bibcode=1919Sci....49..209.|doi=10.1126/science.49.1261.209}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issue=2632|volume=105|url=https://archive.org/details/paper-doi-10_1038_105173a0/page/n1|pages=173–175|date=16 May 1907|title=The Imperial College of Science and Technology|doi=10.1038/105173a0|doi-access=free}}</ref> In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a BSc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/centenary/timeline/1920.shtml#college|title=Imperial College 1920–1929|publisher=Imperial College|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>

In October 1945, [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. "Commemoration Day", named after this visit, is held every October as the university's main graduation ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/centenary/timeline/1940.shtml#college|title=Imperial College 1940–1949|publisher=Imperial College|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/188666/imperial-celebrates-newest-graduates-commemoration-day/|title=Imperial celebrates its newest graduates at Commemoration Day 2018|publisher=Imperial College|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref> The college also acquired a biology field station at [[Silwood Park]] near [[Ascot, Berkshire]] in 1947<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BpqDQAAQBAJ&q=silwood+park+1947&pg=PA760|title=The History of Imperial College London, 1907–2007: Higher Education and Research in Science, Technology, and Medicine|last=Gay|first=Hannah|date=2007|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9781860947087|language=en}}</ref>

Following the second world war, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science – this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a "British [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]"-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including [[Lord Cherwell]], Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]] and Sir [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]].<ref name="bocock">{{cite journal|author=Jean Bocock |author2=Lewis Baston |author3=Peter Scott |author4=David Smith|year=2003|title=American influence on British higher education: science, technology, and the problem of university expansion, 1945–1963|journal=Minerva|volume=41|issue=4|pages=327–346|doi=10.1023/B:MINE.0000005154.25610.b2|jstor=41821255|s2cid=143347639 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCRFBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|title=Making Policy in British Higher Education 1945-2011|author=Michael Shattock|date=1 October 2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=9780335241873}}</ref> The [[University Grants Committee (United Kingdom)|University Grants Committee]] strongly opposed however,<ref name="bocock" /> and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university, but double in size over the next ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1952-06-11/debates/ffbd1622-6f13-4927-9e07-7dec170ee574/HigherTechnologicalEducation(GovernmentPolicy)|title=Higher Technological Education (Government Policy)|date=11 June 1952|work=Hansard|access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/1953-01-29/debates/efdd76ab-4f52-47cc-b094-66f297bb6980/ImperialCollegeOfScienceAndTechnology(Expansion)|title=Imperial College Of Science And Technology (Expansion)|author=John Boyd-Carpenter|date=29 January 1953|work=Hansard|author-link=John Boyd-Carpenter}}</ref> The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected.

=== Accusations of bullying ===
In 2003, it was reported that one third of female academics "believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/18/highereducation.education|title=Female staff 'feel bullied' at Imperial College|access-date=6 December 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 April 2003|last1=Woodward|first1=Will|last2=Editor|first2=Education}}</ref> Imperial has since won the Athena SWAN Award, which recognises employment practices that are supportive of the careers of women in science, technology, engineering and maths.

In 2007, concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/crude-recipe-for-a-chicken-run-sector/209175.article|title=Crude recipe for a 'chicken-run' sector|access-date=6 December 2014|date=31 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Colquhoun | first = David | year = 2007 | title = How to get good science. | journal = Physiology News | volume = 69 | pages = 12–14 | url = http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-goodscience-jp-version-2007.pdf }}</ref> In 2014, [[Stefan Grimm]], of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being threatened with dismissal for failure to raise enough grant money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/imperial-college-london-to-review-procedures-after-death-of-academic/2017188.article |title=Imperial College London to 'review procedures' after death of academic|access-date=6 December 2014|date=27 November 2014}}</ref> His last email before his passing accused his employers of bullying by demanding that he should get grants worth at least £200,000 per year.<ref name="blog">{{cite web|url=http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/01/publish-and-perish-at-imperial-college-london-the-death-of-stefan-grimm|title=Publish ''and'' perish at Imperial College London: the death of Stefan Grimm|access-date=6 December 2014|date=December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/imperial-college-professor-stefan-grimm-was-given-grant-income-target/2017369.article|title=Imperial College professor Stefan Grimm 'was given grant income target'|access-date=6 December 2014|date=3 December 2014}}</ref> The college announced an internal inquiry into Stefan Grimm's death, and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, with new metrics for performance being needed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/stefan-grimm-inquest-new-policies-may-not-have-prevented-suicide/2019563.article|title=Stefan Grimm inquest: new policies may not have prevented suicide|date=9 April 2015|newspaper=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>

The issues of bullying within the staff community resurfaced in November 2020 after a report by Jane McNeill QC found that bullying had taken place under the [[Alice_Gast|President]] and Chief Financial Officer of Imperial College London. Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds North West later asked the State for Education what steps the Office for Students has taken in response to the report<ref>{{cite web|url=https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2020-11-24/120131?fbclid=IwAR2KGL9w-0j6wlhy_isG51w87MfX5J2KiFHXpyfEoEdloJGG-V6nRreiaMI|title=Bullying: Imperial College London. Question for Department for Education |access-date=4 December 2020|date=24 November 2020}}</ref>. The response from Michelle Donelan, the Conservative MP for Chippenham was "The Office for Students (OfS) is considering the information it has received in relation to this matter, in line with their normal processes. As is standard practice, the OfS cannot comment on individual cases.".

Imperial College TV (ICTV) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early [[AMPEX]] [[Type A videotape|Type A 1-inch videotape recorder]] and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block.

===Student housing===
{{main|Imperial College Halls of Residence}}
[[File:Beit12.jpg|thumb|[[Beit Hall]]]]
[[File:Prince's Gardens Halls.png|thumb|220px|Prince's Gardens, surrounded by college halls of residence]]
Imperial College owns and manages twenty-one halls of residence in [[Inner London]], [[Acton, London|Acton]], and [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]]. Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences.

The majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having [[Bathroom|en suite]] facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/current-students/accommodation/public/College-Accommodation-Licence-19-20.pdf|title=College Accommodation Licence (2019–2020)}}</ref> Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities.

Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, as they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial as their firm offer with [[UCAS]]. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a "hall senior", and places are available for a small number of returning students in the Evelyn Garden halls.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/campus-life/accommodation/halls/returning-students-accommodation/ | title=Accommodation for returning students}}</ref> Some students also live in [[International Students House, London]].
