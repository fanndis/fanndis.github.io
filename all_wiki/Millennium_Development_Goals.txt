{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}
The '''Millennium Development Goals''' ('''MDGs''') were eight [[international development]] [[goal]]s for the year 2015 that had been established following the [[Millennium Summit]] of the [[United Nations]] in 2000, following the adoption of the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]]. The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) succeeded the MDGs in 2016.

All 191 [[United Nations member states]], and at least 22 [[international organizations]], committed to help achieve the following Millennium Development Goals by 2015:

# To eradicate [[extreme poverty]] and [[hunger]]
# To achieve [[universal primary education]]
# To promote [[gender equality]] and empower women
# To reduce [[child mortality]]
# To improve [[maternal health]]
# To combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and other diseases
# To ensure environmental sustainability<ref>[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml], United Nations Millennium Development Goals website, retrieved 21 September 2013</ref>
# To develop a global partnership for development<ref>[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml Background page], United Nations Millennium Development Goals website, retrieved 16 June 2009</ref>

[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|The Millennium Development Goals are a UN initiative.]]

Each goal had specific targets, and dates for achieving those targets. The 8 goals were measured by 21 targets. To accelerate progress, the [[G8]] finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55&nbsp;billion in debt owed by members of the [[heavily indebted poor countries]] (HIPC) to allow them to redirect resources to programs for improving health and education and for alleviating poverty.

Interventions evaluated include (1) improvements required to meet the millennium development goals (MDG) for water supply (by halving by 2015 the proportion of those without access to safe drinking water), (2) meet the water MDG plus halving by 2015 the proportion of those without access to adequate sanitation, (3) increasing access to improved water and sanitation for everyone, (4) providing disinfection at point-of-use over and above increasing access to improved water supply and sanitation (5) providing regulated piped water supply in house and sewage connection with partial sewerage for everyone (Hutton, G. Evaluation of the Cost and Benefits of Water and Sanitation Improvements at the Global Level, 2004 WHO-Geneva)

Critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. Although developed countries' aid for achieving the MDGs rose during the challenge period, more than half went for debt relief and much of the remainder going towards [[natural disaster]] relief and military aid, rather than further development.

As of 2013, progress towards the goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. A UN conference in September 2010 reviewed progress to date and adopted a global plan to achieve the eight goals by their target date. New commitments targeted women's and children's health, and new initiatives in the worldwide battle against poverty, hunger and disease.

Among the non-governmental organizations assisting were the United Nations Millennium Campaign, the Millennium Promise Alliance, Inc., the Global Poverty Project, the [[Micah Challenge UK|Micah Challenge]], The Youth in Action EU Programme, "Cartoons in Action" video project and the 8 Visions of Hope global art project.

== Background ==
=== Millennium Summit ===
Preparations for the 2000 [[Millennium Summit]] launched with the report of the Secretary-General entitled, "''We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-First Century''". Additional input was prepared by the Millennium Forum, which brought together representatives of over 1,000 non-governmental and civil society organizations from more than 100 countries. The Forum met in May to conclude a two-year consultation process covering issues such as [[poverty reduction|poverty eradication]], [[environmental protection]], human rights and protection of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]].

MDGs derive from earlier development targets, where world leaders adopted the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]]. The approval of the Millennium Declaration was the main outcome of the Millennium Summit.

The MDGs originated from the United Nations [[Millennium Declaration]]. The Declaration asserted that every individual has dignity; and hence, the right to freedom, equality, a basic standard of living that includes freedom from hunger and violence and encourages tolerance and solidarity. The MDGs set concrete targets and indicators for poverty reduction in order to achieve the rights set forth in the Declaration.<ref>An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency'</ref>

===Precursors===
The [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping|Brahimi Report]] provided the basis of the goals in the area of peace and security.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Millennium Summit Declaration was, however, only part of the origins of the MDGs. More ideas came from Adam Figueroa,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. A series of UN‑led conferences in the 1990s focused on issues such as children, nutrition, human rights and women. The OECD criticized major donors for reducing their levels of [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA). UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] signed a report titled, ''We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century''. The OECD had formed its International Development Goals (IDGs) and the two efforts were combined for the World Bank's 2001 meeting to form the MDGs.<ref>"The Political Economy of the MDGs: Retrospect and Prospect for the World's Biggest Promise"</ref>

===Human capital, infrastructure and human rights===
The MDGs emphasized three areas: [[human capital]], [[infrastructure]] and human rights ([[economic, social and cultural rights|social, economic]] and [[civil and political rights|political]]), with the intent of increasing living standards.<ref>"The Millennium Development Goals Report"</ref> Human capital objectives include nutrition, healthcare (including [[child mortality]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]], and [[reproductive health]]) and education. Infrastructure objectives include access to safe drinking water, energy and modern information/communication technology; increased farm outputs using sustainable practices; transportation; and environment. Human rights objectives include empowering women, reducing violence, increasing political voice, ensuring equal access to public services and increasing security of property rights. The goals were intended to increase an individual's [[capability approach|human capabilities]] and "advance the means to a productive life". The MDGs emphasize that each nation's policies should be tailored to that country's needs; therefore most policy suggestions are general.

===Partnership===
MDGs emphasize the role of developed countries in aiding developing countries, as outlined in Goal Eight, which sets objectives and targets for developed countries to achieve a "global partnership for development" by supporting [[fair trade]], debt relief, increasing aid, access to affordable essential medicines and encouraging technology transfer. Thus developing nations ostensibly became partners with developed nations in the struggle to reduce world poverty.(GOAL 8 TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT)

==Criticism==
===General===
General criticisms include a perceived lack of analytical power and justification behind the chosen objectives.<ref name="idrc.ca">{{cite book | last1 = Deneulin | first1 = Séverine | last2 = Shahani | first2 = Lila | author-link1 = Séverine Deneulin | title = An introduction to the human development and capability approach freedom and agency | publisher = Earthscan International Development Research Centre | location = Sterling, Virginia Ottawa, Ontario | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1844078066 }}</ref>

The MDGs lack strong objectives and indicators for within-country equality, despite significant disparities in many developing nations.<ref name=idrc.ca /><ref name="ReferenceA">Can the MDGs provide a pathway to social justice?: The challenge of intersecting inequalities. 2010. Naila Kabeer for Institute of Development Studies.</ref>

Iterations of proven local successes should be scaled up to address the larger need through human energy and existing resources using methodologies such as [[participatory rural appraisal]], [[asset-based community development]], or [[SEED-SCALE]].<!-- originally developed under [[UNICEF]] and now tested in a number of countries over two decades--><ref>Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ‘'Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change'’ (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012) pp. 25–33.</ref>

MDG&nbsp;8 uniquely focuses on donor achievements, rather than development successes. The ''[[Commitment to Development Index]]'', published annually by the [[Center for Global Development]] in Washington, D.C., is considered the best numerical indicator for MDG&nbsp;8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/hdr03_complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2003 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> It is a more comprehensive measure of donor progress than official development assistance, as it takes into account policies on a number of indicators that affect developing countries such as trade, migration and investment.

The MDGs were attacked for insufficient emphasis on environmental [[sustainability]].<ref name="idrc.ca" /> Thus, they do not capture all elements needed to achieve the ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

Agriculture was not specifically mentioned in the MDGs even though most of the world's poor are farmers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Alleged lack of legitimacy===
The entire MDG process has been accused of lacking [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] as a result of failure to include, often, the voices of the very participants that the MDGs seek to assist. The International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty, in its post 2015 thematic consultation document on MDG 69 states "The major limitation of the MDGs by 2015 was the lack of political will to implement due to the lack of ownership of the MDGs by the most affected constituencies".<ref>{{cite web|title=Position International Planning Committee on Food Sovereignty Informal Thematic Consultation Hunger, Food and Nutrition Post 2015, CSA actors|url=http://www.fao.org/fsnforum/post2015/sites/post2015/files/files/IPC%20declarat%20post2015%2B%2011feb%20(ES%20EN).pdf|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>

===Human rights===
The MDGs may under-emphasize local participation and empowerment (other than women's empowerment).<ref name=idrc.ca /> FIAN International, a human rights organization focusing on the right to adequate food, contributed to the Post 2015 process by pointing out a lack of: "primacy of human rights; qualifying policy coherence; and of human rights based monitoring and [[accountability]]. Without such accountability, no substantial change in national and international policies can be expected."<ref>{{cite web|last=FIAN International|title=Post 2015 Thematic Consultation|url=http://www.fao.org/fsnforum/post2015/comments/2?page=1|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>

===Human capital===
MDG 2 focuses on primary education and emphasizes enrollment and completion. In some countries, primary enrollment increased at the expense of achievement levels. In some cases, the emphasis on primary education has negatively affected secondary and post-secondary education.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Waage |first=Jeff|title=The Millennium Development Goals: a cross-sectoral analysis and principles for goal setting after 2015 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61196-8/fulltext |date=18 September 2010 |journal=The Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9745 |pages=991–1023 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61196-8|display-authors=etal |pmid=20833426|pmc=7159303 }}{{registration required}}</ref>

A publication from 2005 argued that goals related to [[maternal mortality]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] are impossible to measure and that current UN estimates lack scientific validity or are missing.<ref name="Amir Attaran 2005">{{cite journal|first=Amir |last=Attaran |authorlink=Amir Attaran |date=October 2005 |title=An Immeasurable Crisis? A Criticism of the Millennium Development Goals and Why They Cannot Be Measured |journal=[[PLOS Medicine]] | volume=2 | issue=10 | page=318 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020318|pmid=16156696 |pmc=1201695 }}</ref> Household surveys are the primary measure for the health MDGs but may be poor and duplicative measurements that consume limited resources. Furthermore, countries with the highest levels of these conditions typically have the least reliable data collection. The study also argued that without accurate measures, it is impossible to determine the amount of progress, leaving MDGs as little more than a rhetorical call to arms.<ref name="Amir Attaran 2005"/>

MDG proponents such as McArthur and Sachs countered that setting goals is still valid despite measurement difficulties, as they provide a political and operational framework to efforts. With an increase in the quantity and quality of healthcare systems in developing countries, more data could be collected.<ref name="McArthur JW 2005">{{Cite journal | last1 = McArthur | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = J.

The attention to well being other than income helps bring funding to achieving MDGs.<ref name=idrc.ca /> Further MDGs prioritize interventions, establish obtainable objectives with useful measurements of progress despite measurement issues and increased the developed world's involvement in worldwide poverty reduction.<ref name=haines>Andy Haines and Andrew Cassels. 2004. "Can The Millennium Development Goals Be Attained?" ''BMJ: British Medical Journal'', Vol. 329, No. 7462 (14 August 2004), pp. 394–397</ref> MDGs include gender and reproductive rights, environmental sustainability, and spread of technology. Prioritizing interventions helps developing countries with limited resources make decisions about allocating their resources. MDGs also strengthen the commitment of developed countries and encourage aid and information sharing.<ref name=idrc.ca /> The global commitment to the goals likely increases the likelihood of their success. They note that MDGs are the most broadly supported poverty reduction targets in world history.<ref name="undp.org">United Nations. 2006. "The Millennium Development Goals Report: 2006." United Nations Development Programme, www.undp.org/publications/MDGReport2006.pdf (accessed 2 January 2008).</ref>

Achieving the MDGs does not depend on economic growth alone. In the case of MDG&nbsp;4, developing countries such as [[Bangladesh]] have shown that it is possible to reduce child mortality with only modest growth with inexpensive yet effective interventions, such as [[measles]] immunization.<ref>[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/blogs/2010/08/addressing-the-inequalities-in-child-survival/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902084512/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/blogs/2010/08/addressing-the-inequalities-in-child-survival/ |date=2 September 2010 }}</ref> Still, government expenditure in many countries is not enough to meet the agreed spending targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/docs/6325.pdf/ |title=The Feasibility of Financing Sectoral Development Targets |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Research on health systems suggests that a "one size fits all" model will not sufficiently respond to the individual healthcare profiles of developing countries; however, the study found a common set of constraints in scaling up international health, including the lack of absorptive capacity, weak health systems, human resource limitations, and high costs. The study argued that the emphasis on coverage obscures the measures required for expanding health care. These measures include political, organizational, and functional dimensions of scaling up, and the need to nurture local organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Subramanian |first=Savitha |author2=Joseph Naimoli |author3=Toru Matsubayashi |author4=David Peters |title=Do We Have the Right Models for Scaling Up Health Services to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals?|journal=BMC Health Services Research |year=2011|volume=11|issue=336|pages=336 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-11-336|pmid=22168915 |url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/do-we-have-the-right-models-for-scaling-up-health-services-t.html|pmc=3260120}}</ref>

Fundamental issues such as gender, the divide between the humanitarian and development agendas and economic growth will determine whether or not the MDGs are achieved, according to researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).<ref>{{cite web|title=Gender and the MDGs|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results/ |work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MDGs and the humanitarian-development divide |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1937&title=mdgs-humanitarian-development-divide|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Economic Growth and the MDGs|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4892&title=millennium-development-goals-equitable-growth-policy-brief|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>

The [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+) aimed to accelerate MDG progress by applying international principles for effective aid and development in the health sector. In developing countries, significant funding for health came from external sources requiring governments to coordinate with international development partners. As partner numbers increased variations in funding streams and bureaucratic demands followed. By encouraging support for a single national health strategy, a single monitoring and evaluation framework, and mutual accountability, IHP+ attempted to build confidence between government, civil society, development partners and other health stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=IHP+ The International Health Partnership|publisher=Internationalhealthpartnership.net |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>

===Equity===
Further developments in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] into the role of [[equity (economics)|equity]].<ref name=ODI2>Vandemoortele, Milo (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4895&title=mdgs-equity "The MDGs and Equity"], Overseas Development Institute.</ref> Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|virtuous circle]] where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability.<ref name=ODI2/> Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as [[equity (legal concept)|political]]. Examples abound, including Brazil's [[cash transfers]], [[Uganda]]'s eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else [[Mauritius]]'s dual-track approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road into the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref name=ODI2/> Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute|ODI]] thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG review meeting.<ref name=ODI2/>

===Women's issues===
[[File:Geena Davis at the podium (9922450166).jpg|thumb|The Hollywood actress [[Geena Davis]] in a speech at the MDG Countdown event at the [[Ford Foundation]] in New York, addressing gender roles and issues in film such as her organisation's work in combating [[inequality in Hollywood]] (24 September 2013)]]
Increased focus on gender issues could accelerate MDG progress, e.g. empowering women through access to paid work could help reduce child mortality.<ref name="Kabeer, Naila 2003">Kabeer, Naila. 2003. ''Gender Mainstreaming in Poverty Eradication and the Millennium Development Goals: A Handbook for Policy-Makers and Other Stakeholders''. Commonwealth Secretariat.</ref> In [[South Asia]]n countries babies often suffered from [[low birth weight]] and high mortality due to limited access to healthcare and maternal [[malnutrition]]. Paid work could increase women's access to health care and better nutrition, reducing child mortality. Increasing female education and workforce participation increased these effects. Improved economic opportunities for women also decreased participation in the sex market, which decreased the spread of AIDS, MDG&nbsp;6A.<ref name="Kabeer, Naila 2003"/>
Another way in which women can be empowered is through access to paid work. Kabeer states that this access increases women's agency in their households, it does so in the economic and political spheres as well. A study of women in rural Mexico found that those of them engaged in industrial work were able to negotiate and obtain a greater degree of respect in their households. Additionally, another study from Tanzania found that increased access to paid work led to a long-term reduction in domestic violence.  Lastly, Women's employment and access to financial resources increased their political participation. Data from Bangladesh indicates that longer membership in microfinance organizations have many positive effects including higher levels of political participation and improved access to government programs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kabeer|first1=Naila|title=Gender equality and women's empowerment: a critical analysis of the third millennium development goal|journal=Gender and Development|date=2005|volume=13|issue=Gender and Development|pages=13–24|doi=10.1080/13552070512331332273|s2cid=53667254}}</ref>

Although the resources, technology and knowledge exist to decrease poverty through improving gender equality, the political will is often missing.<ref name="Grown, Caren 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Grown | first1 = Caren | year = 2005 | title = Answering the Skeptics: Achieving Gender Equality and the Millennium Development Goals | journal = Development | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 82–86 | doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100170| s2cid = 83769004 }}</ref> If donor and developing countries focused on seven "priority areas", great progress could be made towards the MDG. These seven priority areas include: increasing girls' completion of secondary school, guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health rights, improving infrastructure to ease women's and girl's time burdens, guaranteeing women's property rights, reducing gender inequalities in employment, increasing seats held by [[women in government]], and combating violence against women.<ref name="Grown, Caren 2005"/>

It is thought{{By whom|date=December 2016}} that the current MDGs targets do not place enough emphasis on tracking gender inequalities in poverty reduction and employment as there are only gender goals relating to health, education, and political representation.<ref name="Kabeer, Naila 2003"/><ref>Noeleen Heyzer. 2005.

==Progress==
[[File:Extreme poverty 1981-2008.svg|thumb|Graph of global population living on under 1, 1.25 and 2 equivalent of 2005 US dollars a day (red) and as a proportion of world population (blue) from 1981 to 2008 based on data from The World Bank]]

Progress towards reaching the goals has been uneven across countries. [[Brazil]] achieved many of the goals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/country_progress.cfm?c=BRA&cd= |title=Brazil: Quick Facts |publisher=MDG Monitor |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> while others, such as [[Benin]], are not on track to realize any.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/country_progress.cfm?c=BEN&cd= |title=Benin: Quick Facts |publisher=MDG Monitor |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> The major successful countries include China (whose [[Poverty in China|poverty population]] declined from 452 million to 278 million) and India.<ref name="econ.lse.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/rburgess/wp/jep11.pdf |title=Halving Global Poverty |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> The [[World Bank]] estimated that MDG&nbsp;1A (halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day) was achieved in 2008 mainly due to the results from these two countries and East Asia.<ref>Chen, Shaohua and [[Martin Ravallion]], (29 February 2012) "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPOVCALNET/Resources/Global_Poverty_Update_2012_02-29-12.pdf An Update to the World Bank’s Estimates of Consumption Poverty in the Developing World]" Development Research Group, World Bank, Retrieved 14 August 2012.</ref>

In the early 1990s [[Nepal]] was one of the world's poorest countries and remains South Asia's poorest country. Doubling health spending and concentrating on its poorest areas halved maternal mortality between 1998 and 2006. Its [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] has seen the largest decreases of any tracked country. [[Bangladesh]] has made some of the greatest improvements in infant and maternal mortality ever seen, despite modest income growth.<ref name=econ2013>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21586601-eradicating-extreme-poverty-no-longer-pipe-dream-first-governments-must-agree |title=Poverty: Growth or safety net? |work=The Economist|date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

Between 1990 and 2010 the population living on less than $1.25 a day in developing countries halved to 21%, or 1.2 billion people, achieving MDG1A before the target date, although the biggest decline was in China, which took no notice of the goal. However, the child mortality and maternal mortality are down by less than half. Sanitation and education targets will also be missed.<ref name=econ2013/>

===Multilateral debt reduction===
[[G8|G‑8]] Finance Ministers met in [[London]] in June 2005 in preparation for the [[31st G8 summit|Gleneagles Summit]] in July and agreed to provide enough funds to the World Bank, IMF and the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) to cancel the remaining HIPC multilateral debt ($40 to $55&nbsp;billion). Recipients would theoretically re-channel debt payments to health and education.<ref name=Carrasco>E.&nbsp;Carrasco, C.&nbsp;McClellan, & J.&nbsp;Ro (2007) [http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-I.shtml "Foreign Debt:  Forgiveness and Repudiation"] University of Iowa Center for International Finance and Development E-Book {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731123358/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-I.shtml |date=31 July 2008 }}</ref>

The Gleaneagles plan became the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Countries became eligible once their lending agency confirmed that the countries had continued to maintain the reforms they had implemented.<ref name=Carrasco />

While the World Bank and AfDB limited MDRI to countries that complete the HIPC program, the IMF's eligibility criteria were slightly less restrictive so as to comply with the IMF's unique "uniform treatment" requirement. Instead of limiting eligibility to HIPC countries, any country with [[per capita income]] of $380 or less qualified for debt cancellation. The IMF adopted the $380 threshold because it closely approximated the HIPC threshold.<ref name=Carrasco />

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
{{see also|The Earth Institute}}
One success was to strengthen rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa. By the mid‑1990s, rice imports reached nearly $1&nbsp;billion annually. Farmers had not found suitable rice varieties that produce high yields. [[New Rice for Africa]] (NERICA), a high-yielding and well adapted strain, was developed and introduced in areas including Congo Brazzaville, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Togo and Uganda. Some 18 varieties of this strain became available, enabling African farmers to produce enough rice to feed their families and have extra to sell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/story.cfm?goal=1 |title=Goal :: Tracking the Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Mdg Monitor |date=1 November 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130105523/http://www.mdgmonitor.org/story.cfm?goal=1 |archive-date=30 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The region also showed progress towards MDG&nbsp;2. School fees that included Parent-Teacher Association and community contributions, textbook fees, compulsory uniforms and other charges took up nearly a quarter of a poor family's income and led countries including [[Burundi]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]] to eliminate such fees, increasing enrollment. For instance, in Ghana, public school enrollment in the most deprived districts rose from 4.2&nbsp;million to 5.4&nbsp;million between 2004 and 2005. In Kenya, primary school enrollment added 1.2&nbsp;million in 2003 and by 2004, the number had climbed to 7.2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/story.cfm?goal=2 |title=Goal: Tracking the Millennium Development Goals|publisher=MDG Monitor |date=1 November 2007|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>

Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in 2000, [[Jeffrey Sachs]] of [[The Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]] was among the leading academic scholars and practitioners on the MDGs. He chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–01), which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5, and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] in 2000–2001 to design and launch [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].<ref name="Mountains Beyond Mountains">{{cite book|last1=Kidder|first1=Tracy|title=Mountains Beyond Mountains|url=https://archive.org/details/mountainsbeyond000kidd|url-access=registration|date=2003|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/mountainsbeyond000kidd/page/257 257]}}</ref> He also worked with senior officials of the [[George W. Bush administration]] to develop the PEPFAR program to fight [[HIV/AIDS]], and the PMI to fight [[malaria]]. On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the [[UN Millennium Project]], which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005. The recommendations for rural Africa are currently being implemented and documented in the Millennium Villages, and in several national scale-up efforts such as in Nigeria.

The [[Millennium Villages Project]], which Sachs directs, operates in more than a dozen African countries and covers more than 500,000 people. The MVP has engendered considerable controversy associated as critics have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success.  In 2012 ''[[The Economist]]'' reviewed the project and concluded "the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact."<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2012/05/jeffrey-sachs-and-millennium-villages?zid=295&ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0|title=Jeffrey Sachs and the millennium villages: Millennium bugs|journal=The Economist|accessdate=10 September 2015|date=14 May 2012}}</ref> Critics have pointed to the failure to include suitable controls that would allow an accurate determination of whether the Projects methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 ''Lancet'' paper claiming a 3-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology, and the authors later admitted that the claim was "unwarranted and misleading".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/24/does-it-take-a-village|title=Does It Take a Village?|date=24 June 2013}}</ref>

Although developed countries' financial aid rose during the Millennium Challenge, more than half went towards debt relief. Much of the remainder aid money went towards disaster relief and military aid. According to the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (2006), the 50 least developed countries received about one third of all aid that flows from developed countries.<ref name=singer />

=== Funding commitment ===
Over the past 35 years, UN members have repeatedly "commit[ted] 0.7% of rich-countries' [[Measures of national income and output|gross national income]] (GNI) to [[Official development assistance|Official Development Assistance]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm |title=Press Archive |publisher=UN Millennium Project |accessdate=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218162526/http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm |archivedate=18 February 2015  }}</ref> The commitment was first made in 1970 by the [[UN General Assembly]].

The text of the commitment was:
{{quote|Each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0.7 percent of its gross national product at market prices by the middle of the decade.<ref name="unmillenniumproject.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/costs_benefits2.htm |title=Publications |publisher=UN Millennium Project |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>}}

====European Union====
In 2005 the [[European Union]] reaffirmed its commitment to the 0.7% aid targets, noting that "four out of the five countries, which exceed the UN target for ODA of 0.7%, of GNI are member states of the European Union".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/EUExternalRelations24May.pdf |title=External Relations Council, Brussels 24 May 2005 |publisher=Unmillenniumproject.org |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> Further, the UN "believe[s] that donors should commit to reaching the long-standing target of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2015".<ref name="unmillenniumproject.org"/>

===United States===
However, the United States as well as other nations disputed the [[Monterrey Consensus]] that urged "developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) as ODA to developing countries".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/07_aconf198-11.pdf |title=United Nations Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov/fact_sheet/ecosoc_Chapter_4_apr15.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508175513/http://www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov/fact_sheet/ecosoc_Chapter_4_apr15.pdf |date=8 May 2009 }}</ref>

The US consistently opposed setting specific foreign-aid targets since the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] first endorsed the 0.7% goal in 1970.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf2005092_5264_db039.htm |title=Bush Balks at Pact to Fight Poverty |date=2 September 2005 |work=BusinessWeek online}}</ref>

====OECD====
Many [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) nations, did not donate 0.7% of their GNI. Some nations' contributions fell far short of 0.7%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/endorse_TI_19Jan05.pdf |title=Poverty Can Be Halved If Efforts Are Coupled with Better Governance, says TI |publisher=UN Millennium Project |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>

===Review Summit 2010===
A major conference was held at [[UN headquarters]] in New York on 20–22 September 2010 to review progress.  The conference concluded with the adoption of a global action plan to accelerate progress towards the eight anti-poverty goals.  Major new commitments on women's and children's health, poverty, hunger and disease ensued.

===MDG3===
According to MDG Monitor, the target under MDG 3 "To eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005, and in all levels of education by 2015" was met.<ref name="Monitor">{{Cite web|quote=Gender disparity has reduced dramatically at all levels of education in the developing regions since 2000, hitting the MDG target.|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/mdg-3-promote-gender-equality-and-empower-women/|title=MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>

However MDG monitor points out that while parity has been achieved across the developing world, there are regional and national differences favouring girls in some cases and boys in others.  In secondary education in "Western Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa, girls are still at a disadvantage, while the opposite is true in Latin America and the Caribbean – boys are at a disadvantage."  Similarly in tertiary education there are disparities "at the expense of men in Northern Africa, Eastern Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean" while conversely they are "at the expense of women in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa."<ref name="Monitor" />

Moreover, some 36,000 Cuban physicians worked in 72 countries, from Europe to Southeast Asia, including 31 African countries, and 29 countries in the Americas.

==Post 2015 development agenda==
Although there have been major advancements and improvements achieving some of the MDGs even before the deadline of 2015, the progress has been uneven between the countries. In 2012 the UN Secretary-General established the "UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda", bringing together more than 60 UN agencies and international organizations to focus and work on sustainable development.<ref name="ECOSOC MDGs Post Agenda">{{cite web|title=Millennium Development Goals and post-2015 Development Agenda|url=https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/mdg.shtml|website=The United Nations|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>

At the MDG Summit, UN Member States discussed the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] and initiated a process of consultations. Civil society organizations also engaged in the post-2015 process, along with academia and other research institutions, including think tanks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/beyond2015.shtml |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) have been proposed as targets relating to future international development once the MDGs expire at the end of 2015.

On 31 July 2012, Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] appointed 26 public and private leaders to advise him on the post-MDG agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/Press%20release_post-2015panel.pdf |title=UN Secretary-General Appoints High-Level Panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>

In 2014, the UN's [[Commission on the Status of Women]] agreed on a document that called for the acceleration of progress towards achieving the millennium development goals, and confirmed the need for a stand-alone goal on gender equality and women's empowerment in post-2015 goals, and for gender equality to underpin all of the post-2015 goals.<ref>Ford, Liz (23 March 2014).  [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/23/campaigners-welcome-agreement-un-gender-csw-talks "Campaigners Welcome 'Milestone' Agreement at UN Gender Equality Talks."]  ''[[The Guardian]]''.  Retrieved from TheGuardian.com, 8 February 2019.</ref>

The UN's Commission on the Status of Women electing to have created a goal dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women further demonstrated how the United Nations's Millennium Development Goals did not make much progress on gender equality. The goal of achieving gender equity is still a prominent issue and factor to in global development due to its ties to the rest of the SDGs.

===UN Goals===
UN Goals is a global project dedicated to spreading knowledge of MDG through various internet and offline awareness campaigns.

===Libraries and the Millennium Development Goals===
Librarians and others in the information professions are in a unique position to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It is often the dissemination of key information, e.g., about health, that changes daily life and can affect an entire community.

Millennium Development Goals are not only for the developing world. Maret (2011) specifically addresses how U.S. public libraries can help the United States meet the goals.<ref>Maret, S. (2011). True community: connecting the Millennium Development Goals to public library services in the United States. Information, Society and Justice, 4(2), 29–55.</ref> The work of U.S. librarians has evolved in a manner that incorporates human rights values and precepts without having generally used the language that characterizes the philosophical and ethical goals of human rights and human development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/olos/olosprograms/jeanecoleman/index3|title=Librarians and Human Rights {{!}} Offices of the American Library Association|website=www.ala.org|date=21 January 2011}}</ref> Librarians are able to further the Millennium Development Goals and contribute by providing information and services to all people in varying formats and languages.

Albright and Kwooya (2007) report that cultural and financial barriers in Sub-Saharan Africa impede LIS education programs. As a result, MDG goals for poverty, healthcare, and education fall short. High rates of HIV/AIDS, and escalating child and maternal mortality are the direct result of poverty and substandard medical care. Limited instruction in information access and exchange contributes to this ongoing dilemma.<ref>Albright, K., & Kawooya, D. (2007). Libraries in the time of AIDS: African perspectives and recommendations for a revised model of LIS education. International Information And Library Review, 39 (Library and Information Science Education in Developing Countries), 109–120.</ref>
