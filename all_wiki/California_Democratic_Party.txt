The '''California Democratic Party''' is the state branch of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|United States Democratic Party]] in the state of [[California]]. The party is headquartered in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

With 43.5% of the state's registered voters as of 2018, the Democratic Party has the highest number of registrants of any political party in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/15day-gen-2018/county.pdf|title=California Secretary of State Report of Registration as of October 22, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> Democrats also enjoy [[supermajority|supermajorities]] in both houses of the [[California State Legislature]], holding 61 out of 80 seats in the [[California State Assembly]] and 29 out of 40 in the [[California State Senate]]. Democrats hold all eight statewide executive branch offices, 45 of the state's 53 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and both of California's seats in the [[United States Senate]].

==History==
=== 1850s ===
Since the beginning of the 1850s, issues regarding [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] had effectively split the [[California]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. By the 1853 general election campaign, large majorities of pro-slavery Democrats from Southern California, calling themselves the Chivalry (later branded as [[Lecompton Constitution|Lecompton]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]), threatened to divide the state in half, should the state not accept slavery. [[John Bigler]], along with former state senator and lieutenant governor [[David C. Broderick]] from the previous [[John McDougall (California politician)|McDougall Administration]], formed the Free Soil Democratic faction, modeled after the federal [[Free Soil Party]] that argued against the spread of slavery.

The Democrats effectively split into two camps, with both the Chivalry and Free Soilers nominating their own candidates for the 1853 election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ca.gov/SITN/2003/0335.htm |title=Studies in the News |publisher=California State Library |author=California Research Bureau |date=June 1853 |accessdate=2007-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629055055/http://www.library.ca.gov/SITN/2003/0335.htm |archivedate=2007-06-29 }}</ref>  By 1857, the party had split into the [[Lecompton Constitution|Lecompton]] and Anti-Lecompton factions. Lecompton members supported the [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] [[Lecompton Constitution]], a document explicitly allowing slavery into the territory, while Anti-Lecompton faction members were in opposition to slavery's expansion. The violence between supporting and opposition forces led to the period known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Splits in the Democratic Party, as well as the [[power vacuum]] created by the collapse of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], helped facilitate the rise of the [[Know-Nothings|American Party]] both in state and federal politics. In particular, state voters voted Know-Nothings into the [[California State Legislature]], and elected [[J. Neely Johnson]] as governor in the 1855 general elections.

During the 1859 general elections, Lecompton Democrats voted for [[Milton Latham]], who had briefly lived in the [[American South]], as their nominee for [[Governor of California|governor]]. Anti-Lecomptons in turn selected [[John Currey]] as their nominee. The infant [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], running in its first gubernatorial election, selected businessman [[Leland Stanford]] as its nominee. To make matters more complicated, during the campaign, Senator [[David C. Broderick]], an Anti-Lecompton Democrat, was killed in a [[duel]] by slavery supporter and former [[Supreme Court of California|state Supreme Court Justice]] [[David S. Terry|David Terry]] on September 13.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joincalifornia.com/election/1859-09-07 |title=Election History for the state of California |publisher=JoinCalifornia |date=7 September 1859 |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>

=== Late 19th and early 20th centuries ===
[[File:Governor Budd.jpg|left|210px|thumb|Governor [[James Budd]] in his office.]]
Until the early 1880s the Republican Party held the state through the power and influence of railroad men. The Democratic Party responded by taking an anti-corporate, anti freedom of attainment position. In 1894, Democrat [[James Budd]] was elected to the governorship, and the Democratic Party attempted to make good on their promises to reform the booming railroad industry. The party began working closely with the state's railroad commission to create fair rates for passengers and to eliminate monopolies the railroad companies held over the state. The main effort focused on making railroads public avenues of transportation similar to streets and roads. This measure passed and was a great victory for the Democrats, but the honeymoon would not last.<ref name="Williams Hal 1973">Williams Hal, "The Democratic Party and California Politics 1880 - 1896" (Stanford University Press, California, 1973)</ref>   Budd was to be the last Democratic governor for thirty years. The struggle between the anti-monopolists and the railroad companies was, however, a key and defining issue for the Democratic Party for some time.

Despite their relative lack of power during this period, the Democrats in California were still active in pursuing reform. The party supported fairer railroad policies and crusaded for [[tariff]] reform.<ref name="Williams Hal 1973"/>  The party also supported the large scale railroad strikes that sprung up statewide. The corruption of the time in both the railroad companies and the government led to a change in political dynamic. The people of the state moved away from both of the main parties and the [[Progressive Movement]] began.
	
While the Progressives were successful in creating positive reform and chasing out corruption, the movement drained away many of the Democratic Party's members. As their movement ended, the Republicans won the governorship, but the Democratic Party had a distinct voter advantage.  
	
In 1932, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was elected president and the Power balance between the Republicans and the Democrats in California equalized. However, as Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] policies began to raise the nation out of the depression, Democratic strength mounted. [[Culbert Olson]] was elected to the governorship, but his term was rocky and both parties organized against him. Shortly thereafter, [[Earl Warren]] and the Republicans seized power again.<ref>http://www.kintera.org/site/pp.asp?c=fvLRK7O3E&b=33602</ref>  
	
The California Democratic Party needed a new strategy to regain power in the state. A strategy of reorganization and popular mobilization emerged and resulted in the creation of the [[California Democratic Council]]. The CDC as it became known was a way for members of the party from all levels of government to come together and as such the party became more unified. A new network of politically minded civilians and elected officials emerged and the party was stronger for it.<ref>Bell Jonathan, "Social Democracy and the Rise of the Democratic Party in California 1950 - 1964" (The Historical Journal)</ref> Despite the fact that the council struggled in the [[cold war]] era, due to Republican strength and issues such as the [[Vietnam War]], it still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc-ca.org/|title=California Democratic Council - California Democratic Council|author=|date=|website=www.cdc-ca.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>

===1990s===
By 1992, California was hurting more than most states from a national recession which had started in 1990, causing incumbent Republican president George H.W. Bush's approval rating to tank within the state, giving an opening for the Democratic party to break through and eventually become the largest party. Starting with the double digit victory of Bill Clinton, this became the first time a Democrat had carried the state of California since 1964. Afterwards, a consolidation of the Latino and Asian vote would strengthen the Democratic party's hold in California, when these groups had previously been considered core Republican supporters within the state.

The California Democratic Party began re-organizing in 1991, and in 1992 the party won the greatest victories in the history of California. President Clinton won California's 54 electoral votes and two women, [[Dianne Feinstein]] and [[Barbara Boxer]], were elected as U.S. senators.

Even though redistricting (reapportionment) was executed by a Republican State Supreme Court, California Democrats in November 1992 had increased their margin at all levels—Congressional, state assembly and in the state senate.

In 1994, California Democrats suffered a setback by losing the governor's race for the fourth time in a row, and the Democrats became a minority in the State Assembly. However, despite $29 million spent by Republican U.S. Senate candidate [[Michael Huffington]], Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein won re-election.

The 1996 elections proved to be a dramatic turnaround from the results of 1994, as President [[Bill Clinton]] won California's 54 electoral votes for a second consecutive time. Three Republican Congressman were also defeated, including [[Bob Dornan]] in the conservative stronghold of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. In addition, California Democrats also regained the majority in the State Assembly while adding to their majority in the state senate.

[[File:Gray Davis Bio.gif|thumb|Davis's official biography profile as governor]]
1998 was a banner year for California Democrats. An overwhelming majority of Californians elected [[Gray Davis]], the first Democratic governor in 16 years and re-elected U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. Six of eight candidates for statewide constitutional offices won including Lieutenant Governor [[Cruz Bustamante]], Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]], Treasurer Phil Angelides, Controller [[Kathleen Connell]] and State Superintendent of Public Instruction [[Delaine Eastin]]. In addition, California Democrats increased their majority in the State Assembly from 43 to 48 and also in the state senate from 23 to 25.

===21st century===
Holding off a national Republican trend in 2002, California Democrats won all eight statewide offices for the first time since 1882. Governor Gray Davis, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, Attorney General Bill Lockyer and State Treasurer Phil Angelides were all re-elected while Steve Westly was elected State Controller, Kevin Shelley was elected Secretary of State, [[John Garamendi]] was elected Insurance Commissioner and [[Jack O'Connell (American politician)|Jack O'Connell]] was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

This feat (winning all statewide offices) was repeated in [[California state elections, November 2010|2010]], when, despite massive Republican gains nationwide, the California Democratic Party swept all the statewide offices being contested, maintained its 34–19 edge in the 53-member U.S. House delegation and won one additional seat (thus increasing their majority) in the State Assembly while maintaining their current majority in the state senate.

In the [[California state elections, November 2012|2012]] election, California Democrats experienced tremendous success once again: not only did President [[Barack Obama]] win California's 55 electoral votes again with over 60% of the vote and Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] reelected with over 62% of the vote, but California Democrats – despite running in federal and legislative districts that were redrawn by an [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission|independent redistricting commission]] for the first time, per the passage of Propositions [[California Proposition 11 (2008)|11]] and [[California Proposition 20 (2010)|20]], and the implementation of a new [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|blanket primary]] – also won a net gain of four House seats by defeating three GOP incumbents and winning an open GOP seat and won a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature, a feat which the party last accomplished in 1882.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/us/politics/democrats-likely-to-win-supermajority-in-california-legislature.html|title=Democrats Likely to Win Supermajority in California Legislature|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|date=9 November 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Geographically, the 2012 elections also witnessed the California Democratic Party make inroads in traditionally Republican areas: [[San Diego]], the second largest city in California and a longtime GOP stronghold, [[2012 San Diego mayoral election|elected]] a Democratic mayor for the first time since 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiego6.com/news/elections/Carl-DeMaio-Concedes-to-Congressman-Bob-Filner--177677291.html?m=y|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202064557/http://www.sandiego6.com/news/elections/Carl-DeMaio-Concedes-to-Congressman-Bob-Filner--177677291.html?m=y|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 February 2013|title=Home|author=|date=|website=sandiego6.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> California Democrats also notched up victories in other traditionally Republican areas such as the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]], [[Ventura County]], the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and [[Orange County, CA|Orange County]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/23/5005280/dan-walters-californias-gop-fishhook.html#mi_rss=Top%20Stories |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127225122/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/23/5005280/dan-walters-californias-gop-fishhook.html#mi_rss=Top%20Stories |archive-date=2012-11-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Organization==
The Democratic State Central Committee of the California Democratic Party of California is organized into nine standing committees: Platform, Resolutions, Rules, Legislation, Affirmative Action, Credentials, Finance, Organizational Development, and Voter Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cadem.org/our-party/standing-committees|title=Standing Committees|website=California Democratic Party}}</ref>

===Platform===
The California Democratic Party of California adopted its current platform on 25 February 2018.<ref>
{{cite web
|url=https://www.cadem.org/our-party/standing-committees/platform-committee
|title=Platform Committee
|publisher=California Democratic Party
|access-date=21 April 2019
}}
</ref> This platform covers a wide range of topics and issues under the following headings:
*Preamble
*Business and Economy
*Children, Young Adults, and their Families
*Civil Justice
*Communications and the Internet
*Criminal Justice
*Culture and the Arts
*Death With Dignity
*Disabilities
*Education
*Energy and Environment

*Health Care
*Immigration
*Labor, Economic Justice and Poverty Elimination
*National Security
*Political Reform
*Rural
*Seniors
*Sustainable Communities
*Veterans and Military Families
*Women
*World Peace and International Relations

In regards to businesses and economics, the California Democratic party takes a stance that protects consumers, small businesses, [[Trade union|unions]], and individuals whose homes have been foreclosed upon.

The platform addresses the issues of family in several sections. The platform promises to protect seniors, children and all types of families with fair economic and social policies. These policies range from continuing [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for the elderly and keeping playgrounds safe for children. The platform also highlights the right of a woman to make choices for her own body and claims that healthcare is a natural right of all people. The California democrats further promise to protect the dignity of disabled citizens. The platform is dedicated to advocating for the rights of women through equal pay and [[affirmative action]].

The party prioritizes the creation of a sustainable and [[environmentalism|earth-friendly]] state. Focus is placed on the development of alternative forms of energy and how energy is consumed. In addition, the platform stresses that [[green jobs]] are a solution to economic and environmental concerns.

Finally, the platform takes stances on [[net neutrality|open internet]] use, immigration, and education. The Democrats of California support the right of the people to express their thoughts and ideas through any media, and their right to assemble. The party believes that immigration laws should be fair and that [[immigrants]] should not be discriminated against. The party wishes to bring education to the forefront, aiming to turn California into a leading state for academic achievement.

===Resolutions===

The California Democratic Party passes multiple [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s every year as a way of expressing their opinion to lawmakers statewide. While the party's resolutions have no legal force themselves, they are official documents that elected representatives should take into account when making decisions. A few recent resolutions are summarised below:
  
* '''2012 Buy American'''
:This resolution, written 18 November 2012, encourages all arms of government to favor American suppliers of goods and services.
	
* '''2012 Department of Defense Clean Energy Initiatives''' 
:This resolution was written on 18 November 2012 and supports the Department of Defense's initiative to commit to clean energy and alternative fuels through the Navy's "Great Green Fleet" initiative, the Army's "Net Zero" initiative, and the Air Force's commitment to lower carbon emissions.  
	
* '''2012 Filibuster Reform'''
:This resolution condemns the Republican Party's use of the filibuster to disrupt the work of the U.S. Senate and advocates that reform must be the first priority of the Senate Majority.

The above are only three of a long list of Resolutions passed by the California Democratic Party.
