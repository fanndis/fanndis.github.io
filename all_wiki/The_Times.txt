'''''The Times''''' is a British [[Newspaper#Daily|daily]] [[Newspaper#National|national newspaper]] based in [[London]]. It began in 1785 under the title '''''The Daily Universal Register''''', adopting its current name on 1 January 1788. ''The Times'' and its [[sister paper]] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (founded in 1821) are published by Times Newspapers, since 1981 a subsidiary of [[News UK]], in turn wholly owned by [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]]. ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'', which do not share editorial staff, were founded independently, and have only had common ownership since 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historic-newspapers.co.uk/blog/the-times-newspaper-history/|title=Full History of the Times Newspaper|date=13 November 2019}}</ref>

''The Times'' is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, such as ''[[The Times of India]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''. In countries where these other titles are popular, the newspaper is often referred to as {{nowrap|'''''The London Times'''''}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oii.org.au/5070/london-times-semenya-middle-sex/ |title=London Times: "Caster Semenya and the middle sex" &#124; OII Australia – Intersex Australia |publisher=Oii.org.au |date=20 November 2009 |access-date=8 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adnews.com.au/adnews/london-times-posts-digital-subs-rise |title=London Times posts digital subs rise |publisher=AdNews |date=4 July 2011 |access-date=8 April 2014}}</ref> or as {{nowrap|'''''The Times'' of London'''}},<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/01/26/times_editorial_page_calls_for_intervention_to_save_winehouse.html |title=Times' editorial page calls for intervention to save Winehouse &#124; Toronto Star |work=Thestar.com |date=26 January 2008 |access-date=8 April 2014}}</ref> although the newspaper is of national scope and distribution.

''The Times'' used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics, science, literature, and the arts to build its reputation. For much of its early life, the profits of ''The Times'' were very large and the competition minimal, so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers. Beginning in 1814, the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by [[Friedrich Koenig]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Journalism: History, Principles, Practices: An Historical Reader for Students and Professionals|first1 = W.

[[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]] was appointed general editor in 1817. In the same year, the paper's printer James Lawson, died and passed the business onto his son John Joseph Lawson (1802–1852). Under the editorship of Barnes and his successor in 1841, [[John Thadeus Delane]], the influence of ''The Times'' rose to great heights, especially in politics and amongst the [[City of London]]. Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for ''The Times'' the pompous/satirical nickname 'The Thunderer' (from "We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform."). The increased circulation and influence of the paper was based in part to its early adoption of the steam-driven rotary printing press. Distribution via [[Rail transport|steam trains]] to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence.<ref>Lomas, Claire.

''The Times'' was one of the first newspapers to send [[war correspondent]]s to cover particular conflicts. [[William Howard Russell]], the paper's correspondent with the army in the [[Crimean War]], was immensely influential with his dispatches back to England.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXu6XL4g4agC&pg=PA2|title=The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq|last=Knightley|first=Phillip|date=5 October 2004|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8030-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 1896|title=War Correspondents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aw0HAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA129|journal=The Edinburgh Review|volume=183|issue=375|pages=129}}</ref>

===1890 to 1981===
''The Times'' faced financial extinction in 1890 under [[Arthur Fraser Walter]], but it was rescued by an energetic editor, [[Charles Frederic Moberly Bell]]. During his tenure (1890–1911), ''The Times'' became associated with selling the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by [[Horace Everett Hooper]] and his advertising executive, Henry Haxton. Due to legal fights between the ''Britannica's'' two owners, Hooper and [[Walter Montgomery Jackson]], ''The Times'' severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper [[magnate]], [[Alfred Harmsworth]], later Lord Northcliffe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Charles-William-Harmsworth-Viscount-Northcliffe-of-Saint-Peter|title=Alfred Charles William Harmsworth, Viscount Northcliffe {{!}} British publisher|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref>

In editorials published on 29 and 31 July 1914, [[Wickham Steed]], the ''Times's'' Chief Editor, argued that the [[British Empire]] should enter [[World War I]].<ref>Ferguson, Niall (1999). ''The Pity of War'' London: Basic Books. p. 217. {{ISBN|978-0-465-05711-5}}</ref> On 8 May 1920, also under the editorship of [[Wickham Steed|Steed]], ''The Times'' in an editorial endorsed the [[anti-Semitic]] fabrication ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'' as a genuine document, and called Jews the world's greatest danger. In the leader entitled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", Steed wrote about ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'': <blockquote>What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery? If so, whence comes the uncanny note of prophecy, prophecy in part fulfilled, in part so far gone in the way of fulfillment?".<ref>Friedländer, Saul (1997). ''Nazi Germany and the Jews''. New York: HarperCollins. p. 95. {{ISBN|978-0-06-019042-2}}</ref></blockquote> The following year, when [[Philip Graves]], the [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]) correspondent of ''The Times'', exposed ''The Protocols'' as a forgery,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701191603/http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 July 2010|title=Ballylickey Manor House|date=1 July 2010|access-date=28 December 2019}}</ref> ''The Times'' retracted the editorial of the previous year.

In 1922, [[John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever|John Jacob Astor]], son of the [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|1st Viscount Astor]], bought ''The Times'' from the [[Alfred Harmsworth|Northcliffe estate]]. The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German [[appeasement]]; editor [[Geoffrey Dawson]] was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement, most notably [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Candid news reports by [[Norman_Ebbutt|Norman Ebbut]] from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.<ref>Gordon Martel, ed.

[[Kim Philby]], a double agent with primary allegiance to the [[Soviet Union]], was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of the late 1930s. Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict. He later joined British Military Intelligence ([[MI6]]) during [[World War II]], was promoted into senior positions after the war ended, and defected to the [[Soviet Union]] when discovery was inevitable in 1963.<ref>{{cite book |title= Treason in the blood: H.

[[File:Roy Thomson Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]]]]
Between 1941 and 1946, the left-wing British historian [[E. H. Carr]] was assistant editor. Carr was well known for the strongly pro-Soviet tone of his editorials.<ref>Beloff, Max. "The Dangers of Prophecy" pages 8–10 from ''History Today'', Volume 42, Issue # 9, September 1992 page 9</ref> In December 1944, when fighting broke out in [[Athens]] between the Greek Communist [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] and the British Army, Carr in a ''Times'' [[Leading article|leader]] sided with the Communists, leading [[Winston Churchill]] to condemn him and the article in a speech to the House of Commons.<ref>Davies, Robert William. "Edward Hallett Carr, 1892–1982" pages 473–511 from ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', Volume 69, 1983 page 489</ref> As a result of Carr's editorial, ''The Times'' became popularly known during that stage of World War II as "the threepenny ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]''" (the price of the Communist Party's ''Daily Worker'' being one penny).<ref>Haslam, Jonathan. "We Need a Faith: E.H. Carr, 1892–1982" pages 36–39 from ''History Today'', Volume 33, August 1983 page 37</ref>

On 3 May 1966, it resumed printing news on the front page – previously the front page had been given over to small advertisements, usually of interest to the moneyed classes in British society. Also in 1966, the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]], which had been a feature of the newspaper's masthead since its inception, was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hasler|first=Charles|title=The Royal Arms&nbsp;— Its Graphic And Decorative Development|publisher=Jupiter Books|date=1980|page=[https://archive.org/details/royalarmsitsgrap0000hasl/page/302 302]|isbn=978-0904041200|url=https://archive.org/details/royalarmsitsgrap0000hasl/page/302}}</ref>{{Sfn|Stewart|2005|p=63}} In the same year, members of the [[Astor family]] sold the paper to Canadian publishing magnate [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]]. His [[Thomson Corporation]] brought it under the same ownership as ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' to form [[News UK#Times Newspapers Ltd|Times Newspapers Limited]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

An industrial dispute prompted the management to shut the paper for nearly a year from 1 December 1978 to 12 November 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539795.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 13 – 1979: Times returns after year-long dispute}}</ref>

The Thomson Corporation management were struggling to run the business due to the [[1979 energy crisis]] and union demands. Management sought a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles, and had the resources and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

Several suitors appeared, including [[Robert Maxwell]], [[Tiny Rowland]] and [[Lord Rothermere]]; however, only one buyer was in a position to meet the full Thomson remit, Australian media magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]]. [[Robert Holmes à Court]], another Australian magnate had previously tried to buy ''The Times'' in 1980.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In 1981, ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'' were bought from Thomson by Rupert Murdoch's [[News UK|News International]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of the Times: The Murdoch years, 1981–2002|first1=Graham|last1=Stewart|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|isbn=0-00-718438-7| page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZZZAAAAMAAJ&q=The+History+of+the+Times:+The+Murdoch+years,+1981-2002}}</ref> The acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators John Collier and [[Bill O'Neill (media)|Bill O'Neill]].

After 14 years as editor, [[William Rees-Mogg]] resigned upon completion of the change of ownership.<ref>Stewart, p. 45</ref> Murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing [[Harold Evans]] as his replacement.<ref name="Stewart, p 51">Stewart, p. 51</ref> One of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures. Between March 1981 and May 1982, following agreement with print unions, the hot-metal [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] printing process used to print ''The Times'' since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photo-composition. This allowed print room staff at ''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'' to be reduced by half.<!--from 375 to 186--> However, direct input of text by journalists ("single-stroke" input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the [[Wapping dispute]] of 1986, when ''The Times'' moved from New [[Printing House Square]] in Gray's Inn Road (near [[Fleet Street]]) to new offices in [[Wapping]].<ref>Hamilton, Alan.

In June 1990, ''The Times'' ceased its policy of using courtesy titles ("Mr", "Mrs", or "Miss" prefixes) for living persons before full names on first reference, but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references. In 1992, it accepted the use of "Ms" for unmarried women "if they express a preference."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOykn3dMaJIC&q=%22the+times+of+london%22+%22courtesy+titles%22&pg=PA188|title=Writing Broadcast News: Shorter, Sharper, Stronger|last=Block|first=Mervin|date=1997|publisher=Bonus Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-56625-084-9|language=en}}</ref>

On 6 June 2005, ''The Times'' redesigned its Letters page, dropping the practice of printing correspondents' full postal addresses. Published letters were long regarded as one of the paper's key constituents. According to its [[leading article]] "From Our Own Correspondents", the reason for removal of full postal addresses was to fit more letters onto the page.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/from-our-own-correspondents-st83m3tm08m|title=From our own correspondents|date=6 June 2005|work=The Times|access-date=28 December 2019|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

In a 2007 meeting with the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, Murdoch stated that the law and the independent board prevented him from exercising editorial control.<ref name=Parliament070917>{{cite conference|title=Minute of the meeting with Mr Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, News Corporation |book-title=Inquiry into Media Ownership and the News |page=10 |publisher=House of Commons Select Committee on Communications |date=17 September 2007 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/us.doc |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201082014/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/us.doc |archive-date=1 December 2007 }}

===Online presence===
''The Times'' and ''The Sunday Times'' have had an online presence since March 1999, originally at ''the-times.co.uk'' and ''sunday-times.co.uk'', and later at ''timesonline.co.uk''.

==Typeface==
''The Times'' is the originator of the widely used [[Times New Roman]] typeface, originally developed by [[Stanley Morison]] of ''The Times'' in collaboration with the [[Monotype Corporation]] for its legibility in low-tech printing. In November 2006, ''The Times'' began printing headlines in a new font, [[Times New Roman#Other typefaces used by The Times|Times Modern]]. ''The Times'' was printed in [[broadsheet]] format for 219 years, but switched to [[compact (newspaper)|compact]] size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. ''The Sunday Times'' remains a broadsheet.

{{quote|[T]he various typefaces used before the introduction (The) Times New Roman {{sic}} didn't really have a formal name.

They were a suite of types originally made by Miller and Co. (later Miller & Richards) in Edinburgh around 1813, generally referred to as "modern". When The Times began using Monotype (and other hot-metal machines) in 1908, this design was remade by Monotype for its equipment. As near as I can tell, it looks like Monotype Series no. 1 — Modern (which was based on a Miller & Richards typeface) — was what was used up until 1932.|Dan Rhatigan, type director<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultrasparky.org/archives/2011/08/it_was_never_ca.html|title=Ultrasparky: It was never called Times Old Roman}}</ref>|multiline=yes}}

In 1908, ''The Times'' started using the ''Monotype Modern'' typeface.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Tally of Types|author=Morison|year=1953|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=15}}</ref>

''The Times'' commissioned the [[serif]] [[typeface]] ''[[Times New Roman]]'', created by [[Victor Lardent]] at the English branch of [[Monotype Corporation|Monotype]], in 1931.<ref name="loxley">{{cite book|last=Loxley|first=Simon|title=Type: the secret history of letters |publisher=I.

''The Times'' stayed with ''Times New Roman'' for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman font:
* ''Times Europa'' was designed by [[Walter Tracy]] in 1972 for ''The Times'', as a sturdier alternative to the Times font family, designed for the demands of faster printing presses and cheaper paper.

==Political allegiance==
Historically, the paper was not overtly pro-[[Tory]] or [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], but has been a long time bastion of the [[The Establishment#Britain|English Establishment]] and empire. In 1959, the historian of journalism [[Allan Nevins]] analysed the importance of ''The Times'' in shaping the views of events of London's elite:

<blockquote>For much more than a century ''The Times'' has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain. Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated, and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility. While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns, its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain. To guide this treatment, the editors have for long periods been in close touch with [[10 Downing Street]].<ref>Allan Nevins, "American Journalism and Its Historical Treatment", ''Journalism Quarterly'' (1959) 36#4 pp 411–22</ref></blockquote>

''The Times'' adopted a stance described as "peculiarly detached" at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]; although it was increasingly critical of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s campaign, it did not advocate a vote for any one party.<ref>R. B. McCallum and Alison Readman, "The British General Election of 1945", Oxford University Press, 1947, p.&nbsp;181–2.</ref> However, the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|next election]] five years later. It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] for the next five elections, expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974. The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997, when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual (primarily [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]) candidates.<ref>[[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]] and Dennis Kavanagh, "The British General Election of 1997", Macmillan, London, 1997, p. 156.</ref>

For the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], ''The Times'' declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s Labour government, which was re-elected by a landslide (although not as large as in 1997). It supported Labour again in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], when Labour achieved a third successive win, though with a reduced majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/business--money/which-political-parties-do-the-newspapers-support--25923p1.html|title=Which political parties do the newspapers support?|last=Lancaster|first=Dave|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Supanet|access-date=27 October 2010}}</ref> In 2004, according to [[Ipsos MORI|MORI]], the voting intentions of its readership were 40% for the Conservative Party, 29% for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], and 26% for Labour.<ref name="MORI survey">{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/755/Voting-Intention-by-Newspaper-Readership.aspx|title=Voting intention by newspaper readership|date=9 March 2005|publisher=Ipsos MORI|access-date=18 July 2009}}</ref> For the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the newspaper declared its support for the Conservatives once again; the election ended in the Tories taking the most votes and seats but having to form a [[coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to form a government as they had failed to gain an overall majority.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stoddard|first=Katy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/may/04/general-election-newspaper-support |title=Newspaper support in UK general elections|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=4 May 2010|access-date=27 October 2010}}</ref>
