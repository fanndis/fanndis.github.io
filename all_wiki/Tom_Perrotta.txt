==Career==
While teaching Creative Writing at Yale,<ref name="page"/> Perrotta completed three novels that he had trouble getting published. One was ''[[Election (1998 novel)|Election]]'', the story of an intense high-school election inspired by the three-candidate [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 United States presidential race]], and another was ''Lucky Winners'', which remains unpublished as of 2007 and which Perrotta described in 2004 as "a pretty good novel about a family that falls apart after winning the lottery."<ref name="bn">[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=881758 "Meet the Writers: Tom Perrotta"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610002828/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=881758 |date=2007-06-10 }}, Barnesandnoble.com, 2004.</ref> In 1994, Perrotta published his first book, a collection of short stories titled ''Bad Haircut: Stories of the Seventies'' which ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called "more powerful than any other [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]]." The same year, Perrotta left Yale and began teaching expository writing at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="motoko"/> In 1997 he published ''The Wishbones'', his first novel, which Perrotta has said is basically "about my high school years."<ref name="dige">Alexander, Kevin. "Suburban Observer" (interview with Perrotta), [[Writer's Digest]], Dec. 2007.</ref> The unpublished manuscript of ''Election'' was optioned as a screenplay in 1996 by director [[Alexander Payne]], which then led to interest in publishing it as a book. It arrived in bookstores in March 1998, followed shortly by its [[Election (1999 film)|film adaptation]], which was released in April 1999 to critical acclaim.<ref name="page"/> The film, which starred [[Matthew Broderick]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]], helped popularize Perrotta as an author.

Following ''Election'', Perrotta shifted his focus to an older—though just as troubled—cast of characters: first with 2000's ''Joe College'', a comic journey into the dark side of higher education, love, and food service (which the author says is about his college years<ref name="dige"/>); and then with 2004's ''[[Little Children (novel)|Little Children]]'', which explored the psychological and romantic depths beneath the surface of [[suburb]]ia.
''

''Little Children'' was Perrotta's "breakout book,"<ref name="motoko"/> featured on numerous "Best Books of 2004" lists—including those of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[National Public Radio]], and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine—and garnering tremendous praise for Perrotta. ''[[The New York Times]]'' dubbed him "an American [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] whose characters even at their most ridiculous seem blessed and ennobled by a luminous human aura,"<ref>Blythe, Will. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D8133FF937A25750C0A9629C8B63 "All the Children Are Above Average"], [[The New York Times]], 2004-03-14. Retrieved on 2007-07-04.</ref> and ''People'' called him "the rare writer equally gifted at drawing people's emotional maps...and creating sidesplitting scenes."<ref>[http://www.tomperrotta.net/content.php?page=election&n=2&f=2 "Books & Writing: Election"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234909/http://www.tomperrotta.net/content.php?page=election&n=2&f=2 |date=2007-09-27 }}, Official Web Site. Retrieved on 2007-10-20.</ref> For his part, Perrotta describes himself as a writer in the "plain-language American tradition" of authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Raymond Carver]].<ref name="globe"/>

In 2006, Perrotta sold [[New Line Cinema]] an original screenplay he co-wrote with ''[[Frasier]]'' producer [[Rob Greenberg]]. Titled ''Barry and Stan Gone Wild'', the screenplay is "a shameless comedy [about] a 40-something dermatologist who goes on spring break."<ref name="globe"/> In January 2007, Perrotta was on the guest faculty for the third annual Writers in Paradise conference at [[Eckerd College]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].<ref name="page"/> Perrotta was invited to teach at Eckerd by [[Dennis Lehane]]; the two writers had previously taught together at Stonecoast Writers Conference in [[Maine]].<ref name="page"/>

Perrotta's novel, ''[[The Abstinence Teacher]]'', was published on October 16, 2007. It is, according to the author, "all about sex education and the [[culture war]]s. It's close in spirit to ''Little Children'', I think."<ref name="page"/> It was chosen by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a 2007 Notable Book of the Year. As of October 2007, he was working on a film adaptation of the book with ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' directors [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]].<ref name="ent"/>

In 2010, 30,000 copies of his short story "The Smile on Happy Chang's Face" were distributed as part of the [[Boston Book Festival]]'s "One City, One Story" project.

He has participated in turning his novel ''[[The Leftovers (novel)|The Leftovers]]'' into an [[HBO]] TV series of [[The Leftovers (TV series)|the same name]] that began running in 2014 to critical acclaim for three seasons.
