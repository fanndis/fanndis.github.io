'''Wayland Baptist University''' ('''WBU''') is private [[Baptist]] university based in [[Plainview, Texas]]. Wayland Baptist has a total of 14 campuses in five Texas cities, six states, American Samoa, and Kenya. It was originally chartered in 1908 and currently has a total enrollment of approximately 5,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/search/title+Wayland%20Baptist%20University|title=Wayland Baptist University - Profile, Rankings and Data|publisher=U.S. News}}</ref>

==History==
In 1906, the Staked Plains Baptist Association purposed the creation of a school. Dr. and Mrs. [[James Henry Wayland]] offered [[United States dollar|$]]10,000 and {{convert|25|acre|m2}} of land in Plainview if the Staked Plains Baptist Association and the citizens of the city would raise an additional $40,000.<ref name="History"/> In 1910, the school offered its first classes despite the administration building not yet being fully built. A total of 225 students were taking classes in [[primary education]] through junior college levels during the school's first term. After a public school system was well established in Plainview, the elementary grades were discontinued. Wayland Baptist gained membership to the American Association of Junior Colleges in 1926 and would later be approved as a senior college by the Texas Department of Education and the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]]. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Texas Education Agency for teacher education training.<ref name="History"/>

The school is the oldest institution of higher education in continuous existence on the High Plains of Texas due to the leadership of Dr. George W. McDonald, the fifth president of the school.  When a run on the banks during the Great Depression threatened to close the school, the administration and faculty agreed to forgo pay to continue the task of educating students, trusting God to supply their needs.<ref name="presidents"/>

In 1951, a black teacher approached the college asking if she could fulfill continuing education requirements at the college.  Dr. James W. "Bill" Marshall, the school's sixth president, led the college to take the historic step to admit black students to the college, making Wayland the first four-year liberal arts college in the former [[Southern United States|Confederate states]] to integrate voluntarily.<ref name="Minorities"/>  This action came three years before the Supreme Court's decision to ban school segregation, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.

The Malouf Abraham Family Arts Center on the Wayland campus was endowed by the family of the late [[Texas House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Malouf Abraham, Sr.]], and his son, [[Malouf Abraham, Jr.]], a retired [[allergist]] and active art collector from [[Canadian, Texas|Canadian]], the seat of [[Hemphill County]] in the northeastern [[Texas Panhandle]].

A musical scholarship has been established at Wayland in honor of [[Sybil Leonard Armes]], a Christian writer and alternate [[poet laureate]] of Texas in 1969, who was the mother of Wayland President Paul Woodson Armes.

In 1979, the Hawaii campus opened as Wayland's first outside of Texas.  Twelve satellite campuses are now located throughout the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbu.edu/colleges-in-aiea/|title=Christian Universities in Hawaii - Hawaii Campus of Wayland Baptist University|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>

In May 2008, entertainer [[Jimmy Dean]], a Plainview native, announced that he was making the largest ever gift to Wayland.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Helber|first1=Steve|title=Dean gives $1 million to Wayland|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/052108/loc_281249280.shtml#|accessdate=September 19, 2015|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|date=May 21, 2008}}</ref>

In 2013, Wayland was ranked as the #72 university in the West Region by ''US News''.<ref name="rankingsandreviews.com"/>

In 2014, Wayland was recognized as having some of the most affordable online degree programs in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Most Affordable U.S. Online College Rankings|url=http://www.onlineu.org/college-rankings/most-affordable}}</ref> They have the most affordable online nursing degree program in the country, as well as the 12th most affordable online education degree program.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Athletics==
Wayland Baptist teams, nicknamed athletically as the Pioneers are part of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), primarily competing in the [[Sooner Athletic Conference]].. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, football, golf, soccer, track and field, and wrestling;  women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, soccer, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. Until 2018, Wayland Baptist was the only college in Texas to offer a wrestling program.

On April 1, 2010, Wayland Baptist announced its intention to bring back the football program and join the [[Central States Football League]] in 2012.  On December 8, 2010, the Pioneers introduced Jeff Lynn, former head coach of [[New Mexico Military Institute]], as the first head coach in over 70 years. On April 24, 2011, Lynn stepped down from head coach because of family reasons.  He would be replaced by former [[Lubbock Coronado High School]] coach Butch Henderson.

The cross country and track and field program have won a total of 14 national championships. The programs compete at notable track meets and cross country events such as the Cowboy Jamboree, Texas Relays, Drake Relays, and the Micheal Johnson Classic. In 2012, Wayland's men's track team won the NAIA National Championship by a margin of 38 points, which was the largest margin of victory in 23 years. Four Wayland athletes won individual championships, in addition to Wayland winning the 4x400 relay championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naia.org/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=646949&SPID=100400&DB_LANG=C&ATCLID=205391511&DB_OEM_ID=27900|title=2012 Indoor Championships - Final Day Recap|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref>

===Women's basketball===
Wayland's women's basketball program, The Hutcherson Flying Queens, has the distinction of being the winningest team in women's collegiate basketball history. On November 30, 2017, during the 2017–18 season, the Flying Queens posted their 1,600th win, 300 plus more wins than any other women's collegiate basketball team in USA history. By the end of the 2016–17 season, Tennessee who leads all NCAA DI schools, had 1,252 wins, followed by Louisiana Tech with 1,199 and Connecticut with 1,118.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/mtt/auriemma_geno00.html|title=GENO AURIEMMA|date=November 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402150520/http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/mtt/auriemma_geno00.html|archive-date=2009-04-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> Wayland had 1595.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbuathletics.com/documents/2014/1/21/Women_s_Basketball_Records.pdf?id=281.%20Retrieved%202017-11-12|title=Wayland Baptist University - Women s Basketball Records.pdf|website=www.wbuathletics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wbuathletics.com/news/2015/3/27/WBB_0327150033.aspx?path=wbball|title=Flying Queens anxious to take next step next season|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wbuathletics.com/news/2016/3/28/-11-womens-basketball-queens-enjoy-incredible-season-ultimate-goal-still-ahead.aspx?path=wbball|title=Queens enjoy incredible season; ultimate goal still ahead|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wbuathletics.com/news/2017/3/23/-15-womens-basketball-season-a-success-despite-disappointing-end.aspx?path=wbball.|title=Season a success despite disappointing end|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

The Wayland women's basketball team has also distinguished itself in the following ways:
* The Flying Queens are the only team in collegiate basketball history (men or women) to record a 131-game consecutive winning streak (1953–1958).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/images/100000000498464/2010/12/19/sports/ncaabasketball/19wayland.html.%20Retrieved%202017-11-12|title=Before UConn, There Was Wayland – NYTimes.com|website=mobile.nytimes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044044/https://mobile.nytimes.com/images/100000000498464/2010/12/19/sports/ncaabasketball/19wayland.html.%20Retrieved%202017-11-12|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2013, the 1953–58 teams were honored as "Trailblazers of the Game" by the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame for the 131 game-winning streak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbhof.com/Trailblazers.html|title=Trailblazers of the Game|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The team is featured in a documentary entitled ''Flying Queens: A Basketball Dynasty'', directed by Kellie Mitchell and produced by Aperture Art Productions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingqueens.com/about/|title=About Our Documentary|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
* From the 1948–49 season through 2017–18 season the Flying Queens posted 1622 wins against 562 losses for a winning percentage of .743. In this 69-year period, the Wayland Team averaged 23 wins per season.<ref name=":0" />
* The Wayland Team has won 19 National Championships.<ref name=":0" />
* The Flying Queens' program has had eight individuals inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Tennessee.<ref name=":0" />
* Members of the Wayland Hutcherson Flying Queens have received 212 All-American Awards from various organizations, excluding NAIA Scholar Athletes and a COSIDA Academic Award.<ref name=":0" />
Since the 1948–49 season, when Wayland began keeping official statistics on the Queens, the Wayland Team has had the following affiliations:
* AAU (Amateur Athletic Union):  Between the 1948–49 season through the 1976–77 season, Wayland competed in AAU women's basketball and was one of only a few colleges to compete in this league, as teams were primarily industrial and basically professional. The Wayland Team won 10 National AAU Championships, placed second 9 times, and third 3 times. Wayland Team members received 88 AAU All-American Awards.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">Nadler S. F. (1980). A Developmental History of the Wayland Hutcherson Flying Queens from 1910 to 1979 (Doctoral Dissertation). East Texas State University.</ref>
* NWIT (National Women's Invitational Tournament): The NWIT was initially sponsored by the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce. Wayland administrators had presented the idea to them because of Wayland's strong desire to have a national tournament limited to college teams. The NWIT was one of the first two national basketball tournaments for college women, coincidentally starting one day apart. The Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics Tournament held in West Chester, PA, March 20–24, 1969<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jonfmorse.com/wiki/index.php?title=1969_CIAW_Basketball_Tournament|title=1969 CIAW Basketball Tournament – Varsity Pride|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=www.jonfmorse.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}</ref> and the NWIT in Amarillo, Texas, March 21–24, 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/asu.edu/womensbasketball/Home/women-s-basketball-timeline|title=Women's Basketball Timeline|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Wayland competed in the NWIT for 9 years (1969–1977), winning 9 consecutive NWIT National Championships and receiving 23 NWIT All-American Awards.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> The NWIT faded in prominence when the NCAA and NAIA assumed governance for women's basketball and was discontinued in 1996. In 1998, Triple Crown Sports resurrected the tournament as the Women's National Invitational Tournament (Women's NIT).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenscollegebasketballhistory.com|title=Women's College Basketball Championship Page|last=Cooper|first=Gregory|website=womenscollegebasketballhistory.com|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>
* AIAW (Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women): Wayland competed in the AIAW play-off structure for nine years, 1974–1982. During that period the team made it to the Final 4 three times finishing third in 1976 and fourth in 1978 and 1982. In both 1974 and 1975 they won the Consolation bracket.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
* NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics): The Wayland Team has competed in NAIA Division I basketball from 1983 through 2018.  They have qualified for the National Tournament 25 times garnering 38 NAIA All-American Awards, one COSIDA Academic All American, and 39 NAIA Scholar-Athlete Awards.<ref name=":0" />
* FIBA (International Basketball Federation): Between 1953 and 1975, Wayland was represented on all seven of FIBA's Women's World Championship Teams. Nineteen Flying Queens have played in FIBA World Championships.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
* Pan American Games:  Between 1955 and 1979, Wayland was represented on all seven USA Pan American teams. Twenty-seven Flying Queens competed in these games. Wayland coaches coached the USA's teams to first place victories in 1955 and 1959 and second place in 1971.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />
* USA All-Star Teams: Between 1958 and 1978, eighteen Flying Queens were selected for basketball tours that were part of the State Department's Intercultural Exchange Program to enhance relations between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In 1959, eight Wayland players and a coach participated in the first women's basketball game ever to be played in Madison Square Garden.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Russia won, 42–40. Also, to foster international goodwill, Wayland hosted national teams from Russia, The Republic of China, and Mexico on the Wayland's Plainview campus. Wayland teams made a number of trips to Mexico City to play both Mexican national teams and Mexican independent teams.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Other Organizational Honors: In addition to the 149 All-American Awards previously mentioned, members of the Wayland Team garnered 63 other All-American Awards:  Hanes Underalls (6); National Scouting Association (6); Street & Smith Preseason (9); Kodak (18); American Women's Sports Federation All Star Team (14); American Women's Sports Federation All American Freshman Team (7); and, JC Penny All-American Five (1).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

The women's team also has a rich history. Wayland's first women's basketball game was in 1910–11, the same year that Wayland opened for classes. Women played club sport basketball against high schools from the 1910–11 season through the 1947–48 season when the Wayland women's team played its first game against another college, beating Texas Tech. The Wayland Team played its first AAU competition in 1948–49, which is also when Wayland began keeping official game statistics. The Wayland Team played its first International Competition in 1949–50 against Mexico. Beginning with the 1950–51 season, the Wayland Team became the first women's basketball team to fly to all away games, as Claude and Wilda Hutcherson, owners of Hutcherson Flying Service, picked up sponsorship of the team and flew the team to away games in Hutcherson Flying Service planes. This tradition of flying resulted in the team being named the "Hutcherson Flying Queens".<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/hoop-queens/|title=Hoop Queens|last=|first=|date=November 19, 2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In the early 1950s, Wayland became the first 4-year collegiate program in history to provide 13 full scholarships annually to a women's collegiate team. [19, 20] The Wayland Team attracted 40 to 50 women to Plainview each year for tryouts.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

The mascot for the women's team is the Flying Queens. The original team name was the Wayland Lassies, but in 1948, a local company, Harvest Queen Mill provided uniforms for the team, so they became the Harvest Queens.<ref name="Ikard 105" /> Before the 1950 season began, the team had a chance to play a game in Mexico City. A Wayland grad, Claude Hutcherson, was persuaded to fly the team to Mexico. Hutcherson became enamored with the team, and became a major sponsor, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the team.<ref name="Ikard 105" /> When Hutcherson Air Service became a full sponsor of the team, they began calling the team the Hutcherson Flying Queens.<ref name="Su 79" /> Hutcherson provided three sets of uniforms, plus traveling attire, and flew the team about 9,000 miles a year to games.<ref name="Festle 37" /> To this day, Hutcherson Air Service continues to provide travel for the women's road games.

Ironically, the strong support of Claude Hutcherson created problems for the school. Wayland considered dropping the team because the scholarships threatened their accreditation.<ref name="Festle 40" /> In 1961, the Wayland board of trustees voted unanimously to eliminate women's basketball. The school had difficulty funding the academic programs. The accrediting organization, the Southern Association of Colleges, was not interested in AAU championships. No plans were made to eliminate the men's scholarships, only the women's scholarships.<ref name="Grundy and Shackleford 109" /> The local citizens did not accept the decision. Local businessmen, under the leadership of Claude Hutcherson, raised money to privately fund scholarships for a year. The trustees voted to reverse their position.<ref name="Grundy and Shackleford 110" />

The team was coached from 1955–56 through 1972–73 by Harley Redin. Redin served in the Marine Air Corp in WWII, logging 50 combat missions over the South Pacific. After the war, he became the athletic director of Wayland Baptist, and the coach of the men's basketball team. The men's teams were very successful, making the NAIA postseason tournament three separate years.<ref name="Porter 388" />
However, he became the coach of the women's team in 1955, and was even more successful—in 1954, under Coach Caddo Matthews, they began a winning streak that would stretch to 131 games, including four consecutive AAU national championships.<ref name="Grundy and Shackleford 97" /> The winning streak would eclipse a prior winning streak of 102 games, held by Hanes Hosiery, which ended in 1954.<ref name="Ikard 72" /> For 18 years under the coaching leadership of Redin, the team won 431 games against only 66 losses. The team won six national AAU championships, and finished second six other times.<ref name="Porter 388" /> Redin went on to coach the [[USA Women's Pan American Team]] in 1959 and 1971.<ref name="Porter 388" /> He was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1999.<ref name="HOF" /> In 2018, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame presented Coach Redin the Bunn Lifetime Achievement award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wkyt.com/content/sports/Harley-Redin--Jim-Host-to-Receive-Naismith-Memorial-Basketball-Hall-of-Fames-2018-John-W-Bunn-Lifetime-Achievement-Award-474428673.html|title=Harley Redin & Jim Host to receive Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame’s 2018 John W.

==Schools==
===School of Math and Sciences===
The '''School of Mathematics and Sciences''' at Wayland Baptist University administers all mathematics and science courses taught on the Plainview campus and also those taught online. Degrees are offered in math, math education, biology, molecular biology, chemistry, and geology, along with several preprofessional service course areas such as prenursing and pre-engineering. Currently, the school has 15 faculty members; 6 math and 9 sciences, with three emeritus faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbu.edu/academics/schools/math_and_science/faculty.html|title=Wayland Baptist University - Academics - Schools - Mathematics and Science|publisher=|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}</ref> The School serves over 400 students each semester. On average, 20 to 30 students graduate with degrees from the school each year.

Initially, math and science courses were taught in several temporary locations on the WBU campus. Eventually, they, along with most other courses, were taught in Gates Hall, and later also in the library. The Division of Math and Science was formally designated in the 1940s. Science courses were moved to refurbished army barracks located on the north side of the campus in the 1960s. The Moody Science building was constructed in the early 1970s from a generous grant from the [[Moody Foundation]]. Several of the features in the new building were designed by faculty members. Since its completion, all Plainview campus math and science courses have been held there. In 2005, the university structure was reorganized, and the Division was redesignated as the School of Mathematics and Science.<ref>Estelle Owens (2009) History of Wayland Baptist University, 167 p.</ref> The School is housed in the Moody Science Building at 1900 W 7th Street, Plainview, TX 79072.
