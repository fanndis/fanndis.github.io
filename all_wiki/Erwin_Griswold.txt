'''Erwin Nathaniel Griswold''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|r|ɪ|z|w|ɔː|l|d|,_|-|w|əl|d}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/griswold "Griswold"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> July 14, 1904 – November 19, 1994) was an appellate attorney who argued many cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Griswold served as [[Solicitor General of the United States]] (1967–1973) under [[U.S. President|Presidents]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard M. Nixon]]. He also served as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of [[Harvard Law School]] for 21 years. Several times he was considered for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. During a career that spanned more than six decades, he served as member of the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] and as President of the [[American Bar Foundation]].

== Early life ==
Griswold was born in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], to Hope (Erwin) and James Harlen Griswold. Griswold graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1925 with an A.B. in mathematics and an M.A. in political science. He attended [[Harvard Law School]] from 1925 to 1929, earning an [[LL.B.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1928 and an [[S.J.D.]] in 1929. Griswold compiled ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook]]'', a uniform system of legal citation used by law professionals, in 1926 while a student at Harvard Law School.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hurt |first=Christine |authorlink= |title=The Bluebook at Eighteen: Reflecting and Ratifying Current Trends in Legal Scholarship |journal=Indiana Law Journal |volume=82 |issue= |pages=49, 51–52 |year=2007}}</ref>

In 1929, Griswold was admitted to the Ohio bar and spent six weeks working as a partner in his father's [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] law firm of Griswold, Green, Palmer & Hadden. He subsequently joined the [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Office of the Solicitor General]] as a staff attorney and served as a special assistant to the [[attorney general]] from 1929 to 1934. There he worked under Solicitor General [[Charles Evans Hughes, Jr.]], son of the future Chief Justice of the United States, [[Charles Evans Hughes, Sr.]] He became an expert at arguing tax cases before the Supreme Court, and is considered one of the great scholars in [[tax law]].

== Academic career ==
Griswold joined the Harvard faculty in 1934, first as an associate legal professor, and then as a full professor from 1935 to 1946. Known for a very keen intellect, Griswold was made dean of Harvard Law School from 1946 and served in that capacity until 1967. One of the dominant figures in American legal education, he doubled the size of the faculty, bringing in such legal luminaries as [[Derek Bok]] (who succeeded him as Dean, and later became President of Harvard University), [[Kingman Brewster]] (later President of [[Yale University]]), and [[Alan Dershowitz]].  In 1946, just after Griswold was made Dean, [[Soia Mentschikoff]] was appointed Visiting Professor, the first woman faculty member in the history of Harvard Law School.<ref>{{cite news |author1=No Writer Attributed |title=Law School Appoints First Woman to Staff |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1946/11/15/law-school-appoints-first-woman-to/ |accessdate=27 December 2018 |agency=The Harvard Crimson |date=November 15, 1946}}</ref>

On December 11, 1934, the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' published an article by Griswold titled "Government in Ignorance of the Law – A Plea for Better Publication of Executive Legislation."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griswold |first1=Erwin |title=Government in Ignorance of the Law- A Plea for Better Publication of Executive Legislation |journal=Harvard Law Review |date=December 11, 1934 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=198–215 |doi=10.2307/1332538 |jstor=1332538 |url=https://public.resource.org/48HarvLRev198.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref> The arguments Griswold made for orderly publication of the official actions of the Executive Branch were underlined when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in [[Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan]] and forced the hand of the committee studying the issue for President Roosevelt. Congress passed legislation to create the [[Federal Register]], and the President signed it into law (Pub. L. 74-220, July 26, 1935).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Office of the Federal Register |title=A Brief History Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the Publication of the First Issue of the Federal Register |journal=Federal Register |date=March 14, 2006 |volume=71 |issue=49 |page=2 |url=https://www.federalregister.gov/uploads/2011/01/fr_history.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Elliott |first1=Debbie |title='Federal Register' Marks 70th Anniversary |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5301813 |website=All Things Considered |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

As Dean, Griswold enlarged the school's curriculum to include such specialized topics as [[labor relations]], [[family law]], and [[copyright law]]. In addition, he expanded the school's physical plant, library holdings, and financial resources. Finally, he began the process of convincing the [[Harvard Corporation]] to allow the enrollment of the first female students in 1948, and oversaw it beginning in Autumn of 1950.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richards Hope |first1=Judith |title=Pinstripes and Pearls |date=2003 |publisher=A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781416575252 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pinstripespearls00hope/page/265 265]–271 |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/pinstripespearls00hope |url-access=registration |quote=pinstripes and pearls. |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>  The Law School was the third graduate school at Harvard to admit women after the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and the [[Harvard Medical School|Medical School]]. It did so twenty-seven years before [[Harvard College]] fully admitted women as [[undergraduates]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Walsh |first1=Colleen |title=Hard-earned gains for women at Harvard |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/hard-earned-gains-for-women-at-harvard/ |accessdate=28 December 2018 |publisher=The Harvard Gazette |date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> 

At Harvard, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] was scolded for taking up a man’s seat by Dean Griswold.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ruth Bader Ginsburg Has Died. She Leaves Behind a Vital Legacy for Women — and Men |url=https://time.com/5660188/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies/ |website=Time |accessdate=19 September 2020}}</ref> 

In a 1992 Interview, he recalled that at the time, over one-third of the faculty were against the admission of women.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Radd |first1=Victoria L. |title=Interview of Erwin N.

In the 1950s, Griswold served as an expert witness for [[Thurgood Marshall]], who was then the legal director of the [[NAACP]], in several cases that the association brought to lay the foundation for the Supreme Court's desegregation order in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solicitor General: Erwin N.

Earlier in the 1950s Griswold denounced Senator [[Joseph R. McCarthy]] in his book ''The Fifth Amendment Today'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griswold |first1=Erwin N. |title=The Fifth Amendment Today |date=January 1955 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=9780674492585 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674492585 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref> which examined the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. A 1960 profile of Mr. Griswold in ''The New York Times'' said that "when Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was in full cry against the use of the Fifth Amendment by witnesses accused of Communist ties, one of the most forceful voices in defense of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination was raised by Dean Erwin Nathaniel Griswold of the Harvard Law School."<ref name=hevesi>{{cite news |last1=Hevesi |first1=Dennis |title=Erwin Griswold Is Dead at 90; Served as a Solicitor General |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/21/obituaries/erwin-griswold-is-dead-at-90-served-as-a-solicitor-general.html |accessdate=1 January 2019 |issue=Page B10 |work=New York Times |date=November 21, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Champion of Liberties; Erwin Nathaniel Griswold |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/11/14/archives/a-champion-of-liberties-erwin-nathaniel-griswold.html |accessdate=1 January 2019 |work=New York Times |date=November 14, 1960 |page=34}}</ref>

Griswold was a member of the [[U.S. Civil Rights Commission]] from 1961 to 1967 having been appointed by [[John F. Kennedy]].  On May 8, 1963, in the midst of police violence and massive arrests of schoolchildren in [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham]], Alabama, Kennedy held a press conference in which the President answered a reporter's question about the matter of improving U.S. race relations, and a suggestion there was need for a [[Fireside Chat]] on [[Civil Rights]], with the claim that the Federal Government had done all it legally could do about the issue.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=John Fitzgerald |title=News Conference 55, May 8, 1963 |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-press-conferences/news-conference-55 |website=Archives |publisher=John F.

== Solicitor General ==
On the same day that Griswold retired as Dean and Langdell Professor of Law in 1967, President Johnson appointed him [[United States Solicitor General]].<ref>https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1967/10/2/a-great-law-dean-perwin-griswold/</ref> Johnson was a Democrat and Griswold a moderate Republican, but the bipartisan appointment was widely praised. As Solicitor General, Griswold advocated in support of [[Great Society]] legislation, and he continued on in the position under President Nixon until 1973. Harriet S. Shapiro became the first woman attorney in the Solicitor General’s office when Griswold hired her in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ernst |first1=Dan |title=Harriet S. Shapiro, Harold M.

As Solicitor General, Griswold unsuccessfully argued against the publication of the [[Pentagon Papers]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'', because such publication would cause a "grave and immediate danger to the security of the United States." Years later, he reversed his position in an [[op-ed]] piece entitled "Secrets Not Worth Keeping" in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', writing, "I have never seen any trace of a threat to the national security from the publication" of the Pentagon Papers. He suggested that government demands for secrecy be treated with some skepticism by the public.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Griswold |first1=Erwin |title=Secrets Not Worth Keeping |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1989/02/15/secrets-not-worth-keeping/a115a154-4c6f-41fd-816a-112dd9908115/ |accessdate=29 December 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=February 15, 1989}}</ref>

== Later years ==
In 1973, Griswold resigned as Solicitor General and joined the international law firm of [[Jones Day Reavis & Pogue]] in Washington, D.C. He continued to argue many cases before the Supreme Court up until his death in 1994. He also served as a mentor to many of the young lawyers in the firm.

Harvard Law School's [[Griswold Hall]], which houses faculty offices including that of the dean, was named for him in 1979.<ref name=hevesi/>

From 1983 to 1994, he served the U.S. government as a liaison between U.S. and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lawyers in the Lawyers Alliance Nuclear Arms Control. Griswold was also active in the Supreme Court Historical Society, serving as Chairman of the Board of Trustees at the time of his death in 1994.

Griswold also served as a trustee of his undergraduate alma mater, Oberlin College. In October 2014, the President of Oberlin, [[Marvin Krislov]], in a detailed tribute to Griswold, announced the creation of the Erwin N. Griswold '25 Chair in Politics and Law.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krislov |first1=Marvin |title=New Chair in Politics and Law Honors Erwin Griswold |url=https://www.oberlin.edu/news/new-chair-politics-and-law-honors-erwin-griswold |website=Campus News October 8, 2014 |publisher=Oberlin College |accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref>

Griswold wrote several books including ''Spendthrift Trusts'' (1936), ''Cases on Federal Taxation'' (1940), ''Cases on Conflict Laws'' (1942), and arguably his most popular, ''The Fifth Amendment Today, Law and Lawyers in the United States'' (1992). Throughout his career he received numerous honorary degrees from many prestigious universities, including [[Columbia University]], [[Northwestern University]], [[Brown University]], and the [[University of Sydney]]. Griswold served as president of the Association of American Law Schools from 1957 to 1958 and as President of the American Bar Foundation from 1971 to 1974. In 1978, the [[American Bar Association]] awarded Griswold the gold medal for his outstanding contributions and service to the legal community.

In 1985, at a ceremony commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the [[United States Supreme Court Building]], Griswold gave a speech in which he compared the work [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] had done for [[women's rights]] to that which [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] and Thurgood Marshall had done for the [[civil rights]] of [[racial minorities]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States |journal=Hearings Before the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, First Session |date=July 20–23, 1993 |volume=Senate Hearing 103-482 |issue=Serial No. J-103-21 |pages=10–11 |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CHRG-GINSBURG/pdf/GPO-CHRG-GINSBURG-4-30-1.pdf |accessdate=3 January 2019 |quote="But I would call attention, sir, simply to remarks of Erwin N.

Dean Griswold spoke of the work of attorneys who had appeared before the Court on behalf of special interest groups, as he termed it, and he said this: 'I think, for example, of the work done in the early days of the NAACP which was represented here by one of the country's great lawyers, Charles Hamilton Houston; work which was carried on later with great ability by Thurgood Marshall. And I may mention the work done by lawyers representing groups interested in the rights of women of whom Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an outstanding example.'

And then Nussbaum said, 'I'm sorry , the Oval Office is buzzing, I've got to go in.'  And I said, 'Hold it!  Hold it!  One minute!  Erwin Griswold–dean of ''Har-vard'' Law School–said–on the fiftieth anniversary–the Supreme Court–building a new building–that–she–was–to–women's rights–what–Thurgood Marshall–was–to–civil rights!' "  The next night, at about midnight, Clinton woke Moynihan with a call requesting him to act as Ginsburg's sponsor in the Senate.  The following afternoon, the Senator sat in the front row in the Rose Garden as the President announced that Ginsburg was his nominee.  Nussbaum took Moynihan aside to remind him of his Griswold reference and said "I walked into the Oval Office with that."  Moynihan said later, "And I thought, Well, if I had not kept Nussbaum for twelve seconds..."}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Labaton |first1=Stephen |title=Senators See Easy Approval for Nominee |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/us/senators-see-easy-approval-for-nominee.html |accessdate=3 January 2019 |issue=49364 |work=New York Times |date=June 16, 1993 |page=A22 |quote="With the help of the judge's husband, Martin Ginsburg, a tax professor at Georgetown Law School , Mr. Moynihan managed to track down a 1985 speech by Erwin Griswold, the former Harvard Law School dean and solicitor general, that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court building.

Together with [[William H.
