==Background==
On 20 October 2017, an anonymous [[Reddit]] user hinted at the existence of the Paradise Papers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|url=https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|title=A Reddit user hinted at Paradise Papers 16 days before they leaked|date=6 November 2017|website=Quartz|accessdate=6 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106105209/https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|archive-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> Later that month, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) approached the [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] law firm [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]] with allegations of wrongdoing.

The documents were acquired by the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', which had also obtained the [[Panama Papers]] in 2016.

===Apple===
{{main|Leprechaun economics|Ireland as a tax haven}}
A great deal of the company's [[intangible property]] was exposed around the time of an internal [[Apple Inc.]] reorganization of three [[Ireland|Irish]] subsidiaries. The company's 2015 [[gross domestic product]] showed a 26% increase, and close to $270&nbsp;billion of [[intangible asset]]s suddenly appeared in Ireland as the year began – more than the entire value of all residential property in Ireland. This may indicate that Apple took advantage of a tax incentive known as a capital allowance, which gives Irish companies generous tax breaks for buying intangible property – essentially intellectual property like patents. In other words, Apple (some suggest) transferred them to a subsidiary located in Ireland for the tax incentives, and didn't have to pay any tax on the transaction in Bermuda either, on the value it declared on the property when it sold them to itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Following a 2013 US Senate investigation, which featured testimony by CEO [[Tim Cook]], Ireland announced that henceforth Irish companies would be required to declare [[tax residency]] somewhere in the world. Apple had been paying a lower rate of corporate taxes in Ireland in a so-called sweetheart deal. This attracted the attention of EU regulators as many multinationals were doing the same thing. As the tax break in the Netherlands came to a scheduled end, Apple's law firm, Baker McKenzie, researched island tax havens, asking Appleby officials in numerous jurisdictions to confirm "that an Irish company can conduct management activities ... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction." Two of the subsidiaries moved to [[Jersey]] and took intellectual property with them{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The third is receiving tax breaks in Ireland for buying Apple IP from another Apple subsidiary{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The [[Jersey Financial Services Commission]] (JFSC) issued a statement regarding Apple on 7 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/1596/2017-11-07_jfsc_statement_re_apple.pdf|title=Jersey Financial Services Commission Statement re Apple|publisher=[[Jersey Financial Services Commission|JFSC]]|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319004329/https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/1596/2017-11-07_jfsc_statement_re_apple.pdf|archive-date=19 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The JFSC confirmed that the two Apple subsidiaries referred to by the media are not Jersey-registered companies and their understanding is that Apple funds relating to these entities have not been remitted to or held in the Island.

The JFSC states that it has not seen any of the documentation that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) claims to hold following the Appleby data breach. If the ICIJ possesses data of a criminal or regulatory nature which relates to business activities in Jersey then the JFSC requested that this information is shared with them and, if there is any evidence of regulatory wrongdoing, then they would investigate and take action if appropriate.

The Government of Jersey (States of Jersey) also issued a statement of similar effect on 7 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2017/Pages/ApplebyStatement.aspx|title=Jersey Government Appleby Data Breach Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319164227/https://www.gov.je/News/2017/Pages/ApplebyStatement.aspx|archive-date=19 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

It is of further note that the jurisdiction of Jersey has recently been independently assessed as fully compliant with international regulatory guidelines on tax transparency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/jersey/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-jersey-2017-second-round-9789264283824-en.htm|title=OECD Jersey Report 2017|publisher=OECD|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151326/http://www.oecd.org/countries/jersey/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-jersey-2017-second-round-9789264283824-en.htm|archive-date=19 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The EU, under the leadership of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], threatened to sue Ireland over its tax deals, although Juncker himself had approved similar tax deals in his own country, [[Luxembourg]]. Apple paid all of its taxes in Ireland as required by that country so Ireland is appealing the EU decision. HP, Nike, Microsoft and others use the same tax arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} but Apple is frequently cited as a media example.<ref>[[List of public corporations by market capitalization#2017]]</ref> Irish companies are required to pay taxes in Ireland, but if they convince authorities {{Which|date=February 2018}} that they are "managed and controlled" from abroad, the companies may win an exemption.

As of November 2017, Apple held $252&nbsp;billion offshore.<ref name="Apple">{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers|title=Apple's Offshore Island Hop|author=Simon Bowers|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105235747/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/|archive-date=5 November 2017}}</ref> However, Apple has previously publicly stated that it reinvests post-tax earnings (generated outside the US) into the global economy via investment funds held offshore.

=== Avianca ===
[[Germán Efromovich]], founder of [[Synergy Group]], is linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial [[holding business]] with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama, and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens.

One of the Katanga board members was Glencore major shareholder [[Telis Mistakidis]], a former employee whose [[stock options]] made him a billionaire in the IPO. Glencore, which had effectively taken over Katanga, agreed to vote for the joint venture. The loan document specifically provided that repayment would be owed if agreement was not reached within three months. Gertler and Glencore each have denied wrongdoing.

A separate ICIJ project found that tax auditors in [[Burkina Faso]] accused a Glencore subsidiary of deducting from its taxes "fictitious" payments to other Glencore subsidiaries, and of selling the zinc from its mine (to another Glencore company) in unrefined form to minimize its revenue. Its CEO told shareholders before this that it expected a spike in demand, which did materialize. The mine is owned by Nantou Mining SA, which is owned by Merope Inc, a Bermuda shell company set up by Appleby with directors provided by the firm. Glencore sold Merope in April 2017 but before that it was 100% owned by Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd, which was, according to a document from the Paradise Papers leaks, 100% owned by Glencore Group Funding Ltd of the [[United Arab Emirates]], an entity in turn 100% owned by Swiss firm Glencore International AG, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore plc, registered in [[Jersey]].<ref name="Burk">{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|title=Development Dreams Stand Still While Mining Money Moves Offshore|author=Will Fitzgibbon|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061248/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|archive-date=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Nike ===
Appleby documents detail how Nike boosted its after-tax profits by, among other maneuvers, transferring ownership of its Swoosh [[trademark]] to a Bermudian subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. This transfer allowed the [[subsidiary]] to charge [[royalties]] to its European headquarters in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], effectively converting taxable company [[profit (accounting)|profits]] to an account payable in tax-free Bermuda.<ref name="Nike">{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=How NikeStays One Step Ahead of the Regulators: When One Tax Loophole Closes, Another Opens|author=Simon Bowers|publisher=ICIJ|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011937/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|archive-date=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike's main offices in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Oregon – to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudian company's seal was needed – for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as based in Bermuda.

Dutch law treats income earned by a CV as if it had been earned by the principals, who owe no tax in the Netherlands if they do not reside there. One in six dollars of foreign [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] earned by US multinationals was earned, at least on paper, through a Dutch CV subsidiary. Companies with similar structures include [[Tesla, Inc.]], [[NetApp]] and [[Uber]].<ref name=Nike />
