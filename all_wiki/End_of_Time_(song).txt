"'''End of Time'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé Knowles]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011). It was written by Knowles, [[The-Dream|Terius "The-Dream" Nash]], [[Shea Taylor]] and [[Switch (house DJ)|David "Switch" Taylor]] while its production was handled by Knowles, Nash and Taylor. The song was initially touted to be a follow up to the [[lead single]], "[[Run the World (Girls)]]" (2011). However, "[[Best Thing I Never Had]]" was ultimately chosen as the second single. In February 2012, it was announced through Knowles' website that "End of Time" will be the sixth and final single from ''4'' within International markets. It was sent to promoted to a release date of April 23, 2012 in the UK.

An [[tempo|uptempo]] song, "End of Time" exhibits the influence of late Nigerian music legend [[Fela Kuti]]; its [[bass line]] was inspired by the multi-instrumentalist's work. Also displaying elements of [[Afrobeat]], the song's instrumentation includes [[marching band]] [[drum]]s,  [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[French horn|horns]]. The high energy level provided by its [[instrumentation]] has similarities to several songs by [[Michael Jackson]] from the ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson song)|Off the Wall]]'' era (1979–80). "End of Time" was lauded by music critics, who coined it as one of highlights on ''4'' thanks to Knowles' boldness and its dance [[Beat (music)|beat]] that makes the song a catchy one. Critics also commended the uplifting lyrics and Knowles' confident vocal delivery.{{who?|date=December 2019}}  

Following the release of ''4'', "End of Time" charted at number 62 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and at number 20 on its [[UK R&B Chart|R&B Chart]], based solely on downloads. It also opened at number 26 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart]]. The song peaked at number 13 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] chart. The song was part of Knowles' [[set list]] for her [[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé]], [[Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live]] and [[The Mrs. Carter World Tour]] [[revue]]s; critics generally agreed that the song sounds great when performed live, and showed much appreciation for the choreography.

== Critical reception ==
"End of Time" was lauded by music critics, who appreciated its production, especially the beat; many of them noted it to be the outstanding track on the record.

===Music Video===
A music video was planned for release, but never came to fruition. Choreographer [[Teyana Taylor]] explained backstage at the [[VMA Awards]] that the "dance scene at the very, very end of "[[Fade (Kanye West song)|Fade]]" was something she originally choreographed for End Of Time. "Me and one of my homeboys Matthew Pasterisa actually made that choreography for Beyonce for when 'End of Time' came out," the singer revealed. "She loved it but she wound up not being able to use it because she was pregnant, but back then the world didn’t know. All this time that choreography was just sitting there. And as soon as I was freestyling [for Kanye] it just came out naturally."<ref>http://popcrush.com/teyana-taylor-fade-choreography-beyonce-kanye-west/</ref>
