==History==
In 1916, land from the McAdory family was purchased and a high school was built, opening its doors in 1920. In the early morning hours of Friday April 5, 1929, a fire destroyed most of the school. Its four-room annex was undamaged and classes continued there for the school's 320 students. The first section of a replacement building opened in 1929, the remaining sections in 1931. On Sunday December 18, 1938 another fire destroyed this building. A replacement school in the [[Art-Deco]] style was built as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project. It opened in 1941 and is the building used today.<ref name="MHShist">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060222074313/http://www.jefcoed.com/SCHOOLS/McAdoryHi/about.htm McAdory Middle and High Schools – Historical Overview – By James Walker]</ref> In 2006, a building renovation was started.<ref>[http://www.dadot.com/project/education_k-12/mcadory_high_school.aspx School Redesign, Davis Architects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416020727/http://www.dadot.com/project/education_k-12/mcadory_high_school.aspx |date=2008-04-16 }}</ref>  From 1920 until 1996, the McAdory School campus was K-12, that year the elementary grades were re-located to a new school in Tannehill Valley,<ref>McAdory Elementary School webpage on the website of the Jefferson County School System</ref> a few years later a new school was also constructed for the Middle School although its campus is adjacent to McAdory High School.

The McAdory High School Yellow Jackets football team has a record of 489-390-25 over the team's history which ranks it among the top five winning programs among all schools in Jefferson County.  Their longest played rival is Fairfield High School whom they have met 58 times.  Fairfield leads the series 34-23-1.  Before 1970, Alabama had no football playoff system and teams were often "declared" as a "mythical" State Champion by various newspapers around the state.  In 1953, McAdory (then a 2A high school) posted a very strong team that went 9-1 including two victories in the same season over [[Hueytown High School]] with that second game being the "Dental Clinic Classic" which the Yellow Jackets won by a score of 18-0.  That Yellow Jacket football team scored 179 points and surrendered only 63.  Seven of its players were named to All-Star teams and two of them were selected to play in the All-Star game hosted by the University of Alabama.  The two players were Richard Autry (offensive center) and Clay Walls (quarterback).  The 1953 McAdory squad was "declared" as "State Champions" by both the Birmingham News and the Birmingham Post-Herald newspapers.<ref>AHSFHS.org (Alabama High School Football Historical Society)</ref>  Between 1948-1995 a Jefferson County Championship was awarded in the Dental Clinic Classic played between two of the county's best teams.  McAdory won this game nine times with wins in 1950, 1952, 1953, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1988, 1989, and 1994.<ref>Alabama High School Historical Society</ref>
