'''Red Cloud''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Webster County, Nebraska]], United States.<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The population was 1,020 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].

==History==
The region of present-day Red Cloud was intermittently occupied and used as hunting grounds by the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]] until 1833. In that year, a treaty was signed in which the Pawnees surrendered their lands south of the [[Platte River]]. According to [[George E. Hyde|George Hyde]], it is likely that the Pawnees did not realize that they were thereby giving up their lands, and that they were led to believe that they were only granting the [[Lenape|Delawares]] and other relocated tribes permission to hunt in the area.<ref name=hyde>Hyde, George E. ''Pawnee Indians''. University of Denver Press, 1951.  p. 135.</ref>

In 1870, the area that is now Webster County was opened to [[Homestead Act of 1862|homesteaders]].  In that year, [[Silas Garber]] and other settlers filed claims along Crooked Creek, just east of the present-day city.  In 1871, the town, named after the renowned [[Oglala Lakota]] leader [[Red Cloud]], was voted county seat of the newly formed county.  The city was platted in 1872.<ref>[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/Webster%20County%20Report.pdf "Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey&ndash;Webster County".]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.shtml Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2011-06-10.</ref><ref>[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/red_cloud.htm "Red Cloud 1871&ndash;1971".] [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.shtml Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2011-06-10.</ref>

The author [[Willa Cather]] lived in Red Cloud for several years with her family, starting in 1883 at age nine.  She used the town as inspiration for several in her novels, including Black Hawk in ''[[My √Åntonia]]''.<ref name="Red Cloud - Webster County">[http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/webster/redcloud/ "Red Cloud - Webster County"], ''Nebraska Towns'', University of Nebraska - Lincoln, accessed 10 Aug 2010</ref> In addition to writing about the city Cather also published while living in Red Cloud.
