==Early life, education and career==
Goddard was born and raised in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[Arizona]], the son of Julia E. "Judy" (née Hatch) and [[Samuel Pearson Goddard Jr.]], who served as [[Governor of Arizona]] from 1965 to 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0202goddard0202.html |title=Former Gov.

Returning to Arizona, he received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Arizona State University]] in 1976.<ref name="votesmart" /> His time as a private attorney saw him working in the Arizona Attorney General's office, where he prosecuted white collar crime. Goddard is married and has one son.<ref name="bio">[http://terrygoddard.com/meet-terry Terry Goddard Webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223110655/http://terrygoddard.com/meet-terry |date=2010-12-23 }}</ref>

==Early political career==
Goddard's first serious foray into electoral politics came in 1982, when he led the successful push for members of the [[Phoenix City Council]] to be elected from districts, instead of by a majority of all voters citywide. This allowed minorities from certain parts of Phoenix to be elected and represent their home areas and giving those areas a voice on the council. The next election saw the election of the city's first Latino and African-American to the council in over a decade. The measure is credited with significantly opening up Phoenix city government, and in 1983, Goddard was elected mayor.<ref>[http://phoenix.gov/mayor/historyofmayor.html Phoenix Gallery of Mayors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505074508/http://www.phoenix.gov/mayor/historyofmayor.html |date=2011-05-05 }}</ref> Within a decade, all of the members of the City Council who had been elected at-large, and who had been considered unbeatable under the previous system, were no longer serving on the council. Goddard was re-elected four times, serving through 1990, when he resigned to run for governor.<ref>[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1990-10-03/news/terry-goddard/2/ Phoenix New Times]</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-15/news/mn-1228_1_governor-mayor-resigns Phoenix Mayor Resigns to Run for Governor</ref>  In 1988, he was elected president of the National League of
Cities.<ref>[https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Short-Bio-Terry-Goddard-.pdf]</ref>

In 1990, Goddard sought and won the [[Arizona Democratic Party|Arizona Democratic Party's]] nomination for [[Governor of Arizona]], but was defeated in a runoff by [[Fife Symington]], who, after winning a second term, resigned in 1997 amid charges of bank fraud. Goddard again sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1994, losing the primary to [[Eddie Basha Jr.]]<ref>[http://www.azsos.gov/election/1990/Info/ElectionInformation.htm Arizona 1990 Election Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615233041/http://www.azsos.gov/election/1990/Info/ElectionInformation.htm |date=2011-06-15 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/04/us/arizona-governor-convicted-of-fraud-and-will-step-down.html Arizona Governor Convicted Of Fraud and Will Step Down]</ref>

Goddard served as Arizona State Director for the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from 1995 to 2002<ref name="bio" /> and in 2000, he was elected to the [[Central Arizona Project|Central Arizona Water Conservation District]], which oversees the [[Central Arizona Project]]. In the non-partisan election in which the top five candidates are elected, Goddard came first, with 403,568 votes (19.74%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311973 Central Arizona Water Conservation District</ref>

In 2002, Goddard decided to enter the race for Attorney General of Arizona to succeed fellow Democrat [[Janet Napolitano]], who was running for governor. He was elected that year with a greater margin than Napolitano received for governor, receiving over 50% of the vote; he and a number of other candidates for office that year ran publicly financed campaigns under Arizona's [[Clean Elections]] program.<ref>[http://www.azsos.gov/election/2002/general/ElectionInformation.htm Arizona Election Results 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615233130/http://www.azsos.gov/election/2002/general/ElectionInformation.htm |date=2011-06-15 }}</ref>

Goddard was re-elected to the office of attorney general in 2006 with 60% of the vote. After Napolitano resigned to become [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] in January 2009 and was succeeded by [[Arizona Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Jan Brewer]], Goddard was next in line to succeed Brewer. Although the secretary of state is ordinarily next in line to succeed the governor, new Secretary of State [[Ken Bennett]] had been appointed and was not eligible, so Goddard was next in line to succeed Brewer.<ref>[http://www.azsos.gov/election/2006/General/ElectionInformation.htm Arizona 2006 Election Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730184524/http://www.azsos.gov/election/2006/General/ElectionInformation.htm |date=2008-07-30 }}</ref><ref>Ariz.

{{Main article|2010 Arizona gubernatorial election}}
In 2010, Goddard ran for Governor of Arizona, and was unopposed in the Democratic party primary, going on to challenge incumbent Governor [[Jan Brewer]] in the general election. Earlier that year, in April 2010, Brewer had controversially signed into law [[Arizona SB 1070]], which received national attention for its strict enforcement of immigration laws. Only one debate was held during the general election campaign.<ref>http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/09/jan-brewer-im-done-with-debates.php</ref><ref>http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/article_cfb8fb2a-20a9-59d0-9276-ffaf4067b082.html</ref> Goddard was unsuccessful in his attempt to defeat Brewer, losing by a nearly 12-point margin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azsos.gov/election/2010/General/Canvass2010GE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920230737/http://azsos.gov/election/2010/General/Canvass2010GE.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-20 }}</ref>
