The '''Institute of Culinary Education''' ('''ICE''') is a private for-profit [[culinary school]] in [[New York City]]. ICE is accredited by the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]] (ACCSC),<ref>{{cite web|title=ACCSC|url=http://www.accsc.org/DirectorySearchResults.aspx?SearchRequest=Institute%20of%20culinary%20Education&Locations=&Programs=&Credentials=&Categorys=|work=ACCSC|publisher=ACCSC|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> and offers career training diploma programs in Culinary Arts, Pastry & Baking Arts, Culinary Management and Hospitality Management. The school runs one of the largest program of hands-on recreational cooking classes and wine education courses in the country, with more than 26,000 enthusiasts taking any of the 1,500 classes offered each year.

==History==
ICE traces its roots to 1975, when [[Peter Kump]] opened '''Peter Kump's New York Cooking School''', one of the first culinary schools in New York City. Kump's philosophy was to concentrate on teaching cooking techniques and flavor development at a time when most other cooking schools were only teaching recipes.

In 1983, Kump inaugurated a professional program to train aspiring chefs. A number of his former teachers, including [[James Beard]], [[Simone Beck]], [[Marcella Hazan]] and [[Diana Kennedy]] taught classes. A number of other notable chefs, including [[Julia Child]], James Peterson, [[David Bouley]], and [[Jacques Pépin]], were frequent guest instructors.

When Kump died in 1995, the school was acquired by Rick Smilow, an [[entrepreneur]] with an interest in education and the culinary arts.

After the acquisition, the school’s professional programs expanded, requiring a move to a new location in the Flatiron neighborhood of the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of New York City at 50 W. 23rd Street, where it then expanded twice, in 1999 and 2004, growing to 45,000 square feet over seven floors. In 1999, the older East 92nd Street facility was closed.

In 2001, the school's name was changed to '''The Institute of Culinary Education'''.

In 2015, the school relocated to a brand new, 74,000 square foot facility in Battery Park City that includes such amenities as the nation's first education-focused bean-to-bar chocolate lab, a hydroponic herb and vegetable garden, a culinary technology lab, and a state-of-the-art mixology bar.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.edu/newyork/about-ice/facilities-and-technology|title=Facilities and Technology &#124; About ICE &#124; New York Campus &#124; ICE|website=www.ice.edu}}</ref>
