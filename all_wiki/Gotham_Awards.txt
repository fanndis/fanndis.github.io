The '''Gotham Independent Film Awards''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|θ|əm}}) are American film awards, presented annually to the makers of [[independent film]]s at a ceremony in [[New York City]], the city first [[nicknames of New York City|nicknamed]] "Gotham" by native son [[Washington Irving]], in an issue of ''[[Salmagundi (periodical)|Salmagundi]]'', published on November 11, 1807.<ref name=Sederstrom>{{cite news|author= Sederstrom, Jotham |title=Indie Film's Best to Flock to Navy Yard for Gotham Awards|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2007/11/15/2007-11-15_indie_films_best_to_flock_to_navy_yard_f-2.html|work=[[New York Daily News|Daily News]] | date= November 16, 2007|accessdate= November 16, 2012|quote=The ceremony, which was previously held at [[Chelsea Piers]], [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] and [[Roseland Ballroom]] in [[Manhattan]], grew too big for those venues.

==Scope==
In 2004, the scope of the awards broadened to include the international film scene, when the number of awards presented increased from six awards{{spaced ndash}} given to films and those involved in making them primarily from the northeastern U.S. film community{{spaced ndash}} to nine awards, including in its broader scope films originating in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and international locations as well.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Venue==
Having outgrown its previous locations in the city's [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]], for the first time in its history, the 17th Annual Gotham Awards gala occurred outside of that borough, in the city's [[Brooklyn]] borough at [[Steiner Studios]], in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], on November 27, 2007, and it was "promoted nationally via a partnership with ''[[The New York Times]]'' and locally via broadcast on [[WNYE-TV|WNYE]]".<ref name=Sederstrom/><ref name=IFPpr/><ref name=IMDb17>Database (undated).

From 1991 to 2002, the Tribute Award, also called Career Tribute, was awarded as a Lifetime Achievement Award to one person each year and the individual achievement awards (Filmmaker Award, Writer Award, Actor Award, Below-the-Line Award, Producer/Industry Executive Award and Independent Vision Award) were given out separately. As of the 2003 Gotham Awards, the
IFP replaced all mentioned individual category awards with Career Tributes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gotham Awards Recipients (1991-present) (as of June 17, 2011)|url=http://gotham.ifp.org/support/Gotham_Recipients.pdf|publisher=Gotham Independent Film Awards|accessdate=19 February 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185708/http://gotham.ifp.org/support/Gotham_Recipients.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
