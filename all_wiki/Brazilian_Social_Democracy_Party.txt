The '''Brazilian Social Democracy Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira}}, '''PSDB'''), also known as the '''Brazilian Social Democratic Party''' or the '''Party of Brazilian Social Democracy''',<ref name="MainMenePow">{{citation|first1=Scott|last1=Mainwaring|first2=Rachel|last2=Meneguello|first3=Timothy J.|last3=Power|title=Conservative Parties in Brazil|work=Conservative Parties, the Right, and Democracy in Latin America|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|page=178}}.</ref> is a [[political party]] in [[Brazil]]. As the third largest party in the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], the PSDB was the main opposition party against the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) administrations of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] from 2003 to 2016.

Born together as part of the [[social democratic]] opposition to the [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military dictatorship]] from the late 1970s through the 1980s, the PSDB and the PT have since the mid-1990s been the bitterest of rivals in current [[Politics of Brazil|Brazilian politics]]—both parties prohibit any kind of [[coalition]] or official cooperation with each other at any government levels. Its mascot is a blue and yellow colored [[toucan]], with party members being called ''tucanos'' for this reason. Famous ''tucanos'' include [[Mário Covas]], [[Geraldo Alckmin]], [[Tasso Jereissati]], [[Aécio Neves]], former President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], [[Franco Montoro]], Aloysio Nunes, [[Yeda Crusius]], [[João Doria]] and [[José Serra]].

== History ==
[[File:Eleições PT e PSDB.gif|framed|Presidential elections against the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]]]]
With the imminent collapse of the military dictatorship in the early 1980s, a group of [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[intellectual]]s were mobilized to create a leftist party. Some of them attempted to work with the [[labour movement]] led by [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]], but the group split over ideological grounds. A group of democratic socialists and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] joined the labour movement and founded the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) while the social democrats remained in the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) and would later create the Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Founded on 25 June 1988 by members of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB) linked to the European social democratic movement as an attempt to clarify their ideals, its manifesto preached "democracy as a fundamental value" and "[[social justice]] as an aim to be reached". In its foundation, the party attempted to unite political groups as diverse as [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[Social liberalism|social liberals]], [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]]. The period when the PSDB was created was a very significant moment in the history of Brazilian politics.

On 21 April 1985, the Brazilian people witnessed the death of [[Tancredo Neves]], the last President not elected directly by the people since the beginning of the dictatorial government. With the formation of new parties, including the PSDB, a [[Brazilian Constituent Assembly (1988)|National Constitutional Assembly]] was created and drafted the current democratic constitution in 1988. A high proportion of the first members of the PSDB came from the so-called "historic PMDB", which was and still is a very large party with many internal conflicts. The founders of the PSDB were dissatisfied with the results of the National Constitutional Assembly and decided to create a party to reflect the need for a national political renewal. As their manifesto states, the new party was created "away from the official benefits, but close to the pulsing of the streets" (taken from a speech by party leader [[Franco Montoro]]). Some of the founding members were [[José Serra]], [[Mário Covas]], [[André Franco Montoro]], [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], [[Aécio Neves]] and [[Geraldo Alckmin]].

In a country where two constitutional referendum, held in [[1963 Brazilian constitutional referendum|1963]] and in [[1993 Brazilian constitutional referendum|1993]], have shown a very strong preference for a [[presidential system]] of government as in most countries of the Americas, the PSDB stands almost alone in the preference given in its manifesto to a [[parliament]]arian system of government. However, after the electors rejected parliamentarism in 1993 and even though the PSDB leader Cardoso was elected President the next year, the party did nothing in the last years to further the cause of a parliamentarian system.{{citation needed|reason=This paragraph reads as political opinion; lacks a necessary level of wikipedian objectivity, and perhaps veracity, please consider rewriting.|date=April 2016}}

The PSDB is one of the largest and most significant political parties in Brazil. Its official program says its policies are social democratic and often associated with the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] movement, although the party is also seen as influenced by [[neoliberalism]]. The party's program states that it "reject[s] [[populism]] and [[authoritarianism]], as well as both fundamentalist neoliberalism and obsolete national-statism".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldman|first1=Alberto|title=Declaração Programática do Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira (Documento preliminar para discussão interna)|url=http://americo.usal.es/oir/opal/Documentos/Brasil/Partidos%20Pol%C3%ADticos/PSDB/Declarac_progra2001.pdf|website=Instituto de Iberoamérica|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=18 May 2001}}</ref>

Despite its name, the PSDB is not a member of the [[Socialist International]]<ref>[http://www.socialistinternational.org/maps/english/southa.htm "404 - File or directory not found"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20061014101051/http://www.socialistinternational.org/maps/english/southa.htm# |date=2006-10-14 }}.</ref> which draws together social democratic parties worldwide (the Brazilian member of the Socialist International is the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], PDT). The party has not and has never had the links to [[trade union]] movements that usually characterize social democratic parties and it used to sponsor a central union, the Social-Democracia Sindical (SDS), which has now merged with the Central Autônoma dos Trabalhadores (CAT) and the much more important Central Geral dos Trabalhadores (CGT) into the União Geral dos Trabalhadores (UGT),<ref>[http://www.secefergs.org.br/Ugt/ "União Geral dos Trabalhadores"].</ref> but its impact among the unions has always been quite unimpressive compared to even much smaller parties as the PDT or the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], or to the ''tucanos''{{'}}s own influence in society at large.

=== Recent times ===
A mere six years after its creation, the PSDB won the presidency. It grew faster than any other party in Brazilian history, with an astonishingly good performance in elections at all levels. President Cardoso enjoyed eight years (1994–2002) of political stability in his tenure as President. Accordingly, a good summary of the PSDB's stated program is the following:
* Constant defense of democracy
* The state at a minimally needed size
* Administrative decentralization
* Sustainable economic growth with wealth distribution
* Political reform to make stronger parties with electoral districts accountable representatives as well as aiming to reduce and eliminate corruption

== Controversies ==
=== Ranking of corruption ===
Based on data released by the [[Superior Electoral Court]], the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption released a balance on 4 October 2007 with the parties that include the largest number of parliamentarians quashed by electoral corruption since 2000. The PSDB appeared in third place on the list with 58 cases, behind only the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] and the PMDB.<ref name="O Globo 04-10-2007">{{cite web|title=Desde 2000, 623 políticos foram cassados.

According to analysis released on 8 September 2012, of 317 Brazilian politicians who were barred from running in elections by the [[Ficha Limpa|Clean Record Act]] the PSDB is the party that has the largest number of barred candidates with 56 party members.<ref name="FichaLimpa">{{cite web|author=Talita Abrantes|title=PSDB tem o maior número de barrados pelo Ficha Limpa|work=Exame|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/psdb-tem-o-maior-numero-de-barrados-pelo-ficha-limpa|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

=== ''A Privataria Tucana'' ===
The 2011 book ''[[A Privataria Tucana]]'' written by [[journalist]] [[Amaury Ribeiro Jr.]], a former special reporter of weekly magazine ''[[ISTOÉ]]'' and daily newspaper ''[[O Globo]]'', highlighted documents that show supposed irregularities in privatizations that occurred during the administration of the former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. It contains about 140 pages of photocopied documents trying to demonstrate that President Cardoso's [[Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management|Minister of Planning]] and later [[Ministry of Health (Brazil)|Minister of Health]] [[José Serra]] received [[bribery|kickbacks]] from businessmen that participated in the Brazilian privatization process, held companies in tax shelters and moved millions of dollars between 1993 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/brazilian-political-party-threatens-sue-journalist-over-book|title=Brazilian political party threatens to sue journalist over book|author=Natalia Mazotte|publisher=Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref>

== Ideology ==
Although the PSDB declares itself as a [[Centrism|centrist]] party, some people on the left reject this definition, especially after [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] embraced [[Third Way]] politics as President. According to many critics, the party is seen as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] from its beginnings.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Construção da ideologia neoliberal do PSDB|url=http://www.encontro2010.rj.anpuh.org/resources/anais/8/1276606395_ARQUIVO_AconstrucaodaideologianeoliberalnoPSDB_1988-1994_.pdf|isbn=978-85-60979-08-0|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> [[Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira]], one of the founders of the PSDB, left the party for ideological reasons, claiming "that the party had taken a hard turn to the [[Right-wing politics|right]]".<ref name="PolíticaPartidária">{{cite news|first=Luiz Carlos|last=Bresser Pereira|title=Adeus à política partidária|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/opiniao/fz1805201107.htm}}</ref>

In an article titled "The left-right confusion in the post-[[Berlin Wall]] world", political analyst [[Angelo Segrillo]] says that "most analysts defined PSDB as center-left as of its foundation, after all, it was the Brazilian Social Democratic Party". As he notes, "this story changed after 1994, with the election of PSDB to the presidency. [...] A rhetoric of overcoming classical ideological division [...] was one of the justifications of the grand parliamentary alliance with center and right-wing parties. [...] As such, after the 1994 presidential election, most analysts started defining PSDB as a center party along with PMDB".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Segrillo|first=Angelo|year=2004|title=A confusão esquerda-direita no mundo pós-Muro de Berlim|trans-title=The left-right confusion in the post-Berlin Wall world|journal=Dados|volume=47|pages=615–632|issn=0011-5258|doi=10.1590/S0011-52582004000300006|language=pt|quote=A maioria dos analistas classificava o PSDB na centro-esquerda quando de sua criação.

Workers' Party campaign leader Marco Aurélio Garcia criticized declarations made by PSDB president Sérgio Guerra that PSDB is "the real left". He said that "PSDB is not a right wing party, it is the right wing's party".<ref>[https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,garcia-psdb-nao-e-partido-de-direita-e-da-direita,495794 "Garcia: 'PSDB não é partido de direita, é da direita'"].</ref>

=== Political alignment ===
The PSDB questions the use of what it considers "outdated political labels" such as "left" and "right". To quote a document drafted by [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]'s office in 1990: "If left means to be against the existing social order, and right in favor, then social-democracy is without doubt a left current. [...] A social democrat is before anything someone who has critical sense—who realizes the injustices of society and has no fear to oppose them, even at the risk of being taken as a subversive or a dreamer".

The party did not preach [[nationalisation]] or [[privatisation]] in general ("the consensus is that the state must not be too big or too small, but 'have the size and functions corresponding to the needs of the whole of society'"), although President Cardoso privatized many large public companies, such as [[Companhia Vale do Rio Doce]] and the national telecommunication system. Many political scientists in Brazil believed that the party in its antagonism with the PT made a move to the right in recent years to fulfill a void in the Brazilian political spectrum and to put a certain distance between it and the PT's political views, which also moved more to the right (from the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] or left to the [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]]) in the 1990s in order to be elected.

=== Voter base ===
The main electoral base of the party is the [[State of São Paulo]]. The party triumphed in all but three major elections to executive chairs in new republic in the state. The party also has a stronghold in other regions which reject the PT, like the Espirito Santo, southern and mid-western states. Unlike the PT, the party have less rejection in areas which often votes the PT in national elections, like the North and Northeastern regions and Minas Gerais. Many leaders of the party come from these regions, like Tasso Jereisatti, Aécio Neves, Teotonio Vilela Filho, [[Cassio Cunha Lima]], Sergio Guerra and [[Simão Jatene]]. However, the party has not succeeded in transforming this into results in presidential elections, partly because of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]'s charisma and partly because of internal infighting.

Most of rejection of the party comes from the [[State of Rio de Janeiro]], where the protagonism of the party in the Brazilian centre and [[centre-right]] is often lost to [[PMDB]] and another parties with less national representation, like the [[Brazilian Republican Party]], the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]], [[Progressistas]] and the [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]]. The only victory of the party in Rio happened in 1994, when the state gave the majority of votes for FHC in presidential election and the toucans Artur da Tavola and Marcelo Alencar were elected to the senate and state governorship, respectively. PT is also strong rejected in Rio; However, less than PSDB.

Despite being considered a centre-left party by their own members, media and by the Brazilian right, the PSDB has little or no appeal to the majority of Brazilian left. The majority of support and bases of ''tucanos'' comes from right-wing sectors like conservative Christians, professionals, the [[Middle class|middle]] and [[upper middle class]], farmers, landowners and business owners. Reasons for this support are from the more softcore rhetoric and ideology of the party compared with the PT, the major economic reforms which the party led in the 1990s and the major influence of the Democrats in the party.

This support is not seen with good eyes inside the "old guard" of the party. Many ''tucanos'' often publicly express their discomfort with the party. Even Cardoso, the main member of the party's history, constantly criticises such figures as Colonel Telhada, a former police officer who was elected a deputy in São Paulo with proposals such as reducing the age of defense of infancy, harsher penalties for criminals and appealing to the evangelical churches, of which he is a member; and João Dória Junior, mayor of São Paulo between 2016 and 2018 and governor of the state of São Paulo from 2019. Dória is often accused of [[populism]], [[Demagogue|demagoguery]], [[opportunism]], [[personalism]], self-[[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[market fundamentalism]] and aggressive exploitation of anti-[[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] sentiment within the populace. These antagonisms between the voter base together with the new members who joined the party based on right-wing sentiment of opposition of Workers' Party against the party elite and old members, with more left-liberal, progressive, social democratic and pragmatic views is seen as an important factor to the often internal rifts between ''tucanos''.

In 2017, a group of new, young federal representatives, nicknamed "black heads", in reference to their youth, contrasting with a visible gray or bald head of older and progressive members, began to gain prominence in the party. This wing, made up of members in their 30s or less, shows a strong opposition to the continued support of the party to the government of President [[Michel Temer]] and a far more support to [[economic liberalism]] than the old party members like José Serra and Aloysio Nunes. Black heads now occupies important positions inside the party and with support of the base and social movements like the [[Free Brazil Movement]] have conditions to push the party more to the right-wing of the Brazilian political spectrum

In the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 general election]], the party suffered the greatest defeat in the history as [[Geraldo Alckmin]] got only the 4th position in the presidential election with less than 5% of votes and the party fell to the 10th in number of representatives in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]], with less representatives than the Democrats. The reasons for it was the corruptions scandals of [[Aécio Neves]], the support to the government of [[Michel Temer]] by the party, lack of charisma and wrong strategies of Alckmin in presidential campaign, which choose to attack the [[right-wing populist]] candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] by a progressive viewpoint instead of attacking the traditional rival PT, a continuous domain of old leftist leaders instead of new and more liberal members with more connection with voter base over the party. They support Bolsonaro and his [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|Social Liberal Party]] smashed the voter base of the party. The PSDB went to runoff in three of the four biggest states, namely São Paulo, [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], all of them with more pro-[[free market]] and centre-right views than Alckmin. PSDB triumphed in São Paulo with [[João Doria Junior]], Rio Grande do Sul with [[Eduardo Leite]] and in the agrarian state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] with [[Reinaldo Azambuja]], also a [[centre-right]] candidate.
