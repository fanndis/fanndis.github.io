The group was established by co-founders Laurence Orbach and Robert Morley and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1986.<ref>{{ cite web |url= https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/FC013814/filing-history?page=4 |title=The Quarto Grp Inc. |accessdate= 4 February 2016 }}</ref> Laurence Orbach was Chairman and CEO until November 2012, when he was replaced as Chairman by Tim Chadwick and Marcus Leaver as CEO.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/category/tags/laurence-orbach |title=Orbach removed as Quarto director  |work=The Bookseller |date=8 November 2012 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The Quarto Group was founded by Bob Morley, Michael Jackson and Laurence Orbach in the early 1970s and was finally established as The Quarto Group in 1976.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/69780-quarto-group-comes-of-age.html |title=Quarto Group Comes of Age | first=Jim | last=Milliot | work=[[Publishers Weekly]] | date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> In 1986, Quarto listed on the London stock exchange.<ref>{{ cite web |url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/FC013814/filing-history?page=4 |title=The Quarto Grp Inc. |accessdate= 4 February 2016 }}</ref>

By the late 1990s, Quarto had acquired three new imprints, Rotovision, Book Sales Inc and Rockport Publishers and founded Quarto Children's Books, Quintet and Quintessence that published art, health, lifestyle and children's books. The group expanded further in the US – with the addition of Book Sales, Rockport Publishers, Walter Foster, Creative Publishing International, Motorbooks, and more recently, Cool Springs Press. In the UK, Quarto grew by acquiring Aurum Press and then Jacqui Small in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/jacqui-small-prepares-step-down-630976|title=Quarto's Jacqui Small prepares to step down {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> By the 2000s, The Quarto Group had increased imprints and genres, along with this, a steady increase in its share value. In August 2011, The Quarto Group acquired independent UK book publisher [[Frances Lincoln Publishers|Frances Lincoln]] for £4.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/quarto-snaps-frances-lincoln |title= Quarto Snaps-up Frances Lincoln |first= Graeme |last= Neill |work=The Bookseller |date= 16 August 2011 |accessdate= 4 February 2016}}</ref>

In 2012, Marcus Leaver took over from Laurence Orbach as Group CEO <ref>{{ cite web |url= http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Directors-and-dealings?s=QRT:LSE |title= Directors & Dealings |accessdate= 4 February 2016 }}</ref> and in the same year, the group made a profit of $11.4 million (£7.3 million) on revenue of $181 million (£116 million).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/quarto-looks-cut-debt-after-2012-revenue-fall |title=Quarto Looks to Cut Debt After 2012 revenue fall |first=Joshua |last=Farringdon |work=Bookseller |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> Since then, the group has pursued a stated strategy of growing both organically and through judicious acquisitions, while constantly focusing on operational efficiencies.

With increasing profit, 2013 saw a restructure of The Quarto Group by creating and renaming four distinct businesses:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/quarto-looks-cut-debt-after-2012-revenue-fall |title=Quarto Looks to Cut Debt After 2012 revenue fall |first=Joshua |last=Farringdon |work=Bookseller |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> Quarto Publishing UK, Quarto Publishing US,  Quarto Publishing International Co-editions and Books & Gifts Direct. By 2014, the group had started two new children's imprints: Wide Eyed Editions and words & pictures,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/quarto-predicts-annual-profits-122m |title= Quarto predicts annual profits 122m |first=charlotte |last=Eyre |work=The Bookseller |date= 16 October 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref> and acquired small world creations. This helped the increase in share price by 60% since 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/williams-made-Frances-Lincoln-childrens-publisher |title= Williams made Frances Lincoln publisher|first= charlotte |last=Eyre |work= The Bookseller |date= 4 April 2014 |accessdate= 4 February 2016 }}</ref> In 2015 Quarto acquired Ivy Press and Ivy Kids for £1.5m and continued its expansion <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/quarto-buys-ivy-press-13m |title= Quarto buys Ivy Press for £1.3m|first= Joshua |last=Farringdon|work= The Bookseller |date= 25 February 2015 |accessdate= 4 February 2016 }}</ref> In 2016, Quarto acquired becker&mayer, a co-edition publisher based in Bellevue, WA, for $9.8 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/71139-quarto-buys-becker-meyer.html|title=Quarto Buys Becker&Mayer|website=PublishersWeekly.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>

In 2017, Quarto implemented a new organizational structure, moving away from geographic business divisions and encouraging imprints to be run as independent businesses with creative, commercial and financial oversight from the centre. The group has established a central platform that includes finance, operations, sales, marketing and foreign rights sales and that services all its imprints.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/people/article/73418-quarto-group-restructures-sales-and-marketing.html |title= Quarto Group Restructures Sales and Marketing|first= Jim|last=Millot|work= Publisher's Weekly |date= 24 April 2017 |accessdate= 11 May 2017 }}</ref>

That same year, Quarto sold its last two non-publishing businesses – Books & Gifts Direct (Australia/New Zealand) and Regent Publishing Services (Hong Kong) – and is now solely focused on its core publishing expertise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/quarto-disposes-regent-publishing-services-7m-513511 |title= Quarto disposes of Regent Publishing Services for $7m |first= Lisa|last=Campbell|work= The Bookseller |date= 24 March 2017 |accessdate= 11 May 2017 }}</ref>
