A '''pallbearer''' is one of several participants who help carry the [[Coffin|casket]] at a [[funeral]]. They may wear white gloves in order to prevent damaging the casket and to show respect to the deceased person.

Some traditions distinguish between the roles of pallbearers and casket bearer. The former is a ceremonial position, carrying a tip of the pall or a cord attached to it. The latter do the actual heavy lifting and carrying. There may otherwise be pallbearers only in the symbolic sense if the casket is on an animal or vehicle.

In [[Western cultures]], the pallbearers are usually male family members, close friends, or colleagues of the deceased. A notable exception was the funeral of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], in which reporters, pressed into service to carry the coffin, outnumbered the mourners.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cochran|first1=Mike|title=How I Became Lee Harvey Oswald's Pallbearer|url=http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_24570000/how-i-became-lee-harvey-oswalds-pallbearer|access-date=5 October 2015|agency=Associated Press|work=The Denver Post|date=21 November 2013}}</ref> In some [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], pallbearers are not family members but are staffs of professional [[funeral director|funeral agencies]] who are paid for their services.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lansah |first1=Sulley |title=Ghana's Dancing Pallbearers Bring Funeral Joy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-40716576/ghana-s-dancing-pallbearers-bring-funeral-joy |accessdate=4 April 2020 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>The first duty of a pallbearer is to appear at least thirty minutes before the funeral begins as the funeral director can then provide directions. Secondly, they will also be notified on where they are able to sit during the funeral service and during then the casket would be carried. Thirdly, pallbearers are carrying the casket to one's final resting area after the funeral. Depending on the tradition, pallbearers would either carry the coffin on their shoulders or by their waist.

At times additional pallbearers, known as honorary pallbearers, walk either behind or directly in front of the casket in a showcase of supplemental distinction towards the deceased. This type of pallbearer is most often a gentleman in the profession of the deceased who has achieved significant merit within their position.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/164878/828/Leaf0828.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y|title=Planning and Financing a Funeral|last1=Taylor|first1=Dorthy|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Linda|date=1969|publisher=Texas A&M University, Agricultural Extension Service|language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:MILITARY BURIAL.jpg|thumb|Pallbearers at a dignitary's burial in [[Kenya]]]]
A [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] is a heavy cloth that is draped over a [[coffin]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.holytrinitychicago.org/passages/funeralplanning.pdf|title=Making Funeral Preparations: A Guide for Preparing Death and the Funeral Liturgy|publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|page=2|accessdate=28 August 2014|quote=The coffin may be covered with a pall, recalling the white garment given in Baptism, the robe of Christ's righteousness that clothes us. The pall also reminds us that in death and before God all people are equal, regardless of whether the coffin is simple or elaborate. The white color of the pall is a reminder of Easter and Christ's victory over death.}}</ref> Thus the term ''pallbearer'' is used to signify someone who "bears" the coffin which the pall covers. In roman times, a soldier wore a cape or cloak called the pallium. Fast forwarding to medieval times and pallium was shorten to pall. Christians would use a pall to cover their love ones when burying them.
