([[2019 MTV Video Music Awards|2020]])}}

The [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award]] for '''Best Visual Effects''' is a craft award given to the artist, the artist's manager, and the visual effects artists and/or visual effects company of the music video. From 1984 to 2006, the award's full name was '''Best Special Effects in a Video''', and after a brief removal in 2007, its name was shortened to '''Best Special Effects''' between 2008 and 2011. In [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards|2012]], the category acquired its current name.

The biggest winners are director [[Jim Blashfield]], special effects artist Sean Broughton, executive producer Loris Paillier and production company [[GloriaFX]], with two wins each. In terms of nominations, [[GloriaFX]] and Ingennuity Studios (formerly Ingenuity Engine) are also the biggest nominees in the award's history, each receiving a total of six nominations. Closely following are special effects supervisors David Yardley and Fred Raimondi, as well as the company Pixel Envy (headed by the [[Brothers Strause]]) and [[BUF Compagnie|BUF]], with four nominations apiece.

The performer whose videos have won the most awards is [[Peter Gabriel]], garnering three Moonmen. Meanwhile, [[Missy Elliott]]'s videos have received the most nominations with six.

No performer has won a Moonman in this category for working on their video's effects. However, [[David Byrne]] from [[Talking Heads]] ("[[Burning Down the House]]") and [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] from [[Tool (band)|Tool]] ("[[Prison Sex (song)|Prison Sex]]") have been nominated for doing such work.
