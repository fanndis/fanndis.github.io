In [[heraldry]], '''''or'''''<ref>Here treated as non-standard English (foreign or technical term), therefore italicized.<!--see [[MOS:Ety]]--></ref> ({{IPAc-en|ɔr}}; French for "[[gold]]") is the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of [[Gold (color)|gold]] and, together with ''[[argent]]'' (silver), belongs to the class of light tinctures called "metals", or light colours. In [[engraving]]s and line drawings, it is [[Hatching (heraldic tinctures)|hatched]] using a field of evenly spaced dots.  It is very frequently depicted as [[yellow]], though [[gold leaf]] was used in many [[illuminated manuscript]]s and more extravagant rolls of arms.

The word "gold" is occasionally used in place of "''or''"<!--quotation marks to indicate [[use/mention distinction]]--> in [[blazon]], sometimes to prevent repetition of the word "''or''" in a blazon, or because this substitution was in fashion when the blazon was first written down, or when it is preferred by the [[officer of arms]].<ref>{{cite book|first1= Thomas|last1= Woodcock|author-link1= Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|first2= John Martin|last2= Robinson|authorlink2= John Martin Robinson|title= The Oxford Guide to Heraldry|location= Oxford|year= 1988|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 0-19-211658-4|page=54}}</ref> The use of "gold" for "''or''" (and "silver" for "argent") was a short-lived fashion amongst certain heraldic writers in the mid-20th century who attempted to "demystify" and popularise the subject of heraldry.

"''Or''" is sometimes spelled with a capital letter (e.g. "Gules, a fess Or") so as not to confuse it with the [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] "or".<ref>See [[Wikipedia:Blazon#Capitalization|Blazon: Capitalization]]</ref> However, this incorrect heraldic usage is not met with in standard reference works such as [[Bernard Burke]]'s ''General Armory'', 1884 and [[Debrett's]] ''Peerage''. [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|Fox-Davies]] advocated leaving all tinctures uncapitalized. A correctly stated blazon should eliminate any possible confusion between the tincture ''or'' and the conjunction "or" (which is rare in blazons in any case), certainly for the reader with a basic competence in heraldry. 

Sometimes, the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues, and represent certain elements and precious stones. Even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries,<ref>{{cite book|first1= Thomas|last1= Woodcock|author-link1= Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|first2= John Martin|last2= Robinson|authorlink2= John Martin Robinson|title= The Oxford Guide to Heraldry|location= Oxford|year= 1988|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 0-19-211658-4|page=53}}</ref> it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are, since the information is often sought. Many sources give different meanings, but or is usually said to represent the following:

* Of jewels, the [[topaz]]
* Of heavenly bodies, the [[Sun]]
* Of metals, [[gold]]
* Of virtues, Faith<ref>See the table in Woodcock & Robinson (1988), p. 54, compiled from G.
