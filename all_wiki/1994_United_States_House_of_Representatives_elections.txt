The '''1994 United States House of Representatives elections''' (also known as the [[Republican Revolution]]) were held on November 8, 1994, in the middle of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]'s first term. As a result of a 54-seat swing in membership from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], Republicans gained a majority of seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for the first time since [[1952 United States House of Representatives elections|1952]]. It was also the largest seat gain for the party since [[1946 United States House of Representatives elections|1946]], and the largest for either party since [[1948 United States House of Representatives elections|1948]], and characterized a [[political realignment]] in American politics. 

Democrats had run the House since [[84th United States Congress|1955]], and for all but four years (1947–49 and 1953–55) since [[72nd United States Congress|1931]]. But in 1994 the Republican Party ran against President Clinton's [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|proposed healthcare reform]],<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=The Mediating Effect of Public Opinion on Public Policy: Exploring the Realm of Health Care|author=Chard, R.E.|date=2004|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780791460535|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68Xr4tScEqkC|page=123|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> benefited from impressions of corruption created by the [[Whitewater investigation]], and picked up a majority of voters who had voted for [[Ross Perot]] in 1992. The Republicans argued that Clinton had abandoned the centrist [[New Democrat]] platform he campaigned on during the 1992 Presidential election and reverted to big government solutions. The GOP ran on Newt Gingrich's [[Contract with America]].

The incumbent [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], Democrat [[Tom Foley]], lost reelection in his district, becoming the first sitting Speaker to do so since [[Galusha A. Grow|Galusha Grow]] in [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1863]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Thomas Foley, House Speaker, Dies at 84 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/politics/thomas-foley-former-house-speaker-dies-at-84.html?_r=0}}</ref> Other major upsets included the defeat of powerful long-serving Representatives such as Ways and Means Chairman [[Dan Rostenkowski]] and Judiciary Chairman [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]]. In all, 34 incumbents, all Democrats, were defeated. Republicans also won a number of seats held by retiring Democrats. No Republican incumbents lost reelection, but Democrats won four open Republican-held seats.

The incumbent Republican [[Minority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|Minority whip]], [[Newt Gingrich]], was re-elected in the Republican landslide and became Speaker as the incumbent Republican [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]], [[Robert H. Michel]], retired. The incumbent Democratic [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Leader]], [[Dick Gephardt]], became Minority Leader. The new House leadership, under the Republicans, promised to bring a dozen legislative proposals to a vote in the first 100 days of the session, although the [[United States Senate|Senate]] did not always follow suit. A significant [[political realignment]], the South underwent a drastic transformation. Before the election, House Democrats outnumbered House Republicans in the South. Afterwards, with the Republicans having picked up a total of 19 Southern seats, they were able to outnumber Democrats in the South for the first time since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/11/us/1994-elections-south-rising-gop-tide-overwhelms-democratic-levees-south.html|title=THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE SOUTH; The Rising G.O.P. Tide Overwhelms the Democratic Levees in the South|author=Peter Applebome |date=November 11, 1994| accessdate=September 22, 2014 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The Republicans would go on to remain the majority party of the House for the following 12 years, until the [[2006 United States House elections|2006 elections]].

===Religious right===
Evangelicals were an important group within the electorate and a significant voting block in the Republican party. The national exit poll by Mitofsky International showed 27% of all voters identified themselves as a born-again or evangelical Christians, up from 18% in 1988 and 24% in 1992. Republican House candidates outpolled Democrats among white evangelicals by a massive 52 points, 76% to 24%.<ref>Klinkner 118.</ref>

According to a survey sponsored by the Christian Coalition, 33 percent of the 1994 voters were "religious conservatives," up from 24 percent in 1992 and 18 percent in 1988 (''CQ Weekly Report''), November 19, 1994, p.&nbsp;3364; in the 1994 exit poll, 38 percent identified themselves as "conservatives," compared with 30 percent in 1992.<ref>''Hotline'', November 12, 1994.</ref>
