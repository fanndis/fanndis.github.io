The territories of modern-day Ecuador were once home to a variety of [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Amerindian]] groups that were gradually incorporated into the [[Inca Empire]] during the 15th century. The territory was [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonized by Spain]] during the 16th century, achieving independence in 1820 as part of [[Gran Colombia]], from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830. The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse population, with most of its {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Ecuador}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people being [[mestizo]]s, followed by large minorities of European, [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Native American]], and [[Afro-Ecuadorians|African]] descendants. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population, though 13 Native languages are also recognized, including [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and [[Shuar language|Shuar]].

{{Main|History of Ecuador|Indigenous peoples in Ecuador}}

===Pre-Inca era===
[[File:Tolita mythological figure in feathered costume IMJ B77.0161.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[History of Ecuador#La Tolita culture|Tumaco-La Tolita]] mythological figure in feathered costume. Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]
Various peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500–13,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.

Even though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.

Over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Cañari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilisation developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.

In the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.

===Inca era===
[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]
[[File:Múmia de cabeça - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]
When the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers—[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]—to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.

In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Huáscar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.

Huáscar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Huáscar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Huáscar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Huáscar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.

In 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.

New infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]], endemic to the Europeans, caused high fatalities among the Amerindian population during the first decades of Spanish rule, as they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].

The [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801–1802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203–208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>

After nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan Pío Montúfar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, "''[[Luz de América]]''" ("Light of America"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el día de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Telégrafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On October 9, 1820, the Department of [[Guayaquil]] became the first territory in Ecuador to gain its independence from Spain, and it spawned most of the Ecuadorian coastal provinces, establishing itself as an independent state. Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio José de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Simón Bolívar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.

The 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan José Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[José Joaquín de Olmedo]]; [[José María Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro José de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Ascásubi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jijón]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.

The Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military "Julian Revolution" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[José María Velasco Ibarra]].

===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===
{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute}}
{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}

====President Juan José Flores de jure territorial claims====
Since Ecuador's separation from Colombia on May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan José Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.

Ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.

====Struggle for independence====
During the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Jaén with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[José de San Martín|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.

However, [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio José de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.

====Peruvian occupation of Jaén, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====
In the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Marañon cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Jaén, Peru|Jaén de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.

On July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[José de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[José de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.

The war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Jaén, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.

====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====
[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - División política de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]
[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]

The Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan José Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popayán]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.

Fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogotá and Quito, where the government of Bogotá did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogotá recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de División Territorial de la República de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquetá river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popayán extended its control all the way to the Napo River.

====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====
[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]
When Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.

Peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Marañon-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.

In the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back on October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Muñoz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquetá River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquetá region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.

On July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.

Four years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Marañon Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].

[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]

During the course of the [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.

The 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del Río as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.

The [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del Cóndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January–February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the "''Cain de Latinoamérica''", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>

===Military governments (1972–79)===
In 1972, a "revolutionary and nationalist" military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew the government of Velasco Ibarra. The [[coup d'état]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodríguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodríguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled José María Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Durán Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.

===Return to democracy===
Elections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Roldós Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentración de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.

Roldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[León Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdalá Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, "[[¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]" ("Alfaro Lives, Dammit!"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.

The emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005. Vice President [[Alfredo Palacio]] took his place and remained in office until the presidential [[Ecuadorian general election, 2006|election of 2006]], in which [[Rafael Correa]] gained the presidency.<ref name="Rory Carroll, Latin America correspondent">{{cite news |author=Rory Carroll, Latin America correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/01/ecuador-president-police-attack |title=Ecuador's president attacked by police |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917123916/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/01/ecuador-president-police-attack |archive-date=September 17, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

After being elected in 2017, President Lenin Moreno's government adopted [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] policies: reduction of [[public spending]], [[trade liberalization]], flexibility of the labour code, etc. He also left the left-wing Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas in August 2018. The Productive Development Act enshrines an austerity policy, and reduces the development and redistribution policies of the previous mandate. In the area of taxes, the authorities aim to "encourage the return of investors" by granting amnesty to fraudsters and proposing measures to reduce [[Corporate tax|tax rates for large companies]]. In addition, the government waives the right to tax increases in raw material prices and foreign exchange repatriations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article46999|title=Équateur : Lenín Moreno et le néolibéralisme par surprise}}</ref>

Ecuador rejected the recommendation on decriminalization of libel.<ref name=hrw>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/ecuador|title=Ecuador|publisher=WORLD REPORT 2013, Human Rights Watch|pages=1–3|accessdate=September 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120738/http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/ecuador|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) President Correa has intimidated journalists and subjected them to "public denunciation and retaliatory litigation". The sentences to journalists have been years of imprisonment and millions of dollars of compensation, even though defendants have been pardoned.<ref name=hrw/> Correa has stated he was only seeking a retraction for slanderous statements.<ref>{{cite news|title=Democracy in Ecuador|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/opinion/democracy-in-ecuador.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 5, 2012|access-date=February 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627001406/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/opinion/democracy-in-ecuador.html?_r=0|archive-date=June 27, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

According to HRW, Correa's government has weakened the [[freedom of press]] and [[Judicial independence|independence of the judicial system]]. In Ecuador's current judicial system, judges are selected in a contest of merits, rather than government appointments. However, the process of selection has been criticized as biased and subjective. In particular, the final interview is said to be given "excessive weighing". Judges and prosecutors that have made decisions in favor of Correa in his lawsuits have received permanent posts, while others with better assessment grades have been rejected.<ref name=hrw/><ref name=Reformahasta2015>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131102052404/http://diariodigitalcentro.com/index.php/455-reforma-judicial-en-ecuador-debe-hacerse-hasta-el-2015 Reforma judicial en Ecuador debe hacerse hasta el 2015], diariodigitalcentro.com</ref>

The laws also forbid articles and media messages that could favor or disfavor some political message or candidate. In the first half of 2012, twenty private TV or radio stations were closed down.<ref name=hrw/>

In July 2012, the officials warned the judges that they would be sanctioned and possibly dismissed if they allowed the citizens to appeal to the protection of their constitutional rights against the state.<ref name=hrw/>

People engaging in public protests against environmental and other issues are prosecuted for "terrorism and sabotage", which may lead to an eight-year prison sentence.<ref name=hrw/>

The [[Military of Ecuador|Ecuadorian Armed Forces]] (Fuerzas Armadas de la Republica de Ecuador), consists of the [[Ecuadorian Army|Army]], [[Ecuadorian Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Ecuadorian Navy|Navy]] and have the stated responsibility for the preservation of the integrity and national sovereignty of the national territory.

The military tradition starts in [[Gran Colombia]], where a sizable army was stationed in Ecuador due to border disputes with Peru, which claimed territories under its political control when it was a Spanish vice-royalty. Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Simón Bolívar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan José Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.

Due to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archive-date=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>

Ecuador has a total area of {{convert|283561|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, including the [[Galápagos Islands]]. Of this, {{convert|276841|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|6720|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} water.<ref name="CIA" /> Ecuador is bigger than Uruguay, Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana in [[South America]].

Ecuador lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel north|2°N]] and [[5th parallel south|5°S]],
bounded on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], and has {{convert|2337|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[coastline]]. It has {{convert|2010|km|mi|abbr=on}} of land boundaries, with [[Colombia]] in the north (with a {{convert|590|km|0|abbr=on}} border) and Peru in the east and south (with a {{convert|1420.|km|0|abbr=on}} border). It is the westernmost country that lies on the equator.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dowl|first1=Aimee|title=Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands|date=2010|page=53}}</ref>

The country has four main geographic regions:

* '''La Costa''', or "the coast": The coastal region consists of the provinces to the west of the Andean range&nbsp;– [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]], [[Guayas Province|Guayas]], [[Los Ríos Province|Los Ríos]], [[Manabí Province|Manabí]], [[El Oro Province|El Oro]], and [[Santa Elena Province|Santa Elena]]. It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].
* '''La Sierra''', or "the highlands": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;– [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Cañar Province|Cañar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]]. This land contains most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].
* '''La Amazonía''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or "the east": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&nbsp;– [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumbíos Province|Sucumbíos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumbíos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.
* '''La Región Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Galápagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.

Ecuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region. Its largest city is Guayaquil, in the [[Guayas Province]]. [[Cotopaxi]], just south of Quito, is one of the world's highest active volcanoes. The top of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Mount Chimborazo]] (6,268 m, or 20,560&nbsp;ft, above sea level), Ecuador's tallest mountain, is the most distant point from the center of the Earth on the Earth's surface because of the [[ellipsoid]] shape of the planet.<ref name=CIA>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html |title=Ecuador |work=The World Factbook |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816121210/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html |archive-date=August 16, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Ecuador}}
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map ECU present.svg|thumb|Ecuador map of [[Köppen climate classification]].]]

There is great variety in the climate, largely determined by altitude. It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.

Because of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>

===Hydrology===
{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}
[[File:Canyoning en Baños de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Baños de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]

The Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north–south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.

Almost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.

[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]
In the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.

Major rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61.|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500.|to|1800.|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Galápagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs, although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.

The Ministry of Information and Tourism was created on August 10, 1992, at the beginning of the government of [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], who viewed tourism as a fundamental activity for the economic and social development of the peoples. Faced with the growth of the tourism sector, in June 1994, the decision was taken to separate tourism from information, so that it is exclusively dedicated to promoting and strengthening this activity.

Ecuador is a country with vast natural wealth. The diversity of its four regions has given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna. It has around 1640 kinds of birds. The species of butterflies border the 4,500, the reptiles 345, the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258, among others. Not in vain, Ecuador is considered one of the 17 countries where the planet's highest biodiversity is concentrated, being also the largest country with diversity per km2 in the world. Most of its fauna and flora lives in 26 protected areas by the State. Also, it has a huge culture spectrum. Since 2007, with the government of Rafael Correa, the tourism brand "Ecuador Ama la Vida" has been transformed, with which the nation's tourism promotion would be sold. Focused on considering it as a country friendly and respectful of the nature, natural biodiversity and cultural diversity of the peoples. And for this, means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy.

The country has two cities UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Quito and Cuenca, as well as two natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Galapagos Islands and Sangay National Park in addition to one [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve]], such as the Cajas Massif. Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.

Among the main tourist destinations are:

*Nature attractions: [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Baños de Agua Santa]].
*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its [[Mama Negra]] festival.
*Snowy mountains: [[Antisana]] volcano, [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] volcano, [[Chimborazo]] volcano, [[Cotopaxi]] volcano, [[Illiniza]]s volcanoes.
*Beaches: [[Atacames]], [[Bahía de Caráquez]], Crucita, [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]], [[Montañita]], [[Playas, Ecuador|Playas]], [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]]

The rehabilitation and reopening of the Ecuadorian railroad and use of it as a tourist attraction is one of the recent developments in transportation matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrocarrilesdelecuador.gob.ec/ferrocarriles_en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=202:noticias-novedades-y-actualidad|title=News And Updates|author=David Grijalva|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224446/http://www.ferrocarrilesdelecuador.gob.ec/ferrocarriles_en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=202%3Anoticias-novedades-y-actualidad|archive-date=February 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The roads of Ecuador in recent years have undergone important improvement. The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).

Another major project is developing the road Manta – Tena, the highway Guayaquil – Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba – Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia – San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.

[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.

The [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization. In the case of Guayaquil it involved a new air terminal, once considered the best in South America and the best in Latin America<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airportservicequalityawards.com/best-airport-size-2-5-million-passengers|title=Best airport in the world – 2–5 million passengers - ASQ Awards|accessdate=September 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903133203/http://www.airportservicequalityawards.com/best-airport-size-2-5-million-passengers|archive-date=September 3, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and in Quito where an entire new airport has been built in Tababela and was inaugurated in February 2013, with Canadian assistance. However, the main road leading from Quito city centre to the new airport will only be finished in late 2014, making current travelling from the airport to downtown Quito as long as two hours during rush hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adventurecruisenews.com/2012/03/13/quito-ecuadors-new-airport-to-open-october-2012/|title=Quito, Ecuador's New Airport – Gateway to the Galápagos|accessdate=September 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617035421/http://www.adventurecruisenews.com/2012/03/13/quito-ecuadors-new-airport-to-open-october-2012/|archive-date=June 17, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Quito's old city-centre airport is being turned into parkland, with some light industrial use.

Ecuador's population is ethnically diverse and the {{UN_Population|Year}} estimates put Ecuador's population at {{UN_Population|Ecuador}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The largest ethnic group ({{As of|2010|lc=y}}) is the ''[[Mestizo]]s'', who are Amerindians with mixture or cultural influence from Spanish colonists, and constitute about 71% of the population. The White Ecuadorians ([[White Latin American]]) are a minority accounting for 6.1% of the population of Ecuador and can be found throughout all of Ecuador, primarily around the urban areas. Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]). In addition, there is a small European Jewish ([[Ecuadorian Jews]]) population, which is based mainly in Quito and to a lesser extent in Guayaquil.<ref name=ethn>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html|title=Población del país es joven y mestiza, dice censo del INEC - Data from the national census 2010 (2011-09-02)|author=EL UNIVERSO|work=El Universo|accessdate=September 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924055500/http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html|archive-date=September 24, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] account for 7% of the current population. The mostly rural Montubio population of the coastal provinces of Ecuador, who might be classified as [[Pardo]] account for 7.4% of the population. The [[Afro-Ecuadorian people|Afro-Ecuadorians]] are a minority population (7%) in Ecuador, that includes the [[Mulatto]]s and ''[[zambo]]s'', and are largely based in the Esmeraldas province and to a lesser degree in the predominantly Mestizo provinces of Coastal Ecuador - Guayas and Manabi. In the Highland Andes where a predominantly Mestizo, white and Amerindian population exist, the African presence is almost non-existent except for a small community in the province of Imbabura called Chota Valley.

The Ecuadorian constitution recognizes the "pluri-nationality" of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups. Thus, in addition to ''criollos'', ''mestizos'', and Afro-Ecuadorians, some people belong to the Amerindian nations scattered in a few places in the coast, Quechua Andean villages, and the Amazonian jungle.

===Population genetics===
According to a 2015 [[genealogical DNA test]]ing, the average Ecuadorian is estimated to be 52.96% [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Native American]], 41.77% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], and 5.26% [[Sub-Saharan African]] overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Unravelling the hidden ancestry of American admixed populations|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|pmc=4374169|doi=10.1038/ncomms7596|pmid=25803618|date=March 24, 2015|at=See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4374169/bin/ncomms7596-s2.xlsx Supplementary Data]|last1=Montinaro|first1=F.|last2=Busby|first2=G.

===Population density===
The majority of Ecuadorians live in the central provinces, the Andes mountains, or along the Pacific coast. The tropical forest region to the east of the mountains (El Oriente) remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3% of the population. Birth rate is 2-1 for each death. Marriages are usually from 14 and above using parental consent. About 12.4% of the population is married in the ages 15–19. Divorce rates are moderate.

A prominent [[Asian Latino|East Asian Latino]] community mainly consists of those of Japanese and Chinese descent, whose ancestors arrived as miners, farmhands and fishermen in the late 19th century.<ref name=CIA/>

In the early years of World War II, Ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants, and in 1939, when several South American countries refused to accept 165 Jewish refugees from Germany aboard the ship ''Koenigstein'', Ecuador granted them entry permits.<ref>

In the early 1900's there was immigration from [[Italians]], [[Germans]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[French people|French]], [[Britons]] and [[Greeks]]. In the 1950's the Italians were the third largest national group in terms of numbers of immigrants, since Ecuador like Mexico and the Andean countries did not receive a significant total number of immigrants. It can be noted that, after World War I, people from Liguria, still constituted the majority of the flow, even though they then represented only one third of the total number of immigrants in Ecuador. This situation came from the improvement of the economic situation in Liguria. The classic paradigm of the Italian immigrant today was not that of the small trader from Liguria as it had been before; those who emigrated to Ecuador were professionals and technicians, employees and religious people from South-Central Italy. It must be remembered that many immigrants, a remarkable number of Italians among them, moved to the Ecuadorian port from Peru to escape from the Peruvian war with Chile. The Italian government came to be more interested in the emigration phenomenon in Ecuador because of the necessity of finding an outlet for the large number of immigrants who traditionally went to the United States but who could no longer enter this country because of the new measures that imposed restrictions in the 1920s. Most of these communities and their descendants are located in the [[Guayas Province|Guayas]] region of the country.<ref>

Another perk that draws many expats to Ecuador is its low cost of living. Since everything from gas to groceries costs far less than in North America, it is a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/top-5-reasons-retire-ecuador-n38526 |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113123543/https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/top-5-reasons-retire-ecuador-n38526 |archive-date=January 13, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}
[[File:Cañari people 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Cañari]] children with the typical Andean indigenous clothes]]

Ecuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and, like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.

Since African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.

Ecuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archive-date=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.

Most Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelled Quechua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Awá), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Tsáchila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}
[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]

The music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the "national genre of music". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].

[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the highland region, various dishes of pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig)<ref>(Perez, M. (2019) Eat Like a Local - Ecuador, CZYK Publishing, p. 24, {{ISBN|9798607903664}})</ref> are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and [[Mote (food)|mote]]) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s or patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Literature===
[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]

Early literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF Boceto de Poesía Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184150/http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF |date=May 3, 2011 }}</ref> an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama "Ollantay", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the "Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.

Other early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.

Famous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Simón Bolívar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work "Cumanda" or "Tragedy among Savages" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A. Martinez with ''A la Costa''; Dolores Veintimilla;<ref>Dolores Veintimilla [http://teachers.cmsfq.edu.ec/high/Assignments/D%C3%A9cimo%20Primer%20Grado/AP%20Spanish%20Language%20-%20D%20-%20Diego%20Chauvin/Dolores_Veintimilla_de_Ga%5B1%5D.doc Brief biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425092612/http://teachers.cmsfq.edu.ec/high/Assignments/D%C3%A9cimo%20Primer%20Grado/AP%20Spanish%20Language%20-%20D%20-%20Diego%20Chauvin/Dolores_Veintimilla_de_Ga%5B1%5D.doc |date=April 25, 2012 }}</ref> and others.

Contemporary Ecuadorian writers include the novelist [[Jorge Enrique Adoum]]; the poet [[Jorge Carrera Andrade]]; the essayist [[Benjamín Carrión]]; the poets Medardo Angel Silva, Jorge Carrera Andrade, and [[Luis Costales|Luis Alberto Costales]]; the novelist Enrique Gil Gilbert; the novelist [[Jorge Icaza]] (author of the novel ''Huasipungo'', translated to many languages); the short story author Pablo Palacio; and the novelist Alicia Yanez Cossio.

In spite of Ecuador's considerable mystique, it is rarely featured as a setting in contemporary western literature. One exception is "The Ecuadorian Deception," a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.

===Art===
The best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quiteña]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito. [[Ecuadorian painters]] include [[Eduardo Kingman]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]], and [[Camilo Egas]] from the Indiginist Movement; [[Manuel Rendon]], Jaime Zapata, [[Enrique Tábara]], [[Aníbal Villacís]], [[Theo Constanté]], [[Luis Molinari]], [[Araceli Gilbert]], [[Judith Gutierrez]], [[Felix Arauz]], and [[Estuardo Maldonado]] from the Informalist Movement; [[Teddy Cobeña]] from expressionism and figurative style<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.europapress.es/comunicados/empresas-00908/noticia-comunicadolas-esculturas-teddy-cobena-favoritas-publico-20161219153436.html|title=Las esculturas de Teddy Cobeña las favoritas del público|work=Europa Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083751/http://www.europapress.es/comunicados/empresas-00908/noticia-comunicadolas-esculturas-teddy-cobena-favoritas-publico-20161219153436.html|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/ecuador/diario-expreso/20150505/282346858369317|title=Teddy Cobeña expondrá en Europa y Asia|work=Diario Expreso|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202040506/http://www.pressreader.com/ecuador/diario-expreso/20150505/282346858369317|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/382480-madrid-guarda-arte-manabita/|title=Madrid guarda arte manabita|work=El Diario de Ecuador|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202034803/http://www.eldiario.ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/382480-madrid-guarda-arte-manabita/|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and Luis Burgos Flor with his abstract, futuristic style.

The Minister of Public Health is appointed directly by the President of the Republic. The current minister, or Ecuadorian general surgeon, is [[Margarita Guevara]].

The philosophy of the Ministry of Public Health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population,<ref name=health>{{cite web |url=http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=97&Itemid=55 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005042709/http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=97&Itemid=55 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 5, 2010 |title=Program of the Ministry of Public Health – Ecuador |publisher=Msp.gob.ec |accessdate=February 24, 2012 }}</ref> and its main plan of action lies around communitarian health and preventive medicine.<ref name=health/>

The public healthcare system allows patients to be treated without an appointment in public general hospitals by general practitioners and specialists in the outpatient clinic (''Consulta Externa'') at no cost. This is done in the four basic specialties of pediatric, gynecology, clinic medicine, and surgery.<ref name=healths>{{cite web |url=http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63:mi-hospital-modelo&catid=41 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206032316/http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63:mi-hospital-modelo&catid=41 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 6, 2010 |title=Public health care network – Ministry of Public Health – Ecuador |publisher=Msp.gob.ec |accessdate=February 24, 2012 }}</ref> There are also public hospitals specialized to treat chronic diseases, target a particular group of the population, or provide better treatment in some medical specialties. Some examples in this group are the Gynecologic Hospitals, or Maternities, Children Hospitals, Geriatric Hospitals, and Oncology Institutes.

Although well-equipped general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of provinces, there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and [[canton (country subdivision)|canton]] cities for family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics, gynecology, clinical medicine, and surgery.<ref name=healths/>

Community health care centers (Centros de Salud) are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas. These are day hospitals that provide treatment to patients whose hospitalization is under 24 hours.<ref name=healths/>
The doctors assigned to rural communities, where the Amerindian population can be substantial, have small clinics under their responsibility for the treatment of patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities. The treatment in this case respects the culture of the community.<ref name=healths/>

The public healthcare system should not be confused with the Ecuadorian Social Security healthcare service, which is dedicated to individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers.

Ecuador has 61 universities, many of which still confer [[terminal degree]]s according to the traditional Spanish education system,<ref>Spanish Education System, [[:es:Sistema educativo de España|Spanish Education System (Text in Spanish)]]</ref> honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the Americas: University of San Fulgencio, founded in 1586 by the Augustines; San Gregorio Magno University, founded in 1651 by the Jesuits; and University of Santo Tomás of Aquino, founded in 1681 by the Dominican order.

Among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law schools or engineering, physics, chemistry, or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institutes. These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.

However, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''médico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a "médico" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.

[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]

This new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''décano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.

A debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).

About 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.

The major areas of scientific research in Ecuador have been in the medical fields, tropical and infectious diseases treatments, agricultural engineering, pharmaceutical research, and bioengineering. Being a small country and a consumer of foreign technology, Ecuador has favored research supported by entrepreneurship in information technology. The antivirus program ''Checkprogram'', banking protection system ''MdLock'', and Core Banking Software ''Cobis'' are products of Ecuadorian development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2009/02/01/0217/220/3A2B9B57BD244019AC0760C8CBF7C0EB.html |title=Checkprogram press release |publisher=Eluniverso.com |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119052834/http://www.eluniverso.com/2009/02/01/0217/220/3A2B9B57BD244019AC0760C8CBF7C0EB.html |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of funding but focused around physics, statistics, and partial differential equations in mathematics.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In the case of engineering fields, the majority of scientific production comes from the top three polytechnic institutions: Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral - ''[[Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral|ESPOL]]'', Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas - ''[[ESPE]]'', and Escuela Politécnica Nacional ''[[National Polytechnic School|EPN]]''. The [[Center for Research and Technology Development in Ecuador]] is an autonomous center for research and technology development funded by [[Senecyt]].

EPN is known for research and education in the [[applied science]], [[astronomy]], [[atmospheric physics]], [[engineering]] and [[physical sciences]]. The [[Geophysics]] Institute<ref>[http://www.igepn.edu.ec/ "Instituto Geofísico - EPN - Home"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222210620/http://www.igepn.edu.ec/ |date=February 22, 2011 }}. ''igepn.edu.ec''.</ref> monitors over the country's [[volcanoes]] in the [[Andes Mountains]] of Ecuador and in the [[Galápagos Islands]], all of which is part of the [[Ring of Fire]]. EPN adopted the [[History of European research universities|polytechnic university model]] that stresses laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering.

The oldest observatory in South America is the [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] and is located in Quito, Ecuador. The Quito Astronomical Observatory, which gives the global community of a Virtual Telescope System that is connected via the Internet and allows the world to watch by streaming, is managed by EPN.

Contemporary Ecuadorian scientists who have been recognized by international institutions are Eugenia del Pino (born 1945), the first Ecuadorian to be elected to the United States [[National Academy of Science]], and [[Arturo Villavicencio]], who was part of the working group of the IPCC, which shared the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[Al Gore]] for their dissemination of the effects of climate change.
