'''Isinglass''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|z|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|l|æ|s|,_|-|ɡ|l|ɑː|s}}) is a substance obtained from the dried [[swim bladder]]s of [[fish]]. It is a form of [[collagen]] used mainly for the [[Clarification (wine)|clarification]] or fining of some [[beer]] and [[wine]]. It can also be cooked into a paste for specialised gluing purposes.

The English word origin is from the obsolete Dutch ''huizenblaas'' – ''huizen'' is a kind of [[sturgeon]], and  ''blaas'' is a bladder,<ref>(Chambers 20th century dictionary)</ref> or German ''hausenblase'', meaning essentially the same.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=76|year=1855|issue=6|pages=66}}</ref>

Although originally made exclusively from sturgeon, especially [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]], in 1795 an invention by [[William Murdoch]] facilitated a cheap substitute using [[cod]]. This was extensively used in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in place of [[Russia]]n isinglass, and in the US hake was important. In modern British brewing all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from a limited range of tropical fish.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baxter ED, Cooper D, Fisher GM, Muller RE |title=Analysis of Isinglass Residues in Beer |journal=Journal of the Institute Brewing |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=130–134 |doi= 10.1002/j.2050-0416.2007.tb00268.x }}</ref> The bladders, once removed from the fish, processed, and dried, are formed into various shapes for use.

{{See also|Finings}}
Before the inexpensive production of [[gelatin]] and other competing products, isinglass was used in confectionery and desserts such as fruit jelly and ''[[blancmange]]''.

Isinglass [[finings]] are widely used as a processing aid in the British brewing industry to accelerate the fining, or clarification, of beer. It is used particularly in the production of cask-conditioned beers, although a few [[cask ale]]s are available which are not fined using isinglass. The finings [[flocculation|flocculate]] the live [[yeast]] in the beer into a jelly-like mass, which settles to the bottom of the cask. Left undisturbed, beer will clear naturally; the use of isinglass finings accelerates the process. Isinglass is sometimes used with an auxiliary fining, which further accelerates the process of sedimentation.

Non-cask beers that are destined for [[keg]]s, [[Beverage can|can]]s, or [[bottle]]s are often [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] and [[filtration|filtered]]. The yeast in these beers tends to settle to the bottom of the storage tank naturally, so the sediment from these beers can often be filtered without using isinglass.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, some breweries still use isinglass finings for non-cask beers, especially when attempting to repair bad batches.

Although very little isinglass remains in the beer when it is drunk, many [[vegetarian]]s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barnivore.com/ |title=Is your booze vegan? |publisher=barnivore.com |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> consider beers that are processed with these finings (such as most [[Cask ale|cask-conditioned ales]] in the UK<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000777.html |title=Gingering up the real ale range |date=23 July 1994 |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>) to be unsuitable for [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]]s (although acceptable for [[pescetarian]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/29/1098992287581.html |title=Dyed Smarties make vegetarians see red |date=29 October 2004 |author= |publisher=The Age |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> According to global data in 2018, along with low-calorie beer and gluten-free beer, beers that are acceptable for these strict vegetarians are expected to grow in demand in the coming years. The demand increase is attributed to [[millennials|millennial]] consumers, and some companies have introduced vegetarian friendly options or done away with isinglass use.<ref>{{cite web |author=Rachel Arthur |url= https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2018/05/09/Low-calorie-vegan-and-gluten-free-beers-win-favor-with-millennial-consumers |title=Low calorie, vegan and gluten-free beers win favor with millennial consumers |date=9 May 2018 |website=Beverage daily.com}}</ref> A beer-fining agent that is suitable for vegetarians is [[Chondrus crispus|Irish moss]], a type of [[red algae]] containing the polymer chemical [[carrageenan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/guinness---may-contain-fish-476494 |title=Guinness - 'May Contain Fish' |date=21 May 2007 |author=Kate Jackson, Sara Wallis |work=Daily Mirror |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> However, carrageenan-based products (used in both the boiling process and after [[fermentation (beer)|fermentation]]) primarily reduce hazes caused by [[protein]]s, but isinglass is used at the end of the brewing process, after fermentation, to remove [[yeast]]. Since the two fining agents act differently (on different haze-forming particles), they are not interchangeable, and some beers use both.

Isinglass finings are also used in the production of [[kosher wine]]s, although for reasons of [[kashrut]], they are not derived from the [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga sturgeon]], because this fish is not kosher.<ref name="Noda" /> Whether the use of a nonkosher isinglass renders a beverage nonkosher is a matter of debate in Jewish law. Rabbi [[Yehezkel Landau]], in ''Noda B'Yehuda'', first edition, Yore Deah 26, for example, permits such beverages.<ref name="Noda">{{cite web |url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1497&pgnum=73 |script-title=he:נודע ביהודה מהדורה קמא, יורה דעה, כ"ו |publisher=The Society for Preservation of Hebrew Books |language=Hebrew |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref> This is the position followed by many kashrut-observant Jews today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Egg preservative ==
Isinglass was used as a preservative in Britain in the 1940s before and during World War II. Isinglass from tins was dissolved into water, typically in a bucket. The resulting solution acted as an effective preservative for fresh eggs submerged in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cooksinfo.com/preserving-eggs|title=Preserving Eggs|work=CooksInfo.com|accessdate=25 May 2016}}</ref>

== Parchment and painting conservation ==
Isinglass is also used to help repair [[parchment]] and damage to paintings on canvas. Pieces of the best Russian isinglass are soaked overnight to soften and swell the dried material. Next, it is cooked slowly in a [[double boiler]] at 45&nbsp;°C while being stirred. A small amount of [[gum tragacanth]] dissolved in water is added to the strained isinglass solution to act as an [[emulsifier]].

When repairing paint that is flaking from parchment, isinglass can be applied directly to an area which has been soaked with a small amount of [[ethanol]]. It is typically applied as a very tiny drop that is then guided, with the help of a [[binocular microscope]], under the edges of flaking paint.

It can also be used to coat tissue or [[goldbeater's skin]]. On paintings this can be used as a temporary backing to either canvas patches or filler until dried. Here, isinglass is similar to parchment [[Sizing|size]] and other forms of gelatin, but it is unique in that as a dried film the [[adhesive]] can be reactivated with moisture. For this use, the isinglass is cooked with a few drops of [[glycerin]] or [[honey]].
This adhesive is advantageous in situations where minimal use of water is desired for the parchment as the isinglass can be reactivated with an ethanol-water mixture. It also has a greater adhesive strength than many other adhesives used for parchment repair.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Quandt |first=Abigail B. |date=1996 |title=Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts |publisher=The American Institute for Conservation |journal= The Book and Paper Group Annual |s2cid=190456099 |s2cid-access=free |url= https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/50a8/0ab2039432d9d5326c39ae52f8419142ced2.pdf?_ga=2.132664462.1265083044.1595358032-575350536.1593756367 |access-date=2020-07-21}}</ref>
