'''Marion Crawford''', [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (5 June 1909 – 11 February 1988) was a Scottish educator and [[governess]] to [[Princess Margaret]] and Princess Elizabeth (the future [[Queen Elizabeth II]]), who called her '''Crawfie'''. Crawford was the named author of the book ''[[The Little Princesses]]'', which told the story of her time with the royal family.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Little Princesses: The Story Of The Queen's Childhood By Her Nanny Crawfie|first=Marion|last=Crawford|date=3 July 2003|publisher=Orion|id={{ASIN|0752849743|country=uk}}}}</ref> After the book was published in 1950,<ref>Originally published in the UK by Cassell & Co Ltd and in the US by Harcourt, Brace and Company.

The current US title is erroneous; Crawford is quite clear that she was never the "nanny" for the princesses (a position held by a woman named Clara Knight, called "Alla"), but was instead their ''governess'', responsible for their education outside the nursery.</ref> Crawford was socially ostracised and left [[Nottingham Cottage]], her [[grace and favour]] house, which had been granted to her for life. Neither the Queen nor any other member of the Royal Family ever spoke to her again.<ref name=bond>{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Jennie|title=The Little Princesses|url=http://us.macmillan.com/thelittleprincesses/MarionCrawford|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|accessdate=8 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227092834/http://us.macmillan.com/thelittleprincesses/MarionCrawford|archive-date=27 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Early life and royal governess==
Crawford was born, the daughter of a mechanical engineer's clerk, at [[Gatehead, East Ayrshire]], on 5 June 1909.<ref name=Scotsman>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/princess-diaries-1-1101446|title=Princess diaries|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="drecord00">{{cite news|last=Spavin|first=Vicky|title=Was Crawfie victim of royal conspiracy?|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Was+Crawfie+victim+of+royal+conspiracy%3F%3B+DUPED%3A+SCOTS+NANNY'S+AND...-a062955649|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Daily Record|date=24 June 2000}}</ref> She was raised in [[Dunfermline]], [[Fife]] and taught at Edinburgh's [[Moray House Institute]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ewan |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Pipes |first2=Rose |last3=Rendall |first3=Jane |last4=Reynolds |first4=Siân |title=The new biographical dictionary of Scottish women |date=2018 |isbn=978-1-4744-3628-1 |pages=99–100}}</ref> While studying to become a child psychologist, she took a summer job as the governess for [[Edward Bruce, 10th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin's]] children. This led her to take a role in the household of the Duke and Duchess of York (later known as [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]), as the Duchess was a distant relative of Lord Elgin. After one year the arrangement was made permanent.

Crawford became one of the governesses of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret]]. Following the abdication of [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936, the Duke of York ascended the throne as King George VI, and Elizabeth became the [[heir presumptive]]. Crawford remained in service to the King and Queen, and did not retire until Princess Elizabeth's marriage in 1947, Crawford herself having married two months earlier. Crawford had already delayed her own marriage for 16 years so as not to, as she saw it, abandon the King and Queen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/261992/The-forgotten-royal-nanny|title=The forgotten royal nanny|first=Ian|last=Loyd|date=30 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>

==Retirement and authorship==
Upon her retirement in 1948, Crawford was given [[Nottingham Cottage]] in the grounds of [[Kensington Palace]], as a [[grace and favour]] home. [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], the princess' grandmother, also provided it with antique furniture and flower prints as a mark of her appreciation.<ref name="Bradford">{{cite book|author=[[Sarah Bradford]]|title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Her Majesty the Queen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=--xTWYmw5wQC|date=28 Feb 2002|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-0-141-93333-7|page=192}}</ref>

After their wedding, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh conducted an overseas tour, visiting Canada and the United States of America. Shortly afterwards, Bruce and Beatrice Gould, editors of the large circulation American magazine ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', contacted [[Buckingham Palace]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to seek stories for publication across the Atlantic. Although the approach was refused by the Palace, the British government proved keen on the idea and suggested Marion Crawford, as the recently retired governess of the princesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/25/monarchy.vanessathorpe|title=Queen Mother was 'ruthless' to royal nanny|first1=Vanessa|last1=Thorpe|first2=Arts|last2=Correspondent|date=24 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

In April 1949, having heard of the offer, Queen Elizabeth wrote to Crawford, saying: "I do feel, most definitely, that you should not write and sign articles about the children, as people in positions of confidence with us must be utterly oyster. If you, the moment you finished teaching Margaret, started writing about her and Lilibet, well, we should never feel confidence in anyone again." However, the Queen did give a carefully qualified approval for her to anonymously provide some assistance, writing: "Mr Morrah (the man chosen to write the articles), who I saw the other day, seemed to think that you could help him with his articles and get paid from America. This would be quite all right as long as your name did not come into it. Nevertheless, I do feel most strongly that you must resist the allure of American money and persistent editors and say No No No to offers of dollars for articles about something as private and as precious as our family."<ref name="drecord00" />

However, the contract with the Goulds stipulated: "You will further consider publication of the articles without Her Majesty's consent (possibly with only the consent of Princess Elizabeth, or no consent) and under your own name, on terms to be arranged."<ref name="drecord00"/>

In October 1949, [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Lady Astor]] sent a copy of the manuscript from the Goulds to Queen Elizabeth for her approval. The Queen was deeply distressed, finding it shockingly frank, especially Crawford's revelations of the King's moods and the Queen's chilly relationship with [[Wallis Simpson]]. She replied to Lady Astor saying: "The governess has gone off her head", and had her private secretary send a further letter to Lady Astor. This contained the Queen's annotations on the manuscript with the request that passages of particular concern be removed. The Goulds were taken aback as they considered the account sympathetic, but they kept the response from Crawford.<ref name="Bradford"/> The first intimation Crawford had that something was wrong was when she did not receive a Christmas card that year from the Palace.<ref name="drecord00"/>

Crawford's unauthorised work was published in ''[[Woman's Own]]'' in the UK and in the ''Ladies' Home Journal'' in the United States, becoming a sensation on both sides of the Atlantic. A book, ''The Little Princesses'', also sold exceptionally well. Later she wrote stories about [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She also put her name to ''Woman's Own's'' "Crawfie's Column", a social diary written by journalists several weeks in advance.

As the first servant to cash in on the private lives of the royals, Crawford was ostracised by the royal family,<ref>{{cite news|last=Loyd|first=Ian|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/261992/The-forgotten-royal-nanny|title=The forgotten royal nanny |newspaper=Daily Express|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Vanessa Thorpe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/25/monarchy.vanessathorpe|title=Queen Mother was 'ruthless' to royal nanny |newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 June 2000|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> and they never spoke to her again.<ref name="drecord00" />

==Later life and death==
Courtiers believed that Crawford was deeply under the influence of her husband George Buthlay whom she married after her retirement, and that he pressured her to capitalise on her royal connections, as he himself did. Buthlay boasted of it in his business transactions, and had her ask the royal family to change their bank account to Drummonds, the bank for which he worked.<ref name="Bradford" />

Crawford's writing career came to a crashing halt when the column to which her name was attached was exposed as a fraud. It carried details of a [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony and the [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]] races, when in fact they had been cancelled that year because of a strike. As the stories were written in advance, it was too late to stop their publication.

Crawford retired to [[Aberdeen]], buying a house {{convert|200|yd|m}} from the road to Balmoral. Although the royal family regularly drove past her front door on their way to [[Balmoral Castle]], they never visited. When her husband died in 1977, she descended into depression and attempted suicide, leaving a note saying: "The world has passed me by and I can't bear those I love to pass me by on the road."<ref name="drecord00" />

Crawford died at Hawkhill House (a nursing home in Aberdeen) on 11 February 1988. Neither the Queen, the Queen Mother nor Princess Margaret sent a wreath to her funeral.<ref name=drecord00/>

Her story was featured in a 2000 [[Channel 4]] documentary ''The Nanny Who Wouldn't Keep Mum''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thorpe |first1=Vanessa |last2=Correspondent |first2=Arts |title=Queen Mother was 'ruthless' to royal nanny |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/25/monarchy.vanessathorpe |website=The Observer |accessdate=2 October 2019 |date=24 June 2000}}</ref>
