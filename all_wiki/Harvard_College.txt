==History==
{{Main|History of Harvard University}}
[[File:View of the ancient buildings belonging to Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass (NYPL b12349145-422857).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Harvard College in Colonial times]]

The school came into existence in 1636 by vote of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]—though without a single building, instructor, or student. In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship {{ship||John of London|ship|2}}.<ref name="FirstPrintingPress">{{cite web|title=The instrument behind New England’s first literary flowering|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/harvard’s-first-impressions/|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref><ref name="UHullMHSC">{{cite web|title=Rowley and Ezekiel Rogers, The First North American Printing Press|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/mhsc/FarHorizons/Documents/EzekielRogers.pdf|publisher=Maritime Historical Studies Centre, University of Hull|accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref>
Three years later, the college was renamed in honor of deceased [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] minister [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] (1607–1638) who had bequeathed to the school his entire library and half of his monetary estate.

Harvard's first instructor was schoolmaster [[Nathaniel Eaton]] (1610–1674); in 1639, he also became its first instructor to be dismissed, for overstrict discipline.<ref name="Samuel Eliot Morison 1986">Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636–1936'' (1986)</ref>
The school's first students were graduated in 1642. In 1665, [[Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck]] (c. 1643–1666) "from the [[Wampanoag]] … did graduate from Harvard, the first Indian to do so in the colonial period."<ref>Monaghan, E. J., 2005, p.&nbsp;55, 59</ref><!--this seems awkward here but I don't know where else to put it, and I don't think it should be dropped-->

The colleges of England's [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities are communities within the larger university, each an association of scholars sharing room and board. Harvard's founders may have envisioned it as the first in a series of sibling colleges on the English model which would eventually constitute a university—though no further colleges materialized in colonial times. The [[Indian College]] was active from 1640 to no later than 1693, but it was a minor addition not operated in federation with Harvard according to the English model. Harvard began granting higher degrees in the late eighteenth century, and it was increasingly styled Harvard University, even as Harvard College was increasingly thought of as the university's undergraduate division in particular.{{Fix|text=citations needed throughout}}

Currently, Harvard College is responsible for undergraduate admissions, advising, housing, student life, and athletics—generally all undergraduate matters except instruction, which is the purview of the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. The body known as the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]] retains its traditional name despite having governance of the entire University. [[Radcliffe College]], established in 1879, originally paid Harvard faculty to repeat their lectures for women.<ref>{{cite book |first=Sally |last=Schwager |chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe |title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History |editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich|location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2004 |isbn=1403960984 |pages=87–115}}</ref>
Since the 1970s, Harvard has been responsible for undergraduate matters for women, though women's Harvard diplomas were countersigned by the President of Radcliffe until a final merger in 1999.<ref>{{cite report |title=Radcliffe Enters Historic Merger With Harvard |work=The Harvard Crimson|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/21/radcliffe-enters-historic-merger-with-harvard |accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref>

Admission is based on academic prowess, extracurricular activities, and personal qualities. For the undergraduate class of 2023, Harvard had 43,330 applicants, accepting 2,009 (4.6%) and enrolling 1,649.
The middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores of enrolled freshmen was 710–770 for reading and writing and 750–800 for math, while the middle 50% range of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] composite score was 33–35.

Families with incomes below $65,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, while families earning up to $150,000 pay no more than 10% of their annual incomes.
Financial aid is solely based on need; no merit or athletic scholarships are offered.<ref name="Costs and Tuition">{{cite web|url=https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/how-aid-works|title=How Aid Works|accessdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>

==Academics==

The four-year, full-time undergraduate program has a [[liberal arts education|liberal arts and sciences]] focus.<ref name="Carnegie" /><ref name = "liberal"/>
To graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/bachelor-arts-and-bachelor-science-degrees|title=The Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science Degrees|publisher=Harvard College|accessdate=December 8, 2019}}</ref>

Midway through the second year, most undergraduates join one of fifty [[academic major]]s; many also declare a [[academic minor|minor]] (secondary field). Joint majors (combining the requirements of two majors) and special majors (of the student's own design) are also possible.<ref name = liberal>{{cite web|url=https://college.harvard.edu/academics/liberal-arts-sciences|title=Liberal Arts & Sciences|publisher=Harvard College|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref>
Most majors lead to the ''Artium Baccalaureus'' (AB). some award the ''Scientiae Baccalaureus'' (SB). There are also dual degree programs permitting students to earn both a Harvard AB and a Master of Music (MM) from either the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] or the [[Berklee College of Music]] over five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://college.harvard.edu/academics/liberal-arts-sciences/dual-degree-music-programs|title=Dual Degree Music Programs|publisher=Harvard College|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref>
In most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k69286&pageid=icb.page343095|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20101205233358/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k69286&pageid=icb.page343095|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 5, 2010|title=Academic Information: The Concentration Requirement|work=Handbook for Students|publisher=Harvard College|accessdate=August 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

and fulfill foreign language, expository writing, quantitative reasoning, and other distribution requirements.<ref name = "req"/>
Exposure to a range of intellectual areas in parallel with pursuit of a chosen major in depth, fulfills the injunction of Harvard past-president [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] that liberal education should produce "men who know a little of everything and something well."{{refn|{{cite book|first=Harry R.|last=Lewis|title=Excellence Without a Soul: Does Liberal Education Have a Future?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vnSP2RMjMgC&pg=PA48|year=2007 |publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586485375|page=48}}}}

===House system===<!-- This section is linked from [[Harvard University]] and articles in individual houses-->
[[File:HarvardYard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|alt=grass under trees with some buildings in the background|Freshman dormitories in [[Harvard Yard]]]]

Nearly all undergraduates live on campus, for the first year in dormitories in or near [[Harvard Yard]] and later in the upperclass houses—administrative subdivisions of the college as well as living quarters, providing a sense of community in what might otherwise be a socially incohesive and administratively daunting university environment. Each house is presided over by two faculty deans, while its [[Allston Burr Resident Dean]]—usually a junior faculty member—supervises undergraduates' day-to-day academic and disciplinary well-being.

The faculty deans and resident dean are assisted by other members of the Senior [[Common Room (university)#United States|Common Room]]—select graduate students (tutors), faculty, and university officials brought into voluntary association with each house. The faculty deans and resident dean reside in the house, as do resident tutors. Terms like tutor, Senior Common Room, and Junior Common Room reflect a debt to the [[residential college]] systems at Oxford and Cambridge from which Harvard's system took inspiration.<ref name="Harvard College ResLife 2008">{{cite web| author = Harvard College Office of Residential Life| title = History of the House System| year = 2008| url = http://www.orl.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k11447&tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup17718| accessdate = 2008-04-20}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The houses were created by President Lowell in the 1930s to combat what he saw as pernicious social stratification engendered by the private, off-campus living arrangements of many undergraduates at that time. Lowell's solution was to provide every man—Harvard was male-only at the time—with on-campus accommodations throughout his time at the college; Lowell also saw great benefits in other features of the house system, such as the relaxed discussions—academic or otherwise—which he hoped would take place among undergraduates and members of the Senior Common Room over meals in each house's dining hall.<ref>

[[File:Lowell House belltower.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Lowell House]]]]

How students come to live in particular houses has changed greatly over time. Under the original "draft" system, masters (now faculty deans) negotiated privately over the assignment of students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, each student ranked the houses according to personal preference, with a lottery resolving the oversubscription of more popular houses. Today, groups of one to eight freshmen form a block which is then assigned, essentially at random, to an upperclass house.

A total of nine "River Houses" are located south of Harvard Yard, near the [[Charles River]]: [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams]], [[Dunster House|Dunster]], [[Eliot House|Eliot]], [[Kirkland House|Kirkland]], [[Leverett House|Leverett]], [[Lowell House|Lowell]], [[Mather House (Harvard University)|Mather]], [[Quincy House (Harvard)|Quincy]], and [[Winthrop House|Winthrop]]. Their construction was financed largely by a 1928&nbsp;gift from [[Yale]] alumnus [[Edward Harkness]], who, frustrated in his attempts to initiate a similar project at his alma mater, eventually offered $11&nbsp;million to Harvard.{{efn|

Harkness to defray the expenses of constructing the first Harvard houses."</ref>
Harkness' gift was anonymous, at least at first. "I have forgotten the gentleman's name," Harvard's President Lowell told the faculty in making the initial announcement.

but the land on which they were built had been assembled decades before. After graduating from Harvard in 1895, [[Edward W.

The three "[[Radcliffe Quadrangle (Harvard)|Quad Houses]]" enjoy a residential setting half a mile northwest of Harvard Yard. These were built by [[Radcliffe College]] and housed [[Radcliffe College]] students until the Harvard and Radcliffe residential systems merged in 1977.<ref>Sofen, Adam A.

They are [[Cabot House|Cabot]], [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier]], and [[Pforzheimer House]]. A thirteenth house, [[Dudley House (Harvard College)|Dudley House]], is nonresidential but fulfills, for some graduate students and the (very few) undergraduates living off campus, the administrative and social functions provided to on-campus residents by the other twelve houses. Harvard's residential houses are paired with Yale's residential colleges in [[Harvard–Yale sister colleges|sister relationships]].

=== Student government ===
{{Main|Harvard Undergraduate Council}}
The Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC) is the 51-member student government of Harvard College. The student body at large elects the UC's president and vice president, while the twelve upperclass houses and four freshman neighborhoods each sends three representatives. (The [[Dudley House (Harvard College)|Dudley Cooperative]] sends one representative.) The UC operates several committees on issues pertaining to undergraduates and allocates resources to student organizations.

Harvard's athletic rivalry with [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale]] is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual [[American football|football]] meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply "[[Harvard–Yale football rivalry|The Game]]." While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the best as it was a century ago during football's early days (it won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1920), both Harvard and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries, [[Walter Camp]], former captain of the Yale football team, suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface, so other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html|title=History of American Football|publisher=Newsdial.com|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, pp. 127–128</ref>

[[File:Harvard stadium 2009h.JPG|thumb|left|[[Harvard Stadium]], home of [[Harvard Crimson]] and the [[Boston Cannons]]]]

Even older than Harvard{{ndash}}Yale football rivalry, the Harvard–Yale Regatta is held each June on the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in [[rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Other sports in which Harvard teams are particularly strong are [[Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], and men's and women's [[fencing]]. Harvard's men's ice hockey team won the school's first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989, and Harvard also won the [[Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships]] in 2003. Harvard was the first Ivy League school to win an NCAA Championship in a women's sport when its women's lacrosse team won in 1990.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://harvardmagazine.com/2015/06/25-year-anniversary-womens-lacrosse-national-championship|title=Teammates for Life|magazine=Harvard Magazine|date=June 5, 2015|accessdate=December 15, 2019}}</ref>

The school color is [[crimson]], which is also the name of Harvard's sports teams and the student newspaper, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to [[magenta]]) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when [[Charles William Eliot]], a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869–1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.{{refn|https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/4/11/harvard-explained-why-is-crimson-harvards/}}

==== Fight songs ====
[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|right|Harvard men's eight crew at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004. Originating in 1852, the [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]] is the oldest intercollegiate athletic rivalry in the United States. Also well known is the [[Harvard–Yale football rivalry]].]]

Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are "[[Ten Thousand Men of Harvard]]" and "[[Harvardiana]]." While "[[Fair Harvard]]" is actually the [[alma mater (song)|alma mater]], "Ten Thousand Men" is better known outside the university. The [[Harvard University Band]] performs these fight songs and other cheers at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus [[Tom Lehrer]] in his song "[[Fight Fiercely, Harvard]]," which he composed while an undergraduate.

====Athletics history====
By the late 19th century, critics of intercollegiate athletics, including Harvard president [[Charles William Eliot]], believed that sports had become over-commercialized and took students away from their studies. They called for limitations on all sports.
This opposition prompted Harvard's athletic committee to target "minor" sports—basketball and hockey—for reform in order to deflect attention from the major sports: football, baseball, track, and crew. The committee made it difficult for the basketball team to operate by denying financial assistance and limiting the number of overnight away games in which the team could participate.

=== Student organizations ===
{{main|List of Harvard College undergraduate organizations}}
Harvard has more than 450 undergraduate student organizations.<ref name = organization/><ref>{{Cite web |title=List of Student Organizations |url=http://osl.fas.harvard.edu/student-organizations |publisher=Harvard College |access-date=13 January 2016 |work=[[The President and Fellows of Harvard College]]}}</ref>
The [[Phillips Brooks House Association]] acts as an umbrella service organization.
