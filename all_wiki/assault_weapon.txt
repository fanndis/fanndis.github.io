'''Assault weapon''' is a term used in the [[United States]] to define some types of [[firearm]]s.<ref name=Goode130116/> The definition varies among regulating jurisdictions but usually includes [[semi-automatic firearm]]s chambered for [[centerfire ammunition]] with a detachable [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]], a [[pistol grip]] and sometimes other features such as a [[vertical forward grip]], [[flash suppressor]] or [[barrel shroud]].<ref name=Goode130116/><ref name=Babay121222/> Some firearms are specified by name.<ref name=Levs130131/> At the time that the now-defunct [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] passed in 1994, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] said, "In general, assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use."<ref name=Levs130131/> The origin of the term has been attributed to legislators, [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control groups]], firearm manufacturers, and the media.<ref name=Goode130116/><ref name=Tartaro1995/><ref name=Blake130117/><ref name=Kauffman121218/><ref name=GDBG2AWs2008/> It is often used interchangeably with the term "[[assault rifle]]", which may more specifically refer to [[selective-fire]] military rifles that can fire in [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] or [[Burst mode (weapon)|burst mode]].<ref name=Blake130117/>

After the December 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], many news organizations ran stories about assault weapons, explaining their varying definitions and presenting varying opinions about whether they should be banned again at the federal level.<ref name=Goode130116>{{cite news |title=Even Defining 'Assault Rifles' Is Complicated |author=Goode, Erica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/even-defining-assault-weapons-is-complicated.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Blake130117>{{cite news |last=Blake |first=Aaron |date=January 17, 2013 |title=Is It Fair to Call Them 'Assault Weapons'? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/01/17/is-it-fair-to-call-them-assault-weapons/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Lallanilla130117>{{cite news |last=Lallanilla |first=Marc |date=January 17, 2013 |title=What Is an Assault Weapon? |url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/17/what-is-assault-weapon/ |publisher=Fox News Channel |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Richman130118/>

===History of terminology===
The origin of the term is not very clearly known and is the subject of much debate. In the past, the names of certain military weapons used the phrase, such as the [[Rifleman's Assault Weapon]], a grenade launcher developed in 1977 for use with the [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle,<ref>''Jane's Infantry Weapons 1995–96'', p. 219.</ref> or the [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon]], a rocket launcher introduced in 1984.<ref name=AboutviaUSMC>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Marine Corps Fact File: Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/marinefacts/blsmaw.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref>

One of the earliest uses of the term, or a similar term, in its current meaning was in a bill introduced by [[Art Agnos]] in the [[California State Assembly]] in April 1985 to ban semi-automatic "assault firearms" capable of using detachable magazines of 20 rounds or more.<ref name=Ingram850409>{{cite news |last=Ingram |first=Carl |date=April 9, 1985 |title=Restricting of Assault-Type Guns Okd by Assembly Unit |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/news/mn-27984_1_machine-guns |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201034612/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/news/mn-27984_1_machine-guns |archivedate=December 1, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Kavey851101>{{cite journal |last=Kavey |first=Fred |date=November 1, 1985 |title=California: gun control's primary target |journal=Guns & Ammo Magazine }}</ref> Speaking to the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Agnos said, "The only use for assault weapons is to shoot people."<ref name=Ingram850409/> The measure did not pass when it came up for a vote.<ref name=Kavey851101/>

In 2013, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', looking into the history of the term, wrote of the term: "Many attribute its popularization to a 1988 paper written by gun-control activist and Violence Policy Center founder Josh Sugarmann and the later reaction to the [[Cleveland School massacre]] in Stockton, California, in January 1989."<ref name=Blake130117/> [[Josh Sugarmann|Sugarmann]] had written:
{{quote|Assault weapons—just like armor-piercing bullets, machine guns, and plastic firearms—are a new topic. The weapons' menacing looks, coupled with the public's confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semi-automatic assault weapons—anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun—can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. In addition, few people can envision a practical use for these weapons.<ref name="AWA1988conc">{{cite web |last=Sugarmann |year=1988 |first=Josh |title=Assault Weapons and Accessories in America |url=http://www.vpc.org/studies/awaconc.htm |publisher=[[Violence Policy Center]] |accessdate=February 26, 2005 }}</ref>}}

Other researchers have found evidence to suggest that the firearms industry itself may have introduced the term "assault weapon" to build interest in new product lines.<ref name=Richman130118>{{cite news |last=Richman |first=Josh |date=January 18, 2013 |title=Assault Weapons: What Are They, and Should They Be Banned? |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_22396050/assault-weapons-what-are-they-and-should-they |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=January 19, 2013 |quote=In fact, the term was introduced by the gun industry itself to boost interest in new lines of firearms.}}</ref> Phillip Peterson, the author of ''Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Assault Weapons'' (2008) wrote:

{{quote|The popularly held idea that the term 'assault weapon' originated with anti-gun activists is wrong.

Meanwhile many gun rights activists have put forward that the term originated from the media or gun control activists.

Two scholars have written: "One problem inherent in the study of [assault weapons (AW)] is that the classifications of AW are based on cosmetic features of firearms... For instance, the [[Colt AR-15]] series of semi-automatic rifles—the civilian version of the fully automatic M-16 rifle issued to U.S. soldiers—was subject to the 1994 AW restrictions, but the [[Ruger Mini-14]] rifle was not banned. Yet, the Mini-14 is the same caliber, has a similar barrel length, the same semi-automatic action, and can use magazines that hold 30 rounds of ammunition. The only real meaningful difference between the two firearms is cosmetic: The AR-15 rifle looks more dangerous."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Criminal Justice Review|date=May 1, 2005|volume=30|title=Kids and Assault Weapons: Social Problem or Social Construction?|last=Decker|first=Scott|last2=Ruddell|first2=Rick|pages=53}}</ref>

The [[National Shooting Sports Foundation]], a firearms industry [[trade group]], states that the term ''assault weapon'' has been misapplied to many semi-automatic firearms because of their appearance and not their use in crime.<ref name="NSSF Facts">"{{cite web |url=http://www.nssf.org/factsheets/semi-auto.cfm |title=Background Information on So-Called 'Assault Weapons' |publisher=National Shooting Sports Foundation |date=December 2011 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219071331/http://www.nssf.org/factsheets/semi-auto.cfm |archive-date=December 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Defunct U.S. Federal Assault Weapons Ban===
{{Main|Federal Assault Weapons Ban}}

The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994, more commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, expired in 2004.  It banned the manufacture or importation of certain [[semi-automatic firearm]]s that it defined as "semiautomatic assault weapons", commonly known as assault weapons.  Any firearms so defined that were already possessed at the time the law took effect were grandfathered in, and could be legally owned or transferred.  Another aspect of the law banned the manufacture or importation of [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]] that could hold more than ten rounds of ammunition, with existing magazines grandfathered in as legal.<ref name=FedBan94/>

The Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 defined certain firearms as assault weapons based on the features they possessed.  This included semi-automatic [[rifle]]s with a [[detachable magazine]] and at least two of these features: a [[pistol grip]], a folding or telescoping [[stock (firearms)|stock]], a [[flash suppressor]] or threaded barrel, a [[bayonet lug|bayonet mount]], or a muzzle-mounted [[grenade launcher]].  It included semi-automatic pistols with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a magazine that attaches outside the pistol grip, a threaded barrel, a [[barrel shroud]], or an unloaded weight of 50 ounces or more. Additionally defined as assault weapons were semi-automatic [[shotgun]]s with a rotating cylinder, or with at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a detachable magazine, or a fixed magazine that can hold more than five rounds.<ref name=Koerner040916>{{cite news |last=Koerner |first=Brendan |date=September 16, 2004 |title=What Is an Assault Weapon?

The ban also prohibited 19 specifically named models of firearms, as well as copies of those guns.  These included the [[AK-47]], [[Uzi]], [[IMI Galil|Galil]], [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]], [[FN FAL]], [[MAC-10]], [[Steyr AUG]], [[TEC-9]], and [[Armsel Striker]].<ref name=Koerner040916/><ref name=FedBan94/>
