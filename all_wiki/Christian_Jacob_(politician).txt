Following the [[2017 French legislative election|legislative elections]] in June 2017, Jacob was re-elected chairman of the LR parliamentary group, in a vote against [[Damien Abad]].<ref>[https://www.europe1.fr/politique/christian-jacob-reelu-president-du-groupe-les-republicains-de-lassemblee-nationale-3367901 Christian Jacob réélu président du groupe Les Républicains de l'Assemblée Nationale] ''[[Europe 1]]'', 21 June 2017.</ref> In addition, he has since been serving on the Defence Committee and the Committee on Sustainable Development and Spatial Planning again.<ref>[http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/deputes/fiche/OMC_PA1695 Christian Jacob] [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]].</ref>

In the Republicans' [[2017 The Republicans (France) leadership election|2017 leadership election]], Jacob endorsed [[Laurent Wauquiez]].<ref>Ludovic Vigogne (11 October 2017), [https://www.lopinion.fr/edition/politique/liste-136-parrains-laurent-wauquiez-135723 La liste des 136 parrains de Laurent Wauquiez] ''[[L'Opinion (French newspaper)|L'Opinion]]''.</ref>

In October 2019, after Wauquiez's resignation and in the context of a series of electoral losses, Jacob emerged as a consensus candidate for the [[2019 The Republicans (France) leadership election|LR leadership]].<ref>Rym Momtaz (26 June 2019), [https://www.politico.eu/article/sarkos-back-playing-it-by-the-book/ Sarko’s back, playing it by the book] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref><ref>[https://www.france24.com/en/20191013-france-s-troubled-conservatives-elect-new-leader France's troubled conservatives elect new leader] ''[[France 24]]'', 13 October 2019.</ref> In an internal party vote, he won against [[Julien Aubert]] and [[Guillaume Larrivé]].<ref>Aude Le Gentil (13 October 2019), [https://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/presidence-des-republicains-le-plus-dur-commence-pour-christian-jacob-elu-des-le-premier-tour-3925246 Présidence des Républicains : le plus dur commence pour Christian Jacob, élu dès le premier tour] ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]''.</ref> [[Damien Abad]] succeeded him as leader of the LR parliamentary group.<ref>Ludovic Vigogne (Novembre 6, 2019), [https://www.lopinion.fr/edition/politique/a-l-assemblee-damien-abad-devient-nouveau-patron-deputes-lr-202371 Couronnement: A l’Assemblée, Damien Abad devient le nouveau patron des députés LR] ''[[L'Opinion (French newspaper)|L'Opinion]]''.</ref> Under Jacob’s leadership, LR won more than half of the country’s small towns in the [[2020 French municipal elections]]; at the same time, however, the party lost in larger cities it had held for decades, including Marseille and Bordeaux.<ref>Victor Mallet (July 1, 2020), [https://www.ft.com/content/bdbdd197-eadd-4557-bf41-e1114fdeeaa7  French centre-right faces identity crisis] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Jacob has said he has “no ambition” to campaign for the [[2022 French presidential election]].<ref>Victor Mallet (July 1, 2020), [https://www.ft.com/content/bdbdd197-eadd-4557-bf41-e1114fdeeaa7  French centre-right faces identity crisis] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

==Political positions==
===Foreign policy===
When [[President of France|President]] [[François Hollande]] and the French government sought to bolster the case for [[Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War|military action]] against [[President of Syria|President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government amid the [[Syrian civil war]] in 2013, Jacob held that an intervention "could only be justified in the framework of the United Nations" and expressed concern that France was out of step with its neighbors, including Germany.<ref>Scott Sayare (2 September 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/middleeast/french-release-intelligence-tying-assad-government-to-chemical-weapons.html French Release Intelligence Tying Assad Government to Chemical Weapons] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

In 2014, Jacob criticized the Socialist majority for backing France's [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognition of the State of Palestine]] as a move to "add fuel to the fire in a region that doesn’t need that at all."<ref>John Irish, Alexandria Sage and Ari Rabinovitch (2 December 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-palestinians-france/french-parliament-votes-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state-idUSKCN0JF3DW20141202 French parliament votes for recognition of Palestinian state] ''Reuters''.</ref>

Ahead of Hollande's 2015 visit to meet his Russian counterpart [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow, Jacob called on him to push for an end to the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|European Union sanctions on Russia]] over its activities in Ukraine.<ref>Emile Picy (24 November 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-france-embargo/main-french-opposition-calls-for-end-to-eu-embargo-on-russia-idUSKBN0TD1BL20151124 Main French opposition calls for end to EU embargo on Russia] ''Reuters''.</ref>

===Domestic policy===
Amid a 2019 public debate in France about women wearing [[hijab]]s in public, Jacob demanded that clothing restrictions applied to teachers and students be extended to parents who sign up for class trips.<ref>Aurelien Breeden (19 October 2019), [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/world/europe/france-hijab-school-trip-mother.html Another Hijab Furor Hits France, Over a Mother on a School Trip] ''The New York Times''.</ref> In an interview with ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper, he said: "The veil should be banned on all school time. Not just on school premises".<ref>Emmanuel Galiero and Tristan Quinault-Maupoil (17 October 2019), [https://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/christian-jacob-nous-devons-parlerde-tous-les-sujets-a-tous-les-francais-20191017 Christian Jacob: "Nous devons parler de tous les sujets à tous les Français"] ''[[Le Figaro]]''.</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2011 Jacob caused controversy when he described [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] as an urban intellectual – a "[[Bobo (socio-economic group)|bobo]]," short for "bourgeois-bohemian" – and said that Strauss-Kahn did not represent "the image of France, the image of rural France, the image of the France of terroirs and territories". Both French and foreign media interpreted this notion of rootless cosmopolitanism, of being out of touch with the soil and the mystery of "[[France profonde|la France profonde]]," as an old trope for foreign and Jewish influence. In response, the president of the [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France]] (CRIF), [[Richard Prasquier]], called Jacob's comments "a very great clumsiness".<ref>[[Steven Erlanger]] (17 February 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/18/world/europe/18france.html One Prospect for President Isn’t Talking, but France Is] ''The New York Times''.</ref>

==Personal life==
Jacob has in the past touted his passion for hunting and featured in full hunting attire in ''[[Paris Match]]'' magazine in July 2020.<ref>Virginie Le Guay (July 25, 2020), [https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Politique/Christian-Jacob-l-amour-de-la-chasse-1695756 Christian Jacob, l'amour de la chasse] ''[[Paris Match]]''.</ref><ref>Elisa Braun (August 31, 2020), [https://www.politico.eu/article/tide-is-turning-for-frances-powerful-hunting-lobby-emmanuel-macron/ Macron’s glue-hunting ban threatens France’s powerful lobby] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

On 15 March 2020, Jacob was tested positive for [[coronavirus]].<ref>[https://www.afp.com/de/infos/334/le-president-de-lr-christian-jacob-teste-positif-au-coronavirus-doc-1px02x4 Afp.com:Le président de LR Christian Jacob testé positif au coronavirus AfP: Le président de LR Christian Jacob testé positif au coronavirus], 15 March 2020</ref>
