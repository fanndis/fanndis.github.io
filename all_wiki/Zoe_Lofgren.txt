She was the [[California's 16th congressional district|16th district]]'s first female U.S. Representative, prior to a portion of the district being redistricted into the [[California's 19th congressional district|19th congressional district]]. The district covers much of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], including the cities of [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]], [[Morgan Hill, California|Morgan Hill]], and most of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In 1994, Lofgren entered a six-way Democratic primary in what was then the 16th district, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. The district, then as now, is a Democratic stronghold, and it was understood that whoever won the Democratic primary would be only the second person to represent this district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th district from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993, the 16th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013). A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor [[Tom McEnery]], by just over 1,100 votes. She breezed to victory in November, and been reelected ten times with no substantive opposition.

During the 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections, Lofgren's campaign paid approximately $350,000 to two businesses her husband operates: Collins and Day and John Marshall Collins P.C. over a six year period to support campaign efforts.<ref name="Coile">{{cite news |last1=Coile |first1=Zachary |title=Watchdog lists 64 in the House paying kin out campaign funds / It's legal, but some wonder whether it's good government |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Watchdog-lists-64-in-the-House-paying-kin-out-2555377.php |accessdate=21 November 2020 |work=SFGATE |date=19 June 2007}}</ref>

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054356/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 25, 2013 |title=Reps.

In May 2016, Lofgren was publicly reprimanded during a House Judiciary Committee hearing after calling witness [[Gail Heriot]] of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] an "ignorant bigot" because Ms. Heriot's written testimony before the hearing had suggested that calling one's self a female does not cause one to be a female.<ref>[https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-HeriotG-20160524.pdf Testimony of Gail Heriot to the Task Force on Executive Overreach] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830234304/https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-HeriotG-20160524.pdf |date=August 30, 2017 }}, May 26, 2016</ref> Following the oral warning from acting committee chairman and so-called white supremacist [[Steve King]] (R, Iowa), Lofgren responded, "I cannot allow that kind of bigotry to go into the record unchallenged". Her quote was later published in a Huffington Post article about the hearings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zoe-lofgren-transphobia_us_5746eee4e4b0dacf7ad403eb|title=Congresswoman Shuts Down Transphobic Woman: 'You're A Bigot, Lady'|first=Paige|last=Lavender|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=|via=Huff Post|access-date=May 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527124646/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zoe-lofgren-transphobia_us_5746eee4e4b0dacf7ad403eb|archive-date=May 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
