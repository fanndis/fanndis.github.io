It is also part of the [[Western United States|Western]] and the [[Mountain States|Mountain]] states. It is the [[list of U.S. states and territories by area|6th largest]] and the [[list of U.S. states and territories by population|14th most populous]] of the 50 states. Its [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of largest cities|largest city]] is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Arizona shares the [[Four Corners]] region with [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], and [[New Mexico]]; its other neighboring states are [[Nevada]] and [[California]] to the west and the [[List of states of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Sonora]] and [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] to the south and southwest.

Arizona is the 48th state and last of the [[contiguous United States|contiguous states]] to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of ''[[Alta California]]'' in [[New Spain]], it became part of independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the [[Mexican–American War]], Mexico ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the [[Gadsden Purchase]].

[[Southern Arizona]] is known for its [[desert]] climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. [[Northern Arizona]] features forests of pine, [[Douglas fir]], and [[spruce]] trees; the [[Colorado Plateau]]; mountain ranges (such as the [[San Francisco Peaks|San Francisco Mountains]]); as well as large, deep [[canyon]]s, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are [[skiing|ski resorts]] in the areas of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Alpine, Arizona|Alpine]], and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. In addition to the internationally known [[Grand Canyon National Park]], which is one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World|world's seven natural wonders]], there are several [[U.S. National Forest|national forests]], [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and [[National parks (United States)|national monuments]].

==Etymology==

The state's name appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, {{lang|es|Arizonac}}, derived from the O'odham name {{lang|ood|alĭ ṣonak}}, meaning "small spring", which initially applied only to an area near the [[silver mining]] camp of [[Planchas de Plata, Sonora]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bright |first=William |year=2004 |title=Native American Place Names of the United States |location=Norman |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |page=47 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kitt |first1=E.

For thousands of years before the modern era, Arizona was home to many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes. [[Hohokam]], [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] and [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]] cultures were among those that flourished throughout the state. Many of their pueblos, cliffside dwellings, rock paintings and other prehistoric treasures have survived and attract thousands of tourists each year.

In 1539, [[Marcos de Niza]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]], became the first European to contact Native Americans. He explored parts of the present state and made contact with [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] inhabitants, probably the [[Sobaipuri]]. The expedition of Spanish explorer [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado]] entered the area in 1540–1542 during its search for [[Quivira and Cíbola|Cíbola]]. Few Spanish settlers migrated to Arizona. One of the first settlers in Arizona was [[José Romo de Vivar]].<ref name="Lainez and Torres">Martínez Laínez, Fernando and Canales Torres, Carlos.

[[Eusebio Kino|Father Kino]] was the next European in the region. A member of the [[Society of Jesus]] ("[[Jesuits]]"), he led the development of a chain of missions in the region. He converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the [[Pimería Alta]] (now southern Arizona and northern [[Sonora]]) in the 1690s and early 18th century. Spain founded ''presidios'' ("fortified towns") at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775.

When [[Mexico]] achieved its independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of its Territory of ''Nueva California'', ("New California"), also known as ''[[Alta California]]'' ("Upper California").<ref>Timothy Anna et al., ''Historia de México''. Barcelona: Critica, 2001, p. 10.</ref> Descendants of ethnic Spanish and mestizo settlers from the colonial years still lived in the area at the time of the arrival of later European-American migrants from the United States.

During the [[Mexican–American War]] (1847–1848), the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] occupied the national capital of [[Mexico City]] and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico, including what later became [[Territory of Arizona (United States)|Arizona Territory]] in 1863 and later the State of Arizona in 1912. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848) specified that, in addition to language and cultural rights of the existing inhabitants of former Mexican citizens being considered as inviolable, the sum of $15{{nbs}}million in compensation ({{inflation|US|15000000|1848|fmt=eq|r=2}}) be paid to the Republic of Mexico.<ref>[[Mexican–American War]] as accessed on March 16, 2007, at 7:33 MST AM</ref> In 1853, the U.S. acquired the land south below the [[Gila River]] from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] along the southern border area as encompassing the best future southern route for a transcontinental railway.

What is now known as the state of Arizona was initially administered by the United States government as part of the [[Territory of New Mexico]] until the southern part of that region seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] to form the [[Confederate Arizona|Territory of Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/~azrebel/page9.html |title=Arizona Ordinance of secession presented by the Col.

The Southern territory supplied the Confederate government with men, horses, and equipment. Formed in 1862, [[Company A, Arizona Rangers|Arizona scout companies]] served with the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Arizona has the westernmost military engagement on record during the Civil War with the [[Battle of Picacho Pass]] (1862).

The Federal government declared a new U.S. Arizona Territory, consisting of the western half of earlier New Mexico Territory, in [[Washington, D.C.]], on February 24, 1863. These new boundaries would later form the basis of the state. The first territorial capital, Prescott, was founded in 1864 following a gold rush to central Arizona.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Henson|first1=Pauline|title=Founding a Wilderness Capital, Prescott, A.

Although names including "Gadsonia", "Pimeria", "Montezuma" and "Arizuma" had been considered for the territory,<ref>{{cite web |title=Preserving Cultural and Historic Resources—A Conservation Objective of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan |url=http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/Archives/reports/Cult.html |website=pima.gov |access-date=November 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703055719/http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/Archives/reports/Cult.html |archive-date=July 3, 2010 }}</ref> when 16th President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the final bill, it read "Arizona", and that name was adopted. ([[Montezuma (mythology)|Montezuma]] was not derived from the [[Aztec]] emperor, but was the sacred name of a divine hero to the [[Pima people]] of the [[Gila River Valley]]. It was probably considered—and rejected—for its sentimental value before Congress settled on the name "Arizona".)

[[Brigham Young]], patriarchal leader of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in [[Salt Lake City]] in [[Utah]], sent [[Mormons]] to Arizona in the mid- to late 19th century. They founded [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]], [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]], and other towns. They also settled in the [[Phoenix Valley]] (or "Valley of the Sun"), [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], and other areas. The Mormons settled what became [[northern Arizona]] and northern New Mexico. At the time these areas were in a part of the former [[New Mexico Territory]].

During the nineteenth century, a series of gold and silver rushes occurred in the territory, the best known being the 1870s stampede to the silver bonanzas of [[Tombstone, Arizona]] in southeast Arizona, also known for its legendary outlaws and lawmen.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shillingberg |first1=William |title=Tombstone, A.

===20th century to present===

During the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920, several battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizona settlements. Throughout the revolution, many Arizonans enlisted in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico. Only two significant engagements took place on U.S. soil between U.S. and Mexican forces: [[Pancho Villa]]'s 1916 Columbus Raid in New Mexico, and the [[Battle of Ambos Nogales]] in 1918 in Arizona. The Mexicans won the first battle and the Americans won the latter.

After Mexican federal troops fired on U.S. soldiers, the American garrison launched an assault into [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties. A few months earlier, just west of Nogales, an Indian War battle had occurred, considered the last engagement in the [[American Indian Wars]], which lasted from 1775 to 1918. U.S. soldiers stationed on the border confronted [[Yaqui Indians]] who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements, as part of their wars against Mexico.

Arizona became a U.S. state on February 14, 1912, coincidentally [[Valentine's Day]]. Arizona was the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|48th state admitted]] to the U.S. and the last of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] to be admitted.

Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the [[Great Depression]]. But during the 1920s and even the 1930s, tourism began to develop as the important Arizonan industry it is today. Dude ranches, such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to take part in the flavor and activities of the "Old West". Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws. They include the [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]] in central Phoenix (opened 1929) and the Wigwam Resort on the west side of the Phoenix area (opened 1936).

Arizona was the site of German prisoner of war camps during World War{{nbs}}II and [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese American internment camps]]. Because of wartime fears of a Japanese invasion of the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]] (which in fact materialized in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in June 1942), the government authorized the removal of all Japanese American residents from all the [[Territory of Alaska|Alaska Territory]] and [[California]], the western halves of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], and [[Southern Arizona]]. From 1942 to 1945, they were forced to reside in internment camps built in the interior of the country. Many lost their homes and businesses. The camps were abolished after World War{{nbs}}II.

The Phoenix-area German P.O.W. site was purchased after the war by the [[Maytag]] family (of major [[home appliance]] fame). It was developed as the site of the [[Phoenix Zoo]]. A Japanese-American internment camp was on [[Mount Lemmon]], just outside the state's southeastern city of Tucson. Another [[POW camp]] was near the [[Gila River]] in eastern [[Yuma County, Arizona|Yuma County]].

Arizona was also home to the [[Steele Indian School Park|Phoenix Indian School]], one of several federal [[Indian boarding schools]] designed to assimilate Native American children into mainstream European-American culture. Children were often enrolled into these schools against the wishes of their parents and families. Attempts to suppress native identities included forcing the children to cut their hair, to take and use English names, to speak only English, and to practice Christianity rather than their native religions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/phoenix/ |title=Archaeology of the Phoenix Indian School |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=March 27, 1998 |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103142851/http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/phoenix/ |archive-date=November 3, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Numerous Native Americans from Arizona fought for the United States during World War{{nbs}}II. Their experiences resulted in a rising activism in the postwar years to achieve better treatment and civil rights after their return to the state. After Maricopa County did not allow them to register to vote, in 1948 veteran Frank Harrison and Harry Austin, of the [[Mojave-Apache Tribe]] at [[Fort McDowell Indian Reservation]], brought a legal suit, ''[[Harrison and Austin v. Laveen]]'', to challenge this exclusion. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in their favor.<ref name="HAvote">[http://az.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19480715_0040021.AZ.htm/qx ''Harrison v.

Arizona's population grew tremendously with residential and business development after World War{{nbs}}II, aided by the widespread use of [[air conditioning]], which made the intensely hot summers more comfortable. According to the ''Arizona Blue Book'' (published by the [[Arizona Secretary of State]]'s office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970, it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades, and about 60% each decade thereafter.

In the 1960s, [[retirement communities]] were developed. These age-restricted subdivisions catered exclusively to the needs of senior citizens and attracted many retirees who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the [[Midwest]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]], established by developer [[Del Webb]] and opened in 1960, was one of the first such communities. [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]], south of Tucson, was another such community, designed as a retirement subdivision for Arizona's teachers. Many senior citizens from across the U.S. and [[Canada]] come to Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as [[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]].

In March 2000, Arizona was the site of the first legally binding election ever held over the internet to nominate a candidate for public office.<ref>[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/News/19991003-0.html "Arizona Democrats authorize Internet Voting for March 11 Advisory Primary"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106154155/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/News/19991003-0.html |date=November 6, 2010 }}, The Green Papers</ref> In the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary, under worldwide attention, [[Al Gore]] defeated [[Bill Bradley]]. Voter turnout in this state primary increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.

Three ships named [[USS Arizona|USS ''Arizona'']] have been christened in honor of the state, although only [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'' (BB-39)]] was so named after statehood was achieved.

Arizona is in the Southwestern United States as one of the [[Four Corners]] states. Arizona is the sixth [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest state by area]], ranked after [[New Mexico]] and before [[Nevada]]. Of the state's {{convert|113998|sqmi|km2|-3}}, approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and park land, [[Arizona State Trust Land|state trust land]] and Native American reservations.

Arizona is well known for its [[desert]] [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] region in the state's southern portions, which is rich in a [[landscape]] of [[xerophyte]] plants such as the [[cactus]]. This region's topography was shaped by prehistoric [[volcanism]], followed by the cooling-off and related [[subsidence]]. Its climate has exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the high country of the [[Colorado Plateau]] (see [[Arizona Mountains forests]]).

Like other states of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] United States, Arizona has an abundance of mountains and plateaus. Despite the state's aridity, 27% of Arizona is forest,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://azsf.az.gov/forestry-community-forestry/urban-community-forestry |title=Urban and Community Forestry Division |publisher=Arizona State Forestry Division |access-date=July 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213135/https://azsf.az.gov/forestry-community-forestry/urban-community-forestry |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> a percentage comparable to modern-day Romania or Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/288.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> The world's largest stand of [[ponderosa pine]] trees is in Arizona.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsu.edu/project/wildfire/Arizona/prescott/prescott.html |title=Prescott Overview |publisher=Ncsu.edu |date=May 15, 2002 |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118135417/http://www.ncsu.edu/project/wildfire/Arizona/prescott/prescott.html |archive-date=January 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Mogollon Rim]], a {{convert|1998|ft|adj=on}} [[escarpment]], cuts across the state's central section and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. In 2002, this was an area of the [[Rodeo–Chediski Fire]], the worst fire in state history until 2011.

Located in northern Arizona, the [[Grand Canyon]] is a colorful, deep, steep-sided gorge, carved by the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]]. The canyon is one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World]] and is largely contained in the [[Grand Canyon National Park]]—one of the first national parks in the United States. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area as a National Park, often visiting to hunt [[cougar|mountain lion]] and enjoy the scenery. The canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years, and is about {{convert|277|mi}} long, ranges in width from {{convert|4|to|18|mi|0}} and attains a depth of more than {{convert|1|mi}}. Nearly two{{nbs}}billion years of the [[Earth]]'s history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of sediment as the Colorado Plateau uplifted.

Arizona is home to one of the most well-preserved [[meteorite]] impact sites in the world. Created around 50,000 years ago, the Barringer Meteorite Crater (better known simply as "[[Meteor Crater]]") is a gigantic hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau, about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]]. A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders, some of them the size of small houses, rises {{convert|150|ft|m}} above the level of the surrounding plain. The crater itself is nearly a mile (1.6 kilometers) wide and {{convert|570|ft|m}} deep.

Arizona is one of two U.S. states (Hawaii being the other) that do not observe [[Daylight Saving Time]]. (The large [[Navajo Nation]] in the state's northeastern region ''does''.)

===Earthquakes===

Generally, Arizona is at low risk of earthquakes, except for the southwestern portion which is at moderate risk due to its proximity to southern California. On the other hand, northern Arizona is at moderate risk due to numerous faults in the area. The regions near and west of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] have the lowest risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/arizona/hazards.php |title=Arizona |publisher=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Earthquake.Usgs.Gov |access-date=October 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106024533/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/arizona/hazards.php |archive-date=January 6, 2013 }}</ref>

The earliest Arizona earthquakes were recorded at [[Fort Yuma]], on the [[California]] side of the [[Colorado River]]. They were centered near the Imperial Valley, or [[Mexico]], back in the 1800s. Residents in [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]] felt the [[1887 Sonora earthquake]] with its epicenter {{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} to the south in the Mexican state of [[Sonora]].<ref name="earthquake.usgs">{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/arizona/history.php |title=Arizona |publisher=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Earthquake.Usgs.Gov |access-date=October 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901050344/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/arizona/history.php |archive-date=September 1, 2012 }}</ref> The first damaging earthquake known to be centered within Arizona occurred on January 25, 1906, also including a series of other earthquakes centered near [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. The shock was violent in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]].

In September 1910, a series of 52 earthquakes caused a construction crew near Flagstaff to leave the area. In 1912, the year Arizona achieved statehood, on August 18, an earthquake caused a 50-mile crack in the [[San Francisco Peaks|San Francisco Range]]. In early January 1935, the state experienced a series of earthquakes, in the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma area]] and near the [[Grand Canyon]]. Arizona experienced its largest earthquake in 1959, with a tremor of a magnitude 5.6. It was centered near [[Fredonia, Arizona|Fredonia]], in the state's northwest near the border with [[Utah]]. The tremor was felt across the border in [[Nevada]] and Utah.<ref name="earthquake.usgs" />

==Climate==

Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. In the lower elevations, the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and extremely hot summers. Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of {{convert|60|°F}}. November through February are the coldest months, with temperatures typically ranging from {{convert|40 to 75|°F}}, with occasional frosts.<ref name="wrcc">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/ARIZONA.htm |title=Arizona Climate |date=December 7, 2001 |access-date=December 28, 2011 |publisher=Desert Research Institute, Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, Nevada |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222180507/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/ARIZONA.htm |archive-date=December 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

About midway through February, the temperatures start to rise, with warm days, and cool, breezy nights. The summer months of June through September bring a dry heat from {{convert|90 to 120|°F}}, with occasional high temperatures exceeding {{convert|125|°F}} having been observed in the desert area.<ref name="wrcc" /> Arizona's all-time record high is {{convert|128|°F}} recorded at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]] on June 29, 1994, and July 5, 2007; the all-time record low of {{convert|-40|°F}} was recorded at [[Hawley Lake, Arizona|Hawley Lake]] on January 7, 1971.

Due to the primarily dry climate, large diurnal temperature variations occur in less-developed areas of the desert above {{convert|2500|feet|abbr=on}}. The swings can be as large as 83{{nbs}}°F (46{{nbs}}°C)<!--A temperature CHANGE of {{convert|83|°F|°C|abbr=on}} corresponds to a temperature CHANGE of 46{{nbs}}°C. Can't use {{convert|83|°F}}, as this is temperature change, different from a temperature of {{convert|83|°F|°C|abbr=on}}--> in the summer months. In the state's urban centers, the effects of [[urban heat island|local warming]] result in much higher measured night-time lows than in the recent past.

This hot moisture brings [[lightning]], [[thunderstorm]]s, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause [[flash flood]]s, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the [[Arizona Legislature]] enacted the [[Stupid Motorist Law]]. It is rare for [[tornado]]es or [[List of Arizona hurricanes|hurricanes]] to occur in Arizona.

Arizona's northern third is a [[plateau]] at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert, and has an appreciably cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers, though the climate remains semiarid to arid. Extremely cold temperatures are not unknown; cold air systems from the northern states and Canada occasionally push into the state, bringing temperatures below {{convert|0|°F}} to the state's northern parts.

Indicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over {{convert|100|°F}} ([[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with the most days with a low temperature below freezing ([[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011217185325/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 17, 2001 |title=''Mean number of Days with Minimum Temperature Below 32F'' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Retrieved March 24, 2007 |publisher=Lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov |date=August 20, 2008 |access-date=December 28, 2011 }}</ref>

==Economy==

{{See also|Economy of Arizona|Arizona locations by per capita income}}
[[File:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|thumb|Arizona's [[Meteor Crater]] is a tourist attraction.]]

The 2011 total [[gross state product]] was $259{{nbs}}billion. This figure gives Arizona a larger economy than such countries as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Finland]], and [[New Zealand]]. {{Dubious|date=April 2019}} The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors.

The state's per capita income is $40,828, ranking 39th in the U.S. The state had a [[median household income]] of $50,448, making it 22nd in the country and just below the U.S. national mean.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/2010/pdf/spi0310.pdf|title=News Release|access-date=December 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921200544/http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/2010/pdf/spi0310.pdf|archive-date=September 21, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see ''[[Copper mining in Arizona]]''), cotton, cattle, [[citrus]], and [[climate]] (tourism). Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output.

===Taxation===

Tax is collected by the [[Arizona Department of Revenue]].<ref>https://azdor.gov/</ref>

Arizona collects personal [[income tax]]es in five brackets: 2.59%, 2.88%, 3.36%, 4.24% and 4.54%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-rates.org/arizona/income-tax|title=Arizona Income Tax Rates for 2017|website=www.tax-rates.org|access-date=February 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150119/http://www.tax-rates.org/arizona/income-tax|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The state [[transaction privilege tax]] is 5.6%; however, county and municipal sales taxes generally add an additional 2%.

The state rate on transient lodging (hotel/[[motel]]) is 7.27%. The state of Arizona does not levy a state tax on food for home consumption or on drugs prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist. However, some cities in Arizona do levy a tax on food for home consumption.

All fifteen Arizona counties levy a tax. Incorporated municipalities also levy transaction privilege taxes which, with the exception of their hotel/motel tax, are generally in the range of 1-to-3%. These added assessments could push the combined sales [[tax rate]] to as high as 10.7%.

Main Interstate routes include I-17, and I-19 traveling north–south, I-8, I-10, and I-40, traveling east–west, and a short stretch of I-15 traveling northeast–southwest through the extreme northwestern corner of the state. In addition, the various urban areas are served by complex networks of [[List of Arizona State Routes|state routes]] and highways, such as the [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]], which is part of Phoenix's vast [[Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways|freeway system]].

===Public transportation, Amtrak, and intercity bus===

{{see also|List of passenger train stations in Arizona}}

The Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff also have public bus systems. [[Greyhound Lines]] serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide.

A [[light rail]] system, called [[Valley Metro Rail]], was completed in December 2008; it connects Central Phoenix with the nearby cities of Mesa and Tempe.

In Tucson, the [[Sun Link]] streetcar system travels through the downtown area, connecting the main [[University of Arizona]] campus with Mercado San Agustin on the western edge of downtown Tucson. Sun Link, loosely based on the [[Portland Streetcar]], launched in July 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_tuc_2006-05b.htm |title=Tucson: Streetcar Plan Wins With 60% of Vote |publisher=Lightrailnow.org |access-date=December 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104135221/http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_tuc_2006-05b.htm |archive-date=January 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Amtrak]] ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' route serves the northern part of the state, stopping at [[Winslow (Amtrak station)|Winslow]], [[Flagstaff (Amtrak station)|Flagstaff]], [[Williams Junction (Amtrak station)|Williams]] and [[Kingman (Amtrak station)|Kingman]]. The ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' and ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' routes serve South-Central Arizona, stopping at [[Tucson (Amtrak station)|Tucson]], [[Maricopa (Amtrak station)|Maricopa]], [[Yuma (Amtrak station)|Yuma]] and [[Benson (Amtrak station)|Benson]]. Phoenix lost Amtrak service in 1996 with the discontinuation of the ''[[Desert Wind]]'', and now an Amtrak bus runs between Phoenix and the station in Maricopa.

===Aviation===

{{See also|List of airports in Arizona}}

Airports with regularly scheduled commercial flights include: [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]] (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX) in Phoenix (the state's largest airport and the major international airport); [[Tucson International Airport]] (IATA: TUS, ICAO: KTUS) in Tucson; [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]] (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in Mesa; [[Yuma International Airport]] (IATA: NYL, ICAO: KNYL) in Yuma; [[Prescott Municipal Airport]] (PRC) in Prescott; [[Flagstaff Pulliam Airport]] (IATA: FLG, ICAO: KFLG) in Flagstaff, and [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]] (IATA: GCN, ICAO: KGCN, FAA: GCN), a small, but busy, single-runway facility providing tourist flights, mostly from Las Vegas. Phoenix Sky Harbor is the world's 7th busiest airport in terms of aircraft movements and 17th for passenger traffic.<ref>World's busiest airports by traffic movements</ref><ref>World's busiest airports by passenger traffic</ref>

Other significant airports without regularly scheduled commercial flights include [[Scottsdale Municipal Airport]] (IATA: SCF, ICAO: KSDL) in Scottsdale, and [[Deer Valley Airport]] (IATA: DVT, ICAO: KDVT, FAA: DVT) home to two flight training academies and the nation's busiest general aviation airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deervalleyairport.com/index.shtml |title=Deer Valley Airport |publisher=Phoenix.gov |access-date=July 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423090645/http://deervalleyairport.com/index.shtml |archive-date=April 23, 2011 }}</ref>

===Capitol complex===

[[File:Azcap.jpg|thumb|The original [[Arizona State Capitol]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]]]

The capital of Arizona is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The original [[Arizona State Capitol|Capitol building]], with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900), when the area was a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.

The [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] buildings were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.

The Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped [[Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza]], named after [[Wesley Bolin]], a governor who died in office in the 1970s. The site also includes many monuments and memorials, including the anchor and signal mast from the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] (one of the U.S. Navy ships [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sunk in Pearl Harbor]]) and a granite version of the [[Ten Commandments]].

===State legislative branch===

The [[Arizona Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] (like the legislature of every other state except [[Nebraska]]) and consists of a thirty-member [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] and a 60-member [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Each of the thirty legislative districts has one senator and two representatives. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.

Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns ''sine die'' (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can be extended only by a majority vote of members present of each house.

The majority party is the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which has held power in both houses since 1993. The [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] picked up several legislative seats in Arizona State House bringing Democratic Leader [[Charlene Fernandez]] one seat shy of a majority (31 to 29).

Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is common for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.

The fiscal year 2006–07 general fund budget, approved by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, was slightly less than $10{{nbs}}billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, it also included more than $500{{nbs}}million in income and property tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and additional funding for the K–12 education system.

Arizona's executive branch is headed by a [[Governor of Arizona|governor]], who is elected to a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. Arizona is one of the few states that has no governor's mansion. During their term the governors reside within their private residence, with executive offices housed in the executive tower at the state capitol. The governor of Arizona is [[Doug Ducey]] (R).

Governor Jan Brewer assumed office in 2009 after [[Janet Napolitano]] had her nomination by [[Barack Obama]] for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] confirmed by the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ariz.

Other elected executive officials include the [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], [[State Treasurer]], [[Arizona Attorney General|State Attorney General]], [[state education agency|Superintendent of Public Instruction]], [[Arizona State Mine Inspector|State Mine Inspector]] and a five-member [[Arizona Corporation Commission|Corporation Commission]]. All elected officials hold a term of four years, and are limited to two consecutive terms (except the office of the State Mine Inspector, which is limited to four terms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/19/0.1.htm |title=Format Document |publisher=Azleg.gov |date=January 1, 1993 |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917193722/http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=%2Fconst%2F19%2F0.1.htm |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Arizona is one of five states that do not have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Arizona|lieutenant governor]]. The elected secretary of state is first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. If appointed, the Secretary of State is not eligible and the next governor is selected from the next eligible official in the line of succession, including the attorney general, state treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have succeeded to Arizona's governorship.

===State judicial branch===

The [[Arizona Supreme Court]] is the highest court in Arizona, consisting of a chief justice, a vice chief justice, and five associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bipartisan commission, and must be sustained in office by election after the first two years following their appointment. Subsequent sustaining elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, but nearly all other appellate cases go through the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]] first. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court may declare laws unconstitutional if seated ''[[en banc]]''. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza).

The [[Arizona Court of Appeals]], subdivided into two divisions, is the intermediate court in the state. Division One is based in Phoenix, consists of sixteen judges, and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state, along with the greater Phoenix area. Division Two is based in Tucson, consists of six judges, and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state, including the Tucson area. Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices.

Each county of Arizona has a [[Arizona Superior Court|superior court]], the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county.

===Counties===

===Federal representation===

Arizona's two United States Senators are [[Kyrsten Sinema]] (D) and [[Mark Kelly]] (D). Kelly succeeded [[Martha McSally]] who was appointed by Governor [[Doug Ducey]] following the resignation of [[Jon Kyl]] who himself was appointed by Ducey after the death of [[John McCain]] in late 2018.

As of the start of the [[115th United States Congress|115th Congress]], Arizona's representatives in the [[United States House of Representatives]] are [[Tom O'Halleran]] (D-1), [[Ann Kirkpatrick]] (D-2), [[Raul Grijalva]] (D-3), [[Paul Gosar]] (R-4), [[Andy Biggs]] (R-5), [[David Schweikert]] (R-6), [[Ruben Gallego]] (D-7), [[Debbie Lesko]] (R-8), and [[Greg Stanton]] (D-9). Arizona gained a ninth seat in the House of Representatives due to [[redistricting]] based on [[2010 United States Census|Census 2010]].

From statehood through the late 1940s, Arizona was primarily dominated by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. During this time, the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election, the only exceptions being the elections of [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]]—all three were national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] landslides.

In 1924, Congress had passed a law granting citizenship and suffrage to all Native Americans, some of whom had previously been excluded as members of tribes on reservations. Legal interpretations of Arizona's constitution prohibited Native Americans living on reservations from voting, classifying them as being under "guardianship".<ref name="HAvote"/> This interpretation was overturned as being incorrect and unconstitutional in 1948 by the Arizona Supreme Court, following a suit by World War{{nbs}}II Indian veterans [[Frank Harrison (soldier)|Frank Harrison]] and Harry Austin, both of the [[Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation]]. The landmark case is ''[[Harrison and Austin v. Laveen]]''. After the men were refused the opportunity to register in Maricopa County, they filed suit against the registrar. The [[National Congress of American Indians]], the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], the [[Department of the Interior]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] all filed ''amicus curiae'' (friends of the court) briefs in the case. The State Supreme Court established the rights of Native Americans to vote in the state; at the time, they comprised about 11% of the population.<ref name="HAvote"/> That year, a similar provision was overturned in New Mexico when challenged by another Indian veteran in court. These were the only two states that had continued to prohibit Native Americans from voting.<ref name="NAvote"/><ref name="HAvote"/>

From the [[1952 United States presidential election|election]] of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952 until 2020, the majority of state voters favored Republicans in presidential elections. Arizona voted Republican in every presidential election from 1952 to 1992, with [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] winning the state by particularly large margins. During this forty-year span, it was the only state not to be carried by a Democrat at least once.

Democrat [[Lyndon Johnson]], in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], lost the state by less than 5,000 votes to Arizona Senator and native [[Barry Goldwater]]. (This was the most closely contested state in what was otherwise a landslide victory for Johnson that year.) Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] ended this streak in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], when he won Arizona by a little over two percentage points (Clinton had previously come within less than two percent of winning Arizona's electoral votes in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]]). From 2000 until 2016, the majority of the state continued to support Republican presidential candidates by solid margins. In the [[2020 United States presidential election]], [[Joe Biden]] again broke the streak by becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Merica|first=Dan|title=Biden carries Arizona, flipping a longtime Republican stronghold|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/biden-wins-arizona/index.html|access-date=2020-11-13|website=CNN}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general. The fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became increasingly friendly to Republicans from the 1950s onward. During this time, many "Pinto Democrats", or conservative Democrats from rural areas, became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level. While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level, Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections. Two of the last six governors have been Democrats.

On March 4, 2008, Senator [[John McCain]] effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008, becoming the first presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964.

Arizona politics are dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, [[Maricopa County|Maricopa]] and [[Pima County|Pima]]—home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.

Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there. Before [[Joe Biden]] won Maricopa County in 2020, it had voted Republican in every presidential election since 1948. This includes the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] run of native son Barry Goldwater; he would not have carried his home state without his 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Similarly, while McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008, aided by his 130,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.

In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically voted more Democratic. While Tucson's suburbs lean Republican, they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.

A November 2011 [[Public Policy Polling]] survey found 44% of Arizona voters supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56.2%–43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_AZ_1130424.pdf|title=AZ pro-civil unions, remembers Goldwater fondly|access-date=April 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513164507/http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_AZ_1130424.pdf|archive-date=May 13, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

On October 17, 2014, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne announced his office would no longer object to same-sex marriage, in response to a U.S. District Court Ruling on Arizona Proposition 102. On that day, each county's Clerk of the Superior Court began to issue same-sex marriage licenses, and Arizona became the 31st state to legalize same-sex marriage.

==Education==
===Elementary and secondary education===

Public schools in Arizona are separated into about 220 local school districts which operate independently, but are governed in most cases by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the [[Arizona State Board of Education]] and the [[Arizona Department of Education]]. A state [[Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction|Superintendent of Public Instruction]] (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when there is not a presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.

===Higher education===

[[File:Flagstaff NAU Skydome.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Arizona University]] (The Skydome) in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]]]

Arizona is served by three public universities: The [[University of Arizona]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Northern Arizona University]]. These schools are governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]].

Private higher education in Arizona is dominated by a large number of for-profit and "chain" (multi-site) universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1|title=College Navigator—Search Results|website=nces.ed.gov|access-date=February 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511163744/http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1|archive-date=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott]] and [[Prescott College]] are Arizona's only non-profit four-year private colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1&pg=2&id=105589|title=College Navigator—Prescott College|website=nces.ed.gov|access-date=February 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511163750/http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1&pg=2&id=105589|archive-date=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Arizona has a wide network of two-year vocational schools and [[community colleges]]. These colleges were governed historically by a separate statewide board of directors but, in 2002, the state legislature transferred almost all oversight authority to individual community college districts.<ref>2002 Legislature—HB 2710, which later became ARS 15-1444</ref> The Maricopa County Community College District includes 11 community colleges throughout Maricopa County and is one of the largest in the nation.

===Music===

{{main|Music of Arizona}}

Arizona is prominently featured in the lyrics of many [[Country and Western]] songs, such as [[Jamie O'Neal]]'s hit ballad "[[There Is No Arizona]]". [[George Strait]]'s "Oceanfront Property" uses "ocean front property in Arizona" as a metaphor for a sucker proposition. The line "see you down in Arizona Bay" is used in a [[Tool (band)|Tool]] song in reference to the possibility (expressed as a ''hope'' by comedian [[Bill Hicks]]) that Southern California will one day fall into the ocean. [[Glen Campbell]], a notable resident, popularized the song "[[By The Time I Get To Phoenix]]".
[[File:TakeItEasy WinslowAZ.jpg|thumb|[[Standin' on the Corner Park]] and mural in [[Winslow, Arizona]]]]

"Arizona" was the title of a popular song recorded by [[Mark Lindsay]]. Arizona is mentioned by the hit song "[[Take It Easy]]", written by [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Glenn Frey]] and performed by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Arizona is also mentioned in the Beatles' song "Get Back", credited to John Lennon and Paul McCartney; McCartney sings: "JoJo left his home in Tucson, Arizona, for some California grass."

Arizona's budding music scene is helped by emerging bands, as well as some well-known artists. The [[Gin Blossoms]], [[Chronic Future]], [[Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Caroline's Spine]], and others began their careers in Arizona. Also, a number of [[punk rock|punk]] and rock bands got their start in Arizona, including [[JFA (band)|JFA]], [[The Feederz]], [[Sun City Girls]], [[The Meat Puppets]], [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]], [[The Summer Set]], and more recently [[Authority Zero]] and [[Digital Summer]].

====Baseball====

Arizona is a popular location for [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], as it is the site of the [[Cactus League]]. Spring training was first started in Arizona in 1947, when Brewers owner Veeck sold them in 1945 but went onto purchase the Cleveland Indians in 1946. He decided to train the Cleveland Indians in [[Tucson]] and convinced the New York Giants to give [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] a try. Thus the Cactus League was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/2009/07/13/20090713mr-buckhorn0715ASF.html|title=Buckhorn Baths: A unique Mesa landmark|website=www.azcentral.com}}</ref>

On March 9, 1995, Arizona was awarded a franchise to begin to play for the 1998 season. A $130{{nbs}}million franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball and on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks were officially voted into the National League.

Since their debut, the Diamondbacks have won five National League West titles, one National League Championship pennant, and the [[2001 World Series]].
