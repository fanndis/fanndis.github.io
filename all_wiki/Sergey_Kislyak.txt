====2016 US Presidential election controversy====
{{main| Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections | Links between Trump associates and Russian officials}}
Kislyak has emerged as a central figure in the scandal involving [[Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election]], particularly through his contacts with Donald Trump officials including [[Jeff Sessions]], [[Michael Flynn]] and [[Jared Kushner]]. Sessions, later the [[United States Attorney General]], denied any contact with Russian officials during the campaign but was forced to recuse himself from the Russian investigation after the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] acknowledged he had spoken with Kislyak twice in 2016.

In July 2016, Kislyak held a "diplomacy conference" at the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in [[Cleveland]], during which his interactions with Trump officials became the subject of denial and controversy. In a speech in October 2016 in Detroit, Kislyak denied ever meeting with anyone involved in the Trump campaign. However, it later emerged that [[J. D. Gordon]] and [[Carter Page]] had spoken with Kislyak at the RNC. Kislyak did not attend the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="usatoday3217">{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Steve|title=Exclusive: Two other Trump advisers also spoke with Russian envoy during GOP convention|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/03/02/exclusive-two-other-trump-advisers-also-spoke-russian-envoy-during-gop-convention/98648190/|accessdate=27 May 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kaczynski|first1=Andrew|title=Russian ambassador denied meeting with Trump or campaign officials in October speech|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/09/politics/kfile-russian-ambassador-october-speech/|accessdate=27 May 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=9 March 2017}}</ref>

On 29 December 2016, the same day that the United States announced new sanctions against Russia for interfering with the election, Kislyak and then-U.S. [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] designate Michael Flynn had multiple telephone conversations and exchanged text messages.<ref name="WSJ" /> The phone calls are the subject of an investigation by U.S. counterintelligence agents.

On 1 March 2017, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] Jeff Sessions had spoken twice to Ambassador Kislyak, once in July 2016 and once in September 2016, during Sessions' tenure as [[United States Senate|US senator]] on the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]].

On 26 May 2017, ''The Washington Post'' reported that U.S. intelligence officials had, in the course of monitoring Kislyak in December, overheard him discussing a request from Jared Kushner to establish a secret, secure channel to communicate with the Kremlin that would not be monitored by U.S. intelligence. Kislyak was reporting Kushner's request to use "diplomatic facilities in the United States" when it was intercepted by U.S. intelligence. According to the report, "Kislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team." ''The Washington Post'' said that Russian officials occasionally leak "false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U.S. analysts," but that U.S. officials stated it was unclear what Kislyak would have gained by falsely reporting such an encounter at a time when the Kremlin was envisioning improved diplomatic relations under the incoming Trump administration.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nakashima|first1=Ellen|last2=Entous|first2=Adam|last3=Miller|first3=Greg|title=Russian ambassador told Moscow that Kushner wanted secret communications channel with Kremlin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-ambassador-told-moscow-that-kushner-wanted-secret-communications-channel-with-kremlin/2017/05/26/520a14b4-422d-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html|accessdate=27 May 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 May 2017|quote=Ambassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, son-in-law and confidant to then-President-elect Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials.

====Allegations of espionage====

Kislyak's connection to [[Russian Intelligence Community|Russian intelligence]] has been debated in the United States. CNN alleged that [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence]] officials have claimed Kislyak is a leading Russian spy and [[Recruitment of spies|spy recruiter]], which Russian officials have denied.<ref name="cnn3217"/> According to ABC News, former U.S. ambassadors and analysts contradicted with "strong skepticism" the claim that Kislyak is a spy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reevell|first1=Patrick|title=Who is the Russian ambassador who spoke with Jeff Sessions?|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/sergei-kislyak-russian-ambassador-spoke-jeff-sessions/story?id=45865497|work=ABC News|date=2 March 2017|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref> According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', "People who have worked closely with Kislyak doubt the ambassador was up to anything more than just doing his job." and quoted [[Michael McFaul]] former U.S. ambassador to Russia as saying "On political involvement, I personally don't think he crossed any lines".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Makhmutov|first1=Roman|title=Is Russia's ambassador a spy or diplomat?

German-American author and former [[KGB]] spy [[Jack Barsky]], however, evaluated Kislyak as a "very experienced operative" and told CNN that when Kislyak was sent to the United States in the early 1980s as a low-level diplomat, it is certain he would have been either a KGB agent or reporting directly to the KGB.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Preza|first1=Elizabeth|title='Mind-boggling': Ex-KGB spy aghast over reports 'naive' Kushner asked Russian envoy for backchannel l |url=http://www.rawstory.com/2017/05/mind-boggling-ex-kgb-spy-aghast-over-reports-naive-kushner-asked-russian-envoy-for-backchannel/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Raw Story|date=27 May 2017}}</ref> [[James Clapper]], former U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]], stated that Kislyak "oversees a very [[Russian espionage in the United States|aggressive intelligence operation]] in this country... and so to suggest that he is somehow separate or oblivious to that is a bit much".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hains|first1=Tim|title=Chuck Todd to James Clapper: Is Sergey Kislyak A KGB Agent?|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/28/chuck_todd_to_james_clapper_is_sergey_kislyak_a_kgb_agent.html|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=Real Clear Politics|date=28 May 2017}}</ref>

According to [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]'s [[Leonid Bershidsky]], during former FBI Director [[James Comey]]'s [[James Comey Senate Intelligence Committee testimony|Congressional testimony]] on June 8, 2017, Comey "made it clear he didn't consider Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to be an intelligence officer ... Comey said it was not improper for an incoming national security adviser to be in touch with a foreign diplomat. He also said, twice, that a story in an February issue of ''The New York Times'', headlined "Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence" and quoting unnamed officials, was gravely flawed. And he stated that closing the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Kislyak wouldn't be likely to impede the overall investigation into Russian interference; the two investigations, he added, were "touching but separate".<ref>"[https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-09/comey-testimony-offers-nothing-new-on-trump-russia-collusion Missing From Comey's Fireworks: Trump-Russia Collusion]".

==Political career==
On 21 August 2017, the same day Kislyak's term as Russian Ambassador to the United States ended, he announced his plans to enter politics as a candidate for the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council of Russia]] representing the [[Mordovia|Republic of Mordovia]], one of Russia's [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. He visited Mordovia and met with [[Vladimir Volkov (politician)|Vladimir Volkov]], the interim [[Head of the Republic of Mordovia]], and toured venues under construction for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. The election was scheduled for 10 September. The two other candidates were Mikhail Sezganov, chief federal inspector for Mordovia, and Pyotr Tultayev, mayor of [[Saransk]], the republic's capital.<ref name="ria2282017"/>
