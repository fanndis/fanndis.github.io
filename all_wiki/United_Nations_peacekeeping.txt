'''Peacekeeping by the United Nations''' is a role held by the [[Department of Peace Operations]] as "a unique and dynamic instrument developed by the organization as a way to help countries torn by conflict to create the conditions for lasting peace".<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/ United Nations Peacekeeping]</ref> It is distinguished from [[peacebuilding]], [[peacemaking]], and [[peace enforcement]] although the [[United Nations]] does acknowledge that all activities are "mutually reinforcing" and that overlap between them is frequent in practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/peace.shtml|title=Peace and Security|website=United Nations|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref>

[[Peacekeeping|Peacekeepers]] monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas and assist ex-combatants in implementing the [[peace agreement]]s they may have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers (often referred to as '''Blue Berets''' or '''Blue Helmets''' because of their light blue [[beret]]s or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.

The [[United Nations Charter]] gives the [[United Nations Security Council]] the power and responsibility to take [[collective action]] to maintain international [[peace]] and security. For this reason, the international community usually looks to the Security Council to authorize peacekeeping operations through [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]] authorizations.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Perspectives on International Relations|last = Nau|first = Henry|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4522-4148-7|location = Washington DC|pages = [https://archive.org/details/perspectivesonin0004nauh/page/252 252]|url = https://archive.org/details/perspectivesonin0004nauh/page/252}}</ref>

Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself, with troops serving under UN operational control. In these cases, peacekeepers remain members of their respective armed forces, and do not constitute an independent "UN army," as the UN does not have such a force. In cases where direct UN involvement is not considered appropriate or feasible, the Council authorizes regional organizations such as the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO),<ref name=":0" /> the [[Economic Community of West African States]], or coalitions of willing countries to undertake peacekeeping or peace-enforcement tasks.

Jean-Pierre Lacroix is the Head of the Department of Peace Operations. He took over from the former Under-Secretary-General Hervé Ladsous on 1 April 2017. DPKO's highest level doctrine document, entitled "United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines" was issued in 2008.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://pbpu.unlb.org/pbps/Library/Capstone_Doctrine_ENG.pdf  DPKO Capstone Doctrine]</ref>

Every peacekeeping mission is authorized by the Security Council.

==Formation==

Once a peace treaty has been negotiated, the parties involved might ask the United Nations for a peacekeeping force to oversee various elements of the agreed upon plan. This is often done because a group controlled by the United Nations is less likely to follow the interests of any one party, since it itself is controlled by many groups, namely the 15-member Security Council and the intentionally diverse [[United Nations Secretariat]].

If the Security Council approves the creation of a mission, then the [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] begins planning for the necessary elements. At this point, the senior leadership team is selected. The department will then seek contributions from member nations. Since the UN has no standing force or supplies, it must form ad hoc coalitions for every task undertaken. Doing so results in both the possibility of failure to form a suitable force, and a general slowdown in procurement once the operation is in the field. [[Romeo Dallaire]], force commander in Rwanda during the [[Rwandan genocide]] there, described the problems this poses by comparison to more traditional military deployments:

{{quote|He told me the UN was a "pull" system, not a "push" system like I had been used to with NATO, because the UN had absolutely no pool of resources to draw on. You had to make a request for everything you needed, and then you had to wait while that request was analyzed... For instance, soldiers everywhere have to eat and drink. In a push system, food and water for the number of soldiers deployed is automatically supplied. In a pull system, you have to ask for those rations, and no common sense seems to ever apply.|(''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands With the Devil]]'', Dallaire, pp. 99–100)}}

While the peacekeeping force is being assembled, a variety of diplomatic activities are being undertaken by UN staff. The exact size and strength of the force must be agreed to by the government of the nation whose territory the conflict is on. The [[Rules of Engagement]] must be developed and approved by both the parties involved and the Security Council. These give the specific mandate and scope of the mission (e.g. when may the peacekeepers, if armed, use force, and where may they go within the host nation). Often, it will be mandated that peacekeepers have host government minders with them whenever they leave their base. This complexity has caused problems in the field.

When all agreements are in place, the required personnel are assembled, and final approval has been given by the Security Council, the peacekeepers are deployed to the region in question.

===Financing===
[[File:East timor independence un2.jpg|thumb|Australian peacekeepers in [[East Timor]]]]
The financial resources of UN Peacekeeping operations are the [[collective responsibility]] of UN Member States. [[Group decision-making|Decisions]] about the establishment, maintenance or expansion of peacekeeping operations are taken by the Security Council. According to UN Charter every Member State is legally obligated to pay their respective share for peacekeeping. Peacekeeping expenses are divided by the General Assembly based upon a formula established by Member States which takes into account the relative economic wealth of Member States among other things.<ref name=un2016>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/financing.shtml|title=Financing peacekeeping.

===Structure===
A United Nations peacekeeping mission has three power centers. The first is the Special Representative of the [[UN Secretary General|Secretary-General]], the official leader of the mission. This person is responsible for all political and diplomatic activity, overseeing relations with both the parties to the peace treaty and the UN member-states in general. They are often a senior member of the Secretariat. The second is the Force Commander, who is responsible for the military forces deployed. They are a senior officer of their nation's armed services, and are often from the nation committing the highest number of troops to the project. Finally, the Chief Administrative Officer oversees supplies and logistics, and coordinates the procurement of any supplies needed.

==History==
{{Main|History of United Nations peacekeeping}}

===Cold War peacekeeping===<!-- This section is linked from [[T-34]] -->

[[File:Panhard AML in the Musée des Blindés, France, pic-1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Peacekeepers' [[Panhard]] [[Panhard AML|armoured car]] in the [[Musée des Blindés]], [[Saumur]], [[France]]. These vehicles have served with the UN since the inception of [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]].]]
[[File:Convoy trip in Mogadishu.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A Pakistani UNOSOM armed convoy making the rounds in Mogadishu.]]

United Nations peacekeeping was initially developed during the [[Cold War]] as a means of resolving conflicts between states by deploying unarmed or lightly armed military personnel from a number of countries, under UN command, to areas where warring parties were in need of a neutral party to observe the peace process. Peacekeepers could be called in when the major international powers ([[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|the five permanent members of the Security Council]]) tasked the UN with bringing closure to conflicts threatening regional stability and international peace and security. These included a number of so-called "[[proxy wars]]" waged by client states of the [[superpower]]s. As of December 2019, there have been [[Timeline of UN peacekeeping missions|72 UN peacekeeping operations]] since 1948, with seventeen operations ongoing. Suggestions for new missions arise every year.

The first peacekeeping mission was launched in 1948. This mission, the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO), was sent to the newly created [[State of Israel]], where a conflict between the Israelis and the Arab states over the creation of [[Israel]] had just reached a [[ceasefire]]. The UNTSO remains in operation to this day, although the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] has certainly not abated. Almost a year later, the [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP) was authorized to monitor relations between the two nations, which were split off from each other following the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] [[decolonization]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

As the [[Korean War]] ended with the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] in 1953,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10165796|title=The Korean War armistice|date=2015-03-05|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-09|language=en-GB}}</ref> UN forces remained along the south side of [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|demilitarized zone]] until 1967, when [[United States Military|American]] and South Korean forces took over.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Returning its attention to the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the United Nations responded to [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, a war between the alliance of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]], which was supported by other Arab nations. When a ceasefire was declared in 1957, [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/about-a_propos/pearson_nobel.aspx?lang=eng&view=d|title=Lester B. Pearson: 1957 Nobel Peace Prize Recipient}}</ref> (and future Prime Minister) [[Lester Bowles Pearson]] suggested that the United Nations station a peacekeeping force in the [[Suez]] in order to ensure that the ceasefire was honored by both sides. Pearson had initially suggested that the force consist of mainly Canadian soldiers, but the Egyptians were suspicious of having a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nation defend them against the United Kingdom and her allies. In the end, a wide variety of national forces were drawn upon to ensure national diversity. Pearson would win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for this work, and he is today considered a father of modern peacekeeping.{{citation needed|date= October 2016}}

In 1988, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping forces. The press release stated that the forces "represent the manifest will of the community of nations" and have "made a decisive contribution" to the resolution of conflict around the world.

===Since 1991===

The end of the Cold War precipitated a dramatic shift in UN and multilateral peacekeeping. In a new spirit of cooperation, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] established larger and more complex UN peacekeeping missions, often to help implement comprehensive peace agreements between belligerents in intra-State conflicts and [[civil wars]]. Furthermore, peacekeeping came to involve more and more non-military elements that ensured the proper functioning of civic functions, such as elections. The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations was created in 1992 to support this increased demand for such missions.

By and large, the new operations were successful. In [[El Salvador]] and [[Mozambique]], for example, peacekeeping provided ways to achieve self-sustaining peace. Some efforts failed, perhaps as the result of an overly optimistic assessment of what UN peacekeeping could accomplish. While complex missions in [[Cambodia]] and Mozambique were ongoing, the Security Council dispatched peacekeepers to conflict zones like [[Somalia]], where neither ceasefires nor the consent of all the parties in conflict had been secured. These operations did not have the manpower, nor were they supported by the required political will, to implement their mandates. The failures—most notably the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] and the [[Srebrenica massacre|1995 massacre]] in [[Srebrenica]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]—led to a period of retrenchment and self-examination in UN peacekeeping.

That period led, in part, to the [[United Nations Peacebuilding Commission]], which works to implement stable peace through some of the same civic functions that peacekeepers also work on, such as elections. The Commission currently works with six countries, all in Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/beyond-peace-deals-united-nations-experiment-peacebuilding|title=Beyond Peace Deals: The United Nations Experiment in "Peacebuilding"|date=June 22, 2010|website=Pulitzer Center}}</ref>

The [[UN Charter]] stipulates that to assist in maintaining peace and security around the world, all member states of the UN should make available to the Security Council necessary armed forces and facilities. Since 1948, close to 130 nations have contributed military and civilian police personnel to peace operations. While detailed records of all personnel who have served in peacekeeping missions since 1948 are not available, it is estimated that up to one million soldiers, police officers and civilians have served under the UN flag in the last 56 years.

Through October 2018, 3,767 people from over 100 countries had been killed while serving on peacekeeping missions.<ref>UN Peacekeeping, Fatalities,[https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/fatalities "Total Fatalities since 1949"]</ref> Many of those came from [[India]] (163), [[Nigeria]] (153), [[Pakistan]] (150), [[Bangladesh]] (146), and [[Ghana]] (138).<ref>UN Peacekeeping, [https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/statsbynationalitymission_2_15.pdf "Fatalities by Nationality and Mission up to 8/31/2018"]</ref> Thirty percent of the fatalities in the first 55 years of UN peacekeeping occurred in the years 1993-1995. About 4.5% of the troops and civilian police deployed in UN peacekeeping missions come from the [[European Union]] and less than one percent from the [[United States]] (USA).<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/overview.shtml|title=Peacekeeping Fact Sheet |publisher=United Nations|access-date=2010-12-20}}</ref>

The rate of reimbursement by the UN for troop-contributing countries per peacekeeper per month include: $1,028 for pay and allowances; $303 supplementary pay for specialists; $68 for personal clothing, gear and equipment; and $5 for personal weaponry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/faq/q10.htm|title=United Nations Peacekeepers - How are peacekeepers compensated?}}</ref>

== Results ==
According to scholar Page Fortna, there is strong evidence that the presence of peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; more peacekeeping troops leads to fewer battlefield and civilian deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Enough with the Pessimism about Peacekeeping|url = http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2015/09/24/enough-with-the-pessimism-about-peacekeeping/|website = Political Violence @ a Glance|access-date = 2015-10-22}}</ref> There is also evidence that the promise to deploy peacekeepers can help international organizations in bringing combatants to the negotiation table and increase the likelihood that they will agree to a cease-fire.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which international organizations can settle civil wars?|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=DOI 10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|issue=4|pages=613–641|doi=10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0|s2cid=152898046}}</ref>

However, there have been several reports during UN peacekeeping missions of human rights abuse by UN soldiers, notably in Central African Republic in 2015. The cost of these missions is also significant, with [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan|UNMISS]] in South Sudan costing $1 billion per year for 12,500 UN soldiers unable to prevent the country's movement towards civil war. Often missions require approval from local governments before deploying troops which can also limit effectiveness of UN missions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21730636-persecution-rohingya-latest-atrocity-un-has-failed|title=Peacekeepers in name only|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}</ref>

Nicholas Sambanis asserts that the presence of a UN peacekeeping mission is correlated with a positive effect on the achievement of peace, especially in the short-term. However, he notes that this effect is lessened over time. Thus, the longer that peacekeepers remain in a country, the greater the likelihood that peace will maintain.  Acknowledging the success that UN peacekeeping operations have achieved in increasing political participation, Sambanis claims that a greater focus on economic development would further increase the efficacy of peacekeeping efforts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sambanis|first=Nicholas|date=2008|title=Short- and Long-Term Effects of United Nations Peace Operations|journal=The World Bank Economic Review|volume=22|pages=9–32|doi=10.1093/wber/lhm022|hdl=10986/4470|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

Another study suggests that doubling the peacekeeping operation budget, stronger peacekeeping operation mandates and a doubling of the PKO budget would reduce armed conflicts by up to two thirds relative to a scenario without PKOs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hegre|first1=Håvard|last2=Hultman|first2=Lisa|last3=Nygård|first3=Håvard Mokleiv|date=2018-11-28|title=Evaluating the Conflict-Reducing Effect of UN Peacekeeping Operations|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/700203|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=81|issue=1|pages=215–232|doi=10.1086/700203|s2cid=13894244|issn=0022-3816}}</ref>

== Peacekeeping and cultural heritage ==

The UN Peacekeeping's commitment to protecting [[cultural heritage]] dates back to 2012, when there was extensive destruction in Mali. In this matter, the protection of a country's cultural heritage was included in the mandate of a United Nations mission (Resolution 2100) for the first time in history. In addition to many other advances, Italy signed an agreement with [[UNESCO]] in February 2016 to create the world's first emergency task force for culture, made up of civilian experts and the Italian Carabinieri. On the one hand, UN Peacekeeping trained its personnel with regard to the protection of cultural property and, on the other hand, there was intensive contact with other organizations concerned with it. The "Blue Helmet Forum 2019" was one of those events where the actors involved exchanged their previous experiences and tried to strengthen the cooperation. An outstanding mission was the deployment of the UN peace mission [[UNIFIL]] together with [[Blue Shield International]] in 2019 to protect the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] in Lebanon. It was shown that cultural property protection (carried out by military and civil specialists) forms the basic basis for the future peaceful and economic development of a city, region or country in many conflict zones. The need for training and coordination of the military and civilian participants, including the increased involvement of the local population, became apparent.<ref>[https://www.bundesheer.at/cms/artikel.php?ID=10118 "Blue Helmet Forum 2019 - Protection of Cultural Heritage in Peace Operations", Austrian Armed Forces]</ref><ref>[https://en.unesco.org/courier/2017nian-di-3qi/historic-resolution-protect-cultural-heritage A historic resolution to protect cultural heritage, The UNESCO Courier]</ref><ref>[https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/action-plan-to-preserve-heritage-sites-during-conflict Action plan to preserve heritage sites during conflict - United Nations Peacekeeping, 12 April 2019.]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Austrian Armed Forces Mission in Lebanon|url=https://www.krone.at/1911689|language=de}}</ref><ref>''UNESCO Director-General calls for stronger cooperation for heritage protection at the Blue Shield International General Assembly.''

==Crimes by peacekeepers==
===Peacekeeping, human trafficking, and forced prostitution===
{{Further|Peacekeeping#Peacekeeping, human trafficking, and forced prostitution}}
Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in [[Cambodia]] and [[Mozambique]] after UN peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children", former first lady of Mozambique Graça Machel documented: "In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in child prostitution."<ref name="unicef.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf|title=The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children}}</ref>

[[Gita Sahgal]] spoke out in 2004 with regard to the fact that prostitution and [[sex abuse]] crops up wherever [[humanitarian intervention]] efforts are set up. She observed: "The issue with the [[UN]] is that [[peacekeeping operation]]s unfortunately seem to be doing the same thing that other militaries do. Even the guardians have to be guarded."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1126/p06s02-wogi.html | title=Sex charges haunt UN forces | date=November 26, 2004 | access-date=16 February 2010 | via=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>

==Proposed reform==

===Brahimi analysis===
In response to criticism, particularly of the cases of sexual abuse by peacekeepers, the UN has taken steps toward reforming its operations. The [[Report of the Panel of United Nations Peacekeeping|Brahimi Report]] was the first of many steps to recap former peacekeeping missions, isolate flaws, and take steps to patch these mistakes to ensure the efficiency of future peacekeeping missions. The UN has vowed to continue to put these practices into effect when performing peacekeeping operations in the future. The technocratic aspects of the reform process have been continued and revitalised by the DPKO in its "Peace Operations 2010" reform agenda. This included an increase in personnel, the harmonization of the conditions of service of field and headquarters staff, the development of guidelines and standard operating procedures, and improving the partnership arrangement between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), African Union and European Union. 2008 capstone doctrine entitled "United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Principles and Guidelines"<ref name="autogenerated1" /> incorporates and builds on the Brahimi analysis.

===Rapid reaction force===
One suggestion to account for delays such as the one in Rwanda, is a rapid reaction force: a standing group, administered by the UN and deployed by the Security Council, that receives its troops and support from current Security Council members and is ready for quick deployment in the event of future genocides.<ref name="Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations">[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/55/305 Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations], 2000.</ref>

===Restructuring of the UN secretariat===
The UN peacekeeping capacity was enhanced in 2007 by augmenting the DPKO with the new Department of Field Support (DFS). Whereas the new entity serves as a key enabler by co-ordinating the administration and logistics in UN peacekeeping operations, DPKO concentrates on policy planning and providing strategic directions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping==
The Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping initiative was established in 2014 by the Information and Communications Technology Division of the former Department of Field Support (DFS) with an objective to bring greater involvement to peacekeeping through innovative approaches and technologies that have the potential to empower UN global operations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping |url=https://operationalsupport.un.org/en/partnership-technology-peacekeeping |website=operationalsupport.un.org}}</ref>

The Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping holds annual symposiums. The 5th International Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping Symposium was held in [[Nur-Sultan]], [[Kazakhstan]] from 28 to 31 May 2019. It was the first time the Central Asian country held such event on peacekeeping. [[Jean-Pierre Lacroix (French diplomat)|Jean-Pierre Lacroix]], UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, and [[Atul Khare]], UN Under-Secretary-General for Field Support, participated in the symposium.<ref>{{cite web |title=5th International Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping Symposium kicks off in Kazakhstan |url=https://www.inform.kz/en/5th-international-partnership-for-technology-in-peacekeeping-symposium-kicks-off-in-kazakhstan_a3531218 |website=inform.kz}}</ref>
