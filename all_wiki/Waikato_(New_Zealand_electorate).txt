'''Waikato''' is an electorate in the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. A Waikato electorate was first created in 1871 and an electorate by this name has existed from 1871 to 1963, 1969 to 1996, and 2008 to the present, though exact borders have often changed. 

The Waikato electorate is represented by [[Tim van de Molen]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], who has held the seat since the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]]. Both the current Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] and the current Opposition Leader [[Judith Collins]] were born and raised within its borders.

The Waikato electorate, whose borders were last altered in 2020,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Boundary Review 2019/20 {{!}} Elections|url=https://elections.nz/democracy-in-nz/historical-events/boundary-review-2019-2020/|access-date=2020-10-20|website=elections.nz|language=en-NZ}}</ref> is in the [[Waikato|Waikato region]] and includes largely rural areas to the north and the west of the city of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. The [[Waikato River]] flows along near its southern boundary then travels north through the electorate. It includes small portions of the outskirts of Hamilton and [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]]. Towns within the electorate include [[Morrinsville]], [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]], and [[Matamata]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Electorate Map|url=https://elections.nz/map/index.html?id=2&modified=0|access-date=2020-10-20|website=elections.nz}}</ref> each of which have populations around 8,000.

In a piece for the 2020 election, journalist Tom Rowland described the area as "one of the country's most vital regions, home to farmers and agricultural industries that continue to hold New Zealand's economy steady in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic". Rowland considered it to be a key area for future economic development, calling it "the key to activating the Golden Triangle between Auckland, Hamilton and Tauranga."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Rowland|first=Tom|date=7 August 2020|title=Election 2020: National and Labour eye the Waikato region as beating heart to New Zealand|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/waikato-news/news/election-2020-national-and-labour-eye-the-waikato-region-as-beating-heart-to-new-zealand/X4X4PUE3HFD2VHG2RNUSR5YVPQ/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-20|website=NZ Herald|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Creation and seat holders prior to 1938 ===
The Waikato electorate was first contested in the {{NZ election link|1871}}.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=165}} [[James McPherson (New Zealand politician)|James McPherson]] was elected, but he resigned the same year, on 20 December.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=124}} [[William Jackson (New Zealand politician)|William Jackson]] won the resulting {{By-election link|Waikato|1872}}. Jackson retired at the end of the parliamentary term in 1875.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=116}} [[Frederick Whitaker]] won 5 January [[1875–1876 New Zealand general election|1876 election]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=147}} In the {{NZ election link|1879}}, Whitaker contested the {{NZ electorate link|Eden}} electorate but was beaten by [[Joseph Tole]].<ref name="DNZB Whitaker">{{DNZB|Stone|R. C. J. |1w17|Whitaker, Frederick – Biography|14 March 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=144}}

The Waikato electorate was won by [[John Blair Whyte]] in the 1879 election, who served for eleven years until 1890 when he retired. Whyte was appointed to the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] in the following year.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|pp=87, 147}} [[John Bryce]], who first became Member of the House of Representatives during the [[4th New Zealand Parliament|4th Parliament]], succeeded Whyte in the {{NZ election link|1890}}, but he resigned in the following year.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=97}} The resulting {{By-election link|Waikato|1891}} was won by [[Edward Lake (politician)|Edward Lake]], who retired at the end of the parliamentary term in 1893.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=211}}

The {{NZ election link|1893}} was won by [[Alfred Cadman]] for the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], who had been an MP in various electorates since 1881. At the next election in {{NZ election link year|1896}}, Cadman successfully contested the {{NZ electorate link|Ohinemuri}} electorate.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=99}} The Waikato electorate was won by [[Frederic Lang]] in 1896, who represented the electorate until his defeat by the Liberal Party's [[Henry Greenslade]] in the {{NZ election link|1905}}.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=119}} Greenslade held the electorate until [[1911 New Zealand general election|1911]],{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=109}} when he was defeated by the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform]] candidate [[Alexander Young (New Zealand politician)|Alexander Young]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=149}}

Young won subsequent elections in {{NZ election link year|1914}} and {{NZ election link year|1919}}. In the {{NZ election link|1922}}, he successfully contested the newly formed {{NZ electorate link|Hamilton}} electorate.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=149}} Young was succeeded by the Liberal candidate [[Frederick Lye]] in the Waikato electorate in 1922.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=121}} At the {{NZ election link|1925}}, Lye was defeated by Reform's [[Daniel Stewart Reid]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=134}} Lye in turn defeated Reid at the {{NZ election link|1928}}, but this time standing for the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]]. The [[United–Reform Coalition]] was established just before the {{NZ election link|1931}} and Lye was again successful.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=121}} In the {{NZ election link|1935}}, Lye was beaten by [[Robert Coulter (New Zealand politician)|Robert Coulter]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=102}} Coulter served only one term in Waikato, as he was defeated by the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] candidate [[Stan Goosman]] in the {{NZ election link|1938}}. 

=== 1938 onward ===
Since 1938, the Waikato electorate (when it has existed) has always been held by a National Party member. This trend has lasted through 2020, when the seat was retained by National MP Tim van de Molen.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Waikato - Preliminary Count|url=https://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020_preliminary/electorate-details-56.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Electoral Commission}}</ref> Other electorates which covered parts of this region have also strongly supported National. The electorates of [[Piako (New Zealand electorate)|Piako]], [[Matamata (New Zealand electorate)|Matamata]], and [[Karapiro (New Zealand electorate)|Karapiro]] were entirely National-held during their time as electorates, the [[Hamilton (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton electorate]] was held by National from 1943 until it was dissolved in 1969, and the [[Waipa (New Zealand electorate)|Waipa electorate]] was held by National from 1954 until its dissolution in 1996.

Goosman, who had taken Waikato in 1938, also won the {{NZ election link|1943}}, but successfully contested the {{NZ election link|1946}} in the newly formed {{NZ electorate link|Piako}} electorate.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=109}} Goosman was succeeded in Waikato by [[Geoffrey Sim]] in 1946.{{sfn|Scholefield|1950|p=139}} Sim held the electorate until it was abolished in 1963, when he contested [[Piako (New Zealand electorate)|Piako]] instead.{{sfn|Wilson|1985}} 

The Waikato electorate was re-established in [[1969 New Zealand general election|1969]] following the Electoral Act of 1965, which led to substantial changes in the number, shape, and size of electorates across the country.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=108, 111, 112}}{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=111}}{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=107, 111}}{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=108, 112}}{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=111f}} These changes came into effect with the {{NZ election link|1969}}.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|p=111}} The first representative was National's [[Lance Adams-Schneider]], who had previously represented the [[Hamilton (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton electorate]]. Adams-Schneider retired from Parliament in 1981 and became Ambassador of New Zealand to the [[List of ambassadors of New Zealand to the United States|United States]] in the following year.{{sfn|Wilson|1985}} Adams-Schneider was succeeded by National's [[Simon Upton]], who won the {{NZ election link|1981}} and started his long parliamentary career with one term in Waikato. Upton contested the {{NZ electorate link|Raglan}} in the {{NZ election link|1984}} and was succeeded by National's [[Rob Storey]] in Waikato. Storey held the electorate until it was abolished again in the electorate changes that came with the introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed-member proportional]] voting in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]]. 

The Waikato electorate was re-established in 2006 for the 2008 election.<ref>{{cite web|date=17 April 2020|title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf}}</ref>

[[Lindsay Tisch]], who had been the MP for Piako since 2002, won Waikato at the {{NZ election link|2008}}.<ref name="2008 Waikato" /> Tisch retained his seat at the in the {{NZ election link|2011}}<ref name="2011 Waikato" /> and the 2014 election, but he announced he would not stand for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/81167337/mp-lindsay-tisch-not-to-seek-reelection|accessdate=27 September 2017|title=MP Lindsay Tisch not to seek re-election|date=20 June 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref> The seat was won by Tim van de Molen, retaining it for the National Party, who won it again in 2020.

The most recent boundary changes to Waikato occurred in 2020, when more area was added in its north and its south, as well as areas just outside Hamilton and [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]].<ref name=":1" />

Three of the five National Party members of parliament for Waikato were cabinet ministers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}
