The '''Eastern Time Zone''' ('''ET''') is a [[time zone]] encompassing part or all of 23 [[U.S. states|states]] in the eastern part of the [[United States]], parts of eastern Canada, the state of [[Quintana Roo]] in Mexico, Panama in Central America, and Colombia, mainland Ecuador, Peru, and a small portion of westernmost Brazil in South America, along with certain [[Caribbean]] and Atlantic islands.

Places that use:

* '''Eastern Standard Time''' ('''EST'''), when observing [[standard time]] (autumn/winter), are five hours behind [[Coordinated Universal Time]] ([[UTC−05:00]]).
* '''Eastern Daylight Time''' ('''EDT'''), when observing [[daylight saving time]] (spring/summer), are four hours behind Coordinated Universal Time ([[UTC−04:00]]).

In the northern parts of the time zone, on the second Sunday in March, at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. EST, clocks are advanced to 3:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT leaving a one-hour "gap". On the first Sunday in November, at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00&nbsp;a.m. EST, thus "duplicating" one hour. Southern parts of the zone (Panama and the Caribbean) do not observe daylight saving time.

The largest city in the Eastern Time Zone is [[New York City|New York]]; the [[New York metropolitan area]] is the largest metropolitan area in the zone.

==History==
The boundaries of the Eastern Time Zone have moved westward since the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) took over time-zone management from railroads in 1938. For example, the easternmost and northernmost counties in [[Kentucky]] were added to the zone in the 1940s, and in 1961 most of the state went Eastern. In 2000, [[Wayne County, Kentucky|Wayne County]], on the [[Tennessee]] border, switched from Central to Eastern.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Louisville? |url=http://loumag.epubxp.com/i/532701-jul-2015/30?m4= |website=Louisville magazine |accessdate=10 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720051713/https://loumag.epubxp.com/i/532701-jul-2015/30?m4= |archive-date=20 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In March 2018, the [[Florida]] Legislature passed a bill requesting authorization from [[United States Congress|Congress]] for year-round daylight saving time, which would effectively put Florida on [[Atlantic Time Zone|Atlantic Standard Time]] year-round (except for west of the [[Apalachicola River]], which would be on Eastern Standard Time year-round).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Klas |first1=Mary Ellen |title=Legislature approves year-round daylight saving time—but it's not a done deal yet |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article203781769.html |accessdate=30 March 2018 |work=[[Miami Herald]] |date=6 March 2018}}</ref> A similar bill was proposed for the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]] by [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|its legislative assembly]] in late 2020, which would have a similar effect on the province if passed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ontario MPP puts forward bill to make Daylight Saving Time standard time|last1=Patton|first1=Jessica|date=7 October 2020|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/7384245/ontario-mpp-bill-end-daylight-saving-time/|accessdate=9 October 2020|work=[[Global News]]}}</ref>

==Daylight saving time==
For those in the United States, daylight saving time for the Eastern Time Zone was introduced by the [[Uniform Time Act]] of 1966, which specified that daylight saving time would run from the last Sunday of April until the last Sunday in October.<ref name="edt">{{cite web |last=Prerau |first=David |title=Early adoption and U.S. Law |work=Daylight Saving Time |publisher=Web Exhibit |year=2006 |url=http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/e.html |accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref> The act was amended to make the first Sunday in April the beginning of daylight saving time beginning in 1987.<ref name="edt" />

Later, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] extended daylight saving time in the United States, beginning in 2007. Since then, local times change at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. EST to 3:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT on the second Sunday in March, and return from 2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT to 1:00&nbsp;a.m. EST on the first Sunday in November.<ref name="edt" /> In Canada, daylight saving time begins and ends on the same days and at the same times as it does in the United States.<ref name="statoidus">{{cite web |last=Law |first=Gwillim |title=United States Time Zones |date=2007-09-21 |url=http://www.statoids.com/tus.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Daylight Saving Time Starts Sunday |publisher=Government of Ontario |date=2008-03-07 |url=https://news.ontario.ca/archive/en/2008/03/08/R-E-P-E-A-T-Daylight-Saving-Time-Starts-Sunday.html |accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref>

==Canada==
{{main|Time in Canada}}

In [[Canada]], the following [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] are part of the Eastern Time Zone:<ref>{{cite web |title=Time zones and daylight saving time |url=https://nrc.canada.ca/en/certifications-evaluations-standards/canadas-official-time/time-zones-daylight-saving-time |website=nrc.canada.ca |publisher=National Research Council Canada |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |date=March 23, 2019}}</ref>

* [[Ontario]], most of
* [[Quebec]], most of
* [[Nunavut]], most of

All observe daylight saving time in sync with the United States, with very localized exceptions.

==United States==
{{main|Time in the United States}}
The boundary between time zones is set forth in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], with the boundary between the Eastern and [[Central Time Zone]]s being specifically detailed at 49 CFR 71.<ref>The specification for the Eastern Time Zone is set forth at 49 CFR 71.4, and is listed in [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/49cfr71.4.htm text] and [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/pdf/49cfr71.4.pdf PDF] formats. The boundary between Eastern and Central is set forth at 49 CFR 71.5, and is listed in [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/49cfr71.5.htm text] and [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/octqtr/pdf/49cfr71.5.pdf PDF] formats.</ref>

Seventeen states and [[Washington, D.C.]] are located entirely within the Eastern Time Zone. They are:

* [[Connecticut]]
* [[Delaware]]
* [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
* [[Maine]]
* [[Maryland]]
* [[Massachusetts]]
* [[New Hampshire]]
* [[New Jersey]]
* [[New York (state)|New York]]
* [[North Carolina]]
* [[Ohio]]
* [[Pennsylvania]]
* [[Rhode Island]]
* [[South Carolina]]
* [[Vermont]]
* [[Virginia]]
* [[West Virginia]]

Five states are partly in the Eastern Time Zone, with the remaining portions in the Central Time Zone. They are:

* [[Florida]] – peninsula and [[Big Bend (Florida)|Big Bend]] regions east of the [[Apalachicola River]] along with portions of [[Gulf County, Florida|Gulf County]] south of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]].
* [[Indiana]] – all except for northwest ([[Gary, Indiana|Gary]]) and southwest ([[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]]) regions
* [[Kentucky]] – eastern 60%, including the state's three largest metropolitan areas: Louisville, Lexington, Northern Kentucky
* [[Michigan]] – all, except for the four [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] counties that border [[Wisconsin]]: [[Gogebic County, Michigan|Gogebic]], [[Iron County, Michigan|Iron]], [[Dickinson County, Michigan|Dickinson]], and [[Menominee County, Michigan|Menominee]]
* [[Tennessee]] – [[East Tennessee]]<ref>http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/060813/zones.shtml</ref>

==Mexico==
{{main|Time in Mexico}}
* [[Quintana Roo]]: This is the only Mexican state to observe EST. It moved from Central Time to Eastern Time after a successful lobbying effort by tourism interests.<ref>{{cite web |title=On Mexican Time: Changing Time Zones To Accommodate Tourism |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2015/01/29/on-mexican-time-changing-time-zones-to-accommodate-tourism/ |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref>  Quintana Roo does not observe daylight saving time.

==Caribbean islands==
The Bahamas and Haiti officially observe both Eastern Standard Time during the winter months and Eastern Daylight Time during the summer months. Cuba generally follows the U.S. with Eastern Standard Time in the winter, and Eastern Daylight Time in the summer, but the exact day of change varies year to year. Cayman Islands and Jamaica use Eastern Standard Time year-round.

===Turks and Caicos Islands===
The Turks and Caicos Islands followed Eastern Time with daylight saving until 2015, when the territory switched to the [[Atlantic Time Zone]]. The Turks and Caicos Islands switched back to the pre-2015 schedule in March 2018.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/turks-caicos-dst.html |title=DST Dates Confirmed |publisher=Timeanddate.com |date=25 July 2017 |accessdate=10 January 2019}}</ref> A 2017 consultation paper highlighted the advantage for business and tourism of being in the same time zone as the [[eastern United States]] as an important factor in the decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.tc/images/Consultation_Paper_on_Daylight_Savings_Time.pdf |title=Consultation paper Daylight Saving |pages=6–7 |date=April 2017 |access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref>

==Central and South America==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}
In [[Central America]], the countries from Guatemala to Costa Rica use Central Standard Time [[UTC−06:00]] year-round, but Panama uses Eastern Standard Time (UTC−05:00) year-round.

In [[South America]], the state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] and the southwest part of the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] (both in Brazil), along with Colombia, Ecuador (except for the [[Galápagos Islands]], which use Central Standard Time), and Peru also use Eastern Standard Time year-round.
