'''Barry John Sheerman''' (born 17 August 1940) is a British [[Labour and Co-operative|Labour Co-op]] [[politician]] who has been the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] since the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].

==Early life==
Sheerman was born on 17 August 1940 in [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], [[Middlesex]] and went to Hampton Grammar School (which became the independent [[Hampton School]] in 1975) on Hanworth Road in [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], then on to Kingston Technical College.

He graduated from the [[London School of Economics]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] Economics 1965) and from the [[University of London]] (MSc 1967). He became a lecturer at the [[Swansea University|University of Wales, Swansea]] in 1966 and remained there until his election to parliament in 1979.

==Parliamentary career==
Sheerman unsuccessfully contested [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]] in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]], and became the MP for Huddersfield East from 1979 to 1983 and for [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] since the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]]. Sheerman has held the Huddersfield seats since, with his majority as low as 3,955 in 1983 and as high as 15,848 in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. In the most recent general election in [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]], Sheerman's majority was decreased to 4,937 with a swing of 7.8% to the Conservatives, in line with many other seats in Yorkshire.

From 1983 to 1988, Sheerman was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] spokesperson on education and employment; for [[Home Affairs]] (as Shadow Deputy [[Home Secretary]]) from 1988 to 1992; and for Disabled People's Rights from 1992 to 1994. He was  Chair of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Education and Skills [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] from 2001 to 2010, renamed the [[Children, Schools and Families Committee]] in 2007.

Under his chairmanship, the Committee was often critical of government policy. Sheerman warned the government not to "lose their nerve" over reforming secondary education exam system back in 2005,<ref>{{cite news|title=End A-level 'obsession', says MP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4284407.stm|website=BBC|accessdate=7 April 2015|date=21 February 2005}}</ref> and in 2006 said it was "naive" to allocate local school places through parental choice, with lottery selection being the best way to avoid "bloody awful" schools existing as a side effect of parents pushing for their children to study elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parental school choice 'naive'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/5237548.stm|accessdate=7 April 2015|publisher=BBC|date=2 August 2006}}</ref> During Sheerman's chairmanship, the select committee produced reports on subjects such as home education, education outside the classroom, and young people not in education employment or training (NEETs).

Sheerman consistently voted for the Iraq war,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10534/barry_sheerman/huddersfield/divisions?policy=1049 |title = Barry Sheerman MP, Huddersfield, voting record}}</ref> and has nearly always voted to block subsequent independent investigations into the war, with the most recent such vote in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10534/barry_sheerman/huddersfield/divisions?policy=975 |title = Barry Sheerman MP, Huddersfield, voting record}}</ref> He is a member of [[Labour Friends of Israel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lfi.org.uk/in-parliament/|title=LFI Supporters in Parliament|accessdate=8 September 2019|work=Labour Friends of Israel}}</ref>

Outside parliament, he is Chair of the National Educational Research and Development Trust, and a trustee of the [http://yorkshirechildrenscentre.org.uk/ National Children's Centre]. His political interests are listed as trade, industry, finance, [[further education]], education, economy, the [[European Union]], [[South America]] and the [[United States]].

In June 2009, Sheerman called for a secret ballot of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] on whether [[Gordon Brown]] should continue in office as prime minister. This followed widespread criticism of Brown's performance and the resignation of Cabinet member [[James Purnell]]. Sheerman later reassured his local party chairman that he had not directly called for Brown's resignation.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2009/06/06/huddersfield-mp-sheerman-called-to-account-by-local-party-members-86081-23804506/| title = Huddersfield MP Sheerman called to account by local party members| author = Gibson, Barry| date = 6 June 2009| accessdate = 6 June 2009|work  = [[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]}}</ref>

Sheerman called for a London catering company to employ "English workers" in a [[Twitter]] exchange on 23 April 2012.<ref>Barry Gibson [http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2012/04/25/huddersfield-mp-barry-sheerman-demands-british-jobs-for-british-workers-after-disappointing-bacon-buttie-86081-30832588/ "Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman demands British jobs for British workers after disappointing bacon buttie"], ''Huddersfield Daily Examiner'', 25 April 2012</ref> The comments reached the national press. In response Sheerman said the objection to him speaking out was "pernicious political correctness".<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/9226143/MP-accused-of-xenophobia-after-complaining-that-Polish-cannot-make-decent-bacon-sandwich.html "MP accused of 'xenophobia after complaining that Polish cannot make decent bacon sandwich"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 25 April 2012</ref>

In June 2015, Sheerman caused controversy when he argued that lowering the voting age to 16, by reducing childhood, might raise the risk of sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-33188463|title=Votes at 16 raises abuse risk, says MP|date=18 June 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>
