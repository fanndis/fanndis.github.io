The '''Roberts Court''' is the time since 2005 during which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has been led by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]]. It is generally considered more conservative than the preceding [[Rehnquist Court]], as well as the most conservative court since the 1940s [[Vinson Court]]. This is due to the retirement of moderate Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]], and the death of liberal Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and the subsequent confirmation of the conservative Justices [[Samuel Alito]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], and [[Amy Coney Barrett]] in their place, respectively.<ref name="nyt-liptak01">{{cite news | first = Adam | last = Liptak | title = Court Under Roberts Is Most Conservative in Decades | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/us/25roberts.html | work = New York Times | location = [[New York City|New York, New York]] | date = 2010-07-24 | accessdate = 2010-08-05 }}</ref>

==Membership==
Roberts was originally [[John Roberts Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] by President [[George W. Bush]] to replace Associate Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], who had decided to retire from the Court, effective with the confirmation of her successor. However, before the Senate could act upon Roberts' nomination to be an Associate Justice, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] died, and President Bush nominated Roberts for the Chief Justice vacancy.  Roberts' nomination as Chief Justice was confirmed by the Senate in 2005. Roberts took the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] [[oath of office#United States|oath of office]], administered by senior Associate Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] (who was the acting Chief Justice during the vacancy) at the [[White House]], on September 29, 2005, almost immediately after his confirmation. On October 3, Roberts took the judicial oath provided for by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], prior to the first oral arguments of the 2005 term. The Roberts Court commenced with Roberts as Chief Justice and eight holdovers from the [[Rehnquist Court]]: Stevens, O'Connor, [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[David Souter]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]].

President Bush  [[Samuel Alito Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Samuel Alito]] (after the withdrawal of Bush's first nominee, [[White House Counsel]] [[Harriet Miers]]) to replace O'Connor, and he was confirmed in January 2006. In 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] [[Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Sonia Sotomayor]] to replace Souter, and in 2010 Obama [[Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Elena Kagan]] to replace Stevens. After six years, Justice Scalia died in February 2016. In the following month Obama [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Merrick Garland]], but Garland's nomination was never considered by the Senate, and it expired when the Senate's 114th Congress ended and the 115th Congress began on January 3, 2017. Eleven days after the [[inauguration of Donald Trump|2017 Inauguration]], on January 31, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] [[Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Neil Gorsuch]] to replace Scalia. Democrats in the Senate filibustered the Gorsuch nomination, which led to the Republicans exercising the "[[nuclear option]]". After that, Gorsuch was confirmed in April 2017. On July 9, 2018, Trump nominated [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to replace Kennedy (who retired on July 31)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44634176|title=Trump gets chance to reshape top court|date=2018-06-27|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>, and he was confirmed on October 6, 2018. Justice Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020; Trump [[Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination|nominated]] [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to succeed her and was confirmed on October 26, 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett as Supreme Court justice|last1=Vazquez|first1=Maegan|last2=Liptak|first2=Kevin|date=September 26, 2020|publisher=CNN|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/26/politics/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-nominee/index.html|accessdate=October 2, 2020}}</ref>

*''[[Massachusetts v. EPA]]'' (2007): In a 5–4 decision in which the majority opinion was delivered by Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court upheld the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s right to [[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act|regulate]] [[carbon dioxide]] under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].
*''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008): In a 5–4 decision in which the majority opinion was delivered by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court held that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applies]] to [[federal enclave]]s, and that the amendment protects the right of individuals to possess a firearm, regardless of service in a militia. ''[[McDonald v. City of Chicago]]'' (2010), in a 5–4 decision written by Justice Alito, extended this protection to the states.
*''[[Ashcroft v. Iqbal]]'' (2009): In a 5–4 decision written by Justice Kennedy, the court reversed the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]]'s decision not to dismiss a suit against former Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] and others that claimed that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] engaged in discriminatory activities following the [[9/11 attacks]]. The court also extended the [[Twiqbal|heightened pleading standard]] established in ''[[Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly]]'' (2006), which had previously applied only to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]. The number of [[Motion in United States law#Motion to dismiss|dismissals]] greatly increased after the ''Iqbal'' ruling.<ref name="iqbal">{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Supreme Court Ruling Altered Civil Suits, to Detriment of Individuals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/9-11-ruling-by-supreme-court-has-transformed-civil-lawsuits.html|accessdate=March 3, 2016|work=New York Times|date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>
*''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' (2010): In a 5–4 decision in which the majority opinion was delivered by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that the provisions of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] which regulated [[independent expenditure]]s in political campaigns by corporations, unions, and non-profits violated [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[freedom of speech]] rights.
*''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' (2012): In a 5–4 decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court upheld most of the provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], including the [[individual mandate]] to buy health insurance. The mandate was upheld as part of Congress's power of [[Taxing and Spending Clause|taxation]]. In a subsequent case, ''[[King v. Burwell]]'' (2015), the Court upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, this time in a 6–3 opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts.
*''[[Arizona v. United States]]'' (2012): In a 5–3 decision delivered by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that portions of [[Arizona SB 1070]], an Arizona law regarding immigration, unconstitutionally usurped the federal authority to regulate immigration laws and enforcement.
*''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013): In a 5–4 decision delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court struck down Section 4(b) of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which provided a coverage formula for Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

*''[[Timbs v. Indiana]]'' (2019): In a 9-0 decision, the Court ruled that the "excessive fines" clause of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] is [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated]] against state and local governments, affecting the use of [[civil forfeiture]]s.

==Judicial philosophy==
{{see also|Ideological leanings of U.S. Supreme Court justices}}
The Roberts Court has been described as "conservative in most cases, liberal in some," with (prior to the death of Justice Scalia) five conservative-leaning justices and four liberal-leaning justices. Alito, Thomas, Kennedy, Roberts, and Scalia generally have taken more conservative positions, while Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan have generally taken more liberal positions. Souter and Stevens had also been part of the liberal bloc prior to their respective retirements. These two blocs of voters have lined up together in several major cases, though Justice Kennedy has often sided with the liberal bloc. Roberts has also served as a swing vote, often advocating for narrow rulings and compromise among the two blocs of Justices.<ref name="rwolf">{{cite news|last1=Wolf|first1=Richard|title=Chief Justice John Roberts' Supreme Court at 10, defying labels|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/09/28/supreme-court-john-roberts-conservative-liberal/72399618/|accessdate=February 25, 2016|publisher=USA Today|date=September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name="hfairfield">{{cite news|last1=Fairfield|first1=Hannah|title=A More Nuanced Breakdown of the Supreme Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/upshot/a-more-nuanced-breakdown-of-the-supreme-court.html|accessdate=February 25, 2016|work=New York Times|date=June 26, 2014}}</ref> Though the Court sometimes does divide along partisan lines, attorney and [[SCOTUSblog]] founder [[Tom Goldstein]] has noted that more cases are decided 9–0 and that the individual judges hold a wide array of views.<ref name=Goldstein2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/06/everything-you-read-about-the-supreme-court-is-wrong/|last=Goldstein | first= Tom|author-link=Tom Goldstein|title=Everything you read about the Supreme Court is wrong (except here, maybe)|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref>

The judicial philosophy of Roberts on the Supreme Court has been assessed by leading court commentators including Jeffrey Rosen<ref name="newrepublic.com">{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/104898/john-roberts-supreme-court-aca|title=Big Chief|first=Jeffrey|last=Rosen|date=July 13, 2012}}</ref> and Marcia Coyle.<ref name="ReferenceA">Marcia Coyle, ''The Roberts Court: The Struggle for the Constitution'', 2013.</ref> Although Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, his vote in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]]'' (2012) upholding the constitutionality of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) has caused reflection in the press concerning the comparative standing of his conservative judicial philosophy compared to other sitting justices of conservative orientation; he is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when his vote to uphold the ACA is compared to [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist's]] vote in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.<ref name="Scalia, Antonin 2008">Scalia, Antonin; [[Bryan A. Garner|Garner, Bryan A.]] (2008) ''Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges'' (St. Paul: Thomson West) {{ISBN|978-0-314-18471-9}}.</ref>

Regarding Roberts' contemporaneous peers on the bench, his judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than that of [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]].<ref name="newrepublic.com"/><ref name="Scalia, Antonin 2008"/> Unlike Scalia, Roberts has not indicated any particularly enhanced reading of [[originalism]] or framer's intentions as has been plainly evident in Scalia's speeches and writings.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Roberts' strongest inclination on the Court has been to attempt to re-establish the centrist orientation of the Court as being party neutral, in contrast to his predecessor Rehnquist who had devoted significant effort to promote a states rights orientation for the Court. Roberts' voting pattern reflecting his conservative judicial philosophy is most closely aligned to [[Samuel Alito]] on the Court,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/24/upshot/24up-scotus-agreement-rates.html|title=Which Supreme Court Justices Vote Together Most and Least Often|date=June 24, 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> the latter of whom has also become associated with libertarian trends in the conservative judicial philosophy.<ref name="newrepublic.com"/>
