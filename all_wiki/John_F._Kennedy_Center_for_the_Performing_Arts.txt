The '''John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts''' (formally known as the '''John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts''', and commonly referred to as the '''Kennedy Center''') is the United States '''National Cultural Center''', located on the [[Potomac River]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It was named in 1964 as a memorial to [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. Opened on September 8, 1971, the center hosts many different genres of performance art, such as [[theater]], [[dance]], [[orchestra]]s, [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[folk music]].

Authorized by the 1958 National Cultural Center Act of Congress,<ref name=sbccstw>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tL9eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VzEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2328%2C3245154 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=U.S. capital seeks to build culture center |date=October 21, 1962 |page=2}}</ref> which requires that its programming be sustained through private funds, the center represents a [[public–private partnership]]. Its activities include educational and outreach initiatives, almost entirely funded through ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations.

The building, designed by architect {{nowrap|[[Edward Durell Stone]],<ref name=sbccstw/>}} was constructed by Philadelphia contractor [[John McShain]], and is administered as a bureau of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. An earlier design proposal called for a more curvy, spaceship-inspired building similar to how the Watergate complex appears today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghostsofdc.org/2014/02/24/kennedy-center-looked-like/|title=The Kennedy Center Could Have Looked Like This|last=Tom|date=2014-02-24|website=Ghosts of DC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>  The center receives annual federal funding to pay for building maintenance and operation.

==History==
The idea for a national cultural center dates to 1933 when [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] discussed ideas for the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|Emergency Relief and Civil Works Administration]] to create employment for [[unemployment|unemployed]] actors during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="meersman-p527">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |pages=527–528}}</ref> [[United States Congress|Congress]] held [[congressional hearing|hearings]] in 1935 on plans to establish a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet level]] Department of Science, Art and Literature, and to build a monumental theater and arts building on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] near the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] building. A 1938 congressional resolution called for construction of a "public building which shall be known as the '''National Cultural Center'''" near [[Judiciary Square]], but nothing materialized.<ref name="meersman-p527"/>

[[File:Hall of States.jpg|thumb|left|Flags in the Hall of States]]
The idea for a national theater resurfaced in 1950, when [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Arthur George Klein]] of New York introduced a bill to authorize funds to plan and build a cultural center. The bill included provisions that the center would prohibit any discrimination of cast or audience. In 1955, the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the center.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/timeline1.html| title=Timeline of SRI International Innovations: 1940s - 1950s| publisher=[[SRI International]]| accessdate=2012-07-01| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129224242/http://www.sri.com/about/timeline/timeline1.html| archivedate=November 29, 2006| df=mdy-all}}</ref> From 1955 to 1958, Congress debated the idea amid much controversy. A bill was finally passed in Congress in the summer of 1958 and on September 4, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed into law the National Cultural Center Act which provided momentum for the project.<ref name="meersman-p529">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=529}}</ref>

This was the first time that the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] helped finance a structure dedicated to the performing arts. The legislation required a portion of the costs, estimated at $10–25 million, to be raised within five years of the bill's passage.<ref name="meersman-p541">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=541}}</ref> Edward Durell Stone was selected as architect for the project in June 1959.<ref name="meersman-p542">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=542}}</ref> He presented preliminary designs to the President's Music Committee in October 1959, along with estimated costs of $50 million, double the original estimates of $25–30 million. By November 1959, estimated costs had escalated to $61 million.<ref name="meersman-p543">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=543}}</ref> Despite this, Stone's design was well received in editorials in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Washington Star]]'', and quickly approved by the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], [[National Capital Planning Commission]], and the [[National Park Service]].<ref name="meersman-p544">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=544}}</ref>

The National Cultural Center was renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1964, following the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]].<ref name="nyt-robertson">{{cite news |title=At Last, the Performances Begin |work=The New York Times |last=Robertson |first=Nan |date=September 6, 1971 |authorlink=Nan C.

===Fundraising===
The National Cultural Center Board of Trustees, a group President Eisenhower established January 29, 1959, led fundraising.<ref name="meersman-p541"/> Fundraising efforts were not successful, with only $13,425 raised in the first three years.<ref name="meersman-p545">{{cite journal |last=Meersman |first=Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |year=1980 |volume=50 |page=545}}</ref> President John F.

The Kennedy Center features a {{convert|630|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|63|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} grand foyer, with 16 hand-blown [[Orrefors glassworks|Orrefors crystal]] chandeliers (a gift from [[Sweden]]) and [[red carpet]]ing. The Hall of States and the Hall of Nations are both {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|63|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} corridors. The building has drawn criticism about its location (far away from [[Washington Metro]] stops), and for its scale and [[visual appearance|form]],<ref name="weeks" /> although it has also drawn praise for its [[acoustics]], and its [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] overlooking the Potomac River.<ref name="weeks" /> In her book ''On Architecture'', [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] called it "[[Gemütlichkeit|gemütlich]] [[Albert Speer|Speer]]."<ref name=Huxtable>{{cite book| first=Ada Louise| last=Huxtable| authorlink=Ada Louise Huxtable| page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802717078/page/82 82]| title=On Architecture: Collected Reflections on a Century of Change| publisher=Bloomsbury| year=2008| isbn=978-0-8027-1707-8| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780802717078/page/82| url-access=subscription}}</ref>

[[Helicopter]] traffic over the Kennedy Center is also fairly high.

===Artwork===
The plaza entrance of the Kennedy Center features two [[Wikt:tableau|tableaus]] by German sculptor [[:de:Jürgen Weber (Bildhauer)|Jürgen Weber]]; created between 1965 and 1971, which were a gift to the Kennedy Center from the [[West German]] government. Near the north end of the plaza is a display of nude figures in scenes representing [[war and peace]], called ''War or Peace''. The piece, {{convert|8|×|50|×|1.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, depicts five scenes showing the symbolism of war and peace: a war scene, murder, family, and creativity.<ref name="SOS">{{cite web |year=1994 |title=War or Peace, (sculpture) |work=Save Outdoor Sculpture, District of Columbia survey |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!322453~!0#focus |accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref> At the south end is ''America'' which represents Weber's image of America (8 × 50 × 1.5&nbsp;ft.).

==Venues==
[[File:Kennedy center diagram.svg|thumb|right|375px|Layout of the three main theaters at the Kennedy Center]]

The Kennedy Center has three main theaters: the Concert Hall, the Opera House, and the Eisenhower Theater.

===Concert Hall===
The Concert Hall, located at the south end of the Center, seats 2,442 including chorister seats and stage boxes, and has a seating arrangement similar to that used in many European halls such as [[Musikverein]] in Vienna. The Concert Hall is the largest performance space in the Kennedy Center and is the home of the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]]. A 1997 renovation brought a high-tech acoustical canopy, handicap-[[accessibility|accessible]] locations on every level, and new seating sections (onstage boxes, chorister seats, and parterre seats). The [[Hadeland Glassverk|Hadeland]] crystal chandeliers, given by the Norwegian Crown, were repositioned to provide a clearer view.<ref name="nyt-gifts" /> Canadian organbuilder [[Casavant Frères]] constructed and installed a new pipe organ in 2012.<ref name=Wakin>{{cite web| last=Wakin| first=Daniel J.| work=The New York Times| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/kennedy-center-to-replace-its-pipe-organ/| title=Kennedy Center to Replace Its Pipe Organ| date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Opera House===
The Opera House, in the middle, has about 2,300 seats. Its interior features include walls covered in red velvet, a distinctive red and gold silk curtain, given by the Japanese government, and [[J. & L. Lobmeyr|Lobmeyr]] crystal chandelier with matching pendants, which were a gift from the government of [[Austria]].<ref name="nyt-gifts" /> It is the major opera, ballet, and large-scale musical venue of the Center, and closed during the 2003/2004 season for extensive renovations which provided a revised seating arrangement and redesigned entrances at the orchestra level. It is the home of the [[Washington National Opera]] and the annual [[Kennedy Center Honors]].

===Eisenhower Theater===
The Eisenhower Theater, on the north side, seats about 1,163 and is named for President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who signed the National Cultural Center Act into law on September 2, 1958. It primarily hosts plays and musicals, smaller-scale operas, ballet and contemporary dance. The theater contains an orchestra pit for up to 35 musicians that is convertible to a forestage or additional seating space. The venue reopened in October 2008, following a 16-month renovation which altered the color scheme and seating arrangements.

===Other performance venues===

[[File:First Lady Melania Trump at the Kennedy Center (48415137691).jpg|thumb|upright|The Millennium Stage in 2019]]
Other performance venues in the Center include:
*'''The Family Theater''', with 324 seats, opened December 9, 2005. It replaced the former [[American Film Institute]] Theater located adjacent to the Hall of States.  Designed by the architectural firm Richter Cornbrooks Gribble, Inc. of Baltimore, the new theater incorporates a computerized rigging system; and a digital video projection system.
*'''The Terrace Theater''', with 513 seats, was constructed on the roof terrace level in the late 1970s as a Bicentennial gift from the people of Japan to the United States. It is used for chamber music, ballet and contemporary dance, and theater.
*'''The Theater Lab''', with 399 seats, currently houses the whodunit ''[[Shear Madness]]'' which has been playing continuously since August 1987.
*'''The Millennium Stage'''. Part of the concept of "Performing Arts for Everyone" launched by then-Chairman James Johnson in the winter of 1997, the Millennium Stage provides free performances every evening at 6:00 pm on two specially created stages at either end of the Grand Foyer. A broad range of art forms are featured on the Millennium Stage. These include performing artists and groups from all 50 states and an Artist-in-Residence program featuring artists performing several evenings in a month. Every show on the Millennium Stage is available as a simulcast of the live show at 6:00 pm, and is archived for later viewing via the Kennedy Center's website.
*'''The Terrace Gallery'''. On March 12, 2003, the space formerly known as the Education Resource Center was officially designated the Terrace Gallery. It is now home to the Kennedy Center [[Jazz]] Club.

===River and rooftop terraces===
The Kennedy Center offers one of the few open-air rooftop terraces in Washington, D.C.; it is free of charge to the public from 10:00&nbsp;a.m. until midnight each day, except when closed for private events. The wide terrace provides views in all four directions overlooking the [[Rosslyn, Arlington, Virginia|Rosslyn]] skyline in [[Arlington, Virginia]], to the West; the Potomac River and National Airport to the South; the Washington Harbor and the Watergate Complex to the North; and the [[Lincoln Memorial]], [[Department of State]] buildings, [[George Washington University]] and the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] Embassy to the East.

==Productions==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

===Dance===
World premiere performances of Kennedy Center-commissioned works have been offered through a commissioning program for new ballet and dance works. These works have been created by America's foremost choreographers—Paul Taylor, [[Lar Lubovitch]], and Merce Cunningham—for leading American dance companies including American Ballet Theatre, Ballet West, Houston Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, and the San Francisco Ballet. The Kennedy Center formerly supported and produced the Suzanne Farrell Ballet in performances at the Center and on extended tours.

The Center sponsors two annual dance residency programs for young people; Exploring Ballet with Suzanne Farrell and the Dance Theatre of Harlem Residency Program, both now in their second decade. The Kennedy Center's Contemporary Dance series offers a wide range of artistic perspectives, from the foremost masters of the genre to the art form's newest and most exciting artists. In the 2008/2009 series, the Kennedy Center recognized Modern Masters of American Dance, bringing [[Martha Graham Dance Company]], [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]], [[José Limón|Limón Dance Company]], [[Mark Morris Dance Group]], [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]], [[Bill T.

Since its establishment in September 1971, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has showcased jazz in solo, various ensembles, and big band settings. In 1994, the Kennedy Center appointed Dr. [[Billy Taylor]] as Artistic Advisor for Jazz, and his first installation was his own radio show ''Billy Taylor's Jazz at the Kennedy Center''. Featuring his trio and guest artists in performance and discussion, the series ran for seven seasons on [[NPR]]. Since Taylor's appointment in 1994, the Center has initiated numerous performance programs to promote jazz on a national stage, featuring leading international artists and rising stars, including: the [[Art Tatum]] Piano Panorama, named after Dr. Taylor's mentor; the [[Louis Armstrong]] Legacy, highlighting vocalists; the [[Mary Lou Williams]] Women in Jazz Festival, the first festival by a major institution promoting outstanding female jazz artists; Beyond Category, featuring artists whose work transcends genre; the Platinum Series, with internationally acclaimed headliners; Jazz Ambassadors with the [[United States Department of State]], sending musicians on worldwide goodwill tours (1998–2004); the KC Jazz Club, a highly praised intimate setting; and Discovery Artists in the KC Jazz Club, highlighting up-and-coming talent. Kennedy Center and NPR annually collaborated on the beloved holiday broadcast 'NPR's Piano Jazz Christmas', until the retirement of host Marian McPartland, and hence the show, in 2011. Since 2003, the Center's jazz programs have been regularly broadcast on NPR's ''JazzSet'' with [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]]. Recent highlights, produced by the Center, have included ''Great Vibes, A Salute to [[Lionel Hampton]]'' (1995); ''Billy Taylor's 80th Birthday Celebration'' (2002); ''[[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], A Career Celebration'' (2003); ''[[Michel Legrand]] with [[Patti Austin]]'', part of the Center's Festival of France (2004); ''A Tribute to [[Shirley Horn]]'' (2004); ''[[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]'s 80th Birthday'' (2005); and ''[[Benny Golson]] at 80'' (2009).

During Dr. Taylor's tenure, the Center has created recognized educational initiatives, including national jazz satellite distance-learning programs; adult lecture series; master classes and workshops with national artists and local metropolitan Washington, D.C. students; and [[Betty Carter]]'s Jazz Ahead—continuing the singer's legacy of identifying outstanding young talent. In 2015, [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Tony Bennett]] performed there as part of their [[Cheek to Cheek Tour]].

The [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the Kennedy Center's artistic affiliate since 1987, has commissioned dozens of new works, among them [[Stephen Albert]]'s ''RiverRun'', which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music; [[Morton Gould]]'s ''[[Stringmusic]]'', also a Pulitzer Prize-winner; [[William Bolcom|William Bolcom's]] Sixth Symphony, and [[Michael Daugherty]]'s ''UFO'', a concerto for solo percussion and orchestra.

In addition to its regular season concerts, the National Symphony Orchestra presents outreach, education, and pops programs, as well as concerts at [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts|Wolf Trap]] each year. The annual American Residencies for the Kennedy Center is a program unique to the National Symphony Orchestra and the Center. The Center sends the Orchestra to a different state each year for an intensive period of performances and teaching encompassing full orchestral, chamber, and solo concerts, master classes and other teaching sessions. The Orchestra has given these residencies in 20 states so far: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North and South Carolina, Oklahoma, North and South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Nevada, and Wyoming/Montana.

===Performing Arts for Everyone (PAFE)===
The Kennedy Center is the only U.S. institution that presents a free performance 365 days a year, daily at 6pm (12 noon on December 24th). The Millennium Stage, created as part of the Center's Performing Arts for Everyone initiative in 1997 and underwritten by James A. Johnson and Maxine Isaacs, features a broad spectrum of performing arts, from dance and jazz, to chamber music and folk, comedy, storytelling and theater. In the past twelve years, over three million people have attended Millennium Stage performances. The Millennium Stage has presented more than 42,000 artists, which includes over 4,000 international artists from more than 70 countries; performers representing all 50 states; and 20,000 Washington-area ensembles and solo artists. The Charlie Byrd Trio and the Billy Taylor Trio were the first artists to delight audiences with a free performance on March 1, 1997. In 1999, the Center began web-casting each night's live performance, and continues to archive and maintain each event in a database of over 3,000 performances which may be accessed via the Center's website. Performing Arts for Everyone initiatives also include low- and no-cost tickets available to performances on every stage of the Kennedy Center, and several outreach programs designed to increase access to Kennedy Center tickets and performances.
