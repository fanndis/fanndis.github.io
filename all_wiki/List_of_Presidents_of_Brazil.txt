==The Old Republic (1889–1930)==
{{Main|First Brazilian Republic}}
In 1889 the [[Empire of Brazil]] was abolished and replaced with a republic in a [[coup d'état]] led by Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]], who deposed Brazilian Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], proclaimed Brazil a Republic and formed a Provisional Government. The 15 November 1889 military coup actually began as an attempt to overthrow the Empire's Prime Minister, [[Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto]], but the unprecedented coup against a Prime Minister appointed by the Emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the elected Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the abolition of the monarchy. With the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic, the Empire's Constitution ceased to operate, the Imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) ceased to exist, and not only was the Viscount of Ouro Preto removed from office, but the position of Prime Minister itself ceased to exist. As head of the provisional government, Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca ruled by decree, discharging both the functions of head of state and of head of government. The former provinces of the Empire were reorganized as states and the newly proclaimed republic was declared a federation, formed by the perpetual union of those states.

In 1890, elections for a Constituent Congress were summoned and held, but the decree of the Provisional Government that created the Congress required it to adopt a Constitution that conformed to the recently proclaimed republican system of Government, and that organized the recently declared Federal State. In February 1891, a new Brazilian Constitution was adopted, based on the [[federal republic]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The country itself was named the Republic of the United States of Brazil. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the presidents of the Republic were to be elected by direct popular ballot, but, for the first presidential term, the President and Vice President would be chosen by the Constituent Congress; the Constituent Congress was to elect the first President and Vice President immediately after the promulgation of the Constitution. In accordance with those transitional provisions, Congress elected the then Head of the Provisional Government, Deodoro da Fonseca, as the first President of the Republic. Marshal Floriano Peixoto, was elected by Congress to be the first Vice President. The inauguration of the first President and of the first Vice President was held on 26 February 1891, only two days after the promulgation of the Constitution. Deodoro resigned the presidency ten months later after a coup d'état in which he dissolved Congress was reversed. Then, [[Floriano Peixoto]], Deodoro's Vice President, was inaugurated as President. In 1894, Peixoto was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first President of Brazil to be elected by direct popular ballot. De Morais, who was the first president to be elected under the permanent provisions of the Constitution adopted in 1891, was also the first civilian to assume the presidency.

Although it was theoretically a [[constitutional democracy]], the Old Republic was characterized by the power of regional [[oligarchy|oligarchies]] and the seldom broken alternation of power in the federal sphere between the states of [[São Paulo state|São Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. The vote in the countryside was often controlled by the local land owner, and less than 6% of the population had the right to vote due to literacy requirements.

In 1930, when Brazil was suffering the effects of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], a revolution broke out in the country and the old republic ended. President [[Washington Luís]], who was supported by São Paulo oligarchies, broke the expected alternation between São Paulo and Minas and supported a candidate who was also from São Paulo, [[Júlio Prestes]]. Prestes won the rigged election, but Washington Luís was deposed three weeks before the end of his term and Prestes was never inaugurated.

| {{small|''Head of the Provisional Government<br>from 15 November 1889''}}<br>26 February 1891{{efn|In a military coup d'état on 15 November 1889, Marshal of the Army Deodoro da Fonseca overthrew the government of the Empire of Brazil, led by Prime Minister the Viscount of Ouro Preto. The unprecedented military coup against a prime minister appointed by the emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the proclamation of the republic on that same date; thus, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was deposed by Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca and the monarchy was declared abolished. The constitution then in force ceased to operate, and the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state, was replaced with a federal republic, each province of the empire becoming a state. Until the organization of the republic's constitutional order, however, the central Government appointed the governments of the several States. The imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) was dissolved, and Deodoro formed a provisional government. Deodoro as head of the provisional government could appoint and dismiss the other members of that government, and discharged by decree absolute legislative and executive powers. The provisional government was in effect a dictatorship, and remaining monarchist sentiment in society was repressed, as the government and the army were committed to the consolidation of the recently declared republic. The imperial family and their descendants were banished from the country by decree of the provisional government, and the dynasty's exile was only revoked in 1920. On 15 January 1890 Deodoro, as head of the Provisional Government, assumed for himself the unique military rank of [[Generalissimo]] of Land and Sea. In 1890 elections for a constituent congress were held, but the congress (made up of a senate with equal representation of the newly declared states and of a Chamber of Deputies with delegations proportional to the size of the population of each State) was required to adopt a constitution that conformed to the republican system of government and to the federal model of state. Congress assembled in November 1890 and a draft constitution, prepared by a committee of republican jurists and politicians appointed by the Provisional Government, was submitted to Congress by the head of the provisional government, and formed the basis for the congressional deliberations. The Constitution was promulgated by Congress on 24 February 1891. It confirmed the abolition of the parliamentary system of government and created a presidential Executive, widely based on the model of the United States of America. Presidents and vice-presidents were to be elected for 4 years, without the possibility of re-election, by direct popular ballot, but for the first presidential term, Congress was to conduct the election immediately after the adoption of the constitution. Subsequent presidents were to be elected on 1 March and inaugurated on 15 November, starting in the year 1894. Accordingly, under those transitional rules, on 25 February 1891, the day after the adoption of the constitution, Congress voted for president and vice-president, and the then head of the provisional government, Generalissimo Deodoro da Fonseca, was elected to become the nation's first President. The voting for vice-president took place immediately after the counting of the votes for President, and Marshal Floriano Peixoto was chosen by Congress to be the first vice-president. The swearing in of Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto as president and vice-president, respectively, took place on the following day, 26 February 1891, and that inauguration marked the termination of the Provisional Government.}}
| 23 November 1891{{efn|In a coup d'état on 3 November 1891, President Deodoro da Fonseca shut down the National Congress and ruled by decree for a few weeks, attempting to suspend the Constitution and to establish a dictatorial regime in the fashion of the Spanish American ''[[caudillos]]''. There was a reaction by the Brazilian Navy against Deodoro's coup (the [[Revolta da Armada|First Revolt of the Armada]]) and Deodoro was forced to resign the presidency. Deodoro was effectively deposed by the forces loyal to the Constitution in a counter-coup d'état, but because he yielded to the demands of the Navy and agreed to resign the presidency, neither the constitutional impeachment process nor a formal overthrow without impeachment (that would also have been a violation of the Constitution, this time by the counter-coup forces) took place, and instead Deodoro's removal from office was formalized as a simple resignation. Many officers in the Brazilian Navy were still monarchists, opposed Deodoro, and only reluctantly accepted the newly created Republic, but were unwilling to see it be transformed from a constitutional state into a dictatorship. Upon Deodoro's resignation on 23 November 1891, Vice-President Floriano Peixoto succeeded to the presidency and reversed Deodoro's coup. The constitutional legal order was restored, Deodoro's dissolution of Congress was deemed null and void, and Deodoro's other acts since the coup were similarly declared invalid.}}

| 14 November 1894{{efn|Marshal of the Army Floriano Peixoto, Deodoro's Vice-President, succeeded to the Presidency upon President Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca's resignation. The Constitution then in force stipulated that, whenever the Presidency became vacant during the first half of presidential term, new elections should be summoned at once, and the Vice-President should serve as President only until the inauguration of a new elected President. Deodoro had resigned during the first half of his presidential term (he had been sworn-in as President on 26 February 1891 to serve until 15 November 1894 and had resigned the office on 23 November 1891), but the new President, Floriano Peixoto, refused to summon new elections, arguing that the constitutional provision requiring new elections should only apply if the Presidency had been vacated during the first half of the presidential term by a President elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution. Floriano held that, because Deodoro and himself had been respectively elected President and Vice-President by the Constituent Congress under the transitional provisions of the Constitution, and because the Constitution directed that the first elections by direct popular ballot should be held on 1 March 1894 to choose the President that would be inaugurated on 15 November 1894 for the first regular four year term, no elections needed to take place in the wake of Deodoro's resignation, neither by Congress, nor by direct popular ballot. Accordingly, Floriano Peixoto continued to serve as president for the remainder of the first presidential term, that is, until 15 November 1894. Because his interpretation of the Constitution was disputed by several political forces and his manner was regarded as also dictatorial, Floriano faced many revolts (including the [[Revolta da Armada|Second Revolt of the Armada]], that the Administration managed to defeat), and Floriano governed under state of siege, with the right of habeas corpus and several other constitutional rights suspended (in accordance with the emergency provisions of the Constitution), for most of his time in office. Floriano also took advantage of the emergency powers of the state of siege to further suppress remaining pockets of Monarchist sentiment in society and in Brazil's political life, and for this reason he has been dubbed the "consolidator of the Republic". In 1894 he was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first President to be elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution and also the first civilian to hold office as President of Brazil.}}

| {{small|''Head of the Provisional Government from<br>3 November 1930''}}<br>20 July 1934{{efn|[[Getúlio Vargas]] governed by decree from 3 November 1930 to 20 July 1934, as Head of the Provisional Government, with absolute powers. On 9 July 1932 a revolution broke out in the State of São Paulo, demanding the restoration of Constitutional Government. The revolution was defeated by the Government, but it led to Vargas finally making good on his promise to summon a Constituent Assembly. The 1933-1934 Constituent Assembly promulgated Brazil's new Constitution on 16 July 1934, and, under the Constitution's transitional provisions, the first President was to be elected by the Assembly, and subsequent presidents were to be elected by direct popular ballot. In accordance with those rules, on 17 July 1934 the Constituent Assembly voted for President and Vargas won the election. Accordingly, Vargas, who until then was Head of the Provisional Government, was sworn-in as President of the Republic on 20 July 1934, for a term of office that would last until the inauguration of a successor on 3 May 1938. However, on 10 November 1937, Vargas led a coup d'état and proclaimed the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship, imposing a new Constitution that allowed him to rule by decree. Both the referendum provided in the 1937 Constitution that would have confirmed the adoption of the new constitutional legislation, and the elections provided in the 1937 Constitution were never held, under the pretext of a state of emergency. Accordingly, Vargas effectively extended his term of office indefinitely. State Governors were replaced by Federal Interventors appointed by the President of the Republic, and the Legislative chambers in both Federal and State level were dissolved. The new Legislative bodies created by the 1937 Constitution were never elected, due to the state of emergency that lasted until the end of the regime, and accordingly, during that whole period (1937-1945) the President of the Republic and the Interventors appointed to the several States discharged both Executive and Legislative powers, on a theoretically provisional, but effectively permanent, basis. Political parties were abolished, and opposition to the regime was suppressed. Thus, under the Estado Novo, President Vargas ruled Brazil as a dictator, until he was deposed by the military, in an insurrection led by Vargas's own Minister of War, on 29 October 1945.}}
| 29 October 1945{{efn|By 1945, Vargas was under strong pressure from his own supporters to reform his authoritarian Estado Novo regime and to allow for the restoration of democratic freedoms in Brazil. On 28 February 1945, the dictator yielded to those mounting demands and signed a statute granting amnesty to his opponents, amending the 1937 Constitution and finally summoning elections for the Parliament it had established, that had never assembled. The elections were to be held on 2 December 1945. The Legislature would have the power to reform the Constitution; a further statute issued on 28 May 1945 also scheduled presidential elections for 2 December. On 2 October, the Superior Electoral Court ruled that the Parliament's powers to reform the Constitution would be unlimited. Political parties had been allowed to organize for the first time since 1937, and there was rising opposition to Vargas, in spite of the constraints still placed by the regime on freedom of expression. However, the political atmosphere was one of suspicion and insecurity, given Vargas' authoritarian record. There were fears that the elections could be cancelled, or that they would be manipulated by Vargas. In those circumstances, a group of Vargas' own Generals, led by the Minister of War, General Pedro Aurélio de Góes Monteiro, turned against the dictator and deposed him from office in a sudden palace coup on 29 October 1945. The military then handed over power to the President of the Supreme Court, and safeguarded the freedom of the December 1945 elections, in which all parties were allowed to take part, from Communists to right-wing landowners; from Vargas's staunch opponents to his most loyal defenders. The deposed dictator himself (who still mustered strong popular support on account of the many social reforms implemented during his government, that created the Brazilian welfare state) was elected a Senator by the State of Rio Grande do Sul. He would go on to be elected President in 1950.}}

==The Republic of 46 (1946–1964)==
{{Main|Fourth Brazilian Republic}}
In 1945, Vargas was deposed by a military coup led by ex-supporters. Nevertheless, he would be elected president once again and his influence in Brazilian politics would remain until the end of the Fourth republic. In this period, three parties dominated the national politics. Two were pro-Vargas – in the left, [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|PTB]] and in the center-right, PSD – and another anti-Vargas, the rightist UDN.

This period was very unstable. In 1954, Vargas committed suicide during a crisis that threatened his government and he was followed by a series of short-term presidents. In 1961, UDN won national elections for the first time, supporting Jânio Quadros, who himself was a member of a minor party allied to UDN. Quadros, who, before his election, rose meteorically in politics with an anti-corruption stance, unexpectedly resigned the presidency seven months later. Some historians suggest that Quadros was heavily drunk when he signed his resignation letter, while others suggest that Quadros felt that Congress would not accept his vice-president as president, and would ask for his return. Those historians, therefore, see Quadros' resignation as an attempt to return to office with increased powers and more political support. It is possible that both occurred: Quadros was drunk when he resigned, and in that state, he devised the plan to return to power by Congressional request. The plot failed: Congress simply received Quadros' letter, and amid the shock of politicians and of the Nation, the letter was entered into the records of Congress and the presidency was declared vacant. The president of Congress, Senator Auro de Moura Andrade, took the view that the deed of resignation was the province of the elected president, that it was not subject to a congressional vote, needing no confirmation, and that the president's declaration of resignation was final.

At that time, the President and Vice President of Brazil were voted into office separately. The Vice President was a political enemy of Jânio Quadros, the leftist João Goulart. Goulart was out of the country, and Congress was controlled by right wing politicians. During Goulart's absence, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Ranieri Mazzilli, took office as Acting President of Brazil. There was then a plot to block the inauguration of the Vice President as President, but Congressional resistance to the inauguration of Goulart led to a reaction by the Governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who led a "legality campaign", and to a split in the military (that, during the fourth Republic, intervened heavily in politics). Amid the political crisis, the solution was the adoption by Congress of a Constitutional Amendment abolishing the presidential executive and replacing it with a parliamentary system of government. Under that negotiated solution, Goulart's inauguration was allowed to proceed, but Goulart would be Head of State only, and a prime minister approved by Congress would lead the government. The new system of government's continued existence was subject to popular approval in a referendum scheduled for 1963. The result of this referendum restored the presidential executive and a military coup deposed Goulart in 1964, starting the military dictatorship.

The Constitution adopted on 18 September 1946 specified that the first Vice President would be elected by the Constituent Assembly itself on the day following the promulgation of the Constitution, and would take office on the same date, to serve until the inauguration of the President and Vice President that would take office in 1951.

| 24 August 1954{{efn|Vargas committed suicide on 24 August 1954. The political climate at the time of President Vargas' suicide was one of turmoil and instability. Vargas was a former dictator, who had been democratically elected President of Brazil in 1950 by direct popular ballot under the 1946 Constitution. In 1953, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry accused the Government of illegally aiding newspaper owner Samuel Wainer to obtain loans from the State-owned bank Banco do Brasil in exchange for political support by his ''Última Hora'' newspaper. This accusation resulted in an impeachment petition against Vargas that reached the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, but the impeachment attempt failed, and the charges were accordingly never presented to the Senate, because the Chamber of Deputies rejected the impeachment petition in June 1954. The political atmosphere, however, remained very tense. Shortly afterwards, a criminal attempt against the life of leading Opposition politician Carlos Lacerda on 5 August 1954 (an episode in Rio de Janeiro known as the Tonelero Street shooting), that resulted in the death of his bodyguard, Air Force Major Rubens Vaz, led to accusations by the Opposition that the criminal act had been orchestrated by Vargas himself or by his aides, and in late August 1954 it was widely expected that a section of the military would soon intervene in politics once again, to depose President Vargas due to that incident. Indeed, investigations conducted by the Air Force Police found that Gregório Fortunato, a member of President Vargas' bodyguard, had orchestrated the criminal act against Carlos Lacerda that resulted in the death of Major Rubens Vaz. A Military Inquiry on the death of Major Rubens Vaz, conducted at Rio's Galeão Air Force Base, also uncovered evidence of corruption involving both Fortunato and Manuel Vargas, the President's son. Although some claimed that the President's supporters had acted alone, without his knowledge, opponents of the President claimed that he had ordered Lacerda's assassination and that he was the mastermind behind the shooting. Those circumstances resulted in agitation in the military against the President, and, on the eve of his suicide, troops were already on the move to depose him, without the constitutional impeachment process, in what, therefore, would have been a military coup d'état. Having perceived that he had little support in the military to avoid a coup, and that his overthrow was imminent, Vargas, in a depressed state, committed suicide. He had presided over an emergency cabinet meeting in the early hours of 24 August 1954, and then retired to his bedroom and, a few hours later, shot himself in the chest, leaving behind a suicide note and a political testament. An ambulance was called to the Palace, but when it arrived Vargas was already dead. After his death, the military mobilization for a coup ceased, and there was an outpouring of popular feeling for the deceased President. In 1956 Fortunato was found guilty of the Tonelero Street crime, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was murdered by a fellow prison inmate in 1962. The involvement of President Vargas in the criminal act is still debated by historians.}}

Accordingly, from 24 August 1954 until 3 September 1954, Café Filho was Acting President of the Republic, and on 3 September 1954 he took the constitutional oath in the presence of Congress and became President.}}
| {{small|''Under self-declared incapacity from 8 November 1955<br/> and barred from resuming the powers of the presidency from 22 November 1955''{{efn|On 8 November 1955 President Café Filho declared himself temporarily unable to govern for medical reasons. The President had gone to hospital on 3 November 1955, suffering from a heart condition. His self-declared incapacity led to the assumption of the powers of the presidency by Carlos Luz (who was President of the Chamber of Deputies) as Acting President. The President of the Chamber of Deputies was the constitutional successor of the President of the Republic because the Vice-Presidency was then vacant. However, Acting President Carlos Luz was seen as hostile to the inauguration of the then-president elect, Juscelino Kubitschek. Indeed, the results of the election were contested by the National Democratic Union (UDN), the party that had the second greatest share of the vote in the 1955 presidential election, and there was talk of a conspiracy to block the inauguration of the president-elect. Therefore, fearing that Carlos Luz would lead a coup to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect, a section of the military, led by the Army Minister himself (Marshal Henrique Teixeira Lott), in what they called a ''preventive counter-coup'', deposed Carlos Luz from the post of acting president on 11 November, and installed Senator Nereu Ramos, the Vice President of the Senate, as Acting President of the Republic in his stead. Faced with the actions of the military, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, also on 11 November 1955, to back Marshal Lott's preventive counter coup, by recognizing an emergency, declaring Luz impeded from acting as President, and confirming Nereu Ramos as Acting President. Carlos Luz attempted to resist his toppling, by boarding the Navy ship ''Tamandaré'' in the company of leading UDN politicians, and heading to the port of Santos, in the hope of receiving the support of Jânio Quadros, the Governor of São Paulo State, and of the military stationed in that State. However, the ''Tamandaré'' received news from São Paulo that such support would not be forthcoming, and Luz therefore ordered the ship to sail back to Rio de Janeiro, where he surrendered on 13 November. Also on 13 November 1955, Acting President Nereu Ramos visited President Café Filho in hospital, and assured him that he would only continue serving as Acting President until the President recovered. However, Marshal Lott and the other leaders of the ''11 of November movement'' decided to block the resumption of the powers of the presidency by Café Filho, because they suspected that the President, too, was involved in the conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect. Upon being released from hospital, on 21 November, Café Filho sent a message to the Acting President and to both Houses of Congress informing them that he had recovered from his illness, and therefore was resuming the powers and duties of the Presidency of the Republic. His resumption of those powers and duties, however, was swiftly blocked by the military: army tanks surrounded the Catete Palace (the seat of the presidency), to prevent Café Filho from reaching the Presidential Palace, where Nereu Ramos remained. Several other points in the capital were also surrounded by military forces. Café Filho therefore returned to his private residence, that was soon also surrounded by tanks, and the President was prevented from leaving his home. Given that situation, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, on 21 and 22 November 1955, to declare that the President's impediment persisted, that he therefore could not resume the powers and duties of the Presidency until the Congress resolved otherwise, and that acorrdingly, Senator Nereu Ramos should continue as Acting President, as per the congressional resolutions of 11 November. Because this "solution" was employed, of the Houses of Congress declaring, on 21 and 22 November, that they considered that Café Filho could not for the time being resume the powers and duties of the office, he was never formally removed from the office, and there was no impeachment process. Had there been an impeachment process, it would have required a formal accusation against the President, and he would have had the chance to defend himself and to stand trial before the Senate. However, impeachment proceedings were never initiated against Café Filho, and instead he was simply prevented from resuming his powers and duties on the basis of the congressional resolutions of 21 and 22 November 1955. Although for all practical purposes Café Filho had effectively been deposed, and it was universally understood that he would never be allowed to resume the powers of the presidency, neither Congress nor the military went as far as declaring the presidential office vacant, and therefore, formally, Café Filho was not overthrown, but simply barred from resuming the powers of the presidency. While technically Café Filho was never removed from office, he was thus prevented from resuming the powers and duties of the presidency until the end of his term and the inauguration of Kubitschek on 31 January 1956, and Nereu Ramos continued seving as Acting President until then. Café Filho's lawyers presented two petitions on his behalf to the Supreme Court also on 22 November 1955: one of habeas corpus, to restore his freedom of movement, and one of writ of mandamus, seeking an injunction from the Court to allow the President to resume his powers and duties. A statute was passed by Congress and signed into law by Acting President Ramos on 25 November declaring a state of siege (a form of martial law prescribed by the emergency provisions of the Constitution, that were then put in operation). On 14 December 1955, the Supreme Federal Court decided not to interfere in the political question, by ruling, regarding the writ of mandamus petition, that it could not decide the case while the state of siege declared by law persisted. As for the habeas corpus petition, it was declared moot on 21 December 1955, after Acting President Ramos informed the Court that Café Filho's freedom of movement had been restored, without prejudice to the continuation of his impediment. Only on 7 November 1956, long after Café Filho's term had ended, the Court would resume its deliberation on the writ of mandamus, to dispose of the case and close it, by recognizing that the petition had now been rendered moot, due to the termination of Café Filho's term in office.}}}}<br>30 January 1956

Summoned by the Minister of the Army, Henrique Teixeira Lott, who led the coup to overthrow Acting President Carlos Luz, Senator Nereu Ramos assumed the powers of the presidency of the Republic after Luz's deposition, on 11 November 1955 (as detailed above). After President Café Filho was impeded from resuming the powers and duties of the office on 21 and 22 November 1955, Ramos continued serving as Acting President until the end of the presidential term and the inauguration of President-elect Kubitschek. Although technically Carlos Luz and Nereu Ramos were only acting presidents, due to the critical circumstances surrounding their Administrations, they are usually included in the lists of presidents of Brazil, and are even included in the official gallery of presidents published by the Presidency of Brazil. Furthermore, Nereu Ramos had an official photograph of himself as president made, and he made use of the Presidential Sash, the insignia reserved for the President of the Republic alone. As for the actions of the military and of Congress that deposed Acting President Calos Luz, prevented President Café Filho from resuming the discharge of the powers of the presidency, installed and maintained Senator Nereu Ramos as Acting President until the inauguration of President-elect Kubitschek, those actions were in clear violation of the Constitution, although the backing of Congress helped to increase the appearance of legitimacy to the acts of the military. In spite of being unconstitutional, most historians today agree that those actions, led by Marshal Henrique Lott, had indeed the aim of securing the transfer of power according to the result of the 1955 presidential election; that there was indeed a conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of Kubitschek; and that the democratic result of the 1955 elections would not have been respected if not for the actions of Lott's preventive counter coup.}}

There were no political reasons for President Quadros' sudden and abrupt resignation, that took the country and the political establishment by surprise. Some aides and close advisors of the former President have postulated that Quadros was heavily drunk when he wrote and ordered the delivery to Congress of his letter of resignation. Others suggest that Quadros imagined that Congress would not want his Vice-President, João Goulart, as president, and that the legislature would therefore ask him to reconsider his resignation, and would agree to grant him extraordinary powers. Several historians postulate that both things may be true: Quadros was drunk, and in that state he imagined that his resignation would not be accepted and would result in him being able to bargain for extraordinary powers. However, the Brazilian Constitution did not require that the President's resignation be accepted by Congress or by any authority; instead the resignation was deemed to be a unilateral act, that became effective as soon as Congress received the President's written instrument of resignation. Accordingly, once the President of Congress received the Quadros' letter of resignation, a joint session of Congress was convened, the resignation letter was simply read and entered into the records of Congress, and the resignation was deemed effective, and as a result the President of Congress immediately proceeded to declare that Quadros had vacated the Presidency. Afterwards, when asked why he had resigned from office, Quadros denied both the claims of authoritarian intentions and the accounts that he was drunk, but simply stated that he had done it because he wanted to, giving no further reasons for his action. His resignation letter mentioned that he felt he had been "crushed" by unspecified "terrible forces" organized against him.}}

While the Vice President was still abroad, there was an attempt on the part of the Vice President's opponents, who controlled Congress, to prevent him from being inaugurated, but that movement failed, due to resistance by the Governor of the State Rio Grande do Sul and a split in the military. However, Congress only allowed the inauguration of Goulart to proceed after a compromise was reached, whereby a Constitutional Amendment severely limiting the powers of the presidency was passed on 2 September 1961. Under that Constitutional Amendment, the presidential executive, that had existed since the proclamation of the Republic, was abolished and replaced with a parliamentary system, in which a Prime Minister was the head of government and the President of the Republic retained only the role of head of state. The Amendment however stipulated that the constitutional change would only become permanent if confirmed by the people in a referendum. On 6 January 1963 that referendum was held, and a majority of the voters rejected the Amendment, backing the restoration of the presidential Executive instead. According to the result of the referendum, on 23 January 1963 a new Constitutional Amendment was promulgated, repealing the 1961 Amendment and re-establishing the presidential Executive as it existed immediately prior to that Amendment. Thus, from 7 September 1961 until 23 January 1963 President Goulart served as head of State only, in a parliamentary system of Government, and, from 23 January 1963 onwards, he served as both head of state and head of government.}}

Moura Andrade then declared Ranieri Mazzilli (who then was the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the first person in the presidential line of succession) to have become President of the Republic. Accordingly, Mazzilli took charge of the Presidency, but, in spite of Moura Andrade's bold statement declaring Mazzilli President, Mazzilli only took office as Acting President: he never took the presidential oath and, during his brief term in office, he issued his acts as "The President of the Chamber of Deputies, acting in the office of President of the Republic". The 1946 Constitution, then in force, authorized a Vice-President to succeed to the Presidency if the office of President became vacant, but it only authorized the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the other officers in the line of succession to serve as Acting President, and, in the case of a double vacancy of the Presidency and of the Vice-Presidency, it required new presidential elections to be summoned (direct elections by popular ballot if the second vacancy took place in the first half of the presidential term; indirect elections by Congress if the second vacancy occurred in the second half of the presidential term). Mindful of the fact that the elected President for the 1961-1966 term was Quadros (who had resigned), succeeded as President by Goulart, his Vice-President (who was deposed by the 1964 military coup), and that he was only the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mazzilli limited his actions to that of a caretaker Acting President, pending the holding of elections. The norms that would have governed those elections, however, were altered by continuing acts of interference from the Armed Forces that had ejected Goulart from office: on 9 April 1964, a body known as the ''Supreme Command of the Revolution'', composed of the leaders of the military coup (the commanders of the three branches of the Armed Forces), issued an ''Institutional Act'' summoning the National Congress to elect a new President in 48 hours. The military then put forward the name of Marshal Castelo Branco, and he was elected by Congress as planned. Ranieri Mazzilli, therefore, remained as Acting President only for two weeks, until the inauguration of Castelo Branco on 15 April 1964.}}}}

The military junta seized power so as to prevent Vice President Pedro Aleixo, a civilian, from becoming acting president. The possibility of a civilian, even a conservative one, assuming the powers of the presidency was seen as detrimental to the continuity of the military regime. In the initial stage of the President's disease, the junta hoped that he would recover. Subsequently, realizing that the President's condition was irreversible, and that the prolonged continuity of a triumvirate was detrimental to the regime and to its image, the military junta issued an institutional act on 14 October 1969 removing the incapacitated President and the Vice President from office and summoning Congress to elect a new President and Vice President. The military elite that controlled the regime then selected General Emílio Garrastazu Médici to be ARENA's candidate, and his name was rubber-stamped by Congress. The junta remained in place until the new President was sworn-in. In 2011, Brazil enacted a Federal Law recognizing the illegality of the acts that prevented Vice President Pedro Aleixo from becoming Acting President and that removed him from office; the statute also directs that Pedro Aleixo be deemed a former President of the Republic. Costa e Silva died less than three months after his removal, and were it not for the military acts now declared illegal that removed him from the vice-presidency, Pedro Aleixo would have succeeded to the presidency.}}

==The New Republic (1985–present)==
{{Main|History of Brazil since 1985}}
[[File:Flag President of Brazil.svg|thumb|right|Brazilian Presidential Standard]]
In the early 1980s the military government started a process of gradual political opening, called ''abertura'', the final goal of which was democracy. When the term of the last military president was to end, however, no direct elections for President of Brazil took place. For the election of the country's first civilian president since the military coup of 1964, the military maintained the rule that prevailed during the dictatorial regime, according to which an Electoral College made up of the entire National Congress and Representatives from State Assemblies was to elect the President. This time, however, the military placed the Electoral College under no coercion, so that its members would be free to select the President of their choice. The Chamber of Deputies and the State Assemblies had been elected, already under the ''abertura process'' in the [[1982 Brazilian legislative election|1982 parliamentary election]], but the Senators were chosen indirectly, by the State Assemblies, under rules that had been passed by the Military Regime in 1977 to counter the growing support of the opposition: one third of the Senators was chosen in 1982, and two thirds had been chosen in 1978. After the 1982 elections, the ruling party, PDS (the successor of the ARENA), still controlled a majority of the seats in the National Congress.

[[Tancredo Neves]], who had been Prime Minister during the presidency of João Goulart, was chosen to be the candidate of PMDB, the major opposition party (and the successor of the MDB Party, that had opposed the Military Regime since its inception), but Tancredo was also supported by a large political spectrum, even including a significant part of former members of ARENA, the party that supported the military presidents. In the last months of the military regime, a large section of ARENA members defected from the Party, and now professed to be men of democratic inclinations. They formed the Liberal Front, and the Liberal Front Party allied itself to PMDB, forming a coalition known as the Democratic Alliance. PMDB needed the Liberal Front's support in order to secure victory in the Electoral College. In the formation of this broad coalition former members of ARENA also switched parties and joined PMDB. So, to seal this arrangement, the spot of vice-president in Tancredo Neves' ticket was given to José Sarney, who represented the former supporters of the regime that had now joined the Democratic Alliance. On the other hand, those who remained loyal to the military regime and its legacy renamed ARENA as the PDS. In the PDS's National Convention, two  right-wing supporters of the military administrations fought for the Party's nomination: Colonel Mário Andreazza, then Minister of the Interior in General Figueiredo's administration, was the preferred candidate of the incumbent President and of the military elite, but he was defeated by Paulo Maluf, a civilian and former Governor of São Paulo State during the military regime. Tancredo's coalition defeated Maluf, and his election was hailed as the dawn of a New Republic. Andreazza's defeat (by 493 votes to 350) and the selection of Maluf as the PDS's presidential candidate greatly contributed to the split in the Party that led to the formation of the Liberal Front. The Liberal Front refused to support Maluf and joined forces with the PMDB in supporting Tancredo Neves, thus forging the Democratic Alliance. Without that split in the PDS, the election of the opposition candidate would not have been possible.

Although elected President of Brazil, Tancredo Neves became gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration and died without ever taking office. Therefore, the first civilian president since 1964 was Tancredo's running mate, [[José Sarney]], himself an ex-member of ARENA. José Sarney's administration fulfilled Tancredo's campaign promise of passing a constitutional amendment to the Constitution inherited from the military regime, so as to summon elections for a [[1988 Constituent Assembly|National Constituent Assembly]] with full powers to draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country, to replace the authoritarian legislation that still remained in place. In October 1988, a new democratic Constitution was passed and democracy was consolidated. In 1989, the first elections for President under the new Constitution were held and the young [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] was elected for a five-year term, the first President to be elected by direct popular ballot since the military coup. He was inaugurated in 1990 and in 1992 he became the first President in Brazil to be impeached due to corruption. He however resigned before the final verdict.

A referendum held in 1993 (ahead of the 1993 and 1994 Constitutional Revision) allowed the people to decide the form of government of the state (monarchy or republic) for the first time since the proclamation of the Republic in 1889; the republican form of government prevailed. In the same referendum, the Brazilian people was able to choose again, for the first time since 1963, the system of Government (parliamentary or presidential) and the model of a presidential executive was retained. The revision was a unique opportunity to amend the Constitution with a reduced majority. Had a different form or system of government been chosen in the 1993 referendum, the new institutional structure would have been implemented during the Constitutional Revision. Both the Revision and the referendum on the form and system of government were summoned in the original text of the Constitution. The federal model of the state, retained in the 1988 Constitution, is declared by the Constitution as not subject to abolition, even by Constitutional Amendment. According to those tenets and to the results of the popular vote, only minor changes were made to the institutional framework of the State in the Constitutional Revision, including the adoption of a Constitutional Amendment that reduced the presidential term of office from five to four years.

In 1995, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was inaugurated for a four-year term. In 1997 a Constitutional Amendment was enacted allowing presidents of Brazil to be reelected to one consecutive term. In 1998, then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso became first president of Brazil to be reelected for an immediately consecutive term. In 2003 [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] was inaugurated. He was reelected in 2006. In 2011 [[Dilma Rousseff]] became Brazil's first woman president. In 2015, she took office, but in 2016 the Senate of Brazil convicted her on [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|impeachment charges]], and she was removed from office, being succeeded by [[Michel Temer]].

[[José Sarney]], his running mate, accordingly appeared before Congress alone on the day of Neves's would-be inauguration, took office as Vice President and served as Acting President from start of the new presidential term, on 15 March 1985, until the day the President-elect died. Initially, there was hope that the President-elect would recover and take office, but he developed several complications and infections, and underwent several other operations, ultimately resulting in his death. Upon Neves's death on 21 April 1985, Acting President Sarney succeeded to the presidency. On the first anniversary of Neves's death a statute was signed into Law (federal law 7.465/1986), establishing that Tancredo Neves "elected but not sworn-in due to his death" should be included in the gallery of the presidents of Brazil "for all legal purposes".}}''

On 29 September 1992, the Chamber of Deputies voted, by the required two-thirds majority of its members, to allow the charges against the President to be presented to the Senate. On 1 October 1992 the Senate voted to receive the charges and proceed with the trial. On 2 October 1992, upon receiving the formal writ of summons notifying him that he was now a defendant in the impeachment trial that the Senate would conduct, President Collor was automatically suspended from office for 180 days as provided in the Constitution of Brazil and Vice President Itamar Franco became Acting President. On 29 December 1992, on the final day of his trial of impeachment before the Federal Senate, President Collor resigned the presidency, in an attempt to stop the process. The Senate's session as a Court of Impeachment was suspended and two successive joint sessions of Congress were held, one shortly after the other: in the first joint session, President Collor's resignation letter was formally read before Congress by its First Secretary and entered the congressional record, and the presidential resignation thereby took legal effect, resulting in the formal declaration by the President of Congress to the assembled joint session, that the presidency of the Republic was vacant, and that, as a result of that vacancy, Acting President Franco would be summoned at once, as Collor's legal successor, to take the constitutional oath and assume the Presidency; in the second joint session of Congress, Acting President Itamar Franco was accordingly sworn-in as President, as required by the Constitution. Later in the same day, the Senate resumed its sitting as a Court of Impeachment, and it decided that the President's resignation after the start of the trial could not stop the process, given that the determination of the former President's guilt or innocence was relevant for the purposes of imposing on him the penalty of disqualification from holding public office for eight years. Accordingly, the trial of impeachment continued in spite of Collor's resignation and, in the early hours of 30 December 1992 he was found guilty of the charges, by the required majority of more than two thirds of the members of the Senate. The penalty of removal from office was declared moot as Collor had already resigned, but as a result of his conviction by the Senate he was disqualified for holding public office for eight years. The Senate's sentence in the trial of impeachment, imposing upon Collor the said penalty, was pronounced on 30 December 1992 and published in the Official Journal on 31 December 1992. Accordingly, Collor remained  disqualified from holding public office until 31 December 2000.}}
