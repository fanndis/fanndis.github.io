The '''''Harvard Law Record''''' is an independent [[student newspaper|student-edited]] newspaper based at [[Harvard Law School]]. Founded in 1946, it is the oldest law school newspaper in the [[United States]].

==Characteristics==
The ''Record'', a print and online publication, includes law school news, world and national news, and scholarly articles and op-eds written by Harvard Law School students and professors, as well as outside contributors. It should not be confused with the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', which is limited to publishing scholarly academic articles exclusively.

Although it is student-run, the ''Record'' is owned by the '''Harvard Law School Record Corporation''', an independent [[non-profit organization]] funded primarily through donations. It does not receive much funding or substantial support from the law school. The paper operates out of a basement in the Harvard Law School dorms.

The ''Record'' is home to fictional law student Fenno, who since the 1950s has satirically chronicled the adventures of an anonymous law student, and has lampooned prominent members of the Harvard Law School community in the process. It also publishes an annual [[April Fool's Day]] issue, renowned for its satire.

==History==
The ''Record'' was founded in 1946 by a group of returning [[World War II]] veterans who were unhappy with conditions at the School, particularly a lack of student housing.  The three primary founders of the ''Record'' were [[Charles O. Porter]], who later served as a U.S. Congressman from Oregon, Charles Sweet, later a judge, and Paul Hellmuth, who became managing partner of the Boston law firm Hale & Dorr (now [[Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr|WilmerHale]]).

Among the former editors of the ''Record'' is [[Ralph Nader]], who published his first article on unsafe conditions in the auto industry entitled, "American Cars: Designed for Death", in the ''Record'' in 1958.  The article was later expanded into Nader's seminal work on the subject, ''Unsafe at Any Speed''. After a year in which the ''Record'' ceased publishing, Ralph Nader worked with a law student, Michael Shammas, to revive the paper for the 2015-2016 academic year.

In 1959, Nader and co-editor David Binder traveled to [[Cuba]] to report on the [[Cuban Revolution]] in the ''Record'', which coverage included an exclusive interview with [[Fidel Castro]].

Also in 1959, [[William H. Rehnquist]], then a young [[Arizona]] lawyer, wrote an editorial in the ''Record'' entitled "The Making of a Supreme Court Justice," in which he criticized the U.S. Senate for not questioning the judicial philosophy of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominees.  The article was later cited by members of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] when he refused to answer questions during his confirmation hearings.

In April 1971, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Harvard Law School professors [[Alan Dershowitz]] and [[Paul Freund]] had quit after picking up the story from the ''Record'''s April Fool's Day issue.

In the last decade the ''Record'' has won several awards from the [[American Bar Association]] Law Student Division for outstanding writing, including the 2007 awards for Best Editorial and Best Feature Article. Although the print edition briefly paused circulating in 2012, in 2013 Harvard Law students Sima Atri and Michael Shammas revamped the paper with the guidance of former editor-in-chief Ralph Nader. The newspaper has an active staff of law students and routinely publishes articles by professors and law students around the country. In the 2015-2016 year, with Michael Shammas as editor-in-chief and Lindsay Church as co-editor-in-chief, the paper published stories that were referenced in ''The New York Times'', ''American Lawyer'', ''Jerusalem Post'', ''The Washington Post'', ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''The Boston Globe'', and other national and international news organizations. The paper also won the American Bar Association's 2016 "Best Law School Newspaper" Award.

In addition to its print edition, The Record operates a [http://hlrecord.org/ website], a feed on [[Twitter]], and a [[Facebook]] page. Robert Mahari is currently the editor-in-chief.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=About|url=http://hlrecord.org/about/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=July 2, 2020|website=The Harvard Law Record|publisher=The Harvard Law Record}}</ref>
