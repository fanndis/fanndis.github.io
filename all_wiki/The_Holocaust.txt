'''The Holocaust''', also known as '''the Shoah''',{{efn|[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <big>{{lang|he|השואה}}</big>, ''HaShoah'', "the catastrophe"}} was the [[World War II]] [[genocide]] of the [[History of the Jews in Europe|European Jews]]. Between 1941 and 1945, across [[German-occupied Europe]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[#Collaboration|its collaborators]] systematically murdered some six million [[Jew]]s, around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population.{{efn|name=definition}}{{efn|[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]: "Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.

Germany implemented the persecution in stages. Following [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of Nazi Germany (1933–1945)|appointment as Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933, the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed "undesirable", starting with [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] on 22 March 1933.<ref>For the date, see {{harvnb|Marcuse|2001|p=21}}.</ref> After the passing of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 24 March,{{sfn|Stackelberg|Winkle|2002|pp=141–143}} which gave Hitler [[plenary power]]s, the government began isolating Jews from civil society; this included [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycotting Jewish businesses]] in April 1933 and enacting the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in September 1935. On 9–10 November 1938, eight months after Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria]], Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria during what became known as ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (the "Night of Broken Glass"). After Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, triggering World War II, the regime set up [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] to [[Racial segregation|segregate]] Jews. Eventually thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe.

The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the [[Final Solution]] to the [[Jewish Question]], discussed by senior Nazi officials at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|captured territories in the East]], all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized. Under the coordination of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], with directions from the highest leadership of the [[Nazi Party]], killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout occupied Europe, and within territories controlled by [[Axis powers|Germany's allies]]. Paramilitary [[death squads]] called [[Einsatzgruppen]], in cooperation with the [[German Army (1935–1945)|German Army]] and local collaborators, murdered around 1.3&nbsp;million Jews in mass shootings and pogroms between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942, victims were being deported from ghettos across Europe in sealed [[Holocaust trains|freight trains]] to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, they were gassed, worked or beaten to death, or killed by disease or during [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death marches]]. The killing continued until the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945.

The European Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event during the [[#Holocaust era|Holocaust era]] (1933–1945),{{sfn|Gray|2015|p=5}}<ref name=ushmm1/> in which Germany and its collaborators [[#Other victims of Nazi persecution during the Holocaust era|persecuted and murdered]] other groups, including [[#Non-Jewish Poles|ethnic Poles]], [[The Holocaust#Soviet civilians and POWs|Soviet civilians and prisoners of war]], the [[#Roma|Roma]], the [[#Aktion T4|handicapped]], [[#Political and religious opponents|political and religious dissidents]], and [[#Gay men|gay men]].{{efn|name=Stone2010}} The death toll of these other groups is thought to be over 11&nbsp;million.{{efn|name=USHMMfigures|The figure of 11 million killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during the "Holocaust era" (1933–1945) consists roughly of 5.7 million [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet civilians]]; nearly 3 million [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet POWs]]; around 1.8 million [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|non-Jewish Poles]]; 312,000 [[Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|Serb civilians]]; up to 25,000 [[Aktion T4|disabled]]; up to 220,000 [[Romani genocide|Roma]]; around 1,900 [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|Jehovah's Witnesses]]; at least 70,000 criminals and asocials; hundreds of [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany|gay men]]; and an unknown number of [[German resistance to Nazism|political opponents]].<ref name=ushmm1/>}}

Hitler's ideology depicted the Jews as uniquely dangerous to Germany&nbsp;... The threat posted by supposedly corrupting but generally powerless Sinti and Roma was far less, and therefore addressed inconsistently in the Nazi realm.

The evidence suggests that the Slav nations of Europe were also destined, had Germany won the war, to become victims of systematic mass murder; and even the terrible brutality of the occupation in eastern Europe, especially in Poland, can be understood as genocidal&nbsp;... Part of the reason for today's understanding, though, is a correct assessment of the fact that for the Nazis the Jews were regarded in a kind of 'metaphysical' way; they were not just considered as racially inferior (like Romanies), deviants (like homosexuals) or enemy nationals standing in the way of German colonial expression (like Slavs).&nbsp;... [T]he Jews were to some extent outside of the racial scheme as defined by racial philosophers and anthropologists. They were not mere ''Untermenschen'' (sub-humans)&nbsp;... but were regarded as a ''Gegenrasse'': "a 'counter-race', that is to say, not really human at all.&nbsp;... 'Holocaust', then, refers to the genocide of the Jews, which by no means excludes an understanding that other groups—notably Romanies and Slavs—were victims of genocide. Indeed&nbsp;... the murder of the Jews, although a project in its own right, cannot be properly historically situated without understanding the 'Nazi empire' with its grandiose demographic plans."{{sfn|Stone|2010|pp=2–3}}}}

The industrialization and scale of the murder was unprecedented.

===Medical experiments===
{{Main|Nazi human experimentation|Doctors' trial}}
[[File:Doctors' trial, Nuremberg, 1946–1947.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The 23 defendants during the [[Doctors' trial]], Nuremberg, 9 December 1946&nbsp;– 20 August 1947]]

Medical experiments conducted on camp inmates by the SS were another distinctive feature.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|pp=229–230}} At least 7,000 prisoners were subjected to experiments; most died as a result, during the experiments or later.{{sfn|Fisher|2001|pp=410–414}} Twenty-three senior physicians and other medical personnel were charged at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]], after the war, with crimes against humanity. They included the head of the German Red Cross, tenured professors, clinic directors, and biomedical researchers.{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|p=1453}} Experiments took place at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]], [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], and elsewhere. Some dealt with sterilization of men and women, the treatment of war wounds, ways to counteract chemical weapons, research into new vaccines and drugs, and the survival of harsh conditions.{{sfn|Fisher|2001|pp=410–414}}

The most notorious physician was [[Josef Mengele]], an SS officer who became the Auschwitz camp doctor on 30 May 1943.{{sfn|Müller-Hill|1999|p=338}} Interested in genetics{{sfn|Müller-Hill|1999|p=338}} and keen to experiment on twins, he would pick out subjects from the new arrivals during "selection" on the ramp, shouting "''Zwillinge heraus!''" (twins step forward!).{{sfn|Friedländer|2007|p=505}} They would be measured, killed, and dissected. One of Mengele's assistants said in 1946 that he was told to send organs of interest to the directors of the "Anthropological Institute in Berlin-Dahlem". This is thought to refer to Mengele's academic supervisor, [[Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer]], director from October 1942 of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]].<ref>{{harvnb|Müller-Hill|1999|pp=340–342}}; {{harvnb|Friedländer |2007|p=505}}.</ref>{{efn|The full extent of Mengele's work is unknown because records he sent to Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer are assumed to have been destroyed.<ref>{{harvnb|Müller-Hill|1999|p=348}}; {{harvnb|Lifton|2000|p=358}}.</ref>}}<!--add source: Mengele's experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change their eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes, and amputations and other surgeries.-->

There were around 9.5&nbsp;million Jews in Europe in 1933.{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|1996|p=13}} Most heavily concentrated in the east, the pre-war population was 3.5&nbsp;million in Poland; 3&nbsp;million in the Soviet Union; nearly 800,000 in Romania, and 700,000 in Hungary. Germany had over 500,000.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=447}}

==Origins==
===Antisemitism and the ''völkisch'' movement===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Germany|Christianity and antisemitism|Martin Luther and antisemitism|Religious antisemitism|Racial antisemitism}}
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, Jews were subjected to [[antisemitism]] based on Christian theology, which blamed them for killing Jesus. Even after the [[Reformation]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]] continued to persecute Jews, accusing them of [[blood libel]]s and subjecting them to [[pogrom]]s and expulsions.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2006|p=148}}; {{harvnb|Bergen|2016|pp=14–17}}.</ref> The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence in the [[German empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] of the [[völkisch movement|''völkisch'' movement]], developed by such thinkers as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Paul de Lagarde]]. The movement embraced a [[Scientific racism|pseudo-scientific racism]] that viewed Jews as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]] whose members were locked in mortal combat with the [[Aryan race]] for world domination.{{sfn|Fischer|2002|pp=47–49}} These ideas became commonplace throughout Germany; the professional classes adopted an ideology that did not see humans as racial equals with equal hereditary value.{{sfn|Friedlander|1994|pp=495–496}} The Nazi Party (the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]) originated as an offshoot of the ''völkisch'' movement, and it adopted that movement's antisemitism.{{sfn|Fischer|2002|p=47}}

===Germany after World War I and Hitler's world view===
{{Further|Aftermath of World War I|l1=Aftermath of World War I|Treaty of Versailles|l2=Treaty of Versailles|Political views of Adolf Hitler#Antisemitism and the Holocaust|l3=Adolf Hitler, antisemitism and the Holocaust|Mein Kampf|l4=Mein Kampf|Historiography of Adolf Hitler|l5=Historiography of Adolf Hitler}}
After [[World War I]] (1914–1918), many Germans did not accept that their country had been defeated, which gave birth to the [[stab-in-the-back myth]]. This insinuated that it was disloyal politicians, chiefly Jews and communists, who had orchestrated Germany's surrender. Inflaming the anti-Jewish sentiment was the apparent over-representation of Jews in the leadership of communist revolutionary governments in Europe, such as [[Ernst Toller]], head of a short-lived revolutionary government in Bavaria. This perception contributed to the canard of [[Jewish Bolshevism]].<!--replace source--><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Antisemitism in History: World War I |encyclopedia=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007166 |accessdate=1 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909064325/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007166 |archive-date=9 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Early antisemites in the Nazi Party included [[Dietrich Eckart]], publisher of the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', the party's newspaper, and [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who wrote antisemitic articles for it in the 1920s. Rosenberg's vision of a secretive Jewish conspiracy ruling the world would influence Hitler's views of Jews by making them the driving force behind communism.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|pp=41–43}}  Central to Hitler's world view was the idea of expansion and ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) in Eastern Europe for German [[Aryan]]s, a policy of what [[Doris Bergen]] called "race and space". Open about his hatred of Jews, he subscribed to common antisemitic stereotypes.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=52–54}} From the early 1920s onwards, he compared the Jews to germs and said they should be dealt with in the same way. He viewed [[Marxism]] as a Jewish doctrine, said he was fighting against "Jewish Marxism", and believed that Jews had created communism as part of a conspiracy to destroy Germany.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=56}}

With the appointment in January 1933 of [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany and the Nazi's [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]], German leaders proclaimed the rebirth of the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community").{{sfn|Fritzsche|2009|pp=[https://archive.org/details/lifedeathinthird0000frit/page/38 38–39]}} Nazi policies divided the population into two groups: the ''Volksgenossen'' ("national comrades") who belonged to the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', and the ''Gemeinschaftsfremde'' ("community aliens") who did not. Enemies were divided into three groups: the "racial" or "blood" enemies, such as the Jews and Roma; political opponents of Nazism, such as Marxists, liberals, Christians, and the "reactionaries" viewed as wayward "national comrades"; and moral opponents, such as gay men, the work-shy, and habitual criminals. The latter two groups were to be sent to concentration camps for "re-education", with the aim of eventual absorption into the ''Volksgemeinschaft''. "Racial" enemies could never belong to the ''Volksgemeinschaft''; they were to be removed from society.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|p=499}}

Before and after the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 Reichstag elections]], the Nazis intensified their campaign of violence against opponents,{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=28–30}} setting up concentration camps for [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial imprisonment]].{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=32–38}} One of the first, at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], opened on 22 March 1933.{{sfn|Marcuse|2001|p=21}} Initially the camp contained mostly Communists and Social Democrats.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=155}} Other early prisons were consolidated by mid-1934 into purpose-built camps outside the cities, run exclusively by the SS.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=84–86}} The camps served as a deterrent by terrorizing Germans who did not support the regime.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=5}}

Throughout the 1930s, the legal, economic, and social rights of Jews were steadily restricted.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=33}}<!--Add anti-Nazi boycott and Goebbels' response.-->On 1 April 1933, there was a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott of Jewish businesses]].{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|pp=19–20}} On 7 April 1933, the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was passed, which excluded Jews and other "non-Aryans" from the civil service.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|2003|p=78}} Jews were [[disbarment|disbarred]] from practicing law, being editors or proprietors of newspapers, joining the Journalists' Association, or owning farms.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|pp=32–33}} In [[Silesia]], in March 1933, a group of men entered the courthouse and beat up Jewish lawyers; Friedländer writes that, in Dresden, Jewish lawyers and judges were dragged out of courtrooms during trials.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=29}} Jewish students were restricted by quotas from attending schools and universities.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|2003|p=78}} Jewish businesses were targeted for closure or "Aryanization", the forcible sale to Germans; of the approximately 50,000 Jewish-owned businesses in Germany in 1933, about 7,000 were still Jewish-owned in April 1939. Works by Jewish composers,{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=134}} authors, and artists were excluded from publications, performances, and exhibitions.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=158–159, 169}} Jewish doctors were dismissed or urged to resign.

The economic strain of the [[Great Depression]] led Protestant charities and some members of the German medical establishment to advocate compulsory sterilization of the "incurable" mentally and physically handicapped,{{sfn|Evans|2004|pp=377–378}} people the Nazis called ''Lebensunwertes Leben'' ([[life unworthy of life]]).{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=21}} On 14 July 1933, the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses''), the Sterilization Law, was passed.{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|p=1457}}{{sfn|Proctor|1988|pp=101–103}} ''The New York Times'' reported on 21 December that year: "400,000 Germans to be sterilized".<ref>{{cite news |last=Tolischus |first=Otto D. |date=21 December 1933 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/12/21/archives/400000-germans-to-be-sterilized-1700-hereditary-health-courts-will.html |title=400,000 Germans to be sterilized |work=The New York Times |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> There were 84,525 applications from doctors in the first year.

In October 1939 Hitler signed a "euthanasia decree" backdated to 1 September 1939 that authorized ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' [[Philipp Bouhler]], the chief of [[Hitler's Chancellery]], and [[Karl Brandt]], Hitler's personal physician, to carry out a program of involuntary euthanasia. After the war this program came to be known as ''[[Aktion T4]]'',{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|2003|pp=142–149}} named after [[Tiergartenstraße]]&nbsp;4, the address of a villa in the Berlin borough of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], where the various organizations involved were headquartered.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|pp=252–261}} T4 was mainly directed at adults, but the euthanasia of children was also carried out.{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=171}} Between 1939 and 1941, 80,000 to 100,000 mentally ill adults in institutions were killed, as were 5,000 children and 1,000 Jews, also in institutions. There were also dedicated killing centers, where the deaths were estimated at 20,000, according to Georg Renno, deputy director of [[Schloss Hartheim]], one of the euthanasia centers, or 400,000, according to Frank Zeireis, commandant of the Mauthausen concentration camp.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=142}} Overall, the number of mentally and physically handicapped murdered was about 150,000.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=48}}

Although not ordered to take part, psychiatrists and many psychiatric institutions were involved in the planning and carrying out of ''Aktion T4''.{{sfn|Strous|2007}} In August 1941, after protests from Germany's Catholic and Protestant churches, Hitler canceled the T4 program,{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=90–95}} although the handicapped continued to be killed until the end of the war.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=48}} The medical community regularly received bodies for research; for example, the [[University of Tübingen]] received 1,077 bodies from executions between 1933 and 1945. The German neuroscientist [[Julius Hallervorden]] received 697 brains from one hospital between 1940 and 1944: "I accepted these brains of course.

On 15 September 1935, the Reichstag passed the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor, known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. The former said that only those of "German or kindred blood" could be citizens. Anyone with three or more Jewish grandparents was classified as a Jew.<ref name=USHMMNuremberg/> The second law said: "Marriages between Jews and subjects of the state of German or related blood are forbidden."

On 12 March 1938, Germany annexed Austria.

The government claimed it was spontaneous, but in fact it had been ordered and planned by Adolf Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]], although with no clear goals, according to [[David Cesarani]].

Known as ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (or "Night of Broken Glass"), the attacks on 9–10 November 1938 were partly carried out by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]],{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=583–584}} but ordinary Germans joined in; in some areas, the violence began before the SS or SA arrived.{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=168}} Over 7,500 Jewish shops (out of 9,000) were looted and attacked, and over 1,000 [[synagog]]s damaged or destroyed.

A decree on 12 November 1938<!--Check date.--> barred Jews from most remaining occupations.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=595–596}} ''Kristallnacht'' marked the end of any sort of public Jewish activity and culture, and Jews stepped up their efforts to leave the country.{{sfn|Ben-Rafael|Glöckner|Sternberg|2011|pp=25–26}}

Most of the Einsatzgruppen commanders were professionals; 15 of the 25 leaders had PhDs.

They were probably initiated by the OUN and its militia. It is likely, however, that a special unit of the Wehrmacht played a key role in triggering this pogrom when it entered the city as an advance guard together with a battalion of Ukrainian nationalists under its command. The pogroms cost at least 4,000 lives and were finally ended by the Wehrmacht on 2 July after it had spent two days observing but not intervening. At that point, however, Einsatzgruppe C took over the organization of murderous activities: over the next few days, by way of 'retribution' for the murders committed by the NKVD, three Einsatzgruppe C commandos that had entered the city murdered 2,500 to 3,500 Jews.

According to a letter dated 21 September 1939 from SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]] (RSHA or Reich Security Head Office), to the Einsatzgruppen, each ghetto had to be run by a ''[[Judenrat]]'', or "Jewish Council of Elders", to consist of 24 male Jews with local influence.<ref>{{harvnb|Trunk|1996|pp=1–3}}; also see {{harvnb|Browning|2004|p=26}}.</ref> ''Judenräte'' were responsible for the ghetto's day-to-day operations, including distributing food, water, heat, medical care, and shelter.

As German troops advanced, the mass shooting of "anti-German elements" was assigned, as in Poland, to the [[Einsatzgruppen]], this time under the command of [[Reinhard Heydrich]].{{sfn|Browning|2004|pp=16, 224–225}} The point of the attacks was to destroy the local Communist Party leadership and therefore the state, including "Jews in the Party and State employment", and any "radical elements".{{efn|Ten days after the invasion, [[Reinhard Heydrich]] laid out, in a memorandum, the guidelines he had issued to the Einsatzgruppen: "All the following are to be executed: Officials of the Comintern (together with professional Communist politicians in general; top and medium-level officials and radical lower-level officials of the Party, Central Committee and district and sub-district committees; People's Commissars; Jews in the Party and State employment, and other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, inciters etc.)&nbsp;... No steps will be taken to interfere with any purges that may be initiated by anti-Communist or anti-Jewish elements&nbsp;... On the contrary, these are to be secretly encouraged." Cesarani writes that it is "noteworthy that Heyrich did ''not'' want the SS to be held responsible".{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|pp=365–366}}}} Cesarani writes that the killing of Jews was at this point a "subset" of these activities.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=367}}

Typically, victims would undress and give up their valuables before lining up beside a ditch to be shot, or they would be forced to climb into the ditch, lie on a lower layer of corpses, and wait to be killed.{{sfn|McKale|2002|p=204}} The latter was known as ''Sardinenpackung'' ("packing sardines"), a method reportedly started by SS officer [[Friedrich Jeckeln]].{{sfn|Schneider|2015|p=183}}

At first the Einsatzgruppen targeted the male Jewish intelligentsia, defined as male Jews aged 15–60 who had worked for the state and in certain professions (the commandos would describe them as "Bolshevist functionaries" and similar), but from August 1941 they began to murder women and children too.<ref>{{harvnb|Longerich|2010|p=207}}; {{harvnb|Gerlach|2016|p=70}}.</ref> [[Christopher Browning]] reports that on 1 August, the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] passed an order to its units: "Explicit order by RF-SS [Heinrich Himmler, Reichsführer-SS]. All Jews must be shot. Drive the female Jews into the swamps."{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=281}} In a [[Posen speeches|speech on 6 October 1943]] to party leaders, [[Heinrich Himmler]] said he had ordered that women and children be shot, but [[Peter Longerich]] and [[Christian Gerlach]] write that the murder of women and children began at different times in different areas, suggesting local influence.<ref>{{harvnb|Longerich|2010|p=206}}; {{harvnb|Gerlach|2016|pp=71–72}}.</ref>

Notable massacres include the July 1941 [[Ponary massacre]] near [[Vilnius]] ([[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Lithuania]]), in which Einsatgruppe B and Lithuanian collaborators shot 72,000 Jews and 8,000 non-Jewish Lithuanians and Poles.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=193}} In the [[Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre]] ([[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]]), nearly 24,000 Jews were killed between 27 and 30 August 1941.{{sfn|Matthäus|2007|p=219}} The largest massacre was at a ravine called [[Babi Yar]] outside [[Kiev]] (also Soviet Ukraine), where 33,771 Jews were killed on 29–30 September 1941.<ref>{{harvnb|Matthäus|2007|p=219}}; {{harvnb|Evans|2008|pp=226–227}}; {{harvnb|Bergen|2016|pp=199–200}}.</ref> Einsatzgruppe C and the [[Order Police]], assisted by Ukrainian militia, carried out the killings,{{sfn|McKale|2002|p=203}} while the German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] helped round up and transport the victims to be shot.{{sfn|Fritz|2011|pp=102–104}} The Germans continued to use the ravine for mass killings throughout the war; the total killed there could be as high as 100,000.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=199}}

Historians agree that there was a "gradual radicalization" between the spring and autumn of 1941 of what Longerich calls Germany's ''Judenpolitik'', but they disagree about whether a decision—''Führerentscheidung'' (Führer's decision)—to murder the European Jews was made at this point.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=304–305}}{{efn|[[Nikolaus Wachsmann]] (2015): "The genesis of the Holocaust was lengthy and complex. The days are long gone when historians believed that it could be reduced to a single decision taken on a single day by Hitler. Instead, the Holocaust was the culmination of a dynamic murderous process, propelled by increasingly radical initiatives from above and below. During World War II, the Nazi pursuit of a Final Solution moved from increasingly lethal plans for Jewish 'reservations' to immediate extermination. There were several key periods of radicalization. The invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 marked one such moment, as mass shootings of Jewish men of military age soon grew into widespread ethnic cleansing, with daily bloodbaths of women, children, and the elderly."{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=300}}}} According to [[Christopher Browning]], writing in 2004, most historians maintain that there was no order before the invasion to kill all the Soviet Jews.{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=214}} Longerich wrote in 2010 that the gradual increase in brutality and numbers killed between July and September 1941 suggests there was "no particular order"; instead it was a question of "a process of increasingly radical interpretations of orders".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=206}}

According to [[Dan Stone (historian)|Dan Stone]], the murder of Jews in Romania was "essentially an independent undertaking".{{sfn|Stone|2010|p=36}} Romania implemented anti-Jewish measures in May and June 1940 as part of its efforts towards an alliance with Germany.

Bulgaria introduced anti-Jewish measures between 1940 and 1943, which included a curfew, the requirement to wear a yellow star, restrictions on owning telephones or radios, the banning of mixed marriages (except for Jews who had converted to Christianity), and the registration of property.{{sfn|Fischel|2020|p=61}} It annexed Thrace and Macedonia, and in February 1943 agreed to a demand from Germany that it deport 20,000 Jews to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].

Stone writes that Slovakia, led by Roman Catholic priest [[Jozef Tiso]] (president of the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak State]], 1939–1945), was "one of the most loyal of the collaborationist regimes". It deported 7,500 Jews in 1938 on its own initiative; introduced anti-Jewish measures in 1940; and by the autumn of 1942 had deported around 60,000 Jews to ghettos and concentration camps in Poland. Another 2,396 were deported and 2,257 killed that autumn during an uprising, and 13,500 were deported between October 1944 and March 1945.{{sfn|Stone|2010|pp=33–34}} According to Stone, "the Holocaust in Slovakia was far more than a German project, even if it was carried out in the context of a 'puppet' state."{{sfn|Stone|2010|pp=34–35}}

<!--expand a little and link to later section-->Although Hungary expelled Jews who were not citizens from its newly annexed lands in 1941, it did not deport most of its Jews{{sfn|Black|2016|p=135}} until the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944. Between 15 May and early July 1944, 437,000 Jews were deported from Hungary, mostly to Auschwitz, where most of them were gassed; there were four transports a day, each carrying 3,000 people.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=408}} In Budapest in October and November 1944, the Hungarian [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] forced 50,000 Jews [[Death marches (Holocaust)|to march]] to the Austrian border as part of a deal with Germany to supply forced labor.

Italy introduced some antisemitic measures, but there was less antisemitism there than in Germany, and Italian-occupied countries were generally safer for Jews than those occupied by Germany. There were no deportations of Italian Jews to Germany while Italy remained an ally. In some areas, the Italian authorities even tried to protect Jews, such as in the Croatian areas of the Balkans.

After 1942, the economic function of the camps, previously secondary to their penal and terror functions, came to the fore. Forced labor of camp prisoners became commonplace.{{sfn|Baumel|2001|p=135}} The guards became much more brutal, and the death rate increased as the guards not only beat and starved prisoners, but killed them more frequently.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=287–288}} ''[[Extermination through labour|Vernichtung durch Arbeit]]'' ("extermination through labor") was a policy; camp inmates would literally be worked to death, or to physical exhaustion, at which point they would be gassed or shot.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=314–320}} The Germans estimated the average prisoner's lifespan in a concentration camp at three months, as a result of lack of food and clothing, constant epidemics, and frequent punishments for the most minor transgressions.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=76}} The shifts were long and often involved exposure to dangerous materials.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=104}}

Transportation to and between camps was often carried out in closed freight cars with little air or water, long delays and prisoners packed tightly.{{sfn|Friedländer|2007|p=492–494}} In mid-1942 work camps began requiring newly arrived prisoners to be placed in quarantine for four weeks.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=347}} Prisoners wore [[Nazi concentration camp badge|colored triangles]] on their uniforms, the color denoting the reason for their incarceration.

Nearly three years earlier, on 30 January 1939, Hitler had told the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]]: "if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will be not the Bolshevising of the earth, and thus a victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!"<ref>{{harvnb|Burleigh|Wippermann|2003|p=99}}; {{cite web |title=Reichstag Speech |url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1939-1941/hitler-speech-to-german-parliament |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522154136/https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1939-1941/hitler-speech-to-german-parliament |archive-date=22 May 2019}}</ref> In the view of [[Christian Gerlach]], Hitler "announced his decision in principle" to annihilate the Jews on or around 12 December 1941, one day after his declaration of war.

{{wikisource|Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States}}
[[Christopher Browning]] argues that Hitler gave no order during the Reich Chancellery meeting but did make clear that he had intended his 1939 warning to the Jews to be taken literally, and he signaled to party leaders that they could give appropriate orders to others.{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=408}} [[Peter Longerich]] interprets Hitler's speech to the party leaders as an appeal to radicalize a policy that was already being executed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=306}} According to Gerlach, an unidentified former German ''Sicherheitsdienst'' officer wrote in a report in 1944, after defecting to Switzerland: "After America entered the war, the annihilation (''Ausrottung'') of all European Jews was initiated on the Führer's order."{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=82}}

Four days after Hitler's meeting with party leaders, [[Hans Frank]], Governor-General of the [[General Government]] area of occupied Poland, who was at the meeting, spoke to district governors: "We must put an end to the Jews&nbsp;... I will in principle proceed only on the assumption that they will disappear.

We must destroy the Jews, wherever we encounter them and whenever it is possible, in order to preserve the entire structure of the Reich.&nbsp;... We have an estimated 2.5 million Jews in the General Government, perhaps with the half-Jews and all that that entails some 3.5 million.

SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the [[Reich Security Head Office]] (RSHA), convened what became known as the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 at Am Großen Wannsee 56–58, a villa in Berlin's [[Wannsee]] suburb.<ref name=protocol/><ref>{{harvnb|Gerlach|1998|p=759}}; {{cite web |title=Wannsee Conference and the 'Final Solution' |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/wannsee-conference-and-the-final-solution |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928142922/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477 |archive-date=28 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The meeting had been scheduled for 9 December 1941, and invitations had been sent on 29 November, but it had been postponed indefinitely.

The 15 men present at Wannsee included [[Adolf Eichmann]] (head of Jewish affairs for the RSHA), [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] (head of the Gestapo), and other SS and party leaders and department heads.{{efn|[[Wannsee Conference#Attendees|Wannsee Conference attendees]]: [[Josef Bühler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], [[Roland Freisler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich]], [[Otto Hofmann]], [[Gerhard Klopfer]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger]], [[Rudolf Lange]], [[Georg Leibbrandt]], [[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]], [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]], [[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]], [[Karl Eberhard Schöngarth]], [[Wilhelm Stuckart]]{{sfn|Roseman|2003|p=66}}}} Browning writes that eight of the 15 had doctorates: "Thus it was not a dimwitted crowd unable to grasp what was going to be said to them."{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=411}} Thirty copies of the minutes, known as the [[Wannsee Protocol]], were made. Copy no.&nbsp;16 was found by American prosecutors in March 1947 in a German Foreign Office folder.{{sfn|Roseman|2003|p=8}} Written by Eichmann and stamped "Top Secret", the minutes were written in "euphemistic language" on Heydrich's instructions, according to Eichmann's later testimony.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=306}}

Discussing plans for a "[[Final Solution|final solution to the Jewish question]]" ("''Endlösung der Judenfrage''"), and a "final solution to the Jewish question in Europe" ("''Endlösung der europäischen Judenfrage''"),<ref name=protocol/> the conference was held to share information and responsibility, coordinate efforts and policies ("''Parallelisierung der Linienführung''"), and ensure that authority rested with Heydrich. There was also discussion about whether to include the German ''Mischlinge'' (half-Jews).{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|pp=84–85}} Heydrich told the meeting: "Another possible solution of the problem has now taken the place of emigration, i.e. the evacuation of the Jews to the East, provided that the Fuehrer gives the appropriate approval in advance."<ref name=protocol/> He continued:

<blockquote>Under proper guidance, in the course of the Final Solution, the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, in the course of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes.{{pb}} The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival. (See the experience of history.){{pb}} In the course of the practical execution of the Final Solution, Europe will be combed through from west to east. Germany proper, including the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], will have to be handled first due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities.{{pb}}The evacuated Jews will first be sent, group by group, to so-called transit ghettos, from which they will be transported to the East.<ref name=protocol>Original (German): {{cite web |title=Besprechungsprotokoll |url=https://www.ghwk.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf-wannsee/dokumente/protokoll-januar1942_barrierefrei.pdf |pages=7–8 |publisher=Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202072647/https://www.ghwk.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf-wannsee/dokumente/protokoll-januar1942_barrierefrei.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2019|url-status=live}}{{pb}}

These evacuations were regarded as provisional or "temporary solutions" ("''Ausweichmöglichkeiten''").{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=307}}{{efn|[[Wannsee Conference|Wannsee-Protokoll]]: "Diese Aktionen sind jedoch lediglich als Ausweichmöglichkeiten anzusprechen, doch werden hier bereits jene praktischen Erfahrungen gesammelt, die im Hinblick auf die kommende Endlösung der Judenfrage von wichtiger Bedeutung sind."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Wannsee-Protokoll |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622052218/http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Wannsee-Protokoll |url-status=live |archive-date=22 June 2006 |title=Wannsee-Protokoll |work=EuroDocs |publisher=Harold B.

Translation, [[Avalon Project]]: "These actions are, however, only to be considered provisional, but practical experience is already being collected which is of the greatest importance in relation to the future final solution of the Jewish question."<ref name=protocol/>}} The final solution would encompass the 11{{nbsp}}million Jews living not only in territories controlled by Germany, but elsewhere in Europe and adjacent territories, such as Britain, Ireland, Switzerland, Turkey, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Hungary, "dependent on military developments".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=307}} There was little doubt what the final solution was, writes Longerich: "the Jews were to be annihilated by a combination of forced labour and mass murder."{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=308}}

===Extermination camps{{anchor|Extermination camps}}===
{{Main|Extermination camp}}
At the end of 1941 in occupied Poland, the Germans began building additional camps or expanding existing ones. [[Auschwitz]], for example, was expanded in October 1941 by building [[Auschwitz II-Birkenau]] a few kilometers away.<ref name=deathcamps/> By the spring or summer of 1942, gas chambers had been installed in these new facilities, except for Chełmno, which used [[gas van]]s.

====Gas vans====
{{main|Gas van}}
Chełmno, with gas vans only, had its roots in the [[Aktion T4]] euthanasia program.{{sfn|Montague|2012|pp=14–16, 64–65}} In December 1939 and January 1940, gas vans equipped with gas cylinders and a sealed compartment had been used to kill the handicapped in occupied Poland.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=160}} As the mass shootings continued in Russia, Himmler and his subordinates in the field feared that the murders were causing psychological problems for the SS,{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=42–43}} and began searching for more efficient methods. In December 1941, similar vans, using exhaust fumes rather than bottled gas, were introduced into the camp at Chełmno,{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=74}} Victims were asphyxiated while being driven to prepared burial pits in the nearby forests.{{sfn|Montague|2012|pp=76–85}} The vans were also used in the occupied Soviet Union, for example in smaller clearing actions in the [[Minsk ghetto]],{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=513}} and in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Arad|2009|p=138}} Apparently, as with the mass shootings, the vans caused emotional problems for the operators, and the small number of victims the vans could handle made them ineffective.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gas vans |url=https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206236.pdf |publisher=Yad Vashem |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031127114228/https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206236.pdf |archive-date=27 November 2003}}</ref>

}}
[[Christian Gerlach]] writes that over three million Jews were murdered in 1942, the year that "marked the peak" of the mass murder.{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=99}} At least 1.4&nbsp;million of these were in the General Government area of Poland.{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=99, note 165}} Victims usually arrived at the extermination camps by freight train.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=81–85}} Almost all arrivals at Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka were sent directly to the gas chambers,{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=69–70}} with individuals occasionally selected to replace dead workers.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=243}} At Auschwitz, about 20 percent of Jews were selected to work.{{sfn|Piper|2000|pp=219–220}} Those selected for death at all camps were told to undress and hand their valuables to camp workers.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2003|pp=287–288}} They were then herded naked into the gas chambers. To prevent panic, they were told the gas chambers were showers or delousing chambers.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=173}}

At Auschwitz, after the chambers were filled, the doors were shut and pellets of [[Zyklon-B]] were dropped into the chambers through vents,{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=162}} releasing toxic [[hydrogen cyanide|prussic acid]].{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=157}} Those inside died within 20 minutes; the speed of death depended on how close the inmate was standing to a gas vent, according to the commandant [[Rudolf Höss]], who estimated that about one-third of the victims died immediately.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=170}} Johann Kremer, an SS doctor who oversaw the gassings, testified that: "Shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives."{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=163}} The gas was then pumped out, and the [[Sonderkommando]]—work groups of mostly Jewish prisoners—carried out the bodies, extracted gold fillings, cut off women's hair, and removed jewelry, artificial limbs and glasses.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|pp=170–172}} At Auschwitz, the bodies were at first buried in deep pits and covered with lime, but between September and November 1942, on the orders of Himmler,<!--check Himmler--> 100,000 bodies were dug up and burned. In early 1943, new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|pp=163–164}}

Bełżec, Sobibór and Treblinka became known as the [[Operation Reinhard]] camps, named after the German plan to murder the Jews in the General Government area of occupied Poland.<ref>{{harvnb|Cesarani|2016|pp=479–480}}; for size compared to Auschwitz, {{harvnb|Longerich|2010|p=330}}.</ref> Between March 1942 and November 1943, around 1,526,500 Jews were gassed in these three camps in gas chambers using [[carbon monoxide]] from the exhaust fumes of stationary diesel engines.<ref name=deathcamps>{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005145 |title=Killing Centers: An Overview |website=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914220116/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005145 | archive-date=14 September 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> Gold fillings were pulled from the corpses before burial, but unlike in Auschwitz the women's hair was cut before death. At Treblinka, to calm the victims, the arrival platform was made to look like a train station, complete with fake clock.<!--check source-->{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=83–85}} Most of the victims at these three camps were buried in pits at first. From mid-1942, as part of ''[[Sonderaktion 1005]]'', prisoners at Auschwitz, Chelmno, Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka were forced to exhume and burn bodies that had been buried, in part to hide the evidence, and in part because of the terrible smell pervading the camps and a fear that the drinking water would become polluted.<ref>{{harvnb|Arad|1999|pp=170–171}}; also see {{harvnb|Arad|2018|pp=212–219}}.</ref> The corpses—700,000 in Treblinka—were burned on wood in open fire pits and the remaining bones crushed into powder.<ref>{{harvnb|Arad|1999|p=171}}; for 700,000, {{harvnb|Arad|1999|p=177}} and {{harvnb|Arad|2018|p=219}}.</ref>

There was almost no resistance in the ghettos in Poland until the end of 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=340–341}} [[Raul Hilberg]] accounted for this by evoking the [[Persecution of Jews|history of Jewish persecution]]: compliance might avoid inflaming the situation until the onslaught abated.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|pp=1112–1128}} [[Timothy Snyder]] noted that it was only during the three months after the deportations of July–September 1942 that agreement on the need for armed resistance was reached.<ref>{{harvnb|Snyder|2010|p=283}}; {{harvnb|Longerich|2010|p=341}}.</ref>

Several resistance groups were formed, such as the [[Jewish Combat Organization]] (ŻOB) and [[Jewish Military Union]] (ŻZW) in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and the [[United Partisan Organization]] in Vilna.<!--Check/add sources.-->{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=82–85}} Over 100 revolts and uprisings occurred in at least 19 ghettos and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The best known is the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in April 1943, when the Germans arrived to send the remaining inhabitants to extermination camps. Forced to retreat on 19 April from the ŻOB and ŻZW fighters, they returned later that day under the command of SS General [[Jürgen Stroop]] (author of the [[Stroop Report]] about the uprising).{{sfn|Engelking|Leociak|2009|pp=775–777}} Around 1,000 poorly armed fighters held the SS at bay for four weeks.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=83–84}} Polish and Jewish accounts stated that hundreds or thousands of Germans had been killed,{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=243}} while the Germans reported 16 dead.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=269}} The Germans said that 14,000 Jews had been killed—7000 during the fighting and 7000 sent to Treblinka{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=616}}—and between 53,000{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=636}} and 56,000 deported.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=269}} According to ''[[Gwardia Ludowa WRN|Gwardia Ludowa]]'', a [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] newspaper, in May 1943:

{{quote|From behind the screen of smoke and fire, in which the ranks of fighting Jewish partisans are dying, the legend of the exceptional fighting qualities of the Germans is being undermined.&nbsp;...

Death rates were heavily dependent on the survival of European states willing to protect their Jewish citizens.{{sfn|Snyder|2012|pp=164–165}} In countries allied to Germany, the control over Jewish citizens was sometimes seen as a matter of sovereignty; the continuous presence of state institutions prevented the Jewish communities' complete destruction.{{sfn|Snyder|2012|pp=164–165}}<!--check--> In occupied countries, the survival of the state was likewise correlated with lower Jewish death rates: 75 percent of Jews died in the Netherlands, as did 99 percent of Jews who were in Estonia when the Germans arrived—the Nazis declared Estonia ''[[Judenfrei]]'' ("free of Jews") in January 1942 at the [[Wannsee Conference]]—while 75 percent survived in France and 99 percent in Denmark.<ref>For Netherlands, [https://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/netherlands-historical-background.html "The Netherlands"].

The [[Nuremberg trials]] were a series of military tribunals held after the war by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, to prosecute the German leadership. The first was the 1945–1946 trial of 22 political and military leaders before the International Military Tribunal.<!--replace source--><ref>[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/international-military-tribunal-the-defendants "International Military Tribunal: The Defendants"].

The indictments were for participation in a [[Conspiracy (crime)|common plan or conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of a [[crime against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]] and other crimes against peace; [[war crime]]s; and [[Crimes against humanity#Nuremberg trials|crimes against humanity]].

Ribbentrop, the judgement declared, "played an important part in Hitler's 'final solution of the Jewish question'".{{sfn|Conot|1984|p=495}}

The [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]], 1946–1949, tried another 185 defendants.{{sfn|Biddiss|2001|p=646}} West Germany initially tried few ex-Nazis, but after the 1958 [[Ulm Einsatzkommando trial]], the government set up a dedicated agency.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=412}} Other trials of Nazis and collaborators took place in Western and Eastern Europe. In 1960 [[Mossad]] agents captured [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Argentina and brought him to Israel to stand trial on 15 indictments, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes against the Jewish people. He was convicted in December 1961 and executed in June 1962. Eichmann's trial and death revived interest in war criminals and the Holocaust in general.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|pp=430–433}}

<!--Mention Broszat–Friedländer correspondence: ''Reworking the Past Hitler, The Holocaust and the Historians''.-->In the early decades of [[Holocaust studies]], scholars approached the Holocaust as a genocide unique in its reach and specificity; [[Nora Levin]] called the "world of Auschwitz" a "new planet."{{sfn|Stone|2010|p=206}} This was questioned in the 1980s during the West German ''[[Historikerstreit]]'' ("historians' dispute"), an attempt to re-position the Holocaust within German historiography.{{sfn|Stone|2010|p=207}}{{efn|The debate was preceded by the 40th anniversary in May 1985 of the end of World War II, and by President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s visit that month to a German military cemetery at the suggestion of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], leading to the so-called [[Bitburg controversy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1987|pp=789–790}}; {{harvnb|Piper|1993|p=273}}.</ref>}}

[[Ernst Nolte]] triggered the ''Historikerstreit'' in June 1986 with an article in the conservative newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'': "The past that will not pass: A speech that could be written but no longer delivered."<ref name=Nolte6June1986>{{cite news |last1=Nolte |first1=Ernst |author-link=Ernst Nolte |title=Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will: Eine Rede, die geschrieben, aber nicht gehalten werden konnte |url=https://www.staff.uni-giessen.de/~g31130/PDF/Nationalismus/ErnstNolte.pdf |work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |date=6 June 1986}}{{pb}}
{{harvnb|Knowlton|Cates|1993|pp=18–23}}; partly reproduced in [http://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/Chapter14Doc11Intro.pdf "The Past That Will Not Pass"] (translation), German History in Documents and Images.</ref>{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=764}}{{efn|Nolte had delivered a similar lecture to the Carl-Friedrich-Siemens-Stiftung in Munich, published in abridged form as "Die negative Lebendigkeiet des Dritten Reiches. Eine Frage aus dem Blickwinkel des Jahres 1980" in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' on 24 July 1980.{{sfn|Knowlton|Cates|1993|p=15}}{{pb}}
The speech that could not be delivered referred to a lecture Nolte had planned to give to the ''Römerberg-Gesprächen'' (Römerberg Colloquium) in Frankfurt; he said his invitation had been withdrawn, which the organisers disputed.{{sfn|Evans|1987|p=764, note 10}} At that point, his lecture had the title "The Past That Will Not Pass: To Debate or to Draw the Line?".{{sfn|Piper|1993|p=23}}}} The Nazi era was suspended like a sword over Germany's present, he wrote, rather than being studied as an historical event. He compared "the guilt of the Germans" to the Nazi idea of "the guilt of the Jews", and argued that the focus on the Final Solution overlooked the Nazi's euthanasia program and treatment of Soviet POWs, as well as post-war issues such as the [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. Comparing Auschwitz to the [[Gulag]], he suggested that the Holocaust was a response to Hitler's fear of the Soviet Union: "Did the Gulag Archipelago not precede Auschwitz? Was the [[Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin|Bolshevik murder of an entire class]] not the logical and factual ''prius'' of the 'racial murder' of National Socialism?&nbsp;... Was Auschwitz perhaps rooted in a past that would not pass?"{{efn|"War nicht der 'Archipel Gulag' ursprünglicher als 'Auschwitz'? War nicht der 'Klassenmord' der Bolschewiki das logische und faktische Prius des 'Rassenmords' der Nationalsozialisten? Sind Hitlers geheimste Handlungen nicht gerade auch dadurch zu erklären, daß er den 'Rattenkäfig' nicht vergessen hatte? Rührte Auschwitz vielleicht in seinen Ursprüngen aus einer Vergangenheit her, die nicht vergehen wollte?"<ref name=Nolte6June1986/>}}

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12496 hall of names in yad vashem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hall of Names]], [[Yad Vashem]], Jerusalem, 2011]]

Nolte's arguments were viewed as an attempt to normalize the Holocaust; one of the debate's key questions, according to historian Ernst Piper, was whether history should "historicize" or "moralize".{{sfn|Piper|1993|p=274}}{{efn|[[Deborah Lipstadt]] argued in 1994 that Nolte's "invalid historical comparisons" were a form of [[Holocaust denial]] "designed to help Germans embrace their past by telling them that their country's actions were no different than those of countless others&nbsp;..."{{sfn|Lipstadt|1994|p=213}}}} In September 1986 in ''[[Die Zeit]]'', [[Eberhard Jäckel]] responded that "never before had a state, with the authority of its leader, decided and announced that a specific group of humans, including the elderly, women, children and infants, would be killed as quickly as possible, then carried out this resolution using every possible means of state power."{{efn|name=Jäckel}} 

Despite the criticism of Nolte, the ''Historikerstreit'' put "the question of comparison" on the agenda, according to [[Dan Stone (historian)|Dan Stone]] in 2010.{{sfn|Stone|2010|p=207}} He argued that the idea of the Holocaust as unique was overtaken by attempts to place it within the context of [[Stalinism]], [[ethnic cleansing]], and the Nazis' intentions for post-war "demographic reordering", particularly the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the plan to kill tens of millions of Slavs to create living space for Germans.{{sfn|Stone|2010|pp=211–212}} Jäckel's position continued nevertheless to inform the views of many specialists. [[Richard J. Evans]] argued in 2015:

{{quote|Thus although the Nazi "Final Solution" was one genocide among many, it had features that made it stand out from all the rest as well. Unlike all the others it was bounded neither by space nor by time. It was launched not against a local or regional obstacle, but at a world-enemy seen as operating on a global scale. It was bound to an even larger plan of racial reordering and reconstruction involving further genocidal killing on an almost unimaginable scale, aimed, however, at clearing the way in a particular region&nbsp;– Eastern Europe&nbsp;– for a further struggle against the Jews and those the Nazis regarded as their puppets. It was set in motion by ideologues who saw world history in racial terms. It was, in part, carried out by industrial methods. These things all make it unique. |author=Richard Evans |source="Was the 'Final Solution' Unique?", ''The Third Reich in History and Memory''.{{sfn|Evans|2015|p=385}}}}
