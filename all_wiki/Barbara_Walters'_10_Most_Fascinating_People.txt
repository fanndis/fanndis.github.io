'''''Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People''''' was a televised compilation of ten public figures who are prominent names in the fields of entertainment, sports, politics, and [[popular culture]]. Hosted by [[Barbara Walters]], the list was broadcast annually on the second Thursday of December on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1993–2015. Though produced by [[ABC News]], the specials are not presented under the [[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]] banner, the network's flagship [[newsmagazine]].

==History==
After becoming the first woman to co-anchor an evening network newscast in 1976, Barbara Walters left the [[ABC Evening News]] in 1978 to concentrate on '''The Barbara Walters Specials''',{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} an occasional series of interviews with heads of state, newsmakers, sports stars, and other public figures. During the early years of the primetime 'specials', Walters secured the first joint interview with Egypt's President [[Anwar Sadat]] and Israel's Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]]. The specials continued to air sporadically throughout the year and saw Walters conduct interviews with a plethora of public and political figures including former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].

In a 1993 special, Walters compiled a list of twelve figures who defined that year. The top person for the year was [[Hillary Clinton]]. The program proved popular and led to it returning with ten figures every year except 2000 and 2001. Initially, 2013 was to be Walters' final installment of the special, which happened to end with the same person as in the debut year;<ref>{{cite web|title=Hillary Clinton Revealed as 'Most Fascinating Person of 2013'|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/slideshow/barbara-walters-fascinating-people-year-2013-21020543|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> however, Barbara has continued the program in both 2014 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People Of 2014, Returns to ABC Primetime|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/10/barbara-walters-presents-the-10-most-fascinating-people-of-2014-returns-to-abc-primetime-december-14-9-11-pm-et/|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref>

==Format==
The format of the broadcast consists of ten short-form biographical profiles, often interspersed with a recently recorded interview with the subject. The profiles are introduced by Walters from a set which has a computerized backdrop and she often commentates on why the figure has been chosen to qualify for inclusion in the program.

Similar to other end-of-year annual lists like the [[Time 100]], the ten profiles are not ranked in any order. However, since 2002, Walters has ended each show with her "Most Fascinating Person". In 2007, this honor went to author [[JK Rowling]], who was the only one of the ten not to be interviewed for the show. In 2011, this honor was awarded posthumously to Apple founder [[Steve Jobs]], the only person who was deceased at the time.
