The '''Brazilian Labour Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro}}, PTB) was a [[center-left|centre-left]] [[populism|populist]] [[political party]] in [[Brazil]] founded in 1945 by supporters of [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Getúlio Vargas]]. It was dismantled by the [[Brazilian Armed Forces|military]] after the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|1964 coup d'état]].

==History==
The party was founded by followers of President Getúlio Vargas on May 15, 1945, during the final days of his [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship. It grew rapidly under the leadership  of Vargas, the most important Brazilian [[politician]] of the early to mid-20th century. Its main goal was to prevent a growth of [[Brazilian Communist Party|Communist Party]] membership among urban workers.<ref name="FGV">[http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/JK/glossario/partido_trabalhista_brasileiro About PTB] at [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] official website.</ref>

PTB's support came from the [[trade unions]] controlled by the Ministry of Labour, and its trump card was the prestige of Getúlio Vargas, its honorary chairman, which introduced social and labor legislation in the country.<ref name="FGV"/> From 1945 to 1962, PTB was the third force in Brazilian politics, after the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]] (UDN), but it became more popular than the UDN in the 1962 Congressional elections. In 1950, Vargas was elected to a second term through PTB. Vargas committed suicide in 1954, and his heir [[João Goulart]] became the central figure in the party along with the [[populism|populist]] [[Leonel Brizola]].

Since the party was a close ally of PSD, also founded by supporters of the late Vargas, it remained in power when [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was elected President in 1955. Goulart was elected Vice President in 1955 and 1960, becoming President in 1961 with the resignation of [[Jânio Quadros]]. PTB was in power again, but Goulart was overthrown by a military-led [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|coup d'état]] in 1964. Various PTB figures were removed from the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], and all political parties, including PTB, were dissolved on October 27, 1965.<ref name="FGV" />   Nearly all of the party merged with the bulk of the PSD to form the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]], the only opposition party permitted for the first decade of the military dictatorship.

A [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|new PTB]], this time a [[center-right|centre-right]]  party, was established by [[Ivete Vargas]], Getúlio's niece, in 1980, with the end of the artificial two-party system imposed by the military regime.<ref name="FGV" />  Brizola led the majority of the PTB's former followers into the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]].<ref>Riordan Roett, ''Brazil: politics in a patrimonial society ''.
