'''Tidal''' (stylized in [[all caps]]) is a Norwegian [[Subscription business model|subscription]]-based music, [[podcast]] and video streaming service that combines [[Lossless compression|lossless]] audio and high-definition music videos with exclusive content and special features on music. Tidal was launched in 2014 by Norwegian public company [[Aspiro]] and is now owned by [[Project Panther Bidco]].

With distribution agreements with all three [[Major labels|major record labels]] and many [[independent record label|independent label]]s,<ref name="music week">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/hi-fidelity-streaming-service-tidal-launches-in-five-european-countries/060638|title=Tidal launches in five more European countries|date=January 22, 2015|work=Music Week|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> Tidal claims to provide access to more than 70 million tracks and 250,000 music videos.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About|url=https://tidal.com/about|access-date=2020-11-10|website=TIDAL - High Fidelity Music Streaming|language=en-US}}</ref> It offers two levels of service: Tidal Premium (lossy quality) and Tidal HiFi (lossless CD quality – FLAC-based 16-Bit/44.1&nbsp;kHz – and [[Master Quality Authenticated|MQA]] – typically lossy 24-bit/96 kHz).

In March 2015, Aspiro was acquired by [[Project Panther Bidco]] Ltd.,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/business/media/jay-z-buys-the-music-streaming-firm-aspiro.html|title=Jay Z Buys the Music Streaming Firm, Aspiro|work=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> which relaunched the service with a mass-marketing campaign, promoting it as the first artist-owned streaming service.<ref name="16 stakeholders" /> On January 23, 2017, [[Sprint Corporation]] bought 33% of Tidal for a reported $200 million.<ref name="sprint_venturebeat" />

While some observers praised the high fidelity, lossless audio quality, and higher subscription fees that would result in higher royalties to the artists and songwriters, others felt the high subscription fees and exclusive Tidal content from the artists involved could lead to more [[music piracy]]. Tidal has claimed to have over 3 million subscribers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7317826/tidal-three-million-global-subscribers-kanye-west-pablo-streams|title=Tidal Claims Three Million Subscribers|work=Billboard|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate= December 1, 2017}}</ref> although the veracity of those claims and their reported streaming numbers have been questioned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/tidal-subscriber-number-inflation/|title=Tidal May Have Been Wildly Inflating Subscriber Numbers|work=Forbes|date=January 21, 2017|accessdate= December 1, 2017}}</ref> {{As of|October 2020}}, Tidal operates in 55 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/202992312-About-TIDAL |title=What is TIDAL |publisher=Tidal |access-date=October 13, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
Branching off from [[WiMP]], which was launched in Norway in 2010 and later available in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Poland, Aspiro first launched the Tidal brand in the UK, the US, and Canada on October 28, 2014. The launch was supported by [[Sonos]] and 15 other home audio manufacturers as integrations partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11192375/Tidal-launches-lossless-music-streaming-in-UK-and-US.html|title=Tidal launches lossless music streaming in UK and US|work=The Telegraph|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref> In January 2015, Tidal launched in five more European countries: Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.<ref name="music week"/>

Aspiro was purchased by [[Project Panther Bidco|Project Panther Bidco Ltd.]] for [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 466 million ([[USD]] $56.2 million) in January 2015.<ref name="kbps"/> Before the acquisition of Aspiro, Jay-Z stated in an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that he was willing to partner with other streaming services to carry out his vision. "We talked to every single service and we explored all the options," he said, "But at the end of the day, we figured if we're going to shape this thing the way we see it, then we need to have independence. And that became a better proposition for us, not an easier one, mind you," he concluded.<ref name="GPB">{{cite web|url=http://www.gpb.org/news/2015/04/01/jay-zs-music-service-tidal-arrives-splash-and-questions-follow|title=Jay Z's Music Service, Tidal, Arrives With A Splash, And Questions Follow|last=Sanders|first=Sam|date=April 1, 2015|publisher=[[Georgia Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref>

On April 16, 2015, it came to public attention that Tidal was closing its original Aspiro offices in Stockholm, terminating the employment for all Swedish employees and the current CEO Andy Chen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breakit.se/artikel/388/uppgifter-musikbolaget-tidal-sparkar-sina-anstallda-i-sverige|title=Uppgifter: Musikbolaget Tidal sparkar sina anställda i Sverige|publisher=Breakit|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}</ref> The company refused to comment on closing the offices but confirmed that Andy Chen had been replaced as CEO by Peter Tonstad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breakit.se/artikel/392/har-ar-tidals-uttalande-ord-for-ord|title=Här är Tidals uttalande ord för ord|publisher=Breakit|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}</ref> In September 2015, Tidal began selling [[Music download|digital downloads]] and [[CDs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2015/09/15/tidal-selling-prince-cds.html |title=Tidal Is Selling Prince CDs and They're Not Cheap |publisher=BET |date=September 15, 2015 |accessdate=October 13, 2020}}</ref> In December 2015, Tidal appointed Jeff Toig as CEO of the company.

In January 2017, the company announced a partnership with British company [[Master Quality Authenticated]] (MQA) to deliver master-quality recordings—authenticated and unbroken versions (typically 96&nbsp;kHz / 24-bit) with the highest possible resolution to its HiFi subscribers. Tidal is the only streaming company to offer this MQA service.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} MQA is a "lossy" format. On January 23, 2017, US mobile carrier [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] announced that they were buying a 33 percent stake in Tidal,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14356184/sprint-acquires-tidal-streaming-service-exclusive-content |title=Sprint just bought 33 percent of Jay-Z's Tidal streaming service |last= Vincent |first= James |date=January 23, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref> and it was reported that Sprint would offer exclusive content to Sprint customers.<ref name="sprint_venturebeat">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/23/jay-zs-music-streaming-service-tidal-sells-33-stake-to-sprint/|title=Jay Z's music-streaming service Tidal sells 33% stake to Sprint|website=VentureBeat|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref> In September 2017, Tidal partnered with [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s web portal app.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/05/mercedes-benz-is-giving-all-its-customers-a-year-of-tidal-hifi/ |title=Mercedes-Benz is giving all its customers a year of Tidal HiFi |last=LeFebvre |first=Rob |date=September 5, 2017 |website=Endgadget |access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref> American rapper Nicki Minaj starred in a commercial promoting the Mercedes partnership.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/03/nicki-minaj-mercedes-benz-commercial/ |title=Nicki Minaj Appears in New Mercedes-Benz Commercial |last=Saponara |first=Michael |date=March 29, 2018 |work=XXL |access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref> MQA master-quality catalog available on Tidal currently comprises of certain albums and singles from [[Universal Music Group]], [[Warner Music Group]], its affiliates and certain independent distributors, including AvidPlay service provided by [[Avid Technology]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avid.com/products/avid-link/avidplay-music-distribution|title=Music Distribution Made Seamless – Get Started – AvidPlay|website=[[Avid Technology]]|access-date=2020-12-05}}</ref>. Since November 2020, the largest part of master-quality catalog available on Tidal is that of Warner Music Group and its affiliates, which was made available as part of a new deal with MQA and Warner Music Group itself<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mqa.co.uk/newsroom/news/tidal-masters-adds-millions-of-master-quality-tracks|title=TIDAL adds millions of MQA tracks, offering extensive catalogue of highest quality streaming audio|date=2020-11-12|website=[[Master Quality Authenticated|MQA]] Limited|access-date=2020-12-05}}</ref>. In past, [[Sony Music]] also offered certain albums and singles from their catalog in master quality on Tidal, but their quality were later reduced; exceptions include [[Beyoncé]]'s albums ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' and ''[[Homecoming: The Live Album]]'', both released by [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and distributed by Sony Music's label [[Columbia Records]] (likely most possible reason of these exceptions is Tidal's ownership - Jay-Z is Beyoncé's husband).

In 2017, Tidal announced a series of podcasts to launch the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/20/tidal-s-on-air-podcast-network-features-five-exclusive-shows/ |title=Tidal’s ‘On Air’ podcast network features five exclusive shows |last=Tarantola |first=Andrew |date=June 20, 2017 |website=Endgadget |access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref> American rappers [[Fat Joe]] and [[Joey Badass]] each host "Coca Vision" and "47 Minutes" respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/fat-joe-sits-down-with-dj-premier-in-coca-vision-exclusively-on-tidal-new-video.43611.html |title=Fat Joe Sits Down With DJ Premier In 'Coca Vision,' Exclusively On Tidal |last=HNHH Staff |date=April 24, 2018 |website=Hot New Hip Hop |access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8093401/joey-badass-podcast-tidal |title=Joey Bada$$ Teams Up With Tidal for '47 Minutes' Podcast |last=George |first=Rachel |date=January 9, 2018 |work=Billboard |access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref>

==Platform exclusivity==
A key selling point for Tidal as compared with other streaming services such as [[Spotify]] and [[Pandora Radio]] is the exclusive content already available and expected for the future from the current artists who co-own the company, as well as others. Exclusive content available on the relaunch of Tidal included Rihanna's single "[[Bitch Better Have My Money]]", [[The White Stripes]] debut television appearance, ''[[Daft Punk's Electroma]]'' (2006), and playlists personally curated by Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Arcade Fire and [[Coldplay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/03/tidal-debuts-with-exclusive-releases-with-the-white-stripes-daft-punk-and-arcade-fire/|title=TIDAL debuts with exclusive releases from The White Stripes, Daft Punk, and Arcade Fire|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|date=March 31, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> Tidal stated on its official [[Twitter]] page that "lots of exclusive content [is] on the way".<ref>{{cite tweet |user=TIDALHiFi |number=583302720347574272|date=April 1, 2015 |title=Lots of exclusive content on the way, stay tuned.

==Reception==
Shortly after Tidal's launch and press conference, the mobile version of the service shot to the top 20 of the U.S. iPhone Apps chart. Following criticism for its "out-of-touch marketing campaign", two weeks later, the app had already fallen out of the top 700 rankings of the same list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/04/21/jay-zs-tidal-app-falls-out-of-top-700-iphone-apps-chart/|title=Jay Z's TIDAL App Falls Out Of Top 700 iPhone Apps Chart|publisher=BallerStatus.com|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}</ref>

===Praise===
Glenn Peoples of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that Tidal was a good thing for the music industry. He stated that the U.S. streaming market needed a "kick in the butt" when looking at the growth rate of streaming from 2014 to 2015. Peoples also noted that more competition in the streaming market is a good thing as it could lead to a "greater diffusion of innovation". He concluded that a service like Tidal – which is promoted as paying a fair amount of royalties to both the artists and the songwriters – will lead to the industry as a whole sorting out its issues with streaming royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6516972/is-jay-z-tidal-good-for-music-business|title=3 Reasons Why Jay Z's Tidal Is Good for the Music Business -- Even If It Fails|work=Billboard|first=Glenn|last=Peoples|date=March 31, 2015|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Writing for ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s website, Micah Peters released a list of "3 reasons why Jay-Z's new Tidal streaming service is stupid". The article focused on points that the high fidelity, the lossless audio quality model being promoted was "overestimat[ing] the average listener". Peters worried that most listeners do not have the required, advanced [[headphones]] to distinguish the difference between ordinary and high fidelity audio. The article also stated that the $20 price was not reasonable for the mass market.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/03/3-reasons-why-jay-zs-tidal-streaming-service-is-stupid |title= 3 reasons why Jay Z's new Tidal streaming service is stupid |work=For The Win USA Today|first= Micah|last=Peters|date= March 31, 2015|accessdate= March 31, 2015}}</ref>

Recording artist [[Lily Allen]] expressed her opinions on Tidal on her official [[Twitter]] account. She feared that the high price of Tidal, as well as the mass popularity of the artist co-owners, could result in crippling the music industry and increasing [[Music piracy|piracy]]. She stated, "I love Jay-Z so much, but Tidal is (so) expensive compared to other perfectly good streaming services, he's taken the biggest artists… Made them exclusive to Tidal (am I right in thinking this?), people are going to swarm back to pirate sites in droves".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.u.tv/Entertainment/2015/03/31/Lily-Allen-fears-Tidal-will-cripple-music-industry-34605 |title= Lily Allen fears Tidal will cripple music industry|date=March 31, 2015 |accessdate= March 31, 2015 |publisher= [[UTV (TV channel) |UTV]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100804/http://www.u.tv/Entertainment/2015/03/31/Lily-Allen-fears-Tidal-will-cripple-music-industry-34605 |archivedate= April 2, 2015}}</ref>

Jay-Z responded to criticism with a freestyle during the Tidal X: Jaÿ-Z B-Sides<ref>{{cite web|url= http://pitchfork.com/news/59447-jay-z-announces-tidal-x-jay-z-b-sides-concert-featuring-rare-music |title=Jay Z Announces "Tidal X: Jaÿ-Z B-Sides" Concert Featuring Rare Music|work= [[Pitchfork (website) |Pitchfork]] |date=April 29, 2015 |accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref> concert. He compares Tidal with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and says that Tidal has been subjected to hypocritical criticism.

Kanye West's decision to initially release his album ''[[The Life of Pablo]]'' as a Tidal streaming exclusive led to criticism from fans, who felt that streaming exclusivity could promote piracy. The album was pirated over 500,000 times as of February 17, 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35587381 | title = Kanye West album 'pirated 500,000 times' already | first = Zoe |last = Kleinman| work = BBC News | access-date = February 24, 2016}}</ref> West later made the album available to stream on competing services.<ref>{{cite news |title= Kanye West's The Life of Pablo Is Finally Available On Spotify |first= Nash |last= Jenkins |url= http://time.com/4278906/kanye-west-tlop-streaming-spotify-apple-music/ |date= April 1, 2016 |website= [[Time (magazine) |Time]] |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170825020511/http://time.com/4278906/kanye-west-tlop-streaming-spotify-apple-music/ |archivedate= August 25, 2017}}</ref> In July 2017, West terminated his contract with Tidal, claiming that the service owed him $3 million.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/kanye-west-quits-tidal-claiming-service-owes-3m-report|title=Kanye West quits TIDAL, claiming service owes him $3m | type = report | work = Music Business Worldwide|date=July 2, 2017 |accessdate=July 4, 2017}}</ref>

==Finances and royalties==
One artist has stated that artist [[royalties]] per track from Aspiro/Tidal are currently over three times than those paid by Spotify, but that royalties may decrease to provide a sufficient [[return on investment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://storify.com/_charlie123/mint-royale-on-tidal-streaming|title=Mint Royale on Tidal streaming|publisher=storify.com|date=March 31, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> Jay-Z commented in an interview to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that artists would be paid more by being streamed on Tidal than with Spotify, stating "Will artists make more money? Even if it means less profit for our bottom line? Absolutely."<ref name="GPB"/> In the same interview, he also stressed the service was for people "lower down on the food chain".<ref name="GPB"/>

On February 27, 2016, Yesh Music, LLC and John Emanuele from the band [[The American Dollar (band)|The American Dollar]] launched a $5 million class-action lawsuit that claimed Tidal has yet to compensate the band for any of the royalty payments accrued from the streaming of the band's 116 copyrighted songs. The suit also accused Tidal of using faulty numbers to payout artists while also having undercut these same individuals by 35%. A response from Tidal stated that they are indeed fully up to date on all royalties for the group and have removed said intellectual property from their servers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11138960/tidal-fires-cfo-and-coo|title=Tidal fires its CFO and COO|website=The Verge|access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/02/jay-z-and-tidal-facing-lawsuit-over-not-paying-out-royalties-to-artists|title=Jay Z and Tidal Are Reportedly Facing a Lawsuit Over Failing To Pay Artist Royalties (UPDATE)|website=Complex|access-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/301002525|title=Yesh Music v.

==Controversy==
{{POV|date=November 2018}}
In January 2017, Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]'' ('Today's Business') reported that it had received internal documents disclosing lower subscriber counts than had been publicly announced by Tidal and its owners, having only 350,000 users in September 2015 (contradicting a claim by Jay-Z that the service had a million users), and 850,000 subscribers by March 2016, rather than the 3 million claimed by the service (which may have been inflated by including users that were using a free trial).<ref name="variety-inflated">{{cite web|title=Jay Z's Tidal Streaming Service May Have Inflated Subscriber Numbers (Report)|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/tidal-subscriber-numbers-inflated-1201965174/|website=Variety|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name="verge-inflation">{{cite web|title=Tidal may have been inflating its subscriber numbers|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/20/14336218/tidal-subscriber-numbers-inflating-report|website=The Verge|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref>

In May 2018, ''Dagens Næringsliv'' published a report accusing Tidal of intentionally falsifying streaming numbers for [[Beyoncé]]'s ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' and [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[The Life of Pablo]]'' albums and consequently paying inflated [[Royalty payment|royalties]] to the artists' record labels. The newspaper supported its report with a [https://www.dn.no/staticprojects/special/2018/05/09/0600/dokumentar/strommekuppet/data/documentation/NTNU-rapport_til_publisering.pdf comprehensive study] from [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]'s [https://www.ntnu.edu/ccis Center for Cyber and Information Security] in Gjøvik. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported, the music service, which "has rarely shared its data publicly", being the exclusive streaming platform for both albums, "claimed that West’s album had been streamed 250 million times in its first 10 days of release in February of 2016, while claiming it had just 3 million subscribers – a claim that would have meant every subscriber played the album an average of eight times per day; and that Beyonce’s album was streamed 306 million times in its first 15 days of release in April of 2016."<ref name="variety report">{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/jay-z-tidal-accused-of-falsifying-beyonce-and-kanye-west-streaming-numbers-1202804222/ |title=Tidal Accused of Falsifying Beyonce and Kanye West Streaming Numbers |last=Aswad |first=Jem |date=May 9, 2018 |work=Variety |access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref>
