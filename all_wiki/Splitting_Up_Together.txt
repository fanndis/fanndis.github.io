== Premise ==
The series chronicles what happens when a couple's marriage is suddenly reignited by their divorce. The couple has three children who live in the house with one parent on alternating weeks while the other parent lives as a single person who stays in the garage apartment in the back of the house. The garage-dwelling "single" partner is free to date while having no responsibilities in the house or for the children. The "parent" partner is free to preside over the house and family as they deem best. Each week the parents learn a little more about what it is they are lacking in the parenting and "romantic" parts of their lives, and in doing so become better parents and better romantic partners. Often the insight they gain allows them to see why their spouse felt unhappy in the marriage; thus helping them to improve as a person. This increasingly improved person they become also becomes slightly more alluring to their ex-spouse making their complete separation seem less likely.
