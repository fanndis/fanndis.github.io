'''Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr.''' (born '''Leslie Lynch King Jr.'''; July 14, 1913{{spnd}}December 26, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 38th [[president of the United States]] from August 1974 to January 1977. Ford previously served as the 40th [[vice president of the United States]] from December 1973 to August 1974. Ford is the only person to have served as both vice president and president without being elected to either office by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].

Born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and raised in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], Ford attended the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Yale Law School]]. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he enlisted in the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]], serving from 1942 to 1946; he left as a [[lieutenant commander]]. Ford began his political career in 1949 as the [[U.S. Representative|U.S. representative]] from [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]]. He served in this capacity for 25 years, the final nine of them as the [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]]. In December 1973, two months after the [[Spiro Agnew#Criminal investigation and resignation|resignation of Spiro Agnew]], Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[25th Amendment]] by President [[Richard Nixon]]. After the subsequent resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, Ford immediately assumed the presidency. His [[List of Presidents of the United States by time in office|895-day-long presidency is the shortest]] in U.S. history for any president who did not die in office.

As president, Ford signed the [[Helsinki Accords]], which marked a move toward [[détente]] in the [[Cold War]]. With the collapse of [[South Vietnam]] nine months into his presidency, [[US involvement in the Vietnam War|U.S. involvement]] in [[Vietnam]] essentially [[Vietnam War#Exit of the Americans: 1973–1975|ended]]. Domestically, Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the [[Great Depression]], with growing inflation and a [[recession]] during his tenure.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|pages= xxiii, 301|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum}}</ref> In one of his most controversial acts, he granted a [[Pardon of Richard Nixon|presidential pardon]] to President Richard Nixon for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. During Ford's presidency, foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play, and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President.<!-- (Please keep hidden until fully developed below) "This was made clear by developments in two major substantive issues during Ford's presidency: the Cyprus crisis and Arab Israeli relations." --><ref name="Lenczowski">{{cite book|author=George Lenczowski|title=American Presidents, and the Middle East|year=1990|isbn=978-0-8223-0972-7|pages=142–143|publisher=Duke University Press|author-link=George Lenczowski}}</ref> In the Republican presidential primary campaign of 1976, Ford defeated former California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] for the Republican nomination. He narrowly lost the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger, former Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]].

Following his years as president, Ford remained active in the Republican Party. His moderate views on various social issues increasingly put him at odds with conservative members of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship. After experiencing a series of health problems, he [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|died at home]] on December 26, 2006.

==Early life==

[[File:President Gerald R Ford Historical Marker.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Ford's childhood home in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]]]
Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at [[3202 Woolworth Avenue]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents. He was the child of [[Dorothy Ayer Gardner]] and [[Leslie Lynch King Sr.]], a wool trader. His father was a son of prominent banker [[Charles Henry King]] and Martha Alicia King (née Porter). Gardner separated from King just sixteen days after her son's birth. She took her son with her to [[Oak Park, Illinois]], home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James. From there, she moved to the home of her parents, Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer, in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Gardner and King divorced in December 1913, and she gained full custody of her son. Ford's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Jeff C.|title=The Fathers of American Presidents|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7864-0182-6|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, NC|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/fathersofamerica0000youn}}</ref>

Ford later said that his biological father had a history of hitting his mother.<ref name="ford-Nebraska">{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec27/0,4670,FordNebraska,00.html |title=Nebraska-born Ford Left State as Infant |last=Funk, Josh |date=December 27, 2006 |access-date=September 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429040023/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec27/0%2C4670%2CFordNebraska%2C00.html |archive-date=April 29, 2011 |publisher=Fox News |agency=Associated Press |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a biography of Ford,
[[James M. Cannon]], a member of the Ford administration, wrote that the separation and divorce of Ford's parents were sparked when, a few days after Ford's birth, Leslie King took a [[butcher knife]] and threatened to kill his wife, his infant son, and Ford's nursemaid. Ford later told confidants that his father had first hit his mother when she smiled at another man during their honeymoon.<ref name="pbs-knife">{{cite web |last=Cannon |first=James |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/essays/ford.html |title=Gerald R.

After living with her parents for two-and-a-half years, Gardner married [[Gerald Rudolff Ford]] on February 1, 1917. He was a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company. They now called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr. The future president was never formally [[adopted]] and did not legally change his name until December 3, 1935; he also used a more conventional spelling of his middle name.<ref name="utexas">{{cite web |url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/grf/genealog.asp|title=Gerald R.

Ford also had three half-siblings from the second marriage of Leslie King Sr., his biological father: Marjorie King (1921–1993), Leslie Henry King (1923–1976), and Patricia Jane King (1925–1980). They never saw one another as children, and he did not know them at all until 1960. Ford was not aware of his biological father until he was 17, when his parents told him about the circumstances of his birth. That year his biological father, whom Ford described as a "carefree, well-to-do man who didn't really give a damn about the hopes and dreams of his firstborn son", approached Ford while he was waiting tables in a Grand Rapids restaurant. The two "maintained a sporadic contact" until Leslie King Sr.'s death in 1941.<ref name="ford-Nebraska" /><ref>{{cite news |title=A Common Man on an Uncommon Climb|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 1976|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/08/19/357031602.pdf|page=28|accessdate=April 26, 2009 }}</ref>

In his senior year of [[1934 Michigan Wolverines football team|1934]], the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player. In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]]—the eventual national champion—to a scoreless tie in the first half. After the game, assistant coach [[Bennie Oosterbaan]] said, "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them. Ford and [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." Ford later recalled, "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause."<ref name="perry">{{cite book|last=Perry |first=Will |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/wolverinesstoryo0000perr/page/150 |chapter-format=PDF |title=The Wolverines: A Story of Michigan Football |chapter=No Cheers From the Alumni |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wolverinesstoryo0000perr/page/150 150–152] |publisher=The Strode Publishers |location=Huntsville, Alabama |isbn=978-0-87397-055-6 |accessdate=December 28, 2006 |year=1974 }}</ref>

During Ford's senior year, a controversy developed when [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] said that it would not play a scheduled game with Michigan if a black player named [[Willis Ward]] took the field. Students, players, and alumni protested, but university officials capitulated and kept Ward out of the game. Ford was Ward's best friend on the team, and they roomed together while on road trips. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university's decision, but he eventually agreed to play against Georgia Tech when Ward personally asked him to play.<ref>{{cite news | first = Brian | last = Kruger | first2 = Buddy | last2 = Moorehouse | title = Willis Ward, Gerald Ford and Michigan Football's darkest day | date = August 9, 2012 | url = http://blogs.detroitnews.com/history/2012/08/09/willis-ward-gerald-ford-and-michigan-footballs-darkest-day/ | work = The Detroit News | accessdate = October 22, 2012}}</ref>

In 1934, Ford was selected for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's [[East–West Shrine Game]] at San Francisco (a benefit for physically disabled children), played on January 1, 1935.

Throughout life, Ford remained interested in his school and football; he occasionally attended games. Ford also visited with players and coaches during practices; at one point, he asked to join the players in the huddle.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clumsy image aside, Ford was Accomplished Athlete|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 28, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2009|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/bal-sp.ford28dec28,0,6535524.story}}</ref> Before state events, Ford often had the Navy band play the University of Michigan fight song, ''[[The Victors]]'',  instead of ''[[Hail to the Chief]]''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Press and the Ford Presidency | author=Rozell, Mark J. | date=October 15, 1992 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn=978-0-472-10350-8 | page=[https://archive.org/details/pressfordpreside0000roze/page/38 38] | url=https://archive.org/details/pressfordpreside0000roze/page/38 }}</ref>

Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]]. He turned down offers from the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] of the [[National Football League]]. Instead, he took a job in September 1935 as the boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at [[Yale University]]<ref name="librarybio">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp|title=Timeline of President Ford's Life and Career|website=Gerald R.

Ford hoped to attend Yale Law School beginning in 1935. Yale officials at first denied his admission to the law school because of his full-time coaching responsibilities. He spent the summer of 1937 as a student at the [[University of Michigan Law School]]<ref name="umlaw">{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/ford/timeline.html |title=The U-M Remembers Gerald R. Ford |publisher=The University of Michigan |accessdate=January 2, 2007}}</ref> and was eventually admitted in the spring of 1938 to [[Yale Law School]].<ref name="librarybio"/>

While attending Yale Law School, Ford joined a group of students led by [[R. Douglas Stuart Jr.]], and signed a petition to enforce the 1939 [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]]. The petition was circulated nationally and was the inspiration for the [[America First Committee]], a group determined to keep the U.S. out of [[World War II]].<ref name="onlinereader">{{cite web |last=Doenecke|first=Justus D.|year=1990 |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0817988416/ |title=In Danger Undaunted: The Anti-Interventionist Movement of 1940–1941 As Revealed in the Papers of the America First Committee (Hoover Archival Documentaries) |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |accessdate=December 28, 2006}} p. 7</ref> His introduction into politics was in the summer of 1940 when he worked for the Republican presidential campaign of [[Wendell Willkie]].<ref name="librarybio" />

Ford graduated in the top third of his class in 1941, and was admitted to the [[State Bar of Michigan|Michigan bar]] shortly thereafter. In May 1941, he opened a Grand Rapids law practice with a friend, [[Philip W. Buchen]].<ref name="librarybio"/>

After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached all nine sports that were offered, but mostly swimming, boxing, and football. During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]], on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

===Sea duty===
After Ford applied for sea duty, he was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26}}, at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, [[Camden, New Jersey]]. From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the ''Monterey''. While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] with the [[United States Third Fleet|Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]] in late 1943 and 1944. In 1943, the carrier helped secure [[Makin (islands)|Makin Island]] in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against [[Kavieng]], New Ireland in 1943. During the spring of 1944, the ''Monterey'' supported landings at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] and participated in carrier strikes in the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Western Carolines]], and northern [[New Guinea]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]].<ref name="hove">{{cite book |last=Hove |first=Duane |title=American Warriors: Five Presidents in the Pacific Theater of World War II |publisher=Burd Street Press |isbn=978-1-57249-307-0 |year=2003 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/americanwarriors0000hove }}</ref> After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the ''Monterey'' launched strikes against [[Wake Island]], participated in strikes in the Philippines and [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]], and supported the landings at [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]].<ref name="hove" />

Although the ship was not damaged by the [[Empire of Japan]]'s forces, the ''Monterey'' was one of several ships damaged by [[Typhoon Cobra]] that hit Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.|William Halsey's]] Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three [[destroyer]]s and over 800 men during the typhoon. The ''Monterey'' was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's aircraft tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the [[hangar deck]]. Ford was serving as General Quarters Officer of the Deck and was ordered to go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and reported his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Stuart H. Ingersoll]]. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lieutenant Gerald Ford and Typhoon Cobra|url=http://www.navyhistory.org/2013/02/lieutenant-gerald-ford-and-typhoon-cobra/|publisher=[[Naval Historical Foundation]]|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}</ref>

After the fire, the ''Monterey'' was declared unfit for service. Ford was detached from the ship and sent to the Navy Pre-Flight School at [[Saint Mary's College of California]], where he was assigned to the Athletic Department until April 1945. From the end of April 1945 to January 1946, he was on the staff of the Naval Reserve Training Command, [[Naval Air Station Glenview|Naval Air Station, Glenview, Illinois]], at the rank of [[lieutenant commander]].<ref name="librarybio"/>

Ford received the following military awards: the [[American Campaign Medal]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with nine [[Service star|{{frac|3|16}}" bronze stars]] (for operations in the [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], Marshall Islands, Asiatic and Pacific carrier raids, [[Battle of Hollandia|Hollandia]], Marianas, Western Carolines, Western New Guinea, and the Leyte Operation), the [[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two {{frac|3|16}}" bronze stars (for Leyte and Mindoro), and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].<ref name="navy" /> He was released from active duty under honorable conditions in February 1946.<ref name="librarybio"/>

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Gerald R. Ford, Jr., and Betty Ford following their marriage.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in a suit leads a flower-carrying woman by the hand, walking out of a chapel.|The Fords on their wedding day, October 15, 1948]]

On October 15, 1948, Ford married [[Betty Ford|Elizabeth Bloomer]] (1918–2011) at Grace [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in Grand Rapids; it was his first and only marriage and her second marriage. She had previously been married and, after a five‐year marriage, divorced from William Warren.<ref name=NYT1974Howard>{{cite news |first=Jane|last=Howard |authorlink=Jane Howard (journalist) |title=The 38th First Lady: Not a Robot At All |work=The New York Times|date=December 8, 1974| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/08/archives/forward-day-by-day-the-38th-first-lady-not-a-robot-at-all-betty.html| via=The TimesMachine archive viewer| accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>

Originally from Grand Rapids herself, she had lived in New York City for several years, where she worked as a [[John Robert Powers]] fashion model and a dancer in the auxiliary troupe of the [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company. At the time of their engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of 13 terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives. The wedding was delayed until shortly before the [[1948 United States House of Representatives elections|election]] because, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in a 1974 profile of Betty Ford, "Jerry Ford was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced exdancer."<ref name=NYT1974Howard/>

After Ford returned to Grand Rapids in 1946, he became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to challenge [[Bartel J. Jonkman]], the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed his view of the world. "I came back a converted [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]", Ford wrote, "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]].

Ford was a member of the House of Representatives for 25 years, holding [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]] seat from 1949 to 1973. It was a tenure largely notable for its modesty.

In the early 1950s, Ford declined offers to run for either the Senate or the Michigan governorship.

===House Minority Leader (1965–1973)===

In 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, secured another term as president and took 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace [[Charles Halleck]] of [[Indiana]] as Minority Leader.<ref name="mastersDavidson">{{cite book|title=Masters of the House: Congressional leadership over two centuries|publisher=Westview Press|year=1988|pages=267–275|author1=Roger H. Davidson |author2=Susan Webb Hammond |author3=Raymond Smock }}</ref>

With a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Johnson Administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by Johnson the "[[Great Society]]". During the first session of the [[89th United States Congress|Eighty-ninth Congress]] alone, the Johnson Administration submitted 87 bills to Congress, and Johnson signed 84, or 96%, arguably the most successful legislative agenda in Congressional history.<ref name="unger104">Unger, Irwin, 1996: 'The Best of Intentions: the triumphs and failures of the Great Society under Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon': Doubleday, p. 104.</ref>

In 1966, criticism over the Johnson Administration's handling of the [[Vietnam War]] began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the [[1966 United States House of Representatives elections|1966 midterm elections]] produced a 47-seat swing in favor of the Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.<ref name="mastersDavidson" />

Ford's private criticism of the Vietnam War became public knowledge after he spoke from the floor of the House and questioned whether the White House had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion.<ref name="mastersDavidson" /> The speech angered President Johnson, who accused Ford of having played "too much football without a helmet".<ref name="mastersDavidson" /><ref name="Timesteady">{{cite news|title=Gerald Ford: Steady Hand for a Nation in Crisis|work=Time |author=Gray, Paul|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1572927,00.html}}</ref>

As Minority Leader in the House, Ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]], in which they proposed Republican alternatives to Johnson's policies.

After [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon]] was elected president in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an advocate for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] and the [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]]. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a [[Revenue Sharing]] program for state and local governments.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Social Policy|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-5076-3|page=162|author1=James Midgley |author2=Michelle Livermore }}</ref> Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).<ref name="mastersDavidson" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Nixon Reconsidered|author=Hoff, Joan|publisher=Basic Books|year=1995|page=69|isbn=978-0-465-05105-2}}</ref>

To become House Speaker, Ford worked to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber, often traveling on the [[rubber chicken circuit]]. After a decade of failing to do so, he promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976.{{r|deathofford}} On October 10, 1973, Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] resigned and then pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering, part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted $29,500 ($228,847 in 2020 dollars) in bribes while governor of Maryland.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Naughton |first1=James M. |title=Judge Orders Fine, 3 Years' Probation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/11/archives/judge-orders-fine-3-years-probation-tells-court-income-was-taxable.html |accessdate=August 28, 2020 |work=New York Times |date=October 11, 1973}}</ref>  According to ''The New York Times'', Nixon "sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement." The advice was unanimous. "We gave Nixon no choice but Ford," [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Carl Albert]] recalled later.<ref name="nyt-editorial" /> Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the Vice Presidency would be "a nice conclusion" to his career.{{r|deathofford}}

Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the [[25th Amendment]] had been implemented. The [[United States Senate]] voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27. On December 6, 1973, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35. After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.<ref name="librarybio"/>

Ford became vice president as the [[Watergate scandal]] was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] contacted Ford to tell him to prepare for the presidency.<ref name="librarybio"/>

At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated [[Number One Observatory Circle|vice president's residence]] in Washington, D.C. However, "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," Ford later said, "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.{{'"}}<ref name="kunhardt" />

Ford's decision to pardon Nixon was highly controversial. Critics derided the move and said a "[[corrupt bargain]]" had been struck between the men.<ref name="kunhardt" /> They said that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, which had elevated Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend [[Jerald terHorst]] resigned his post in protest after the pardon. According to [[Bob Woodward]], Nixon Chief of Staff Alexander Haig proposed a pardon deal to Ford. He later decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship he and Nixon shared.<ref name="shanescott">{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Shane |title=For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29pardon.html|work=The New York Times|page=A1 |accessdate=September 8, 2009 | date=December 29, 2006}}</ref> Regardless, historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]], an observation with which Ford agreed.<ref name="shanescott" /> In an editorial at the time, ''The New York Times'' stated that the Nixon pardon was a "profoundly unwise, divisive and unjust act" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's "credibility as a man of judgment, candor and competence".<ref name="nyt-editorial" /> On October 17, 1974, Ford testified before Congress on the pardon. He was the first sitting president since [[Abraham Lincoln]] to testify before the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/162654-1 |title=Ford Testimony on Nixon Pardon – C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=October 17, 1974 |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/PresidentsTestify.pdf |title=Sitting presidents and vice presidents who have testified before congressional committees |publisher=Senate.gov |date=2004 |accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref>

In the months following the pardon, Ford often declined to mention President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] by name, referring to him in public as "my predecessor" or "the former president." When, on a 1974 trip to California, White House correspondent [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] pressed Ford on the matter, Ford replied in a surprisingly frank manner: "I just can't bring myself to do it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/fred-barnes/|title=Fred Barnes on Conversations with Bill Kristol|publisher=}}</ref>

After Ford left the White House in January 1977, he privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'', a 1915 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.<ref>''Shadow'', by [[Bob Woodward]], chapter on Gerald Ford; Woodward interviewed Ford on this matter, about twenty years after Ford left the presidency</ref> In 2001, the [[John F.

===Draft dodgers and deserters===
On September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional [[amnesty]] program for military deserters and Vietnam War [[draft dodger]]s who had fled to countries such as Canada. The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military.<ref name="amnesty">{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Marjorie |url= https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0916.html|title=Ford Offers Amnesty Program Requiring 2 Years Public Work; Defends His Pardon Of Nixon |work=The New York Times |date=September 16, 1974 |accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4714#axzz1jJbv1H6i|title=Gerald R.

===Administration===
When Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. During his brief administration, he replaced all members except [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] Kissinger and [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William E. Simon]]. Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the "[[Halloween Massacre]]". One of Ford's appointees, [[William Thaddeus Coleman Jr.|William Coleman]]—the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]]—was the second black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after [[Robert C.

In 1975, Rumsfeld was named by Ford as the youngest-ever [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].

===Midterm elections===
{{Main|1974 United States House elections|1974 United States Senate elections}}

The 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place in the wake of the Watergate scandal and less than three months after Ford assumed office. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections|House elections]], taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since [[Andrew Johnson]] was President of the United States (1865–1869).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2007/05/bush-vetoes-less-than-most-presidents.html Bush vetoes less than most presidents], CNN, May 1, 2007.

The [[Economy of the United States|economy]] was a great concern during the Ford administration.

In the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises. The [[Cyprus dispute#Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974|Cyprus dispute]] turned into a crisis with the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek government]] withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year.<ref name="Lenczowski" /> As Ford expected, Turkish relations were [[United States-Turkey relations#Invasion of Cyprus|considerably disrupted until 1978]].

[[File:Gerald Ford with Anwar Sadat in Salzburg 1975.jpg|thumb|Ford with [[Anwar Sadat]] in Salzburg, 1975]]

In the continuing [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], although the initial [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|cease fire]] had been implemented to end active conflict in the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kissinger's continuing [[shuttle diplomacy]] was showing little progress. Ford considered it "stalling" and wrote, "Their [Israeli] tactics frustrated the Egyptians and made me mad as hell."<ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.240</ref> During Kissinger's shuttle to Israel in early March 1975, a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal, prompted a cable from Ford to Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], which included:
{{Quote|I wish to express my profound disappointment over Israel's attitude in the course of the negotiations ... Failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations. I have given instructions for a reassessment of United States policy in the region, including our relations with Israel, with the aim of ensuring that overall American interests ... are protected. You will be notified of our decision.<ref>Rabin, Yitzak (1996), ''The Rabin Memoirs'', University of California Press, p. 256, {{ISBN|978-0-520-20766-0}}</ref>}}

On March 24, Ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the Middle East. "Reassessment", in practical terms, meant canceling or suspending further aid to Israel. For six months between March and September 1975, the United States refused to conclude any new arms agreements with Israel. Rabin notes it was "an innocent-sounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in American-Israeli relations".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldstein]|first1=Yitzhak Rabin; [translated by Dov|title=The Rabin memoirs|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-20766-0|page=261|edition=Expanded}}</ref> The announced reassessments upset the American Jewish community and Israel's well-wishers in Congress. On May 21, Ford "experienced a real shock" when seventy-six U.S. senators wrote him a letter urging him to be "responsive" to Israel's request for $2.59&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.59|1975|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) in military and economic aid. Ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized. It was, since the September 1974 ban on arms to Turkey, the second major congressional intrusion upon the President's foreign policy prerogatives.<ref>[[George Lenczowski]], American Presidents, and the Middle East, 1990, p.150</ref> The following summer months were described by Ford as an American-Israeli "war of nerves" or "test of wills".<ref>Gerald Ford, A Time to Heal, 1979, p.298</ref> After much bargaining, the [[Sinai Interim Agreement]] (Sinai II) was formally signed on September 1, and aid resumed.

====Vietnam====

One of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing [[Vietnam War]]. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American [[POW|prisoners of war]]. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Church, Peter|title=A Short History of South-East Asia|location=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2006|pages=193–194|isbn=978-0-470-82181-7}}</ref>

The accords had been negotiated by [[United States National Security Advisor]] Kissinger and North Vietnamese [[politburo]] member [[Lê Đức Thọ]]. South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] was not involved in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple letters to the South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.<ref name="Brinkley1">{{cite book|author=Brinkley, Douglas |year=2007 |title=Gerald R.

In December 1974, months after Ford took office, North Vietnamese forces invaded the province of [[Phuoc Long Province|Phuoc Long]]. General [[Trần Văn Trà]] sought to gauge any South Vietnamese or American response to the invasion, as well as to solve logistical issues, before proceeding with the invasion.<ref name="Kurnow">{{cite book|author=Karnow, Stanley|title=Vietnam: A History|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamhistory00karn_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Viking|year=1991}}</ref>

As North Vietnamese forces advanced, Ford requested Congress approve a $722&nbsp;million aid package for South Vietnam, funds that had been promised by the Nixon administration.  Congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin.<ref name="Challenges1970" /> Senator [[Jacob K. Javits]] offered "...large sums for evacuation, but not one nickel for military aid".<ref name="Challenges1970" /> President Thieu resigned on April 21, 1975, publicly blaming the lack of support from the United States for the fall of his country.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/21/newsid_2935000/2935347.stm|title=Vietnam's President Thieu resigns|date=April 21, 1975|accessdate=September 24, 2009|publisher=BBC News }}</ref> Two days later, on April 23, Ford gave a speech at [[Tulane University]]. In that speech, he announced that the Vietnam War was over "...as far as America is concerned".<ref name="Brinkley1" /> The announcement was met with thunderous applause.<ref name="Brinkley1" />

1,373 U.S. citizens and 5,595 [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and third country nationals were evacuated from the South Vietnamese capital of [[Saigon]] during [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. In that operation, military and [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopters took evacuees to [[U.S. Navy]] ships off-shore during an approximately 24-hour period on April 29 to 30, 1975, immediately preceding the [[fall of Saigon]]. During the operation, so many South Vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people. Other helicopters, having nowhere to land, were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers, close to the ships, their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Vietnam War: An Almanac| last=Bowman| first=John S.| publisher=Pharos Books| year=1985| isbn=978-0-911818-85-7| page=[https://archive.org/details/vietnamwaralmana00bowm/page/434 434]| url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamwaralmana00bowm/page/434}}</ref>

Many of the Vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act]].

[[File:Kissinger, Ford, Suharto and Malik (cropped).jpg|thumb|Indonesian President [[Suharto]] with Ford and Kissinger in Jakarta on December 6, 1975, one day before the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]].]]
The former Portuguese colony of [[East Timor]] declared its independence in 1975. [[Indonesia]]n president [[Suharto]] was a strong U.S. ally in Southeast Asia. In December 1975, Suharto discussed the plans to invade East Timor during a meeting with Ford and Henry Kissinger in the Indonesian capital of [[Jakarta]]. Both Ford and Kissinger made clear that U.S. would not object to the proposed [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian annexation of East Timor]].<ref>{{cite web |editor-last=Burr |editor-first=William |editor2-last=Evans |editor2-first=Michael L. |title=Ford, Kissinger and the Indonesian Invasion, 1975–76 |date=December 6, 2001 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB62/ |accessdate=February 13, 2016 |quote=Ford and Kissinger Gave Green Light to Indonesia's Invasion of East Timor, 1975: New Documents Detail Conversations with Suharto}}</ref> According to [[Ben Kiernan]], the invasion and occupation resulted in the [[East Timor genocide|deaths of nearly a quarter of the Timorese population]] from 1975 to 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|title=Genocide and resistance in Southeast Asia : documentation, denial & justice in Cambodia & East Timor|date=2007|publisher=Transaction Publ.|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=978-1412806695|page=281|edition=2nd pr.}}</ref>

====''Mayaguez'' and Panmunjom====
North Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions, once when [[Khmer Rouge]] forces seized an American ship in [[international waters]] and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.<ref>Gawthorpe, A. J. (2009), "The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon", ''The Historical Journal'', '''52'''(3):697–716.</ref>

The first crisis was the [[Mayaguez incident|''Mayaguez'' incident]]. In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of [[Cambodia]], Cambodians seized the American merchant ship ''Mayaguez'' in international waters.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 19, 1975|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/exhibits/vietnam/750519a.htm|title=Debrief of the Mayaguez Captain and Crew|website=Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> Ford dispatched [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the ''Mayaguez'' sailors were being released. In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S. servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed.<ref name="marinemerchants">{{cite web |year=2000 |url=http://www.usmm.org/mayaguez.html |title=Capture and Release of SS Mayaguez by Khmer Rouge forces in May 1975 |publisher=United States Merchant Marine |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}</ref> Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath.<ref>Gerald R. Ford, ''A Time to Heal'', p. 284</ref> The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] wall in Washington, D.C.

Some historians have argued that the Ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot.<ref>Cécile Menétray-Monchau (August 2005), "The Mayaguez Incident as an Epilogue to the Vietnam War and its Reflection on the Post-Vietnam Political Equilibrium in Southeast Asia", ''Cold War History'', p. 346.</ref> But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gawthorpe|first=Andrew J.|date=September 1, 2009|title=The Ford Administration and Security Policy in the Asia-Pacific after the Fall of Saigon|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=52|issue=3|pages=707–709|doi=10.1017/S0018246X09990082|issn=1469-5103}}</ref>

The second crisis, known as the [[axe murder incident]], occurred at [[Panmunjom]], a village which stands in the DMZ between the two Koreas. Encouraged by U.S. difficulties in Vietnam, North Korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try to convince the U.S. to withdraw from South Korea.<ref>Oberdorfer, Don (2001), ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'' (New York, NY: Basic Books), pp. 47–83.</ref> Then, in August 1976, North Korean forces killed two U.S. officers and injured South Korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in Panmunjom's [[Joint Security Area]]. The attack coincided with a meeting of the Conference of [[Non-Aligned Nations]] in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, at which [[Kim Jong-il]], the son of North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]], presented the incident as an example of American aggression, helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a U.S. withdrawal from the South.<ref>Gawthorpe, "The Ford Administration and Security Policy", p. 711.</ref>

At administration meetings, Kissinger voiced the concern that the North would see the U.S. as "the paper tigers of Saigon" if they did not respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major [[show of force]]. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, while at the same time the air force was deployed, which included [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead, and later issued an unprecedented official apology.<ref>Gawthorpe, "The Ford Administration and Security Policy", pp. 710–714.</ref>

Ford was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency. In [[Sacramento, California]], on September 5, 1975, [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], a follower of [[Charles Manson]], pointed a [[M1911 Colt pistol|Colt .45-caliber handgun]] at Ford and pulled the trigger at [[point-blank range]].<ref name="GF:FL"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Ford-Assasinations-Attempts/12305821478075-12/ |title=1975 Year in Review: Ford Assassinations Attempts |publisher=Upi.com |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref> As she did, [[Larry Buendorf]],<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1026_041026_tv_secret_service2_2.html "Election Is Crunch Time for U.S. Secret Service"].

In reaction to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later.

Ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination. Former [[Governor of California]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and the party's [[American conservatism|conservative]] wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in [[South Vietnam]], for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the [[Panama Canal]].

Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous [[United States presidential primary|primaries]], including [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Indiana]], and [[California]], but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the [[1976 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].

Like Presidents Carter, [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]], Ford was an honorary co-chair of the [[Council for Excellence in Government]], a group dedicated to excellence in government performance, which provides leadership training to top federal employees. He also devoted much time to his love of golf, often playing both privately and in public events with comedian [[Bob Hope]], a longtime friend. In 1977, he shot a [[hole in one]] during a Pro-am held in conjunction with the [[Danny Thomas Memphis Classic]] at [[Colonial Country Club (Memphis)|Colonial Country Club]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He hosted the [[Jerry Ford Invitational]] in [[Vail, Colorado]] from 1977 to 1996.

In 1977, Ford established the Gerald R. Ford Institute of Public Policy at [[Albion College]] in [[Albion, Michigan]], to give undergraduates training in public policy. In April 1981, he opened the [[Gerald R.

Ford considered a run for the Republican nomination in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], forgoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with Carter. Ford attacked Carter's conduct of the SALT II negotiations and foreign policy in the Middle East and Africa. Many have argued that Ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an "Accidental President" and to win a term in his own right. Ford also believed the more conservative Ronald Reagan would be unable to defeat Carter and would hand the incumbent a second term. Ford was encouraged by his former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger as well as [[Jim Rhodes]] of Ohio and [[Bill Clements]] of Texas to make the race. On March 15, 1980, Ford announced that he would forgo a run for the Republican nomination, vowing to support the eventual nominee.

After securing the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford as a potential vice-presidential running mate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] were unsuccessful.

On October 3, 1980, Ford cast blame on Carter for the latter's charges of ineffectiveness on the part of the [[Federal Reserve Board]] due to his appointing of most of its members: "President Carter, when the going gets tough, will do anything to save his own political skin.

Scouting was so important to Ford that his family asked for Scouts to participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part of the funeral procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0703/a-ford.html|title=Eagle Scout Welcome Gerald Ford Home|last=Ray|first=Mark|year=2007|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|website=Scouting Magazine|accessdate=March 5, 2007}}</ref>

The State of Michigan commissioned and submitted a [[Gerald R. Ford (Grill)|statue of Ford]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], replacing [[Zachariah Chandler]]. It was unveiled on May 3, 2011, in the Capitol Rotunda. On the proper right side is inscribed a quotation from a tribute by [[Tip O'Neill]], Speaker of the House at the end of Ford's presidency: "God has been good to America, especially during difficult times. At the time of the Civil War, he gave us Abraham Lincoln. And at the time of Watergate, he gave us Gerald Ford—the right man at the right time who was able to put our nation back together again." On the proper left side are words from Ford's swearing-in address: "Our constitution works. Our great republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule."

Ford's wife, Betty Ford, died on July 8, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43692691|title=Former first lady Betty Ford dies at 93|date=July 9, 2011|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}</ref>

Ford is the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president. The choice of Ford to fulfill [[Spiro Agnew]]'s vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty.<ref name=sacrifice>{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/News/30916-Gerald-Ford-Bettys-husband/|title=Gerald Ford, Betty's Husband|accessdate=December 4, 2009|publisher=The Phoenix Media/Communications Group}}</ref> "In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word," said [[Martha Griffiths]].<ref name=publicimage />

The trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon.<ref name=publicimage>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/presidents/gerald-r-ford-1451818.html|title=Gerald R Ford|accessdate=December 2, 2009|work=The Independent | location=London | date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> Nonetheless, many grant in hindsight that he had respectably discharged with considerable dignity a great responsibility that he had not sought.<ref name=publicimage />

In spite of his athletic record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired a reputation as a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded [[Everyman]]. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz.<ref name=publicimage /><ref>{{cite news
