== Controversies ==

=== Working Families for Wal-Mart front group ===
In the 2000s, Edelman created a [[front group]] called the [[Working Families for Wal-Mart]], which said it was a [[grassroots]] organization, but was actually funded by [[Wal-Mart]]. It paid two bloggers to travel the country interviewing Wal-Mart employees, one of whom was a senior Edelman employee's sister. According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "everyone she talked to was delighted with Wal-Mart". In 2006, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' reported that the public relations effort, which was positioned as a grassroots blog, was actually paid for by Wal-Mart. ''The New Yorker'' called it a "blatant example of [[astroturfing]]".<ref name="new yorker">{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/02/070402fa_fact_goldberg|title=Selling Wal-Mart|last=Goldberg|first=Jeffrey|date=April 2, 2007|newspaper=The New Yorker}}</ref>

=== E.ON Kingsnorth coal power station ===
In 2008 Edelman's work with [[E.ON]], which planned to build a coal power station at [[Kingsnorth]] attracted protests at Edelman's UK headquarters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/search/article/832313/FRONT-PAGE-Activists-target-Edelman-climate-change-protest/|title=Activists target Edelman in climate change protest|date=July 17, 2008|newspaper=PR Week|accessdate=October 29, 2013}}</ref> In 2009, to coincide with the weeklong "Climate Camp" range of protests, a group of naked protestors occupied Edelman's reception.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=379:edelman-discovers-the-naked-truth&catid=1:stories&Itemid=115|title=Edelman discovers the naked truth|date=September 2009|newspaper=Communicate magazine|accessdate=October 29, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202930/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=379%3Aedelman-discovers-the-naked-truth&catid=1%3Astories&Itemid=115|archivedate=October 29, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>

=== Keystone XL pipeline and climate change deniers ===
Edelman was commissioned by [[TransCanada Corporation]] to run campaigns supporting the [[Keystone XL pipeline]], a proposed pipeline to carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries on the Gulf coast of [[Texas]].<ref name="oil">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/04/worlds-top-pr-companies-rule-out-working-with-climate-deniers|title=World's top PR companies rule out working with climate deniers|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|authorlink=Suzanne Goldenberg|date=August 2014|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> Edelman also developed a strategy for the proposed [[Energy East pipeline]] intended to carry tar sands oil through Québec, en route to a deep water harbor at [[Cacouna, Quebec]] for export abroad in supertankers and to refineries in New Brunswick. This resulted in a major controversy when documents leaked to [[Greenpeace]] revealed that Edelman had made some unethical proposals to sway public opinion in favor of its client.
