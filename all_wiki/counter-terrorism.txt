{{terrorism}}

'''Counter-terrorism''' (also spelled '''counterterrorism'''), also known as '''anti-terrorism''', incorporates the practice, [[military tactics]], techniques, and strategy that government, military, law enforcement, business, and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] use to combat or prevent [[terrorism]]. [[Strategy|Counter-terrorism strategy]] is a government's plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists, their organizations, and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists' goals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stigall, Miller, and Donnatucci |title=The 2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism: A Synoptic Overview |journal=American University National Security Law Brief |date=October 7, 2019 |ssrn=3466967 }}</ref>

If [[Definitions of terrorism|terrorism]] is part of a broader [[insurgency]], counter-terrorism may employ [[counter-insurgency]] measures. The [[United States Armed Forces]] use the term [[foreign internal defense]] for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency, lawlessness, or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Introduction to Foreign Internal Defense|url=https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-22-D01-FID-Introduction.pdf|journal=Curtis E.

At [[RAND Corporation]]'s workshop of experts in October 2019, which included [[David Kilcullen]], [[Ben Connable]], and [[Christine Wormuth]], the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Mick Mulroy]] officially rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex and said it was a critical component of the U.S. 2018 [[National Defense Strategy]]. He explained that [[irregular warfare]] (IW) included [[counter-insurgency]] (COIN), '''counter-terrorism''' (CT), [[unconventional warfare]] (UW), [[foreign internal defense]] (FID), [[sabotage]] and [[subversion]], as well as [[stabilization (warfare)|stabilization]] and [[information operations]] (IO), among other areas. He continued that IW was perceived as primarily the CT effort used to fight violent extremist organizations as that has been the focus since 2001, but it should be applied to all areas of military competition. These areas include the global powers competitors of China and Russia as well as the rogue states of North Korea and Iran. Mulroy emphasized that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with "aggressive, dynamic, and unorthodox approaches to IW" to be competitive across these priorities.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/nsrd/news/2019/10/dasd-mulroy.html|title=NSRD Hosts Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East, Michael Mulroy|website=www.rand.org}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Special Irish Branch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Special Branch]] detectives on an undercover operation at the [[London Docks]], 1911.]]
In response to the escalating [[Fenian dynamite campaign|terror campaign]] in Britain carried out by the militant [[Fenians|Irish Fenians]] in the 1880s, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], established the first counter-terrorism unit ever. The [[Special Irish Branch]] was initially formed as a section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] of the [[Metropolitan Police|London Metropolitan Police]] in 1883, to combat Irish republican terrorism through infiltration and subversion.

Harcourt envisioned a permanent unit dedicated to the prevention of politically motivated violence through the use of modern techniques such as [[undercover operation|undercover infiltration]]. This pioneering branch was the first to be trained in counter-terrorism techniques.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dMMAQAAQBAJ|title=Counter-Terrorism, Human Rights and the Rule of Law: Crossing Legal Boundaries in Defence of the State|author=Aniceto Masferrer, Clive Walker|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=294|isbn=9781781954478}}</ref>

== Planning ==

=== Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ===
{{See also|Intelligence cycle management|Intelligence analysis|HUMINT|Counterintelligence}}
Most counter-terrorism strategies involve an increase in standard police and domestic intelligence. The central activities are traditional: [[telephone tapping|interception of communications]] and the tracing of persons. New technology has, however, expanded the range of [[Manhunt (military)|military]] and [[manhunt (law enforcement)|law enforcement]] operations.

[[File:לוחמי הקומנדו הימי.JPG|left|thumb|[[Shayetet 13]], the Israeli naval special forces.]]
Domestic intelligence is often directed at specific groups, defined based on origin or religion, which is a source of political controversy. [[Mass surveillance]] of an entire population raises objections on [[civil liberties]] grounds. [[Homegrown terrorism|Homegrown terrorists]], especially [[Lone-wolf fighter|lone wolves]], are often harder to detect because of their citizenship or legal status and ability to stay under the radar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

To select the effective action when terrorism appears to be more of an isolated event, the appropriate government organizations need to understand the source, motivation, methods of preparation, and tactics of terrorist groups. Good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation, as well as political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved. Ideally, one gets information from inside the group, a very difficult challenge for [[HUMINT]] because [[Clandestine cell system|operational terrorist cells]] are often small, with all members known to one another, perhaps even related.<ref name="Feiler2007">{{cite journal

[[Counterintelligence]] is a great challenge with the security of cell-based systems, since the ideal, but the nearly impossible, goal is to obtain a [[Clandestine HUMINT|clandestine source]] within the cell. Financial tracking can play a role, as an [[SIGINT|communications intercept]]. However, both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy.

=== Legal contexts ===
{{Main|Anti-terrorism legislation}}
In response to the growing legislation.
; {{UK}}
* The United Kingdom has had anti-terrorism legislation in place for more than thirty years. The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953. It was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]], a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989, the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.
* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].
* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001, two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004, the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. However, under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offenses related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and, like its predecessors, some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.

Since 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.
;{{US}}
* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.
* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].
* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.
* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism and national response to major natural disasters and accidents.
* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval before deploying the Army or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act does not cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.
* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].
* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to focus solely on Islamist extremism.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02</ref>

; {{AUS}}
* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&nbsp;– a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]]."'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws "require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism." The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The "Shoot to Kill" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a "shoot-to-kill" clause. In a country with entrenched [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] traditions, the measures are controversial and have been criticized by [[civil libertarian]]s and [[Islam]]ic groups. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Examples of these problems can include prolonged, incommunicado detention without judicial review or long periods of 'preventive detention';<ref>de Londras, Detention in the War on Terrorism: Can Human Rights Fight Back?

Many would argue that such violations could exacerbate rather than counter the terrorist threat.<ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /> Human rights advocates argue for the crucial role of human rights protection as an intrinsic part to fight against terrorism.<ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /><ref>{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/preventive-counter-terrorism-measures-and-non-discrimination-in-the-european-union-the-need-for-systematic-evaluation/ |title=Preventive Counter-Terrorism Measures and Non-Discrimination in the European Union: The Need for Systematic Evaluation |date=2 July 2011 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism-The Hague (ICCT) | access-date= 6 September 2016}}</ref> This suggests, as proponents of [[human security]] have long argued, that respecting human rights may indeed help us to incur security. [[Amnesty International]] included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8–11, 2005):

{{quote|Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programs and policies of national governments as well as international bodies."<ref name="Amnesty International 2005">Amnesty International (2005): "Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU. [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior61/013/2005/en/ online]</ref>}}

While international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as [[human security]]) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders, and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the global effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.<ref name="Human Rights News 2004">Human Rights News (2004): "Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/01/29/global7127.htm online]</ref>

=== Preemptive neutralization ===
Some countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.

Another major method of preemptive neutralization is the [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion caused by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of [[inhuman or degrading treatment|inhuman and degrading treatment]], and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).

==== Non-military ====
The [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach that aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens, providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.

This can take many forms, including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors, including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.

[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.

A 2017 study found that "governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C. Tirone|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=62|issue=8|pages=1607–1635|language=en|doi=10.1177/0022002717704952|year=2018|last1=Savun|first1=Burcu|last2=Tirone|first2=Daniel C.|s2cid=158017999}}</ref>

==== Military ====
[[File:U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Ryan Burks, a squad leader with Fox Company, 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, Regimental Combat Team 7, provides security during a mission rehearsal at Camp Bastion, Helmand province 130527-M-QZ858-089.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines in Afghanistan]]
Terrorism has often been used to justify military intervention in countries like Pakistan, where terrorists are said to be based. That was the primary stated justification for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]. It was also a stated justification for the [[second Russian invasion of Chechnya]].

Military intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism, such as during the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Mau Mau uprising]], and most of the campaigns against the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] during the [[Irish Civil War]], the [[S-Plan]], the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]] and [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. Although military action can temporarily disrupt a terrorist group's operations temporarily, it sometimes does not end the threat completely.<ref>{{cite book

Thus repression by the military in itself (particularly if it is not accompanied by other measures) usually leads to short term victories, but tend to be unsuccessful in the long run (e.g., the French's doctrine described in [[Roger Trinquier]]'s book ''Modern War''<ref name="Trinquier">{{cite web

== Preparation ==
Police, fire, and emergency medical response organizations have prominent roles. Local [[firefighter]]s and emergency medical personnel (often called "first responders") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks. However, the police may deal with threats of such attacks.

=== Target-hardening ===

Whatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place [[Hostile vehicle mitigation]] to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and [[truck bomb]]ing. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.<ref>{{cite journal

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Iron Dome Intercepts Rockets from the Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Dome]] air defense system. It intercepts artillery rockets fired by terrorists onto Israeli cities and towns.]]
As [[Israel]] is suffering from constant shelling of its cities, towns, and settlements by [[artillery rocket]]s from the [[Gaza Strip]] (mainly by [[Hamas]], but also by other Palestinian factions) and [[Lebanon]] (mainly by [[Hezbollah]]), Israel developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets, and missiles. These include building a [[bomb shelter]] in every building and [[school]], but also deploying active protection systems like the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow ABM]], [[Iron Dome]] and [[David's Sling]] batteries which intercept the incoming threat in the air. [[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

A more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> To put this risk into perspective, the first [[Poison gas in World War I#1915: large scale use and lethal gases|major lethal chemical attack in WWI]] used 160 tons of chlorine. Industrial shipments of chlorine, widely used in water purification and the chemical industry, travel in 90- or 55-ton tank cars.

To give one more example, the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated, in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate, possibly insecure, [[SCADA]] (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks. Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation, leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities. A small number of terrorists, attacking critical power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.

Equipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Command and control ===
In North America and other continents, for a threatened or completed terrorist attack, the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be required for multiple incidents in a given area (<!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.-->e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. For example, a national response might be required for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or significant chemical attack.

=== Damage mitigation ===
[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.

=== Local security ===
Again under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will typically involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.

=== Medical services ===
[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more severely affected victims to hospitals, which will need mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.

[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to the national level, maybe designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.

== Tactical units ==
[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]

Today, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats. Besides various [[security agency|security agencies]], there are [[Special Weapons And Tactics|elite tactical units]], also known as [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]], whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NSG Air Assault Mumbai Attacks.jpg|left|thumb|224x224px|[[National Security Guard|NSG]] commandos launching their assault on terrorist occupied [[Nariman House]] during the [[2008 Mumbai Attacks]]]] -->
Such units perform both in preventive actions, [[hostage rescue]], and responding to on-going attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques, and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.

Most of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.<ref>{{cite journal

These units are specially trained in [[military tactics|tactics]] and are very well equipped for [[close quarters battle|CQB]] with emphasis on stealth and performing the mission with minimal casualties. The units include take-over force (assault teams), [[sniper]]s, [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] experts, dog handlers, and intelligence officers. See [[counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations]] for national command, intelligence, and incident mitigation.

The majority of counter-terrorism operations at the tactical level are conducted by state, federal, and national [[police|law enforcement agencies]] or [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. In some countries, the military may be called in as a last resort. Obviously, for countries whose military is legally permitted to conduct police operations, this is a non-issue, and such counter-terrorism operations are conducted by their military.

See [[counterintelligence]] for command, intelligence and warning, and incident mitigation aspects of counter-terror.

=== Designing Anti-terrorism systems ===

[[File:Transparent garbage bins at Central station.jpg|thumb|upright|Transparent garbage bin installed at Central station in Sydney so police can check its contents]]

The scope for Anti-terrorism systems is very large in physical terms (long borders, vast areas, high traffic volumes in busy cities, etc.) as well as in other dimensions, such as type and degree of terrorism threat, political and diplomatic ramifications, and legal issues. In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.

A particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366–379 | pmid = 19076327| s2cid = 36370133}}</ref>

=== Law enforcement/Police ===
While some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000). Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.</ref> in other nations, counter-terrorism is a relatively more recent objective of civilian police and law enforcement agencies.<ref name="Deflem">Deflem, Mathieu. 2010. The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.</ref><ref>Deflem, Mathieu and Samantha Hauptman. 2013. "Policing International Terrorism." Pp. 64–72 in Globalisation and the Challenge to Criminology, edited by Francis Pakes. London: Routledge. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/2013/01/policinginternationalterrorism.html]</ref>

While some civil-libertarians and criminal justice scholars have called-out efforts of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism as futile and expensive<ref name="HelmsCostanzaJohnson">{{Cite journal|last1=Helms|first1=Ronald|last2=Costanza|first2=S E|last3=Johnson|first3=Nicholas|date=2012-02-01|title=Crouching tiger or phantom dragon?

=== Counter-Terrorism and American Law Enforcement ===
[[File:FBI Hostage Rescue Team Agents bei einer Übung.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hostage Rescue Team]] agents]]
Pursuant to passage of the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]], federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies began to systemically reorganize.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Costanza | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Kilburn Jr | first2 = John C. | year = 2005 | title = Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism | journal = Journal of Social and Ecological Boundaries | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 106–124 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Deflem | first1 = M | year = 2004 | title = Social Control and the Policing of Terrorism Foundations for a sociology of Counterterrorism | url = http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/social-control-and-policing-of.html | journal = American Sociologist | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 75–92 | doi = 10.1007/bf02692398 | s2cid = 143868466 }}</ref> Two primary federal agencies (the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS)) house most of the federal agencies that are prepared to combat domestic and international terrorist attacks. These include the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and the [[FBI]].

Following suit from federal changes pursuant to 9/11, however, most state and local law enforcement agencies began to include a commitment to "fighting terrorism" in their mission statements.<ref>DeLone, Gregory J. 2007. "Law Enforcement Mission Statements Post September 11." Police Quarterly 10(2)</ref><ref>Mathieu Deflem. 2010. The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.</ref> Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies.  Some scholars have doubted the ability of local police to help in the war on terror and suggest their limited manpower is still best utilized by engaging community and targeting street crimes.<ref name="HelmsCostanzaJohnson"/>

While counter-terror measures (most notably heightened airport security, immigrant [[Racial profiling|profiling]]<ref>Ramirez, D., J. Hoopes, and T.L. Quinlan.  2003 "Defining racial profiling in a post-September 11 world." American Criminal Law Review. 40(3): 1195–1233.</ref> and border patrol) have been adapted during the last decade, to enhance counter-terror in law enforcement, there have been remarkable limitations to assessing the actual utility/effectiveness of law enforcement practices that are ostensibly preventative.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kilburn | first1 = John C | last2 = Jr | last3 = Costanza | first3 = S.E. | last4 = Metchik | first4 = Eric | last5 = Borgeson | first5 = Kevin | year = 2011 | title = Policing Terror Threats and False Positives: Employing a Signal Detection Model to Examine Changes in National and Local Policing Strategy between 2001–2007 | journal = Security Journal | volume = 24 | pages = 19–36 | doi = 10.1057/sj.2009.7 | s2cid = 153825273 }}</ref>  Thus, while sweeping changes in counter-terrorism rhetoric redefined most American post 9/11 law enforcement agencies in theory, it is hard to assess how well such hyperbole has translated into practice.

In [[intelligence-led policing]](ILP) efforts, the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is usually to assess total financial costs against clearance rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,<ref>Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  "Immigration and Homeland Security"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.</ref> measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible.

[[File:ARW 30th Anniversary - 4478058309.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ireland|Irish]] [[Army Ranger Wing]] operators during counter-terrorism training exercise.]]Within military operational approaches Counter-terrorism falls into the category of [[Irregular Warfare]].<ref>Kitzen M. (2020) Operations in Irregular Warfare. In: Sookermany A. (eds) Handbook of Military Sciences. p. 1-21. Springer, Cham {{doi|10.1007/978-3-030-02866-4_81-1}}</ref> Given the nature of operational counter-terrorism tasks national military organizations do not generally have dedicated units whose sole responsibility is the prosecution of these tasks. Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.

In some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.

In cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.
