Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the [[Province of New York]] began as early as 1704, at which time [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Colonel Lewis Morris]] wrote to the [[United Society Partners in the Gospel|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], the missionary arm of the [[Church of England]], persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.<ref name="McCaughey2003">{{cite book|title=Stand, Columbia : A History of Columbia University in the City of New York|last=McCaughey|first=Robert|year=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-231-13008-0|page=1}}<!--|accessdate=April 11, 2011--></ref> However, it was not until the founding of the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (renamed [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) across the [[Hudson River]] in [[New Jersey]] that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.<ref name="McCaughey2003" /> In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the [[Church of England]], to direct the funds accrued by the [[state lottery]] towards the foundation of a college.<ref>{{cite book|title=Columbia|url=https://archive.org/details/columbia01keppgoog|last=Keppel|first=Fredrick Paul|year=1914|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|page=[https://archive.org/details/columbia01keppgoog/page/n49 26]}}</ref>

In 1763, Dr. Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by [[Myles Cooper]], a graduate of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and an ardent [[Tory]].

After the Revolution, the college turned to the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.<ref name="Matthews 1904"/>{{rp|59}} The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed "an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College".<ref name="History of Columbia">{{Cite book|title=A History of Columbia University, 1754–1904|year=1904|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4021-3737-2}}</ref> The Act created a [[Board of Regents]] to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that "the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]",<ref name="History of Columbia" /> a reference to [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], an alternative name for America. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by [[John Jay]] and Alexander Hamilton.

On May 21, 1787, [[William Samuel Johnson]], the son of [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Dr. Samuel Johnson]], was unanimously elected president of Columbia College.

In the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the [[Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs|School of International and Public Affairs]] was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/newcuhome/content/history.html|title=History – Columbia University in the City of New York|website=Columbia.edu|access-date=November 24, 2016}}</ref>

During the 1960s [[Columbia University protests of 1968|Columbia experienced large-scale student activism]], which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus.

===Morningside Heights===
[[File:Columbia College Walk.jpg|thumb|College Walk]]
The majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] on [[Seth Low]]'s late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning principles by the architects [[McKim, Mead & White]]. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six [[city block]]s, or {{convert|32|acres|abbr=on}}, in [[Morningside Heights]], New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive [[Columbia University tunnels|tunnel system]] more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus.

The Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as [[Butler Library]], is the largest single library in the [[Columbia University Library System]], and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as "South Hall" by the university's former president [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] as expansion plans for [[Low Memorial Library]] stalled, the new library was funded by [[Edward Harkness]], benefactor of Yale's [[residential college]] system, and designed by his favorite architect, [[James Gamble Rogers]]. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is [[neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the [[Ionic order]] above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Core Curriculum]] of [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/img/assets/5295/SelfGuided.pdf|title=Butler Library: Self-Guided Tour|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, [[Columbia University Library System|Columbia's library system]] includes over 11.9 &nbsp;million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.columbia.edu/about/facts.html|publisher=Columbia University|title=Libraries and Collections: Fast Facts|access-date=April 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm|publisher=American Library Association|title=The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held|access-date=April 11, 2013}}</ref>

A statue by sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]] called ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' is centered on the front steps of [[Low Memorial Library]]. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing [[List of Latin phrases (S)|sapientia and doctrina]]. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a [[royal charter]] institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!20526~!0#focus|title=Alma Mater (sculpture)|author=Smithsonian American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution|access-date=April 14, 2011}}</ref> The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a [[women's college]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|title=The Myth of the College Sweetheart|author=Meredith Foster|date=February 11, 2011|work=The Eye|publisher=Columbia Spectator|access-date=April 14, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307091227/http://eye.columbiaspectator.com/article/2011/02/10/myth-college-sweetheart|archive-date=March 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/newrec/2423/tmpl/story.4.html|title=What Is the Mace?

"The Steps", alternatively known as "Low Steps" or the "Urban Beach", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the [[City Beautiful movement]], the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies.

Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars "distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/scholars/named|title=The Named Scholars|website=Studentaffairs.columbia.edu|access-date=August 3, 2015}}</ref>

In 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by [[The New York Times]] as "the first modern college application." The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gross, Jessica|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/magazine/who-made-that-college-application.html|title=Who Made That College Application?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 10, 2013|access-date=August 31, 2018}}</ref>

Columbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is "The [[Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York]]." The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]''. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name="Columbia.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=April 17, 2011}}</ref>

The University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/|title=Columbia University Senate|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=April 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="senate.columbia.edu">{{cite web|title=Election packet |date=2017 |url=http://senate.columbia.edu |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/topbar_pages/elections.html|title=Elections|website=Senate.columbia.edu}}</ref>

[[List of Presidents of Columbia University|The president of Columbia University]], who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.<ref name="Columbia.edu"/> [[Lee C. Bollinger]] became the 19th president of Columbia University on June 1, 2002. A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases—[[Grutter v Bollinger]] and [[Gratz v Bollinger]]—that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education. A leading First Amendment scholar, he is widely published on freedom of speech and press, and {{when|date=April 2012}} serves on the faculty of Columbia Law School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/president/docs/bio/index.html|title=Office of the President: Lee Bollinger|website=Columbia.edu|access-date=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

On-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] and the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: [[Hartley Hall]], [[Wallach Hall]] (originally Livingston Hall), [[John Jay Hall]], Furnald Hall or [[Harry Carman|Carman Hall]]. Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], [[Barnard College]] and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/admissions/university/campus/housing.php|title=Housing and Dining|publisher=Columbia University Office of Student Affairs|access-date=April 16, 2011}}</ref>

====Broadcasting====
[[File:Earl Hall Columbia University NYC.jpg|thumb|Earl Hall]]
Columbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate [[campus radio]] broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. [[WKCR]], the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Major Edwin Armstrong]]. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentaffairs.columbia.edu/wkcr/history|title="The Original FM": The Columbia University Radio Club|publisher=Columbia University|year=2009|access-date=January 12, 2013}}</ref> The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at [[4 Times Square]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]].

Columbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against [[Rutgers University]] in the second football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed [[Henley Royal Regatta]] in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student [[Maxie Long]] set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18–0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1–0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/athletics/athletics_timeline.html|title=Columbia Athletics Highlight|publisher=Columbia University|year=2004|access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref> The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA [[Football Championship Subdivision]]. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16–13 victory over archrival [[Princeton University]].

===Protests of 1968===
[[File:Hamilton statue at Columbia University IMG 0958.JPG|thumb|[[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]] was occupied by protesting students in 1968]]
{{Main|Columbia University protests of 1968}}

Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]], perceived as a segregated facility, with limited access by the black residents of neighboring [[Harlem]]. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in [[the Pentagon]]'s weapons research think-tank, the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside [[Low Memorial Library|Low Library]], [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html "Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion"].

The protests achieved two of their stated goals. Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym, building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead. A popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by [[Princeton University]] for the expansion of its athletic facilities, but as [[Jadwin Gymnasium]] was already 50% complete by 1966 (when the Columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct.<ref>Hevesi, Dennis.

Many of the Class of '68 walked out of their graduation and held a countercommencement on Low Plaza with a picnic following at Morningside Park, the place where the protests began.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/sites/cct/files/cct_spring_1968.pdf|title=Columbia College Today|author=George Keller|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=April 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614084125/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/sites/cct/files/cct_spring_1968.pdf|archive-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref> The protests hurt Columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school. [[Allan Bloom]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]],
believed that the protest efforts at Columbia were responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left. As a result of the protests, Bloom stated, "American universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate, but rather places of 'political correctness' and liberalism."<ref>{{cite book|title=Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s|last=Bradley|first=Stefan|year=2009|publisher=University of Illinois|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-252-03452-7|pages=5–19, 164–191, 174}}<!--| accessdate=April 18, 2011--></ref> {{when|date=January 2013}}

===Protests against racism and apartheid===
[[File:Columbia University by Rangilo.JPG|thumb|left|School of Arts]]

Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]] and the Business School<ref>"[[Disinvestment from South Africa#University campuses]]"</ref> during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. university.

The initial (and partial) Columbia divestment,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Columbia Senate Supports Selling South African Stocks Selectively|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 7, 1978|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/07/archives/columbia-senate-supports-selling-south-african-stocks-selectively.html}}</ref>
focused largely on bonds and financial institutions directly involved with the South African regime.<ref>{{cite news|title=Trustees vote for divestiture from backers of S.

Broadly backed by student groups and many faculty members the Committee Against Investment in South Africa held teach-ins and demonstrations through the year focused on the trustees ties to the corporations doing business with South Africa. Trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in May 1978 in the takeover of the Graduate School of Business.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Demonstration at Columbia|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=May 2, 1978}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Student Sit-in at Columbia|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=May 2, 1978}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, professor [[Joseph Massad]], held an elective course called Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies at Columbia.

===Ahmadinejad speech controversy===

The [[School of International and Public Affairs]] extends invitations to heads of state and heads of government who come to New York City for the opening of the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, [[Iran]]ian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/07/09/ahmadinejad2.html|title=President Bollinger's Statement About President Ahmadinejad's Scheduled Appearance|date=September 19, 2007|publisher=Columbia News}}</ref> The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President [[Lee C. Bollinger]] tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/24/politics/main3292477.shtml|title=Candidates Speak Out On Ahmadinejad Visit|date=September 24, 2007|publisher=CBS News}}</ref> Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.

During his speech, Ahmadinejad criticized [[Israel]]'s policies towards the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]; called for research on the historical accuracy of [[the Holocaust]]; raised questions as to who initiated the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]]; defended Iran's [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear power program]], criticizing the UN's policy of sanctions on his country; and attacked [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] in the Middle East. In response to a question about Iran's [[Human rights in Iran|treatment]] of [[Women's rights in Iran|women]] and [[LGBT rights in Iran|homosexuals]], he asserted that women are respected in Iran and that "In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country…In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon.

In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum on the question of whether or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In April 2010 during [[Admiral]] [[Mike Mullen]]'s address at Columbia, President [[Lee C. Bollinger]] stated that the ROTC would be readmitted to campus if the admiral's plans for revoking the [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy were successful. In February 2011 during one of three town-hall meetings on the ROTC ban, former Army staff sergeant Anthony Maschek, a [[Purple Heart]] recipient for injuries sustained during his service in Iraq, was booed and hissed at by some students during his speech promoting the idea of allowing the ROTC on campus.<ref>Karni, Annie, "[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hero_unwelcome_Zi3u1fwtRpo87vXAiAQfSN]", ''New York Post'', February 20, 2011.</ref> In April 2011 the Columbia University Senate voted to welcome the ROTC program back on campus.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/02/columbia-rotc_n_843992.html], "Huff Post College", April 2, 2011.</ref> Secretary of the Navy [[Ray Mabus]] and Columbia University President Lee C.

===Orgo Night===
In one of the school's longest-lasting traditions, begun in 1975,<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 20, 1975 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/20/archives/columbia-cram-session-can-be-fun-too.html|title=Columbia Cram Session Can Be Fun, Too | access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> at midnight before the Organic Chemistry exam—often the first day of final exams—the [[Columbia University Marching Band]] invaded and briefly occupied the main undergraduate reading room in [[Butler Library]] to distract and entertain studying students with some forty-five minutes of raucous jokes and music, beginning and ending with the singing of the school's fight song, "[[Roar, Lion, Roar]]". After the main show before a crowd that routinely began filling the room well before the announced midnight start time, the Band led a procession to several campus locations, including the residential quadrangle of [[Barnard College]] for more music and temporary relief from the stress of last-minute studying.

In December 2016, following several years of complaints from students who said that some Orgo Night scripts and advertising posters were offensive to minority groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2014/12/11/if-you-go-orgo-night-youre-part-problem/| title=If you go to Orgo Night, you're part of the problem | work=Columbia Daily Spectator |access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> as well as a ''The New York Times'' article on the Band's crass treatment of sexual assault on campus,<ref>{{cite news | last=Taylor | first=Kate | title=This Year, Columbia Event Finds Joke Fodder in Sexual Assault Debate | newspaper=The New York Times | date=May 9, 2015 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/nyregion/columbia-bands-traditional-show-includes-jokes-about-sexual-assault-debate.html | access-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref>

The Band's official alumni organization, the Columbia University Band Alumni Association, registered protests with the administration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://columbiabandalumni.org/orgo-night/ | title=Orgo Night! |website=Columbiabandalumni.org |access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> and an ad hoc group of alumni writing under the name "A.

===Tree-Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies===
[[File:Collegewalk2.jpg|thumb|Tree-Lighting at College Walk]]
The campus Tree-Lighting Ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by ''a cappella'' groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|author=Jason Hollander|publisher=Columbia University News|access-date=April 15, 2011}}</ref>

Immediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], but lapsed before being revived by University President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as [[Continental Army]] soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' by [[Clement Clarke Moore]] and ''[[Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus]]'' by [[Francis Pharcellus Church]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hollander|first=Jason|date=December 3, 1999|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|work=Columbia News|access-date=August 10, 2006}}</ref>

===The Varsity Show===
[[The Varsity Show]] is an annual musical written by and for students and was established in 1894, making it one of Columbia's oldest traditions. Past writers and directors have included Columbians [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Oscar Hammerstein]], [[Lorenz Hart]], [[I.A.L. Diamond]], [[Herman Wouk]] and [[Eric Garcetti]]. The show has one of the largest operating budgets of all university events.<ref>{{cite web|date=January 10, 2005|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/04/04/varsity_show.html|title=The Varsity Show, April 15–18|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=December 3, 2006}}</ref>
