'''Franciscus Cornelis Gerardus Maria Timmermans''' ({{IPA-nl|frɑnˈsɪskʏs kɔrˈneːlɪs xeːˈrɑrdʏs frɑns ˈtɪmərˌmɑns}};<ref>In isolation, ''Gerardus'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|ɣeːˈrɑrdʏs|}}.</ref> born 6 May 1961) is a Dutch politician and diplomat serving as [[Vice-President of the European Commission|First Vice President of the European Commission]] since 2014, and has served in the [[von der Leyen Commission]] as [[European Green Deal|Executive Vice President of the European Commission for the European Green Deal]] and [[European Commissioner for Climate Action]] since 2019.

[[File:Delegatieoverleg (8632434850).jpg|thumb|Timmermans with Dutch Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] and [[Russia]]n President [[Vladimir Putin]], 6 March 2013]]

==Diplomatic career==
On 1 August 1987, Timmermans was discharged from military service in the [[Royal Netherlands Army]]. Timmermans joined the Dutch Civil Service as an officer in the Integration Department at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], in [[The Hague]]. On 1 July 1990, he was appointed Deputy Secretary of the Dutch Embassy in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. On 1 September 1993, he returned to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], as Deputy Head of the Bureau for European Development Cooperation. On 15 March 1994, he left the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] becoming Assistant to [[European Commissioner]] [[Hans van den Broek]]. Timmermans moved from this post a year later on 15 March 1995, to become Senior Advisor and Private Secretary to [[Max van der Stoel]], the High Commissioner for National Minorities of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE).

==Political career==
===Member of the House of Representatives===
After the [[1998 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 1998]] Timmermans was elected a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] for the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and was installed as [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] on 19 May 1998. He served as the Deputy Chairman of the Commission for Foreign Affairs from November 2001 until September 2002 when he became the Chairman of the Commission for Economic Affairs until 18 March 2003 when he again became the Deputy Chairman of the Commission for Foreign Affairs serving until 22 February 2007. Timmermans represented the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], in the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] from March 2002 until July 2003. Timmermans also served as a Member of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] from 21 September 1998 until 22 February 2007. Timmermans was reelected to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] after the [[2002 Dutch general election|Dutch general elections of 2002]] and [[2003 Dutch general election|2003]].

===Undersecretary===
After the [[2006 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2006]] the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[ChristianUnion]] (CU) formed a coalition agreement which resulted in the [[2006-07 Dutch cabinet formation|formation]] of the [[Fourth Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende IV]]. Timmermans became [[Undersecretary]] for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Foreign Affairs]] and was responsible for the co-ordination of government policy towards the [[European Union]], and was conferred the diplomatic title of Minister of European Affairs during international visits. A major theme of his time as [[Undersecretary]] for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|European Affairs]] was to increase support for European integration. This was done both by seeking greater influence of citizens on European policies and by improving communication and public perception; besides citizens the aim was that education should have also be more involved with Europe. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed whilst he was [[Undersecretary]], before which Timmermans and [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] successfully lobbied to secure a greater role for national parliaments in [[European Union]] decision-making processes. In February 2010, [[NATO]] officially requested the Netherlands to extend its military involvement in [[Task Force Uruzgan]]. The [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] strongly opposed the extension of the mission and on 23 February 2010 the [[Fourth Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende IV]] fell after the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] officially withdrew its support with all [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] Cabinet members resigning.

===Return as a Member of the House of Representatives===
Following the withdrawal of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] from the coalition government, the [[Fourth Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende IV]] remained as a [[Demissionary cabinet|Demissionary Cabinet]] until the [[2010 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2010]]. Following a coalition agreement between the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (Vvd), [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and the [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV), the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] became the official opposition. Timmermans was returned to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], being installed on 17 June 2010. During his second term as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] he served as Parliamentary Spokesman of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] for Foreign Affairs and European Affairs.

After the fall of the [[First Rutte cabinet|Cabinet Rutte I]]. The [[2012 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2012]], resulted in the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] forming a coalition agreement resulting in the formation of the [[Second Rutte cabinet|Cabinet Rutte II]], and Timmermans being appointed [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], taking office on 5 November 2012.

On 24 March and 25 March 2014 the [[Netherlands]] hosted the [[2014 Nuclear Security Summit]], Timmermans as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] was charged with welcoming all attending representatives.

In May 2014, Timmermans condemned [[Geert Wilders]]' anti-Islam sticker, saying that "The Netherlands cannot be held responsible for the adolescent behavior of a single parliamentarian."<ref>{{cite news |title=Dutch send top diplomat to avert Saudi sanctions over anti-Islam stickers |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-saudi-wilders/dutch-send-top-diplomat-to-avert-saudi-sanctions-over-anti-islam-stickers-idUSBREA4K0HS20140521 |agency=Reuters |date=21 May 2014}}</ref> Timmermans said that [[Saudi Arabia]] is "deeply offended by the sticker action."<ref>{{cite news |title=Wilders damage control forces minister to Saudi Arabia |url=https://nltimes.nl/2014/05/27/wilders-damage-control-forces-minister-saudi-arabia |work=NL Times |date=27 May 2014}}</ref>

On 17 July 2014, passenger flight [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] was shot down over [[Ukraine]] resulting in the deaths of 194 [[Netherlands|Dutch]] citizens. The next day Timmermans flew to [[Kiev]] to meet with [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] and [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]] to discuss the matter, following which, on 21 July 2014, Timmermans addressed the [[United Nations Security Council]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Timmermans delivered an emotional speech which was widely praised by the international community. His speech called for Dutch Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte|Rutte]] and the [[International Community]] to help bring the victims home and start an investigation to make sure that those responsible are brought to justice. He states: "I call on the international community, on the Security Council, on anyone with influence on the situation on the ground: allow us to bring the victims’ remains home to their loved ones without any further delay. They deserve to be home." A statement in his speech about the careless way with which the local population was said to have treated the bodies of the victims appeared to be imprecise. Timmermans acknowledged this later on in a letter to the Dutch parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/frans.timmermans/posts/765080793514782|title=Hier de tekst van mijn speech in de VN... - Frans Timmermans - Facebook}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=U.N.

In August 2014, Timmermans called for an independent investigation into [[Israel]]'s actions during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Gaza is about Israel, not Jews: Timmermans |url=https://nltimes.nl/2014/08/06/gaza-israel-jews-timmermans |work=NL Times |date=6 August 2014}}</ref>

===European Commission (2014–2019)===
[[File:Frans Timmermans' inspirational speech to EU Parliament.webm|thumb|7 July 2016 speech to EU Parliament by Timmermans (5 1/2 min.)]]

In September 2014, the [[Dutch Government]] nominated Frans Timmermans as its prospective member of the [[European Commission]] under President-elect [[Jean-Claude Juncker]]. On 1 November 2014, Timmermans took office as [[Vice-President of the European Commission|First Vice President]] in Juncker's European Commission, and served as President Juncker's first deputy and right-hand man. Timmermans' portfolio comprises Better Regulation, Inter-Institutional Relations, Rule of Law and [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/09/10/timmermans-wordt-eerste-vicevoorzitter-van-de-europese-commissie/|title=Timmermans wordt eerste vice-president van de Europese Commissie|work=nrc.nl}}</ref>

In May 2016, Timmermans said that [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdoğan]]'s [[Turkey]] "has made impressive progress, particularly in recent weeks, on meeting the benchmarks of its [[European Union–Turkey relations|visa liberalisation]] roadmap. There is still work to be done as a matter of urgency but if Turkey sustains the progress made, they can meet the remaining benchmarks."<ref>{{cite news |title=European Commission backs visa-free travel for Turkey |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/european-commission-backs-visa-free-travel-for-turkey-1.2634612 |work=The Irish Times |date=4 May 2016}}</ref>

Timmermans repeatedly criticized [[Poland]]'s [[2015 Polish Constitutional Court crisis|judiciary reform]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Comments on Frans Timmermans’ article on Poland |url=https://polska.pl/politics/foreign-affairs/comments-frans-timmermans-article-poland/ |work=Polska.pl |date=12 December 2016}}</ref> saying that "these laws considerably increase the systemic threats to the rule of law in Poland."<ref>{{cite news |title=EU threatens Poland with sanctions as judiciary stand-off escalates |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20170719-european-union-threatens-poland-with-sanctions-over-judicial-shake-court |work=France 24 |date=19 July 2017}}</ref> In April 2019, the Commission had launched a new infringement proceedings [[Poland in the European Union|against Poland]] over [[Judiciary of Poland|independence of judges]]. Timmermans said: "The new disciplinary regime undermines the judicial independence of Polish judges by not offering necessary guarantees to protect them from political control, as required by the Court of Justice of the European Union."<ref>{{cite news |title=EU targets Poland, Romania with defence of judicial independence |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-poland-judiciary/eu-targets-poland-romania-with-defence-of-judicial-independence-idUKKCN1RF1BJ |agency=Reuters |date=3 April 2019}}</ref>

Timmermans supported the [[European migrant crisis#Relocation and resettlement of asylum seekers|mandatory migrant quotas]] within the EU. He said that people coming to the EU "are fellow human beings who, I think, deserve to seek refuge when they flee the barbarism that the [[jihad]]ists are inflicting upon them."<ref>{{cite news |title=Commissioner and Czech minister argue over migration |url=https://euobserver.com/political/138252 |work=[[EUobserver]] |date=16 June 2017}}</ref>

===Unsuccessful candidacy for the European Commission presidency===

In October 2018, Frans Timmermans announced his candidacy for the office of [[President of the European Commission]] ahead of the [[2019 European Parliament election|2019 European election]].
In December 2018, during the Congress of Lisbon, the [[Party of European Socialists]] acclaimed him as its candidate. He was formally nominated as the PES Common Candidate in Madrid in February 2019. Timmermans said he intended to challenge the dominance of the [[European People's Party|EPP]] by building a left coalition in the [[European Parliament]].<ref>[https://www.politico.eu/article/timmermans-lays-ground-for-left-coalition-against-epp/ Timmermans lays ground for left coalition against EPP, 16 May 2019, politico.eu]</ref> His party finished second in the election behind the EPP, but after having discussed the parliamentary lead candidates [[Manfred Weber]], Timmermans and occasionally also [[Margrethe Vestager]] of the three largest European parties in the parliament several times, the [[European Council]] initially intended to nominate Timmermans for the office of commission president mostly because of Weber's alleged missing experience on the international stage. However, when governments from Eastern Europe protested this decision because of their strong opposition against Timmerman's fight on behalf of the commission for the rule of law and against reforms which are prospected to undermine it in these countries, the Council almost unanimously proposed German Defense Minister [[Ursula von der Leyen]] as a compromise candidate in July 2019, a controversial decision among many members of the European Parliament, as she had neither been running for the office nor taken part in the European election, while such a process had informally been agreed as the gold standard since 2014. Therefore, the sole abstention with her nomination came from Germany themselves because part of the German coalition government did not accept such a move. Yet, von der Leyen was subsequently elected with a narrow majority by the European Parliament, promised to argue for a better implementation and formalisation of the desired parliamentary process in the future and announced that lead candidates Timmermans and Vestagher would become Vice-Presidents in her commission.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49010801|title=MEPs back von der Leyen as EU Commission head|date=16 July 2019|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>

===European Commission (since 2019)===

In 2019, [[President of the European Commission]], [[Ursula von der Leyen]] requested Frans Timmermans continue in his role as First Vice President while also designating him as one of the three new [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Executive Vice Presidents of the European Commission]]. As Executive Vice President Timmermans will be responsible for the European Green Deal.<ref name=Mission>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/mission-letter-frans-timmermans-2019_en.pdf|title=Mission letter of Frans Timmermans|date=10 September 2019|via=ec.europa.eu}}</ref> Timmermans is also responsible for a European Green Deal and a European Climate Law in their first hundred days in office.<ref name=Mission/>

==Family and personal life==
Timmermans has married twice, having two children in his first marriage, a daughter (born 1986) and a son (born 1989). Timmermans remarried in 2000 to Irene Timmermans; he and his second wife have a son (born 2004) and a daughter (born 2006).
