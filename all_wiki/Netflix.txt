'''Netflix, Inc.''' is an American [[Over-the-top media services|over-the-top content platform]] and [[production company]] headquartered in [[Los Gatos, California]]. Netflix was founded in 1997 by [[Reed Hastings]] and [[Marc Randolph]] in [[Scotts Valley, California]]. The company's primary business is a subscription-based [[Streaming service provider|streaming service]] offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house.<ref name="NYFLIX">{{Cite news |title=A Stream of Movies, Sort of Free |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/technology/25pogue.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 25, 2007 |access-date=February 7, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=David |last=Pogue |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322100820/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/technology/25pogue.html |archive-date=March 22, 2016 }}</ref> As of October 2020, Netflix had over 195&nbsp;million paid subscriptions worldwide, including 73&nbsp;million in the United States.<ref name="Investor letter 2020 Q2">{{cite web|title=Investor letter 2020 Q3|url=https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/FINAL-Q3-20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf|access-date=November 14, 2020|website=Netflix IR}}</ref> It is available worldwide except in the following: mainland China (due to local restrictions), [[Syria]], [[North Korea]], and [[Crimea]] (due to US sanctions).

Netflix's initial business model included [[DVD]] sales and rental by mail, but Hastings abandoned the sales about a year after the company's founding to focus on the initial DVD rental business.<ref name=NYFLIX/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Netflixed: The Epic Battle for America's Eyeballs|last=Keating|first=Gina|publisher=Portfolio/Penguin|year=2012|isbn=9781101601433|location=New York|page=47}}</ref> Netflix expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental business.

Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series [[House of Cards (American TV series)|''House of Cards'']].

Since 2012, Netflix has taken more of an active role as producer and distributor for both film and television series, and to that end, offers a variety of "[[List of Netflix original programming|Netflix Original]]" content through its online library.<ref>{{cite web |title = Netflix chief bulks up on series (600 hours!) |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/01/17/netflix-chief-bulks-up-series-600-hours/78931816/ |website = USA Today |access-date = February 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129042636/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/01/17/netflix-chief-bulks-up-series-600-hours/78931816/ |archive-date = January 29, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> By January 2016, Netflix services operated in more than 190 countries.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Netflix Expands to 190 Countries |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-expands-to-190-countries-1452106429 |newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |access-date = February 7, 2016 |issn = 0099-9660 |first1 = Ezequiel |last1 = Minaya |first2 = Amol |last2 = Sharma |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160207005329/http://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-expands-to-190-countries-1452106429 |archive-date = February 7, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Netflix released an estimated 126 [[original series]] and films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.<ref name="hr-backlash" /> Their efforts to produce new content, secure the rights for additional content, and diversify through 190 countries have resulted in the company racking up billions in debt: $21.9&nbsp;billion as of September 2017, up from $16.8&nbsp;billion from the previous year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/10/16/anticipation-builds-pushing-stock-up-ahead-of-netflixs-earnings-report.html|title=Netflix sinking deeper into debt to fuel subscriber growth|last=Liedtke|first=Michael|date=October 16, 2017|work=Toronto Star|access-date=October 17, 2017|issn=0319-0781|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016202417/https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/10/16/anticipation-builds-pushing-stock-up-ahead-of-netflixs-earnings-report.html|archive-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref> $6.5&nbsp;billion of this is long-term debt, with the remainder in long-term obligations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-seeks-to-woo-debt-buyers-with-100-billion-stock-cushion|title=As Netflix Trumpets Stock Value, Debt Investors Want Cash Flow|last=Smith|first=Molly|date=January 23, 2018|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123223532/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-seeks-to-woo-debt-buyers-with-100-billion-stock-cushion|archive-date=January 23, 2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> In October 2018, Netflix announced it would raise another $2&nbsp;billion in debt to help fund new content.<ref>

Randolph worked as a marketing director for Hastings's company, [[Pure Software|Pure Atria]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rational-software-announces-agreement-to-acquire-pure-atria-75078807.html|title= Rational Software Announces Agreement to Acquire Pure Atria|first= Pure Atria|last= Corp.|agency= PR Newswire|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170225140214/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rational-software-announces-agreement-to-acquire-pure-atria-75078807.html|archive-date= February 25, 2017|access-date= March 3, 2017}}</ref> Randolph had co-founded MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company; [[Borland International]] later employed him as vice president of marketing. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, sold Pure Atria to [[Rational Software Corporation]] in 1997 for $700&nbsp;million in what was then the biggest acquisition in [[Silicon Valley]] history. The two came up with the idea for Netflix when commuting between their homes in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale while waiting for government regulators to approve the merger,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |title = Netflixed: The Epic Battle for America's Eyeballs |last = Keating |first = Gina |publisher = Portfolio/ Penguin |year = 2012 }}</ref> although Hastings has given several different explanations for how the idea came about.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/23/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-on-how-the-company-was-born.html|title= Reed Hastings' story about the founding of Netflix has changed several times|first= Michelle|last= Castillo|date= May 23, 2017|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171102211235/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/23/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-on-how-the-company-was-born.html|archive-date= November 2, 2017}}</ref>

Hastings invested $2.5&nbsp;million in startup cash for Netflix.<ref>{{cite web|title= Netflix Company History|url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/netflix-inc-history/|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170902133826/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/netflix-inc-history/|archive-date= September 2, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0"/> Randolph admired the fledgling [[e-commerce]] company [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the [[Internet]] using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected [[VHS tapes]] as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States on March 24, 1997,<ref>{{cite news |title= For the DVD, Disney Magic May Be the Key | author= Johnson, Lawrence B. |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= September 7, 1997 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/movies/for-the-dvd-disney-magic-may-be-the-key.html |accessdate= May 25, 2009 }}</ref> they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16&nbsp;billion [[home-video]] sales and rental industry.<ref name=":1" /> Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of [[Apollo 13 (film)|''Apollo 13'']], but he and Randolph designed this apocryphal story to explain the company's business model and motivation.<ref name=":1" />

Netflix launched as the world's first online DVD-rental store, with only 30 employees and 925 titles available—almost the entire catalogue of DVDs at the time<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/netflix-inc-history/|title= History of Netflix, Inc. – Funding Universe|website= funding universe.com}}</ref>—using the pay-per-rent model, with rates and due dates similar to those of its [[brick-and-mortar]] competitor, [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]].<ref>

=== Membership fee, Blockbuster acquisition offer, growth start ===
Netflix introduced the monthly subscription concept in September 1999,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jeffrey M.|last=O'Brien|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/netflix.html|title=The Netflix Effect|magazine=Wired News|date=December 2002|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905045540/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.12/netflix.html|archive-date=September 5, 2013}}</ref> and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time (see [[Technical details of Netflix]]), the company has built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/renting-from-netflix-1854040|title=Things You Should Know About Renting From Netflix|work=Lifewire|access-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710211444/https://www.lifewire.com/renting-from-netflix-1854040|archive-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 2000, when Netflix had just about 300,000 subscribers and relied on the US Postal Service for the delivery of their DVDs, their losses would total $57&nbsp;million and offered to be acquired by [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] for $50&nbsp;million. They proposed that Netflix, which would be renamed as Blockbuster.com, would handle the online business, while Blockbuster would take care of the DVDs, making them less dependent on the US Postal Service. The offer was declined.<ref>[https://www.marketplace.org/2020/09/08/ceo-reed-hastings-on-how-netflix-beat-blockbuster/ CEO Reed Hastings on how Netflix beat Blockbuster]</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Netflix Vs Blockbuster Business War |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbOsI_fYqGU |website=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/outside-the-box-2|title=The Red-Envelope Revolution|first=Ken|last=Auletta|date=January 27, 2014|work=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703384204575509331302481448|title=Blockbuster to Remake Itself Under Creditors|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 24, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807023527/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703384204575509331302481448|archive-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref>

While they experienced fast growth in early 2001, both the [[dot-com bubble]] burst and the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred later that year, affecting the company badly and forcing them to lay off one-third of their 120 employees. However, sales of DVD players finally took off as they became more affordable, selling for about $200 around Thanksgiving time, becoming one of that year's most popular Christmas gifts. By early 2002, Netflix saw a huge increase in their subscription business.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr|title=How Netflix Reinvented HR|date=January 1, 2014|work=Harvard Business Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Eileen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRQEAAAAMBAJ&q=Best+Buy+DVD/CD/CD-R/MP3+$199+Thanksgiving+Oritron&pg=PA79|title=VM Labs Pushes Its Nuon DVD Players; Image Unleashes Its Own Dinos, Apes |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 16, 2001|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Netflix initiated an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5&nbsp;million shares of [[common stock]] at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during the fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5&nbsp;million profit on revenues of US$272&nbsp;million. In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1&nbsp;million DVDs out every day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4149765|title=Movies to go|work=The Economist|date=July 7, 2005|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206232113/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4149765|archive-date=December 6, 2008}}</ref>

For some time, the company had considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a "Netflix box" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archive-date=December 23, 2017|access-date=December 18, 2017}}</ref>

Netflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers. On October 1, 2006, Netflix offered a [[Netflix Prize|$1,000,000 prize]] to the first developer of a video-recommendation [[algorithm]] that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netflixprize.com/|title=Netflix Prize Website|accessdate=December 8, 2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210022309/http://netflixprize.com/|archive-date=December 10, 2006}}</ref>

In February 2007, the company delivered its billionth DVD,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qqc_AAAAIBAJ&pg=2709,435491&dq=netflix+1+billionth+dvd&hl=en|title=The Victoria Advocate – Feb 26, 2007|page=B4}}</ref> and began to move away from its original core business model of DVDs, by introducing [[video on demand]] via the Internet. Netflix grew as DVD sales fell from 2006 to 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/05/04/dvd-sales-plunge-in-u-s-digital-sales-on-the-rise/|title=DVD Sales Plunge in U.S., Digital Sales on the Rise|work=Time|date=May 4, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220140920/http://techland.time.com/2011/05/04/dvd-sales-plunge-in-u-s-digital-sales-on-the-rise/|archive-date=February 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/01/8627/|title=Netflix offers streaming movies to subscribers|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902141413/https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/01/8627/|archive-date=September 2, 2017|date=January 16, 2007}}</ref>

Another contributing factor for the company's online DVD rental success was that they could offer a much larger selection of movie titles to choose from than Blockbuster's rental outlets. But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as Cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix – Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

In January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

=== Early Netflix Original content ===
Netflix has played a prominent role in [[independent film]] distribution. Through its division [[Red Envelope Entertainment]], Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as ''[[Born into Brothels]]'' and ''[[Sherrybaby]]''. As of late 2006, [[Red Envelope Entertainment]] also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as [[John Waters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/12/08/AM200612081.html|title=Netflix expands indie film biz|last=Dornhelm|first=Rachel|accessdate=December 11, 2006|date=December 8, 2006|publisher=[[American Public Media]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210040727/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/12/08/AM200612081.html|archive-date=December 10, 2006}}</ref> Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008, in part to avoid competition with its studio partners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iKwZUPaTeYqpyM5ombXf-AXxTVoAD923Q2G01 |title=Netflix shuts movie financing arm to focus on core |last=Jesdanun |first=Anick |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |date=July 23, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726232337/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iKwZUPaTeYqpyM5ombXf-AXxTVoAD923Q2G01 |archive-date=July 26, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://securethoughts.com/netflix-closing-the-red-envelope/| title=Netflix closing Red Envelope| last=Goldstein| first=Gregg| accessdate=August 11, 2008| date=July 22, 2008| work=Secure Thoughts| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026212257/http://securethoughts.com/netflix-closing-the-red-envelope/| archive-date=October 26, 2014| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Entertainment dominance, presence, and continued growth ===
Netflix has been one of the most successful [[dot-com startup|dot-com ventures]]. In September 2002, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that, at the time, Netflix mailed about 190,000 discs per day to its 670,000 monthly subscribers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/business/new-economy-dvd-s-have-found-an-unexpected-route-to-a-wide-public-snail-mail.html?scp=2&sq=netflix&st=nyt |title=New Economy; DVD's have found an unexpected route to a wide public: snail mail |work=The New York Times |first=Peter |last=Wayner |date=September 23, 2002 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713172300/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/business/new-economy-dvd-s-have-found-an-unexpected-route-to-a-wide-public-snail-mail.html?scp=2&sq=netflix&st=nyt |archive-date=July 13, 2019 | df=mdy-all |accessdate=January 10, 2020}}</ref> The company's published subscriber count increased from one million in the fourth quarter of 2002 to around 5.6&nbsp;million at the end of the third quarter of 2006, to 14&nbsp;million in March 2010. Netflix's early growth was fueled by the fast spread of [[DVD player]]s in households; in 2004, nearly two-thirds of United States homes had a DVD player. Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals as well. The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Ryan|last=Blitstein|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07092/773993-28.stm|title=Vacation policy at Netflix: Take as much as you want|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=March 22, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014134133/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07092/773993-28.stm|archive-date=October 14, 2008}}</ref>

By 2010, Netflix's streaming business had grown so quickly that within months the company had shifted from the fastest-growing customer of the [[United States Postal Service]]'s [[Mail|first-class service]] to the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America in the evening. In November, it began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.<ref name="nyt20101125">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/business/25netflix.html?pagewanted=all | title=Netflix's Move Onto the Web Stirs Rivalries | work=The New York Times | date=November 25, 2010 | accessdate=July 21, 2013 | author1=Arango, Tim | author2=Carr, David | pages=A1 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723064040/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/business/25netflix.html?pagewanted=all | archive-date=July 23, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.<ref name="QwiksterBlogPost">{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Reed |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html |title=The Official Netflix Blog : US & Canada: An Explanation and Some Reflections |publisher=Blog.netflix.com |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614132217/http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html |archive-date=June 14, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Engadget-2011-09-19-Lawler">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/09/19/netflix-spins-dvd-by-mail-service-off-into-qwikster-says-its/ |title=Netflix spins DVD-by-mail service off into Qwikster, says it's 'done' with price changes (video) |work=[[Engadget]] |date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |first=Richard |last=Lawler |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308083616/http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/19/netflix-spins-dvd-by-mail-service-off-into-qwikster-says-its/ |archive-date=March 8, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Engadget-2011-09-19-Murph">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/09/19/editorial-reed-hastings-netflix-spinoff-isnt-about-dvd-succes/ |title=Editorial: Reed Hastings' Netflix spinoff isn't about DVD success, it's about hedging the stream |work=[[Engadget]] |date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |first=Darren |last=Murph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308083906/http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/19/editorial-reed-hastings-netflix-spinoff-isnt-about-dvd-succes/ |archive-date=March 8, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Andy Rendich, a 12-year Netflix veteran, was to be CEO of Qwikster.

Netflix's [[video on demand]] streaming service, formerly branded as ''Watch Now'', allows subscribers to stream television series and films via the Netflix website on personal computers, or the Netflix software on a variety of supported platforms, including [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[digital media player]]s, [[video game console]]s and [[smart TV]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9940529-1.html |title= Netflix Watch Now: Missing too much popular content |author= Falcone, John P. |date= May 9, 2008 |publisher= CNET |accessdate= July 19, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110617044601/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-9940529-1.html |archive-date= June 17, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> According to a [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the [[Wii]], 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a [[PlayStation 3]] and 12% an [[Xbox 360]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/what-netflix-and-hulu-users-are-watching-and-how/|title= What Netflix and Hulu Users are Watching ... and How|work= NielsenWire|date= July 27, 2011|accessdate= July 27, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110729024009/http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/what-netflix-and-hulu-users-are-watching-and-how/|archive-date= July 29, 2011|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

When the streaming service was first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of [[Hulu]] and to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s new video-rental services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/13/financial/f090113S93.DTL |title=Netflix Expands Internet Viewing Option |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=January 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115195018/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F01%2F13%2Ffinancial%2Ff090113S93.DTL |archive-date=January 15, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.<ref>{{cite web|title = Netflix to lift limits on streaming movies|url = http://www.dailynews.com/20080114/netflix-to-lift-limits-on-streaming-movies|publisher = dailynews.com|access-date = January 20, 2016|date = January 14, 2008}}</ref>

Netflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers [[standard definition]] streaming on a single device, the second allows [[high definition television|high definition]] streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the "Platinum" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and [[4K resolution|4K]] streaming on supported devices and Internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost US$7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to $9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high definition access.<ref name="cbc-nflxprices">{{cite news|title=Netflix to phase out $7.99 HD plan for long-term members starting in May|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-price-hike-1.3527171|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=December 1, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202034914/http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-price-hike-1.3527171|archive-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="cbc-newtiers">{{cite news|title=Netflix hikes monthly subscription price by $1 for new customers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-hikes-monthly-subscription-price-by-1-for-new-customers-1.3262962|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=December 1, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202034417/http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-hikes-monthly-subscription-price-by-1-for-new-customers-1.3262962|archive-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="verge-4kprice">{{cite web|title=Netflix hikes subscription price for 4K TV owners|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/12/6965087/netflix-subscription-price-increase-for-4k-streaming|website=The Verge|accessdate=December 1, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201143546/http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/12/6965087/netflix-subscription-price-increase-for-4k-streaming|archive-date=December 1, 2016|date=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

In July 2016, a Netflix subscriber sued the company over the price increases, alleging he was told by a Netflix customer support representative in 2011 that they would pay the same price in perpetuity as long as they maintained their subscription continuously.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-user-lawsuit-class-action-rate-hike-1201807561/|title=Netflix User Sues Over Rate Hike, Claiming Breach of Contract|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=July 1, 2016|work=Variety|access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref>

On November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an Internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/30/netflix-is-finally-letting-you-download-videos-for-offline-viewing/|title=Netflix is finally letting you download videos for offline viewing|last=Fung|first=Brain|website=The Washington Post|access-date=November 30, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201015959/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/30/netflix-is-finally-letting-you-download-videos-for-offline-viewing/|archive-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-netflix-download-offline-binge-watching-blm-bsi-20161130-story.html|title=Netflix unveils download feature for offline binge-watching|last=Shaw|first=Lucas|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 30, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201013555/http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-netflix-download-offline-binge-watching-blm-bsi-20161130-story.html|archive-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name="verge-offlinenetflix">{{cite web|title=Netflix finally lets you download shows and movies to watch offline|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13792376/netflix-offline-downloads-now-available|website=The Verge|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128195409/http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13792376/netflix-offline-downloads-now-available|archive-date=January 28, 2017|date=November 30, 2016}}</ref> Netflix will partner with airlines to provide them with its mobile streaming technology.

In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1&nbsp;billion to stream films from [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Lionsgate]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

=== Disc rental ===
In the United States, the company provides a monthly [[Flat rate|flat-fee]] for DVD and [[Blu-ray]] rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the [[United States Postal Service]] from regional [[warehouse]]s. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States.<ref>{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Lilly | title = GameFly Complains USPS Favors Netflix | date = March 28, 2011 | url = http://www.maximumpc.com/article/gamefly_complains_usps_favors_netflix | work = Maximum PC | accessdate = April 2, 2011 | quote = Netflix has 58 shipping locations | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110920150713/http://www.maximumpc.com/article/gamefly_complains_usps_favors_netflix | archive-date = September 20, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent a new disc, the subscriber must return the previous disc in a [[metered reply mail]] envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.

Netflix offers pricing tiers for DVD rental. On November 21, 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on [[Blu-ray]] for an additional fee. Also, Netflix sold used discs, delivered, and billed identically as rentals.

Currently, Netflix's disc rental memberships range from $7.99 to $19.99/m, including a free one-month trial and unlimited DVD exchanges.

On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently." It was also announced that the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Also, the two websites would require separate subscriptions.<ref name="fastco-splitqwik">{{cite web|title=Netflix Splits DVD-Streaming Business, Rebrands With Qwikster, Adds Video Games|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1781145/netflix-splits-dvd-streaming-business-rebrands-qwikster-adds-video-games|website=Fast Company|accessdate=October 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009194746/https://www.fastcompany.com/1781145/netflix-splits-dvd-streaming-business-rebrands-qwikster-adds-video-games|archive-date=October 9, 2016|date=September 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name="tc-qwikster">{{cite web|title=Remember When Netflix Wanted To Rent DVDs on a Different Website?

Netflix stated that it had lost 800,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2011—a loss partially credited to the poor reception of the aborted re-branding.<ref name="nyt-deathsprial">{{cite news|title=reportedLooks Back on Its Near-Death Spiral|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/business/netflix-looks-back-on-its-near-death-spiral.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009181540/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/business/netflix-looks-back-on-its-near-death-spiral.html?hp|archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name="cnnmoney-abandoned">{{cite web|title=Netflix abandons plan for Qwikster DVD service|url=https://money.cnn.com/2011/10/10/technology/netflix_qwikster/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009161939/http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/10/technology/netflix_qwikster/|archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name="nyt-lostgoodwill">{{cite news|title=How Netflix Lost 800,000 Members, and Good Will|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/technology/netflix-lost-800000-members-with-price-rise-and-split-plan.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009181324/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/technology/netflix-lost-800000-members-with-price-rise-and-split-plan.html|archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref>

==== Reintroduction ====
Netflix reinvigorated the "Profiles" feature on August 1, 2013, that permits accounts to accommodate up to five user profiles, associated either with individuals or thematic occasions. "Profiles" effectively divides the interest of each user, so that each will receive individualized suggestions and adding favorites individually. "This is important", according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's Vice President of Product Innovation, because, "About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for".<ref name="author=Stenovec">{{cite news|work=HuffPost|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/netflix-profiles_n_3685876.html|date=August 1, 2013|author=Stenovec, Timothy|title=Netflix Launches Profiles, Finally Realizing How People Really Watch Movies On It|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319051341/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/netflix-profiles_n_3685876.html|archive-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> Moreover, Mike McGuire, a VP at [[Gartner]], said: "profiles will give Netflix even more detailed information about its subscribers and their viewing habits, allowing the company to make better decisions about what movies and TV shows to offer".<ref name="author=Stenovec"/> Additionally, profiles lets users link their individual Facebook accounts, and thus share individual watch queues and recommendations,<ref name="author=Stenovec"/><ref name="Pepitone, Julianne">{{cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Netflix launches user profiles for individual recommendations|author=Pepitone, Julianne|date=August 1, 2013|url=https://money.cnn.com/2013/08/01/technology/innovation/netflix-profiles/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114741/http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/01/technology/innovation/netflix-profiles/index.html|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> since its addition in March after lobbying Congress to change an outdated act.<ref name="Pepitone, Julianne" /> Neil Hunt, Netflix's former Chief Product Officer, told [[CNNMoney]]: "profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space", and, "The company said [[Focus group|focus-group]] testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement".<ref name="Pepitone, Julianne"/>

In June 2018, Netflix announced a partnership with [[Telltale Games]] to port its [[adventure game]]s to the service in a streaming video format. The games would be adapted to be similar to the existing interactive narrative stories that Netflix already offers, allowing simple controls through a television remote. The first such game, ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', was expected to be released later in the year, and Telltale also received rights to produce a video game adaptation of ''[[Stranger Things]]'' for conventional gaming platforms.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.techradar.com/news/netflix-to-add-games-to-its-service-including-stranger-things-and-minecraft | title = Exclusive: Netflix to add games to its service, including Minecraft: Story Mode | first = Nick | last = Pino | date = June 13, 2018 | accessdate = June 13, 2018 | work = [[TechRadar]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-partners-with-telltale-games-for-interactive-adventures/ | title = No, Netflix isn't going to stream Minecraft video games | first1 = Joan | last1 = Solsman | first2 = Lori | last2 = Grunin | date = June 13, 2018 | accessdate = June 13, 2018 | publisher = [[CNET]] }}</ref> In September 2018, Telltale underwent a "majority studio closure" and laid off nearly its entire staff beyond a skeleton crew of 25 employees, citing a loss of funding.

Netflix can be accessed via an [[internet browser]] on PCs, while Netflix apps are available on various platforms, including [[Blu-ray Disc]] players, [[tablet computer]]s, mobile phones, [[smart TV]]s, [[digital media player]]s, and [[video game console]]s (including [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]], [[Xbox 360]], and the [[PlayStation 3]]). The [[Wii]] and the [[PlayStation 2]] were formerly compatible with Netflix as well.

In addition, a growing number of [[multichannel television]] providers, including cable television and [[IPTV]] services, have also added Netflix apps accessible within their own [[set-top box]]es, sometimes with the ability for its content (along with those of other online video services) to be presented within a unified search interface alongside linear television programming as an "all-in-one" solution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/netflix-cable-box/|title=Netflix Is Coming Soon to Your TV Through Your Cable Box|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=October 17, 2013|work=Wired|access-date=April 28, 2019|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/04/netflix-cable/|title=Netflix Is Getting Its Own Cable Channel|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|date=April 25, 2014|work=Wired|access-date=April 28, 2019|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/7/16747918/verizon-fios-netflix-set-top-cable-box-integration-test|title=Verizon Fios quietly adds Netflix integration to three set-top box models|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=December 7, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-27/how-cable-companies-learned-to-love-netflix-or-hulu-and-chill|title=How Cable Companies Learned to Love Netflix (or Hulu) and Chill Out|website=Bloomberg|access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref>

During Q1 2011, sales and rentals of DVDs and Blu-rays plunged about 35%, and the sell-through of packaged discs fell 19.99% to $2.07&nbsp;billion, with more money spent on subscription than in-store rentals.

Netflix's success was followed by the establishment of numerous other DVD rental companies, both in the United States and abroad. [[Walmart]] began an online rental service in October 2002 but left the market in May 2005. However, Walmart later acquired the rental service [[Vudu]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walmart buys VUDU|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/23/walmart-buys-vudu/|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=September 23, 2013|first=Scott|last=Merrill|date=February 23, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827075719/http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/23/walmart-buys-vudu/|archive-date=August 27, 2013}}</ref>

Blockbuster Video entered the United States online market in August 2004, with a US$19.95 monthly subscription service ({{Inflation|US|19.95|2004|r=2|fmt=eq}}). This sparked a [[price war]]; Netflix had raised its popular three-disc plan from US$19.95 to US$21.99 just prior to Blockbuster's launch, but by October, Netflix reduced this fee to US$17.99. Blockbuster responded with rates as low as US$14.99 for a time, but, by August 2005, both companies settled at identical rates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-10-17-netflix-dvd-war_x.htm|title=Netflix, Blockbuster in All-Out DVD Rental Price War|first=David|last=Lieberman|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 17, 2004|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}</ref> On July 22, 2007, Netflix dropped the prices of its two most popular plans by US$1.00 in an effort to better compete with Blockbuster's online-only offerings.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2015/09/24/netflix-sketched-out-its-plans-to-be-a-streaming-company-15-years-ago/ |title=Netflix Sketched Out Its Plans To Be A Streaming Company 15 Years Ago |author=Jackson, Eric |date=September 24, 2015 |work=Forbes |accessdate=September 16, 2018}}</ref> On October 4, 2012, [[Dish Network]] scrapped plans to make Blockbuster into a competitor for Netflix's online service.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410655,00.asp|title=Blockbuster Abandons Plans for Netflix-Like Streaming Service|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=October 6, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009001015/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410655,00.asp|archive-date=October 9, 2012}}</ref> (Dish bought the ailing Blockbuster, LLC in 2011, and at that point planned to maintain franchise locations as well as its "Blockbuster on Demand" streaming service.

''Icarus'' had its premiere at the 2017 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was bought by Netflix for $5&nbsp;million, one of the biggest deals ever for a non-fiction film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/sundance-icarus-russian-doping-1201968509/|title=Sundance: Netflix Lands Russian Doping Documentary 'Icarus' (EXCLUSIVE)|last2=Setoodeh|first1=Brent|last1=Lang|first2=Ramin|date=January 24, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=March 8, 2018}}</ref>

Netflix became the most nominated network at the 2018 [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime]] and [[70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] with 112 nominations, therefore breaking [[HBO]]'s 17-years record as most nominated network at the Emmys, which received 108 nominations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/07/emmy-nominations-2018-netflix-hbo/565046/|title=Emmys Nominations 2018: Netflix Takes Over|last=Gilbert|first=Sophie|date=July 12, 2018|work=The Atlantic|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/12/netflix-vs-hbo-emmy/|title=How Netflix beat HBO in Emmy nominations for first time ever|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

=== Film distribution model ===
Netflix's distribution model for original films has led to conflicts with the legacy film industry. Some cinemas have refused to screen films distributed theatrically by Netflix (primarily to ensure awards eligibility), as it defies the standard three-month [[release window]], and releases them simultaneously on its streaming platform (although ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' was instead given a three-week run before being added to the streaming service). [[Steven Spielberg]], governor of the directors branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), has been critical of the streaming model over the "communal", cinema experience, but later clarified his views by arguing that viewers should have access to "great stories", and be able to "find their entertainment in any form or fashion that suits them".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/business/media/steven-spielberg-netflix-academy-awards.html|title=Blockbuster Battle Between Steven Spielberg and Netflix Fizzles|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=April 23, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 24, 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/steven-spielberg-netflix-oscars-theaters|title=Spielberg Would Like to Be Excluded from This Netflix-Hating Narrative|last=Bradley|first=Laura|website=HWD|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/netflix-steven-spielberg-oscars-1203154092/|title=Netflix Responds to Steven Spielberg's Push to Bar It From Oscars|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|date=March 4, 2019|website=Variety|access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/steven-spielberg-vs-netflix-oscar-academy-wars-1202047846/|title=The Spielberg vs. Netflix Battle Could Mean Collateral Damage for Indies at the Oscars|last1=Thompson|first1=Anne|date=March 1, 2019|website=IndieWire|access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref> In April 2019, AMPAS voted against the possibility of changes to the [[Academy Awards]] eligibility criteria to account for streaming services such as Netflix, although AMPAS president [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]] did state that the organization would "further study the profound changes occurring in our industry".<ref name="screendaily-eligibility">{{Cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/academy-leaves-netflix-eligibility-rule-intact-changes-name-of-foreign-language-category/5138723.article|title=Academy leaves Netflix eligibility rule intact, changes name of foreign language category|last=Kay|first=Jeremy|website=Screen|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref>

In 2018, Netflix pulled out of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], in response to new rules requiring competition films to have been released in French theaters. The Cannes premiere of ''[[Okja]]'' in 2017 was controversial, and led to discussions over the appropriateness of films with simultaneous digital releases being screened at an event showcasing theatrical film; audience members also booed at the Netflix [[vanity plate]] at the screening. Netflix's attempts to negotiate to allow a limited release in France were curtailed by organizers, as well as French [[cultural exception]] law—where theatrically screened films are legally forbidden from being made available via video-on-demand services until at least 36 months after their release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17225898/netflix-cannes-film-festival-competition-ban-streaming-services|title=Netflix pulls out of Cannes Film Festival following competition ban|last=Statt|first=Nick|date=April 11, 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15662542/netflix-cannes-film-festival-booed-okja-premiere|title=Netflix booed at Okja's Cannes premiere|last=Tiffany|first=Kaitlyn|date=May 19, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15608978/netflix-cannes-film-festival-new-rule-theater-release-france|title=Netflix's first two films at Cannes could be its last|last=Tiffany|first=Kaitlyn|date=May 10, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref>

Beginning at the 2019 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], films may now be restricted from screening at [[Scotiabank Theatre Toronto]]—one of the festival's main venues—and screened elsewhere (such as [[TIFF Bell Lightbox]] and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix. Organizers stated that the restriction was due to a policy enforced by the facility's owner and operator, [[Cineplex Entertainment]], requiring adherence to 3-month theatrical windows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/tiff-confirms-scotiabank-theatres-new-rules-on-netflix-and-amazon-titles/5142695.article|title=TIFF confirms Scotiabank Theatre's new rules on Netflix and Amazon titles|date=September 8, 2019|website=ScreenDaily|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>

=== Tax avoidance ===
According to a blog post by the [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]], Netflix reported its largest ever profit in the US for 2018, but paid nothing in federal or state tax.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://itep.org/netflix-posted-biggest-ever-profit-in-2018-and-paid-0-in-income-taxes/ | title = Netflix Posted Biggest-Ever Profit in 2018 and Paid $0 in Taxes | first = Matthew | last = Gardner | date = February 5, 2019 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy]] }}</ref> The explanation is that US Tax law allows companies to claim [[tax credit]] on foreign earnings and thus avoid double taxation.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/10/netflix-income-tax-2018-didnt-pay | title = How did Netflix get away with not paying income tax in 2018?  | first = Gene | last = Marks | date = February 10, 2019 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> US Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] has criticized Netflix for this both on Twitter<ref>{{cite tweet |user = BernieSanders |first = Bernie | last = Sanders |number = 1196911527204282368 |date= November 19, 2019 |title = Bernie Sanders on Twitter: "Your $8.99 Netflix subscription is more than the company paid in federal income taxes last year (nothing)."}}</ref> and at a Fox News town hall event on April 15, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-amazon-netflix-its-a-disgrace-companies-do-not-pay-taxes/ | title = Bernie Sanders: It's a "disgrace" that Amazon, Netflix "pay nothing" in taxes  | first = Aimee | last = Picchi | date = April 16, 2019 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[CBS News]] }}</ref> A spokesperson from Netflix has addressed such claims as "inaccurate", but no evidence has been provided that Netflix did pay any state or federal taxes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-calls-out-netflix-paying-less-income-tax-2018-cost-one-899-subscription-1472826 | title = Bernie Sanders Calls Out Netflix for Paying Less Income Tax in 2018 Than The Cost of One $8.99 Subscription  | first = Aila | last = Slisco | date = November 19, 2019 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[Newsweek]] }}</ref>

Allegations of tax evasion are also being investigated by Italian prosecutors. While Netflix doesn't have a headquarters in Italy, the prosecution claims that the digital infrastructure such as servers and cables amounts to a physical presence in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-probe-italy/italy-prosecutors-open-netflix-tax-evasion-investigation-source-idUSKBN1WI0NE | title = Italy prosecutors open Netflix tax evasion investigation: source | first = Emilio | last = Parodi | date = October 3, 2019 | accessdate = February 10, 2020 | work = [[Reuters]] }}</ref>

=== Viewership figure claims ===
Netflix has been called out by some media organizations and competitors for only rarely and selectively releasing its ratings and viewer numbers. A notable instance of this involves the film ''[[Bird Box (film)|Bird Box]]''. A week after its release, Netflix claimed that it had the biggest seven-day viewing record of any of its original films at over 45&nbsp;million viewers, but did not provide data to validate it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412309/netflix-transparency-data-viewers-ratings-subscribers-bird-box-numbers|title=Netflix execs say they'll finally start releasing viewership data soon|work=The Verge|date=April 17, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> It also was not possible to accurately compare its week-long success to a major cultural event such as the [[Super Bowl]] or [[Academy Awards]] or to a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/netflix-raises-movie-viewership-curtain-with-bird-box/|title=Netflix's 'Bird Box' success gets Hollywood clucking|work=The Seattle Times|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, Netflix claimed that 30,869,863 accounts watched the [[Adam Sandler]]- and [[Jennifer Aniston]]-starring Netflix original film ''[[Murder Mystery (film)|Murder Mystery]]'', despite it being critically panned, making it the biggest "opening weekend" for a Netflix original film. If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>

In the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Before this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix started the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as the length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>

=== Promotion of pseudoscience ===

Netflix has long been criticized for offering content that presents wellness [[pseudoscience]] and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] as true.<ref name="Reynolds">{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Matt |title=Think Goop is bad?

== Impact ==
The rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archive-date=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archive-date=June 6, 2014}}</ref>

Netflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': "Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost-effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archive-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.

The Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archive-date=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.
