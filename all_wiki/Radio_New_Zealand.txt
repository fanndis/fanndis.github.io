'''Radio New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|Te Reo Irirangi o Aotearoa}}), commonly known as '''Radio NZ''' or simply '''RNZ''', is a New Zealand [[public broadcasting|public-service]] [[radio]] [[broadcasting|broadcaster]] and [[Crown entity]] that was established under the Radio New Zealand Act 1995. It operates a news and [[Current affairs (news format)|current-affairs]] network, [[RNZ National]], and a [[classical music|classical-music]] and [[jazz]] network, [[RNZ Concert]], with full government funding from [[NZ on Air]]. Since 2014, the organisation's focus has been to transform RNZ from a radio broadcaster to a [[multimedia]] outlet, increasing its production of digital [[Content (media)|content]] in audio, video, and written forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stoppress.co.nz/blog/2014/06/radio-decline-story |title=Radio New Zealand's Paul Thompson on the decline of radio |website=StopPress.co.nz |date=June 2014}}</ref>

The organisation plays a central role in [[public broadcasting in New Zealand|New Zealand public broadcasting]]. The [[New Zealand Parliament]] fully funds its [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] network, used in part for the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings. RNZ has a statutory role under the [[Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002]] to act as a "lifeline [[Public utility|utility]]" in emergency situations.<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045304&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={6CCA2196}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC ''Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 (2002 No 30)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717080212/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045304&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7B6CCA2196%7D&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC |date=17 July 2012 }}</ref> It is also responsible for an international service (known as [[RNZ International|RNZ Pacific]]); this is broadcast to the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] in both English and [[Austronesian languages|Pacific languages]] through its Pacific [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] service.<ref>[http://cbc.am/Letter_PM_AU-NZ_RA-RNZI.ppt Mediumwave Broadcasting Proposal PPT] and [http://cbc.am/Letter_PM_AU-NZ_RA-RNZI.pdf PDF]</ref>

==History==

===Early years===

Government-funded public service radio in New Zealand was historically provided by the Radio Broadcasting Company between 1925 and 1931, the New Zealand Broadcasting Board between 1931 and 1936, the National Broadcasting Service between 1936 and 1962, the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] between 1962 and 1975, and the Radio New Zealand [[state-owned enterprise]] between 1975 and 1995.<ref>Day, Patrick. Voice and Vision: A History of Broadcasting in New Zealand. Vol. 2. Auckland University Press, 2000.</ref> The organisation placed a strong emphasis on training its staff in [[Received Pronunciation]], until it began promoting local and indigenous accents in the 1990s.<ref>Bell, Allan. [http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/content/III/3/246.extract "This Isn't the BBC: Colonialism in New Zealand English."] Applied Linguistics 3.3 (1982): 246-258.</ref><ref>Bell, Allan,  [http://lanchart.hum.ku.dk/research/slice/publications_and_news_letters/publications/standard_languages/Bell_-_Leaving_Home_De-europeanisation_in_a_post-colonial_variety_of_broadcast_news_language_-_p_177-198.pdf "Leaving Home: De-europeanisation in a post-colonial variety of broadcast news language."], Standard Languages and Language Standards in a Changing Europe. Oslo, Norway: Novus (2011): 177-198.</ref>

As part of the process of [[privatisation]] carried out by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]], the government's commercial radio operations were sold to private investors as [[The Radio Network]] in 1996 and the government's non-commercial assets (known previously as New Zealand Public Radio) became the current Radio New Zealand Crown entity.<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045251&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={BCB0978D}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC ''Radio New Zealand Act (No 2) 1995 (1995 No 53)'']</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045251&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={CBB7A71B}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC |title=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=2457045251&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record={BCB0978D}&hitsperheading=on&softpage=DOC |title=New Zealand Legislation |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}</ref>

===Later years===

The broadcaster is bound by the Charter and Operating Principles included in the Radio New Zealand Act, which is reviewed by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] every five years. The Radio New Zealand Amendment Act received Royal assent on 1 April 2016.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Purpose:

# As an independent public service broadcaster, the public radio company's purpose is to serve the public interest.
# Freedom of thought and expression are foundations of democratic society and the public radio company as a public service broadcaster plays an essential role in exercising these freedoms.
# The public radio company fosters a sense of national identity by contributing to tolerance and understanding, reflecting and promoting ethnic, cultural, and artistic diversity and expression.
# The public radio company provides reliable, independent, and freely accessible news and information.

RNZ broadcasts over three nationwide networks; RNZ National, RNZ Concert and the AM network which relays Parliamentary proceedings. RNZ Pacific (formerly Radio New Zealand International or RNZI) is our overseas shortwave service, broadcasting to the South Pacific and beyond, while Radio New Zealand News provides comprehensive, up-to-the-minute news and current affairs information. RNZ also allows for the archiving of broadcast material of historical interest.

It must also produce and commission high quality programming based on research of public needs, and balance mass appeal and minority appeal programming. In achieving these objectives, it must be socially and financially responsible.<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0052/latest/DLM368575.html?search=ta_act_R_ac%40ainf%40anif_an%40bn%40rn_25_a&p=1# ''Radio New Zealand Act 1995 (1995 No 52)'']</ref>

===The Wireless===
[[Image:The Wireless logo.png|thumb|right|This was The Wireless logo when it was launched in 2013.]]
In October 2013, Radio New Zealand launched the youth-focused and non-commercial website 'The Wireless'. The website emerged from the push for a youth radio station as part of Radio New Zealand's offerings. Instead of creating a youth radio station, RNZ decided to create a website or online magazine that focused on 18- to 30-year-olds which would be more relevant to the demographic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/commentary/the-internaut/the-wireless-youth-site-a-brave-step-into-the-net-for-radio-nz/|title=The Wireless: youth site a brave step into the net for Radio NZ|author=Manhire, Toby|date=31 October 2013|work=New Zealand Listener|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>

Project manager Marcus Stickley noted that: "RNZ has had the wisdom to recognize that it didn't necessarily need to be under the RNZ brand. It needed to develop something specifically for that audience, and they've given us the freedom to go away and figure out exactly how to do that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/blogs/strange-news/135801-switching-on-the-wireless|title=Switching on The Wireless|date=31 October 2013|work=The Big Idea|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> The CEO of RNZ commented in April 2014 that The Wireless is "the most exciting innovation from RNZ in recent years."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://salient.org.nz/news/broader-casting|title=Broader casting|author=Hurley, Emma|date=13 April 2014|work=Salient|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewireless.co.nz|title=Home - The Wireless|publisher=thewireless.co.nz|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/digital/showcase/the-wireless/ Showcase of The Wireless] on the [[NZ On Air]] website</ref><ref>[http://publicaddress.net/speaker/about-radio-nzs-new-millennial-venture-the/ "About Radio NZ's new "millennial" venture, The Wireless"], guest post on Public Address</ref>

The Wireless ceased operating as an independent publication in 2018, and was folded back into RNZ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/media/15-12-2018/rnz-in-2018-will-well-meaning-government-interference-end-its-dream-run/|title=RNZ in 2018: will well-meaning government interference end its dream run?|last=Greive|first=Duncan|date=2018-12-15|website=The Spinoff|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

==Websites==
The RNZ website, rnz.co.nz (formerly radionz.co.nz) was launched in October 2005 and includes news coverage, programme information, online station streaming and podcasting. [[Radio New Zealand National|RNZ National]], [[Radio New Zealand Concert|RNZ Concert]], [[AM Network]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] coverage, and [[Radio New Zealand International|RNZ International]] are available as [[Windows Media Audio]] streams.

==Controversy==

In February 2020, it was announced by Music Content Director Willy Macalister and Chief Executive [[Paul Thompson (media executive)|Paul Thompson]] that RNZ Concert was to undergo major changes: it would be moved from the FM to the AM frequency, streamed online and the current service replaced by an automated non-stop play format. Seventeen jobs would be lost from RNZ Music, including all the Concert programme presenters. It would be replaced on FM radio with music for a younger audience as part of a new multimedia music brand.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/mediawatch/audio/2018732872/rnz-set-to-cut-back-concert-and-launch-new-youth-service |title=RNZ set to cut back Concert and launch new youth service |last=Donnell |first=Hayden |date=2020-02-05 |website=RNZ |access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>

The move was widely condemned across the New Zealand, with many people seeing it as a gutting of the arts in New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/119320084/rnz-proposal-to-dial-down-concert-a-slap-in-the-face|title=Dame Kiri te Kanawa calls RNZ proposal to dial down Concert an 'inestimable blow to the arts'|last=|first=|date=6 February 2020|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> Former Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] issued a statement on Twitter saying that it "equates to a dumbing down of cultural life in NZ".<ref>https://twitter.com/HelenClarkNZ</ref> Thousands of protesters issued a petition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/119341444/axing-of-concert-fm-disenfranchising-for-older-rnz-listeners|title=Axing of Concert FM 'disenfranchising' for older RNZ listeners|last=|first=|date=7 February 2020|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> The RNZ board reversed its decision when the government announced it would grant RNZ a third FM channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=12307680|title=RNZ board backs down, Concert to stay on FM|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>

==Former commercial stations==
Prior to 1996 Radio New Zealand operated a large number of commercial stations around New Zealand. These stations were typically local stations with their own local identity with the origin of many stations going back to the 1930s up until more recent stations created in the 1990s. In 1996 the [[New Zealand Government]] sold off all of their commercial stations to a syndicate that included United States radio company [[Clear Channel Communications]] and publisher [[The New Zealand Herald|Wilson & Horton]], in New Zealand the new owner became known as [[The Radio Network]].

The following stations were previously owned by Radio New Zealand, some listed stations were closed down before the 1996 sale and [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore]] radio station [[Hokonui Gold|Radio Hokonui]] was sold privately in 1994.

===Heritage Classic Hits and Newstalk ZB stations===
All of the early local radio stations started by Radio New Zealand originally broadcast on an AM frequency. FM broadcasting did not begin in New Zealand until the 1980s. In the 1980s and early 1990s most stations listed below switched to an FM frequency but continued to broadcast on the original AM frequency. Some stations utilised the AM frequency for specialised shows such as local talkback, sports talk and local news shows. In 1993 the majority of these stations were split in two with the AM frequency used to broadcast Auckland based [[Newstalk ZB]] which was originally Auckland's 1ZB. The local station on the FM frequency adopted a common format and brand called [[Classic Hits FM|Classic Hits]] with all stations retaining local programming under Radio New Zealand's operation.

===Community stations===
Radio New Zealand community stations operated in the heartland areas of New Zealand, typically these stations ran limited local programming such as a local breakfast show and at other times relayed a nearby station or relayed [[Radio New Zealand National|National Radio]]. Following the sale to The Radio Network most of these stations became part of the [[Community Radio Network (New Zealand)|Community Radio Network]] with programming outside the breakfast show originating from [[Taupo, New Zealand|Taupo]]. These stations later became part of the [[Classic Hits FM|Classic Hits]] network in 2001.

The Auckland station [[1ZM (New Zealand)|1ZM]] changed format in 1987 to Classic Hits leaving just the Wellington and Christchurch stations. Since the sale to The Radio Network ZM has been expanded to a nationwide network based in Auckland.

* [[ZM Whangarei|93ZM Whangarei]]
* [[ZM Wellington|91ZM Wellington]]
* [[ZM Christchurch|91ZM Christchurch]]

===Sports Roundup===
Sports Roundup was a network which conducted seasonal sports broadcasts in the main centres during the 1980s and 1990s, particularly used to broadcast [[Cricket]] matches in New Zealand. Following the sale to The Radio Network, Sports Roundup became known as [[Radio Sport]].

===Other stations===
* [[89FM (Auckland)|89X]] [[Auckland]] (purchased by Radio New Zealand in 1992, closed down 1993)
* [[Rock 99]] [[Rotorua, New Zealand|Rotorua]] (closed down 1996)
