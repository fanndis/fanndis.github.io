{{History of Tunisia}}
The '''Tunisian Revolution''', also called the '''Jasmine Revolution''', was an intensive 28-day campaign of [[civil resistance]]. It included a series of street [[demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]] which took place in [[Tunisia]], and led to the ousting of longtime president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] in January 2011. It eventually led to a thorough [[democratisation]] of the country and to free and democratic elections.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ryan, Yasmine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/2011126121815985483.html |title=How Tunisia's revolution began – Features |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref>

In Tunisia and the wider Arab world, the protests and change in government are called '''the Revolution''' or sometimes the '''Sidi Bouzid Revolt''', the name being derived from [[Sidi Bouzid]], the city where the initial protests began.<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--><ref name="SidiBouzid_libcom">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/forums/news/protests-spread-tunisia-29122010 |title=The Sidi Bouzid Revolution: Ben Ali flees as protests spread in Tunisia |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref><ref name="SidiBouzid_YT">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8thJM2nmd_g |title=Revolte Tunisie Sidi bouzid 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> In the Western media, these events have been dubbed the '''Jasmine Revolution''' or '''Jasmine Spring''',<ref>{{cite web|last=Carvin|first=Andy|title=Sidi Bou Zid: A Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia|url=http://storify.com/acarvin/sidi-bou-zid-a-jasmine-revolution-in-tunisia|publisher=Storify|accessdate=7 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211214152/http://storify.com/acarvin/sidi-bou-zid-a-jasmine-revolution-in-tunisia|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> after Tunisia's national flower and in keeping with the geopolitical nomenclature of "[[color revolutions]]".

Some analysts have named this revolt as the '''Wikileaks revolution ''' and the '''Facebook revolution ''' because social media was a main source during the demonstrations and Wikileaks exposed some cracks in the government which has made Tunisians rise against the government. 

==Background==
President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] had ruled Tunisia since 1987, mostly as a one-party state with the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]] (RCD). His government was characterised by the development of Tunisia's private sector in favor of foreign investment, and the repression of political opposition. Foreign media and {{abbr|NGOs|non-government organisations}} criticised his government, which was supported by the United States and France. As a result, the initial reactions to Ben Ali's abuses by the U.S. and France were muted, and most instances of socio-political protest in the country, when they occurred at all, rarely made major news headlines.<ref name="end of an era"/>

Riots in Tunisia were rare<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/10/world/main7233191.shtml |title=Deadly Riots in Tunisia Shut Down Schools |publisher=CBS News |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> and noteworthy, especially since the country is generally considered to be wealthy and stable as compared to other countries in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011191414183128.html |title=Protesters killed in Tunisia riots |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> Protests had been repressed and kept silent by the regime, and protesters would be jailed for such actions, as with hundreds of unemployed demonstrators in [[Redeyef]] in 2008.<ref name="precursor">{{cite web|first1=Jean-Marie|last1=Lemaire|first2=Rim|last2=Mathlouti|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110215-reporters-tunisia-redeyef-gafsa-mining-phosphate-accusations-competition-rigged-ben-ali-supporters-protests-journalists |title=Redeyef, the precursor of the Tunisian revolution |publisher=France 24 |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2011}}</ref> As noted by Mohamed Bacha in his book ''The Revolutionary Chants of Club Africain Ultras'',<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Mohamed-Bacha/e/B00GOLSGM8 Mohamed Bacha]</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1986227979 The Revolutionary Chants of Club Africain Ultras]</ref> Tunisian youth had found an outlet to express their anger and dissatisfaction, through the fan chants of sports association Club Africain Ultras, such as: ''The capital is very angry'', ''We are solidary when we make war to the sons of --- Who oppress us'', and ''Hey Regime, The Revolution is Imminent''.

At the time of the revolution, [[Al Jazeera English]] reported that Tunisian activists are among the most outspoken in its part of the world, with various messages of support being posted on Twitter and Facebook for Bouazizi.<ref name="begin">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122063745828931.html |title=Riots reported in Tunisian city – Africa – Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref> An [[op-ed]] article in the same network said of the action that it was "suicidal protests of despair by Tunisia's youth."

==Mohamed Bouazizi and Sidi Bouzid==
Twenty-six-year-old [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] had been the sole income earner in his extended family of eight. He operated a vegetable or apple cart (the contents of the cart are disputed) for seven years in [[Sidi Bouzid]], 300&nbsp;kilometres (190&nbsp;miles) south of Tunis. On 17&nbsp;December 2010, a female officer confiscated his cart and produce. Bouazizi, who had had such an event happen to him before, tried to pay the 10-dinars fine (a day's wages, equivalent to US$3). It was initially reported that in response the policewoman insulted his deceased father and slapped him. This was a false story, which "had been disseminated and used to mobilise as much as possible against the Ben Ali regime."{{whose quote|date=May 2019}}<ref name="roape.net">{{cite web|url=http://roape.net/2018/04/12/food-sovereignty-and-the-environment-an-interview-with-habib-ayeb|title=Food Sovereignty and the Environment: an interview with Habib Ayeb|year=2018|publisher=Review of African Political Economy|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref> The officer, [[Faida Hamdy|Faida Hamdi]], stated that she was not even a policewoman, but a city employee who had been tasked that morning with confiscating produce from vendors without licenses. When she tried to do so with Bouazizi, a scuffle ensued. Hamdi says she called the police who then beat Bouazizi.<ref name=WAJMJ>{{cite journal|title=The Woman Who Blew Up the Arab World|journal=World Affairs Journal|date=17 May 2012|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/woman-who-blew-arab-world|accessdate=17 May 2012|author=Totten, Michael J. |quote="Barack Obama mentioned me in a speech. He said I was a cop. He said I slapped Mohamed Bouazizi. He's a stupid fool for not checking. Americans are great people, but you need to do a better job of checking your information."}}</ref>

A humiliated Bouazizi then went to the provincial headquarters in an attempt to complain to local municipality officials and to have his produce returned. He was refused an audience. Without alerting his family, at 11:30&nbsp;am and within an hour of the initial confrontation, Bouazizi returned to the headquarters, doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself on fire. Public outrage quickly grew over the incident, leading to protests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043557,00.html | title=Bouazizi: The Man Who Set Himself and Tunisia on Fire | author=Abouzeid, Rania | date=21 January 2011|work=Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/922279--suicide-protest-helped-topple-tunisian-regime | title=Suicide protest helped topple Tunisian regime | location=Toronto | work=The Star | date=14 January 2011}}</ref> This immolation, and the subsequent heavy-handed response by the police to peaceful marchers, provoked riots the next day in [[Sidi Bouzid]]. The riots went largely unnoticed, though [[social media]] sites disseminated images of police dispersing youths who attacked shop windows and damaged cars. Bouazizi was subsequently transferred to a hospital near Tunis. In an attempt to quell the unrest, President Ben Ali visited Bouazizi in hospital on 28&nbsp;December. Bouazizi died on 4&nbsp;January 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70408420110105 | title=Tunisian who sparked rare protests dies: relatives -Reuters | agency=Reuters | date=5 January 2011 | accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

Sociologist [[Asef Bayat]], who visited Tunisia after the uprising and carried out field research, wrote about the mechanisation of large-scale capitalist farms in towns like Sidi Bouzid that have come "at the cost of smallholders' debt, dispossession, and proletarianization."<ref name="Bayat">{{Cite book|title=Revolution without Revolutionaries: Making Sense of the Arab Spring|last=Bayat|first=Asef|date=2017|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9781503602588|language=en-US|pages=125}}</ref> Tunisian geographer-cinematographer Habib Ayeb, founder of the [[Tunisian Observatory for Food Sovereignty and the Environment]] (OSAE), has questioned the model of development that was introduced in Sidi Bouzid:

This is the development which people desire... The problem is that the local population does not benefit.

==End of Ben Ali's rule==
During a national television broadcast on {{Nowrap|28 December}}, President Ben Ali criticised protesters as "extremists and mercenaries" and warned of "firm" punishment. He also accused "certain foreign television channels" of spreading falsehoods and deforming the truth, and called them "hostile to Tunisia".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122823238574209.html|title=Tunisia president warns protesters|date=28 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> His remarks were ignored and the protests continued.<ref name="wed">{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/20101229122733122341.html|title=Tunisia struggles to end protests|date=29 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref>

In January 2011, Ben Ali said 300,000 new jobs would be created, though he did not clarify what that meant. He described the protests as "the work of masked gangs" attacking public property and citizens in their homes, and "a terrorist act that cannot be overlooked". [[Ahmed Najib Chebbi]], the leader of the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Tunisia)|Progressive Democratic Party]] (PDP), responded that despite official claims of police firing in self-defense "the demonstrations were non-violent and the youths were claiming their rights to jobs" and that "the funeral processions [for those killed on 9 January] turned into demonstrations, and the police fired [at] the youths who were at these [...] processions." He then criticised Ben Ali's comments as the protesters were "claiming their civil rights, and there is no terrorist act...no religious slogans". He further accused Ben Ali of "looking for scapegoats" and dismissed the creation of jobs as mere promises.<ref name="death">{{cite web|author=Randeree, Bilal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111016239214548.html |title=Tunisian leader promises new jobs – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

==Effects==
===Refugees===
In mid-February 2011, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian refugees landed on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], causing the authorities to declare a state of emergency<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/02/20112122328974957.html |title=Italy declares migrant emergency – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> that would allow for federal aid to the island. Italian Interior Minister [[Roberto Maroni]] accused the EU of not doing enough to curb immigration and asked them to do more.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Agenzia Giornalistica Italia |url=http://www.agi.it/english-version/world/elenco-notizie/201102112043-pol-ren1094-tunisia_italy_asks_eu_to_start_frontex_mission |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110629122522/http://www.agi.it/english-version/world/elenco-notizie/201102112043-pol-ren1094-tunisia_italy_asks_eu_to_start_frontex_mission |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 June 2011 |title=Tunisia: Italy Asks Eu To Start Frontex Mission |publisher=Agi.it |accessdate=13 February 2011 }}</ref> He said that the "Tunisian system was collapsing" and that he would "ask the Tunisian Foreign Ministry for permission for our authorities to intervene to stop the flow in Tunisia", suggesting Italian troops would be on Tunisian soil.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12443740 |title=Italy 'to deploy police to Tunisia' to tackle migration |work=BBC News |date=13 February 2011|accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> He called the event a "biblical exodus". The comments started a row between the two countries with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry saying it was ready to work with Italy and others but that it "categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any infringement of its sovereignty." In response, Italy's Foreign Minister [[Franco Frattini]] said that both countries share a "common interest" to halt the immigration, while he also offered "logistical help in terms of police and equipment" and called to re-establish previously successful coastal patrols of Northern Africa. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to [[Sicily]] with the other 2,000 [[quarantine]]d at a re-opened holding center.<ref name="aljazrefugeeresponse"/> On 2&nbsp;March about 350 more people arrived on the island.

===International and non-state===
[[File:Manif tunisie Nantes.JPG|thumb|[[Nantes]], France, demonstration in support of the Tunisian protests]]
{{main|International reactions to the Tunisian revolution}}
Many governments and supranational organisations expressed concerns over use of force against protesters. France, the former colonial power of Tunisia, was one of just a few states that expressed strong support for the Ben Ali government prior to its ouster, though protests were held in solidarity with Tunisia in several French cities and the [[French Socialist Party]] voiced support for the popular revolution.

===Media and punditry===

The lack of coverage in the domestic state-controlled media was criticised.<ref name="begin"/> Writer/activist [[Jillian York]] alleged that the [[mainstream media]], particularly in the Western world, was providing less coverage and less sympathetic coverage to the Tunisia protests relative to Iranian protests, the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green movement]], and censorship in China. York alleged the "US government&nbsp;– which intervened heavily in Iran, approving circumvention technology for export and famously asking Twitter to halt updates during a critical time period&nbsp;– has not made any public overtures toward Tunisia at this time."<ref>{{cite web|author=York, Jillian |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111981222719974.html |title=Activist crackdown: Tunisia vs Iran – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

Despite criticism about the "sparse" level of coverage and "little interest" given to the demonstrations by the international media, the protests were hailed by some commentators as "momentous events" in Tunisian history.<ref name="How"/> [[Brian Whitaker]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 28 December 2010, suggested that the protests would be enough to bring an end to Ben Ali's presidency and noted similarities with the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|protests]] that led to the end of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s reign in [[Romania]] in 1989.<ref name="How">{{Cite news|author=Whitaker, Brian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/28/tunisia-ben-ali|title=How a man setting fire to himself sparked an uprising in Tunisia|date=28 December 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> Steven Cook, writing for the [[Council of Foreign Relations]], noted that a [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] is only obvious after the fact, and pointed to the counter-example of the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/cook/2011/01/06/the-last-days-of-ben-ali/ |title=The Last Days of Ben Ali? |publisher=Steven Cook's Blog |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref> Ben Ali's governing strategy was nevertheless regarded as being in serious trouble,<ref name="protestwave"/> and [[Elliot Abrams]] noted both that demonstrators were able for the first time to defy the security forces and that the regime had no obvious successors to Ben Ali and his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/abrams/2011/01/07/is-tunisia-next/ |title=Is Tunisia Next? |publisher=Elliott Abrams: Pressure Points |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

==Repercussion analysis==
''[[Al Jazeera]]'' believed the ousting of the president meant the "glass ceiling of fear has been for ever shattered in Tunisia and that the police state that Ben Ali created in 1987 when he came to power in a coup seems to be disintegrating". It added that Ben Ali's resignation, following his statement that he had been "duped by his entourage", may not have been entirely sincere. ''[[Le Monde]]'' criticised French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Union's "Silence over the Tragedy" when the unrest broke.<ref name="end of an era">{{cite web|author=Ahelbarra, Hashem |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/2011/01/14/tunisia-end-era |title=Tunisia: The end of an era &#124; Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' suggested that [[mobile telecommunications]] played an influential role in the "revolution".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0115/Tunisia-s-Jasmine-Revolution-and-how-mobile-phones-helped-it-happen |title=Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution, and how mobile phones helped it happen |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref>

The revolt in Tunisia began speculation that the Tunisian Jasmine Revolution would lead to protests against the multiple other autocratic regimes across the [[Arab world]]. This was most famously captured in the phrase asking whether "Tunisia is the Arab [[Gdańsk]]?". The allusion refers to the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and Gdańsk's role as the birthplace of the movement that [[Collapse of Communism|ousted Communism in Eastern Europe]]. The phrase appeared in outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9362000/9362677.stm |title=Today – Is this the 'Arab world's Gdansk?' |work=BBC News |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref> as well as editorials by columnists [[Rami George Khouri|Rami Khouri]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2011/01/khouri-tunisia-is-gdansk-shipyard-of-80-with-jazeera-as-megaphone-to-other-arab-countries.html |title=Khouri: Tunisia is Gdansk shipyard of ‘80 with Jazeera as megaphone to other Arab countries! |publisher=Mondoweiss.net |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref> and [[Roger Cohen]].<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18iht-edcohen18.html | title = The Arab Gdansk | accessdate=28 January 2011 | author=Cohen, Roger |work=The New York Times | date=17 January 2011}}</ref>

[[Larbi Sadiki]] suggested that although "conventional wisdom has it that 'terror' in the Arab world is monopolised by al-Qaeda in its various incarnations", there was also the fact that "regimes in countries like Tunisia and Algeria have been arming and training security apparatuses to fight Osama bin Laden [but] were [still] caught unawares by the 'bin Laden within': the terror of marginalisation for the millions of educated youth who make up a large portion of the region's population. The winds of uncertainty blowing in the Arab west – the [[Maghreb]] – threaten to blow eastwards towards the [[Levant]] as the marginalised issue the fatalistic scream of despair to be given freedom and bread or death."<ref>{{cite web|author=Sadiki, Larbi |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/201111413424337867.html |title=The 'bin Laden' of marginalisation – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> A similar opinion by [[Lamis Ardoni]] carried by Al Jazeera said that the protests had "brought down the walls of fear, erected by repression and marginalization, thus restoring the Arab peoples' faith in their ability to demand social justice and end tyranny." He also said that the protests that succeeded in toppling the leadership should serve as a "warning to all leaders, whether supported by international or regional powers, that they are no longer immune to popular outcries of fury" even though Tunisia's ostensible change "could still be contained or confiscated by the country's ruling elite, which is desperately clinging to power." He called the protests the "Tunisian [[wikt:intifada|intifada]]" which had "placed the Arab world at a crossroads". He further added that if the change was ultimately successful in Tunisia it could "push the door wide open to freedom in Arab world. If it suffers a setback we shall witness unprecedented repression by rulers struggling to maintain their absolute grip on power. Either way, a system that combined a starkly unequal distribution of wealth with the denial of freedoms has collapsed."<ref>{{cite web|author=Andoni, Lamis|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world... |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref>

Similarly, [[Mark LeVine]] noted that the events in Tunisia could spiral into the rest of the [[Arab world]] as the movement was "inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate." He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted "[[Kefaya]]" and "We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;" and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as "the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution." He concluded that there were two scenarios that could play out: "a greater democratic opening across the Arab world," or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the [[1991 Algerian legislative election|democratic election]] was annulled and Algeria went into a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111167156465567.html|title=Tunisia: How the US got it wrong}}</ref>

[[Robert Fisk]] asked if this was "The end of the age of dictators in the Arab world?" and partly answered the question in saying that Arab leaders would be "shaking in their boots". He also pointed out that the "despot" Ben Ali sought refuge in the same place as the ousted [[Idi Amin]] of [[Uganda]] and that "the French and the Germans and the Brits, dare we mention this, always praised the dictator for being a 'friend' of civilized Europe, keeping a firm hand on all those Islamists." He notably pointed at the "demographic explosion of youth" of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last. He thinks "this is going to be the same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia – but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability."<ref name="britian">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-brutal-truth-about-tunisia-2186287.html|title=The brutal truth about Tunisia|work=The Independent | location=London|first=Robert|last=Fisk|date=17 January 2011}}</ref>

Blake Hounshell wrote on Foreignpolicy.com that the Tunisian precedent raised the prospect of a "new trend. There is something horrifying and, in a way, moving about these suicide attempts. It's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy."<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-12206551 Accessed 26 December 2016</ref>

===Impact of the Internet===
{{further|Internet#Politics and political revolutions}}

The use of communication technologies, and the Internet in particular, has been widely credited as a contributor to the mobilisation of protests.<ref>Kravets, David. (22 August 2013) [https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/ Threat Level]. ''Wired''. Retrieved 9 September 2013.</ref> A blog associated with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described the intricate efforts of the Tunisian authorities to control such online media as<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/tunisia/|title=Tweeting Tyrants Out of Tunisia: Global Internet at Its Best|publisher=Threat Level / Wired | first1=Nate|last1=Anderson|first2=Ars|last2=Technica|date=14 January 2011}}</ref> Twitter and Facebook. Other regional regimes were also on higher alert to contain spillover effects that might have ensued.

On 11 March 2011, [[Reporters Without Borders]] gave its annual award for online media freedom to the Tunisian blogging group [[Nawaat.org]]. Founded in 2004, it played an important role for rallying anti-government protesters by reporting on the protests which the national media ignored.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110314155555/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jn6P6Y2M4esLbvifHY0Foqb2vQTA?docId=361d3296b81a471bbfffeccbe1202202 Tunisian bloggers win online media award], [[Associated Press|AP]], 11 March 2011</ref>

==Regional instability==
{{main|Arab Spring}}
{{see also|Mohamed Bouazizi#Copycat incidents}}

In January 2011, the BBC reported: "Clearly the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi has resonated across the region...'There is great interest. The Egyptian people and the Egyptian public have been following the events in Tunisia with so much joy, since they can draw parallels between the Tunisian situation and their own.{{' "}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Westcott |first=Kathryn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12206551 |title=Why do people set themselves on fire? |work=BBC News |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref>

After the beginning of the uprising in Tunisia, similar protests took place in almost all Arab countries from [[Morocco]] to [[Iraq]], as well as in other states, ranging from [[Gabon]] to [[Albania]], Iran, [[Kazakhstan]], [[2011 United States public employee protests|United States]], [[2011 Indian anti-corruption movement|India]] and others. Following [[2011 Egyptian revolution|weeks of protests]], Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11&nbsp;February. Major protests against longtime Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] broke out on 17&nbsp;February and quickly deteriorated into [[2011 Libyan civil war|civil war]], ultimately resulting in the downfall of the Gaddafi regime later in the year. [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syria]] experienced a major uprising of people calling for the removal of President [[Bashar al-Assad]].  The Syrian uprising also deteriorated into a [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]], giving rise to the militant group, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], and partly causing the current [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|refugee crisis]]. In addition, [[2011 Yemeni protests|Yemen]], [[2011 Bahraini protests|Bahrain]], and [[2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]] have seen major protests.

However, a financial analyst in [[Dubai]] suggested that "the spillover effect of the political turbulence to the large countries in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] is non-existent as there are no similar drivers."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hankir |first=Zahra |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-30/dubai-shares-plunge-most-in-year-lead-gulf-drop-on-egypt-risk-protests.html |title=Dubai Shares Fall Most Since May on Egypt Unrest, Pacing Mideast Decline |publisher=Bloomberg |date=30 January 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
In mid-May 2013, Tunisia banned the Salafist [[Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia)|Ansar al-Sharia]] from carrying out party congresses. The day after the congress was due to be carried out, clashes between security forces and party supporters in [[Kairouan]] resulted in one death amid attempts to disperse those who wanted to carry out the events.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/05/20135198155650292.html Salafist group clashes with police in Tunisia – Africa].
