'''Viktor Alekseyevich Zubkov''' ({{lang-rus|Ви́ктор Алексе́евич Зубко́в|p=ˈvʲiktər ɐlʲɪˈksʲejɪvʲɪtɕ zʊpˈkof}}; born 15 September 1941) is a Russian politician and businessman who served as the [[List of heads of government of Russia|36th]] [[Prime Minister of Russia]] from September 2007 to May 2008. He was [[Vladimir Putin]]'s [[First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia|First Deputy Prime Minister]] during the presidency of [[Dmitry Medvedev]].

A [[civil servant]] who held various positions in the [[Leningrad Oblast]] under the Soviet regime, he later served as advisor to Cabinet Ministers. Zubkov was a [[Financial crimes|financial crime]] investigator until he was nominated on 12 September 2007 by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to replace Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]], who had resigned earlier that day.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6991053.stm "Putin names next prime minister"], BBC News, 12 September 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296505,00.html "Putin Dissolves Government, Nominates Viktor Zubkov as New Prime Minister"], FOX News, 12 September 2007.</ref> The nomination was approved in the [[State Duma|Duma]] on 14 September 2007.<ref>[http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11871756&PageNum=0 Duma approves Zubkov for prime minister’s post, ITAR-TASS.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230625/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11871756&PageNum=0 |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> On 7 May 2008 Zubkov's cabinet was automatically dismissed. This procedure, following an [[inauguration]] of the [[President of Russia]] is required by the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]]. After Putin became Prime Minister, Zubkov was appointed [[First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia]].

Zubkov is also the current [[Chair (official)|chairman]] of the [[board of directors]] of [[Gazprom]], Russia's largest corporation and one of the largest oil and natural gas companies in the world.

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], Zubkov graduated from the Economic Department of the [[Leningrad]] Agriculture Institute in 1972.

In 1966, he was drafted to the [[Soviet Army]] for an 18-month term. From 1967 to 1985, he worked on leading positions in [[kolkhoz]]es of [[Leningrad Oblast]]. From 1985 to 1991, he occupied several leading positions in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in Leningrad Oblast: Chairman of the [[Priozersk]] City Executive Committee, First Secretary of the Priozersk City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and head of the Department of Agriculture and Food Industry and the Agricultural Department of the Regional Committee of the CPSU. He was also First Deputy Chairman of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee from 1989 to 1991.

In January 1992 to November 1993, he was a deputy Chairman of the External Relations Committee of the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration|Saint Petersburg Mayor Office]] led by [[Vladimir Putin]]. From 3 November 1993, to 30 November 1998, Zubkov was the Chief of the Saint Petersburg Department of the State Tax Inspection and simultaneously a Deputy Chairman of the State Tax Inspection for Saint Petersburg.

In December 1998, during the term of [[Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet]] the State Tax Inspection was reorganized into the Tax Ministry of Russia and Zubkov's deputy head position was abolished, but he was immediately reappointed Chief of the Saint Petersburg Directorate of the Tax Ministry. On 23 July 1999, Zubkov was appointed Deputy Tax Minister of Russia for the Northwestern region. In a few days he was also appointed Chief of the Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast Directorate of the Tax Ministry.

On 12 August 1999, he was registered as a contender in the [[Leningrad Oblast]] governor election, assisted by [[Boris Gryzlov]] as his election campaign manager, but lost the election to [[Valeriy Serdyukov]] on 19 September 1999, with 8.64 percent of the vote (4th place out of 16).

On 5 November 2001, he left his positions in the Tax Ministry and was appointed First Deputy [[Finance minister|Finance Minister]] of Russia and Chairman of the Financial Monitoring Committee of the ministry, aimed to fight [[money laundering]].

On 16 March 2004, after the dismissal of [[Mikhail Kasyanov's Cabinet]], the Financial Monitoring Committee was renamed to [[Federal Financial Monitoring Service of Russia|Federal Financial Monitoring Service]] of the Finance Ministry, but Zubkov retained his position in [[Mikhail Fradkov's First Cabinet]] and [[Mikhail Fradkov's Second Cabinet]].

In a 2006 survey of political experts, Zubkov was ranked as Russia's 84th most influential politician.<ref>C. J. Chivers, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/13/world/europe/13russia.html "Putin Shuffles Government, Posing Mystery"], ''The New York Times'', 13 September 2007.</ref>

Zubkov's daughter is married to [[Anatoliy Serdyukov]], the former [[Russian Ministry of Defence|Russian Defense Minister]].<ref>[http://www.lenta.ru/news/2007/09/12/zubkov/ Putin appoints Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov], lenta.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

=== Prime Minister ===
{{Main|Viktor Zubkov's Cabinet}}
On 12 September 2007, [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] proposed his candidacy for the post of [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] and on 14 September, the [[State Duma]] approved him in the post (he was voted 381 MP).<ref>[http://lenta.ru/news/2007/09/14/zubkov/ Виктор Зубков утвержден премьер-министром России]</ref> Zubkov resigned 8 May 2008, after [[Dmitry Medvedev]] became President.

Some [[Kremlinology|Kremlinologists]] viewed Zubkov as one more technical Prime Minister, interpreting the move as a way to renew a competition between possible successors.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070912.wzubkovpm0912/BNStory/International Putin sets cat among succession pigeons, globeandmail.com]</ref>
Another theory suggested that Putin chose a man of unquestioning loyalty to help him control powerful factions jostling for position inside the Kremlin. Another clue to his usefulness lies in Zubkov's experience under Putin as the man leading the fight against [[financial crime]].
Putin said that there were five people who can run for president and can be elected, including Zubkov.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070914/78797642.html RIA Novosti - Russia - Putin says five candidates could run for president -1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 13 September, Zubkov himself said he might run for President of Russia in 2008.<ref>[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Russia_s_new_PM_could_stand_for_president.html?siteSect=143&sid=8213717&cKey=1189678958000&ty=ti Russia's new PM says could stand for president, sweissinfo.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205234801/http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Russia_s_new_PM_could_stand_for_president.html?siteSect=143&sid=8213717&cKey=1189678958000&ty=ti |date=December 5, 2007 }}</ref> However, in December 2007, Putin officially gave his support to [[Dmitry Medvedev]] for the [[2008 Russian presidential election|2008 presidential election]], effectively dashing Zubkov's hopes for the presidency. After Medvedev took office, Zubkov succeeded him as Chairman of Gazprom.
