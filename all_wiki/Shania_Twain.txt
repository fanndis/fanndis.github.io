Raised in [[Timmins, Ontario]], Twain pursued singing and songwriting from a young age before signing with [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville Records]] in the early 1990s.

==Early life==
Twain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in [[Windsor, Ontario]], on August 28, 1965,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shaniatwain.com/bio|title=Shania Twain – About|accessdate=August 17, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820032156/http://www.shaniatwain.com/bio|archivedate=August 20, 2016}}</ref> to Sharon (''née'' Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. She has two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother moved to [[Timmins, Ontario]], with her daughters. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an [[Ojibwa]] from the nearby [[Mattagami First Nation]], and they had son Mark together. Jerry adopted the girls and legally changed their surname to Twain. When Mark was a toddler, Jerry and Sharon adopted Jerry's baby nephew Darryl when his mother died. Because of Twain's connection to Jerry, the media have incorrectly reported that she is of Ojibwe descent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shania Twain : Biography|work=Rolling Stone Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shaniatwain/biography|accessdate=October 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123143156/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shaniatwain/biography|archivedate=November 23, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> When questioned as to why she chose not to publicly acknowledge Edwards as her father for years, Twain stated: <blockquote>My father (Jerry) went out of his way to raise three daughters that weren't even his. For me to acknowledge another man as my father, a man who was never there for me as a father, who wasn't the one who struggled everyday to put food on our table, would have hurt him terribly. We were a family. Step-father, step-brothers, we never used that vocabulary in our home. To have referred to him as my step-father would have been the worst slap across the face to him.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/native-ancestry-called-question|title=Native ancestry called into question|website=Ammsa.com|access-date=2019-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713201204/https://ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/native-ancestry-called-question|archive-date=July 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>Shania currently holds a status card and is on the official band membership list of the [[Temagami First Nation]]. In 1991, the singer was offered a recording contract in Nashville and applied for immigration status into the United States. At that time, by virtue of her stepfather Jerry Twain being a full-blooded Ojibwe and the rights guaranteed to Native Americans in the [[Jay Treaty]] (1795), Shania became legally registered as having 50 percent Native American blood.<ref name=":0" />

Twain has said that as a child she was told by her mother that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies.<ref name=":0" /> Her confirmed ancestry includes English, French, and Irish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/edwards.html|title=Ancestry of Shania Twain|publisher=Wargs.com|accessdate=August 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602155658/http://www.wargs.com/other/edwards.html|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/blog/look-whos-related-taylor-swift-and-reba-mcentire-373829.html|title=Look Who's Related: Taylor Swift and Reba McEntire|publisher=Geni.com|accessdate=August 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510181144/http://www.geni.com/blog/look-whos-related-taylor-swift-and-reba-mcentire-373829.html|archive-date=May 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenter [[Zacharie Cloutier]].<ref name="Ref_d">{{cite web|url=http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/loiseauHTML/menu/home_en.htm|title=Genealogies of Madonna, Celine Dion, Hillary Clinton and Camilla, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall – All cousins!|publisher=Perche-quebec.com|accessdate=February 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220215928/http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/loiseauHTML/menu/home_en.htm|archivedate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from [[Newbridge, County Kildare]].<ref>Twain, Shania.

Twain has said she had a difficult childhood. Her parents earned little money, and food was often scarce in their household. Twain did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. Her mother and stepfather's marriage was stormy at times, and from a young age she witnessed violence between them. Her mother also struggled with bouts of depression. In mid-1979, while Jerry was at work, at Twain's insistence, her mother drove the rest of the family {{convert|420|mi}} south to a [[Toronto]] homeless shelter for assistance.<ref name="Ref_f">Shania's interview in the January 2005 [[Reader's Digest]].</ref> Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981. In Timmins, Twain started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to help pay her family's bills; she often earned [[Canadian dollar|$]]20 between midnight and 1 a.m. performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving alcohol. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, Twain believes that this was her own kind of performing-arts school on the road.<ref name="Ref_h">[http://www.shaniaforums.com/archive/index.php/t-34295.html Shania Twain Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112051039/http://www.shaniaforums.com/archive/index.php/t-34295.html|date=November 12, 2007}}. [[Today with Des and Mel]]. ITV Productions</ref> She has said of the ordeal, "My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought, 'I hate this.' I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived."<ref name="Ref_i">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=41}}</ref> Twain wrote her first songs at the age of 10, "Is Love a Rose" and "Just Like the Storybooks," which were rhyming fairy tales.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=51">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=51}}</ref> She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, "was very different from performing them and became progressively important".<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=51"/>

At age 13, Twain was invited to perform on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''[[Tommy Hunter]] Show''. While attending [[Timmins High and Vocational School]], she was also the singer for a local band called Longshot, which covered Top 40 music.<ref>{{cite web|author=KymSarah says|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/shania-twain|title=Shania Twain &#124; Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=Walkoffame.com|accessdate=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328011316/http://www.walkoffame.com/shania-twain|archive-date=March 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> In the early 1980s, Twain spent some time working with her father's [[reforestation]] business in northern Ontario, which employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, Twain said, "I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake. It was a very rugged existence, but I was very creative and I would sit alone in the forest with my dog and a guitar and would just write songs."<ref name="Ref_j">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=62}}</ref>

==Career==
===1983–1992: Beginnings===
[[File:Kenogami Lake ON.JPG|thumb|[[Kenogami Lake, Ontario]] where Twain spent much time practicing in 1985]]
Twain graduated from Timmins High in June 1983 eager to expand her musical horizons.<ref name="Eggy 2005 p=88">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=88}}</ref> After Longshot's demise, Twain was approached by a cover band led by [[Diane Chase]] called "Flirt" and toured all over Ontario with them.<ref name="Eggy 2005 p=88" /> She also took singing lessons from Toronto-based coach Ian Garrett, often cleaning his house as payment.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=89">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=89}}</ref> In the autumn of 1984, Twain's talents were noticed by Toronto DJ Stan Campbell who wrote about her in a ''Country Music News'' article: "Eilleen possesses a powerful voice with an impressive range. She has the necessary drive, ambition and positive attitude to achieve her goals".<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=89" /> Campbell happened to be making an album by Canadian musician (and present-day [[CKTB (AM)|CKTB]] radio personality) Tim Denis at the time and Twain was featured on the backing vocals of the song ''Heavy on the Sunshine''.<ref name="Ref_k">{{Citation|url=http://www.610cktb.com/shows/510269|title=61.0 CKTB|publisher=61.0 CKTB|accessdate=October 1, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331113001/http://www.610cktb.com/shows/510269|archivedate=March 31, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Eggar 2005 p=89" /> Campbell later took Twain to Nashville to record some demos, which she found particularly difficult to finance. She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976. Bailey had seen Twain perform in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario, saying "I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed [[Willie Nelson]]'s "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]" and [[Hank Williams]]' "[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]". Her voice reminded me of [[Tanya Tucker]], it had strength and character, a lot of feeling. She's a star, she deserves an opportunity."<ref name="Ref_l">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=90}}</ref> Bailey later said "She sang a few songs that she had written, and I thought to myself, this kid is like nineteen years old, where does she get this? This is from a person who's lived sixty years".<ref name="Ref_m">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=91}}</ref>

Bailey acquired the contract from Stan Campbell and Twain moved into Bailey's home on [[Kenogami Lake, Ontario|Kenogami Lake]] where she practiced her music every day for hours. In the fall of 1985, Bailey took Twain down to [[Nashville]] to stay with a friend, record producer Tony Migliore, who at the time was producing an album for fellow Canadian singer Kelita Haverland and Twain was featured on the backing vocals to the song ''Too Hot to Handle''. She also recorded "demo" songs with Cyril Rawson but those efforts were unsuccessful, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist. After five months she returned to Canada and moved in with Bailey in a flat in downtown [[Kirkland Lake]], not far from Kenogami.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=92">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=92}}</ref>
There she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier, drummer Randy Yurko, guitarist Tom Gustar and formed a new band, moving three months later to [[Bowmanville]], near Toronto. In late summer 1986, Mary Bailey arranged for Twain to meet [[John Kim Bell]], a half [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], half American conductor who had close contacts with the directors of the [[Canadian Country Music Association]]. Bell recognized Twain's ability as well as her looks and the two began secretly dating.<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=92" /> In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years. Twain's first break finally came on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged a fundraiser for the [[Indspire|National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation]], now Indspire, at the [[Roy Thomson Hall]] in Toronto where Twain performed with Broadway star [[Bernadette Peters]], guitarist [[Don Ross (guitarist)|Don Ross]], and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Her performance received little acclaim, but it convinced Bell, who hated pop music, that Twain should stay well away from it and concentrate on country music.<ref name="Ref_n">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=101}}</ref>

On November 1, 1987, Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car accident approximately 50 kilometres north of [[Wawa, Ontario]].<ref name="Ref_o">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=103}}</ref> She moved back to Timmins to take care of her younger siblings and took them all to [[Huntsville, Ontario]], where she supported them by earning money performing at the nearby [[Deerhurst Resort]].<ref name="Eggar2005">{{cite book|last=Eggar|first=Robin|title=Shania Twain: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sh-levpCt-IC&pg=PA110|accessdate=March 26, 2012|date=October 11, 2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7434-9735-0|page=110|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114030743/http://books.google.com/books?id=Sh-levpCt-IC&pg=PA110|archive-date=November 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1993–1994: ''Shania Twain''===
Several years later, when Twain's siblings moved out on their own, she assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for her to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, including [[Mercury Nashville Records]], who signed her within a few months.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=SHANIA|title=Shania Twain Biography|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=November 15, 2008}}</ref> During this time, she changed her name to Shania, which was said to be an [[Ojibwa]] word which means "on my way." However, Twain's biographer, Robin Eggar, writes: "There is a continuing confusion about what 'Shania' means and if indeed it is an Ojibwe word or phrase at all. There is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either Ojibwe or Cree that comes close to meaning 'on my way.' Yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day."<ref name="Eggar 2005 p=145">{{Harvnb|Eggar|2005|p=145}}</ref> Eggar was mistaken about there being no Ojibwe phrase that "comes close", as "Ani aya'aa", pronounced "Ah-nih Eye-uh-ah", means "someone on the way" in Ojibwe. It is therefore possible that someone with an imperfect knowledge of the Ojibwe language created Shania with the incorrect idea it would mean "she's on the way".<ref name="Evans 2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/go/music/evans-fan-of-shania-twain-here-s-the-story-behind/article_dc704ea5-cc92-5511-a56c-99ff63799427.html|title=Evans: Fan of Shania Twain?

Twain's [[Shania Twain (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on April 20, 1993 in North America and garnered her audiences outside Canada. Shortly before its release, she sang backing vocals for other Mercury artists, including on [[Jeff Chance]]'s album ''Walk Softly on the Bridges'' (1992)<ref>Hager, p. 90</ref> and [[Sammy Kershaw]]'s album ''[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw album)|Haunted Heart]]'' (1993).<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Haunted Heart|others=Sammy Kershaw|year=1993|type=cassette|publisher=Mercury Records|id=514332}}</ref> While ''Shania Twain'' only reached No. 67 on the US Country Albums Chart, it gained positive reviews from critics. The album failed to sell significant copies upon release, but Twain's future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum in 1999 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], denoting sales of over 1 million copies. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with "[[What Made You Say That]]" and "[[Dance with the One That Brought You]]". The third and final single, "[[You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me]]", failed to chart. All three singles had accompanying music videos. The album was more successful in Europe, where Twain won Country Music Television Europe's "Rising Video Star of the Year" award.<ref name="allmusic"/> In her 2011 autobiography ''From This Moment On'', Twain expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and was frustrated with being unable to showcase her songwriting abilities. She did, however, co-write one song, "God Ain't Gonna Getcha for That", for the album.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Twain|first1=Shania|title=From This Moment On|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=[[Atria Publishing Group]]|location=New York|isbn=9781451620740}}</ref>

===1995–1996: ''The Woman in Me'' and commercial success===
When rock producer [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]] heard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met at [[CMA Music Festival|Nashville's Fan Fair]] in June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within just weeks, culminating in their wedding on December 28, 1993. Lange and Twain either wrote or co-wrote the songs that would form her second studio album, ''[[The Woman in Me (album)|The Woman in Me]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{Citation|editor=Jann S.

''The Woman in Me'' was released on February 7, 1995. Of the 12 tracks on the album, 8 were released as singles. The album's first single, "[[Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?]]" went to No. 11 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country Chart]]. This was followed by her first Country Top 10 and No.1 hit single, "[[Any Man of Mine]]", which also cracked the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Twain had further hits from the album, including the [[The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)|title track]] which peaked at No.14 and three additional No.1 hits: "[[(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!]]", "[[You Win My Love]]", and "[[No One Needs to Know]]", which was selected for the original soundtrack for the 1996 film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', a first for Twain. Plus minor country hit "[[Home Ain't where His Heart Is (Anymore)]]" and a re-recorded gospel version of the album track "[[God Bless the Child (Shania Twain song)|God Bless The Child]]" with new lyrics.<ref name="allmusic"/> Meanwhile, in Australia, five of these singles: "The Woman in Me", "I'm Outta Here!", "You Win My Love", "No One Needs to Know" and "God Bless the Child", were remixed for the Australian pop market, with "I'm Outta Here!" becoming Twain's breakthrough hit there, reaching No.5 on the ARIA charts.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===1997–2001: ''Come On Over'', international pop breakthrough, cancelled Christmas album and Limelight Sessions===
[[File:Shania Twain - Come on Over Tour - Boston.jpg|thumb|left|Twain performing on the [[Come On Over Tour]] in 1999]]
In 1997, Twain released her follow-up album, ''[[Come On Over]]''. It established her as a successful crossover singer. Of the 16 tracks on the album, 12 were released as singles. Following the release of lead singles "[[Love Gets Me Every Time]]" and "[[Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)]]", which allowed Twain to make more appearances in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, the album started selling. With the release of third single, "[[You're Still the One]]", sales skyrocketed. "[[From This Moment On (Shania Twain song)|From This Moment On]]", "[[When (Shania Twain song)|When]]", "[[Honey, I'm Home]]", "[[That Don't Impress Me Much]]", "[[Man! I Feel Like a Woman!]]", "[[You've Got a Way]]", the [[Come On Over (Shania Twain song)|title track]], "[[Rock This Country!]]", and "[[I'm Holdin' On to Love (To Save My Life)]]" are the other nine songs that eventually saw release as singles. With the exception of "I'm Holdin' On to Love", all of the singles had accompanying music videos. "From This Moment On" is a duet with singer [[Bryan White]] and there was a re-recorded solo pop version, which was used for its music video.<ref>"Year-to-Date Songwriters Charts." Billboard – The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment June 13, 1998: 46. Print</ref>

The album peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and stayed on the charts for the next two years, going on to sell 40&nbsp;million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling album of all time by a female musician.<ref name="Harris2005">{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2005/11/06/1295562.html|title=Biopic looks at Twain's early years|last=Harris|first=Bill|date=November 7, 2005|work=[[Jam!]]|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=March 23, 2010|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529182223/http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2005/11/06/1295562.html|archive-date=May 29, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> She continued to break international boundaries for country music and female crossover artists.

In 1998, following the pop release of "You're Still the One", the ''Come On Over'' album was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation, and actually gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and her producer husband Robert John "Mutt" Lange were looking for. ''Come On Over'' went to No. 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in Great Britain and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4&nbsp;million in the UK alone. Although "You're Still The One" and the pop version of "From This Moment On" cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and "When" had success in the Top 20, the songs that finally drew European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles of "That Don't Impress Me Much", which reached number 3 in the UK and cracked the Top 10 in Germany, and "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!", which peaked at number 3 in both the UK and France. Additionally, "You've Got a Way" was remixed specifically for inclusion on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]''. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' 200, remaining there for 99 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1999/country-albums|title=1999 Archive|website=Billboard|access-date=August 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814041847/https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/1999/country-albums|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Billboard'' magazine declared Shania Twain the most played artist on American radio in 1999.<ref>https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/Billboard-Airplay/1999/BBAM-1999-12-24.pdf</ref>

In 1998, Twain launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager [[Jon Landau]], a veteran of many large-scale tours with [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The [[Come On Over Tour]] shows were a success, winning the "Country Tour of the Year" in 1998 and 1999 by Pollstar Concert Industry Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/PCIA-Static/awards1998.htm|title=Pollstar Awards Archive|work=Pollstar Pro|accessdate=March 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724212001/http://www.pollstarpro.com/PCIA-Static/awards1998.htm|archive-date=July 24, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'' was released on November 19, 2002. On January 26, 2003, Twain performed in the [[Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show]]. About a year later, Twain kicked off the [[Up! Tour]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, Canada on September 25, 2003. ''Up!'' was released with three different discs – country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD). ''Up!'' was given four out of five stars by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, and debuted at No.1 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Twain's crossover appeal in the country, pop and dance genres, led ''Up!'' to reach 1 in Germany, 2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, ''Up!'' was certified 4x platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for a year and a half. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in [[Mumbai]], India. The new versions were produced by Simon and [[Diamond Duggal]], brothers from [[Birmingham]], England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!" which retained the Indian influence.<ref name="Ref_p">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/communities/masti/2003/03/16/diamond_duggal.shtml|title=Shania's 'Asian inspiration' talks it 'Up!'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=October 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927072602/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/communities/masti/2003/03/16/diamond_duggal.shtml|archive-date=September 27, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

Eight of the tracks were released as singles in various markets. The first single from the album, "[[I'm Gonna Getcha Good!]]" became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at No.&nbsp;24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. It was a much bigger hit on the other side of the Atlantic, released in a pop version, the single hit 4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France, the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single was the title track, which reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but only reached 63 on the pop charts. The second European single, and third single overall, became the mid-tempo song "[[Ka-Ching!]]" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where Twain was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another smash hit in the important European markets, reaching 1 in Germany and [[Austria]] and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France. "Ka-Ching!" remains one of Twain's most-successful singles internationally.

The fourth single from the album would be the most successful in the US, the romantic ballad "[[Forever and for Always]]". It was released in April 2003 and peaked at 4 on the country chart, 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Again, success was even bigger on the other side of the Atlantic with "Forever and For Always" again reaching the Top 10 in both, the UK and Germany. The other four singles from the album were "[[Thank You Baby! (For Makin' Someday Come So Soon)]]", "[[She's Not Just a Pretty Face]]", "[[When You Kiss Me]]" and "[[It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing]]". All eight singles had accompanying music videos. The title track "Up!", and "When You Kiss Me" saw release in limited edition to European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. By January 2008, ''Up!'' had sold 5.5&nbsp;million copies in the US and was certified as 11x platinum (Diamond) by the [[RIAA]].<ref name = RIAA/> This made Twain the only female artist in history to have three consecutive albums [[RIAA certification|certified Diamond]] by the [[RIAA]].
