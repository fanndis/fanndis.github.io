"'''SOS'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] from her second studio album ''[[A Girl like Me (Rihanna album)|A Girl like Me]]'' (2006). It was written by [[J. R. Rotem]], [[E. Kidd Bogart]] and [[Ed Cobb]], while production was handled by Rotem, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers. It was released on February 14, 2006, as the [[lead single]] from the album. "SOS" is a [[Dance music|dance]] song which samples [[Soft Cell]]'s 1981 recording of "[[Tainted Love]]", a song written by Cobb in 1965. Critical reception of "SOS" was generally positive, with the majority of [[music journalism|music critics]] praising the inclusion of the "Tainted Love" sample. Some critics compared "SOS" to Rihanna's debut single, "[[Pon de Replay]]".

"SOS" became a commercial success. In the United States, it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for three consecutive weeks, becoming Rihanna's first number one single on the chart. "SOS" peaked at number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart and [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. "SOS" was certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipments of over 1,000,000 copies. The song was also successful in Europe as well as Australia, where it spent eight consecutive weeks at number one.

Three music videos were shot for "SOS"; aside from the official music video, directed by Chris Applebaum, promotional campaign videos were shot for lingerie brand [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]] and [[Nike Inc.|Nike]]. "SOS" was performed live at the 2006 [[MTV EMA#2006|MTV EMA]] awards in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].<ref name="MTVEMA">{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651672/rihanna-ema-show-chance-discover-new-music.jhtml|title=Rihanna Says EMA Show Is A Chance To Discover New Music|publisher=MTV.

==Background and conception==
[[File:JR Rotem LF.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[J. R. Rotem]] co-wrote and produced "SOS", and came up with the idea of sampling "[[Tainted Love]]", written by [[Ed Cobb]] in 1965.]]
"SOS" was written by [[J. R. Rotem]], [[E. Kidd Bogart|Evan "Kidd" Bogart]] and [[Ed Cobb]], with production helmed by Rotem.<ref name="Notes"/> The song was recorded at Bartmitzvah Hall Studios, [[Century City]], [[California]], and Loft Recording Studios, [[Bronxville]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name="Notes"/> "SOS" contains a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of "[[Tainted Love]]", written by [[Ed Cobb]] in 1964, and popularized by [[England|English]] [[synthpop]] duo [[Soft Cell]] in 1981.<ref name="Notes"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Rotem explained the song's conception, saying "I heard 'Tainted Love' and wanted to take the bass line and update it with a new swing. When I gave the track to Evan Bogart, the '80s feeling was already in the track."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JR_Rotem_Interview.html |title=Interview with JR Rotem|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=April 4, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref> Rotem was asked how he felt about working with singers who became successful international recording artists after he had worked with them in an interview with William E. Ketchum for HipHopDX in May 2011, and referred to Rihanna and writing "SOS" in his response, saying:

{{quote|I did Rihanna's song “SOS” and it wasn't her first song, but it was her first number one. Since then, she's obviously one of the biggest stars in the world. But I never look at it like that's because of me or something like that. I just look at it like it was amazing to have worked with her at that time, and I would like to work with her again.<ref name="HipHopDX">{{cite web|last=Ketchum|first=William E.|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1698/title.producers-corner-jr-rotem|title=Producer's Corner: JR Rotem|publisher=HipHopDX|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>}}

"SOS" was originally intended to be given to and recorded by former [[Def Jam Recordings]] labelmate [[Christina Milian]], for her third studio album, ''[[So Amazin']]'' (2006), but Milian turned down the song and former Def Jam CEO and chairman [[L.A. Reid]] offered the song to Rihanna instead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lelinwalla |first=Mark |url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/06/island_def_jam_drops_christina_milian/ |title=Island Def Jam Drops Christina Milian : VIBE.com |work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |date=June 12, 2006 |access-date=August 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202100136/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/06/island_def_jam_drops_christina_milian/ |archive-date=December 2, 2008 }}</ref>

==Production and mixing==
The [[Backing vocalist|background vocals]] in the song were compressed using a compressor program called [[Waves Audio|Waves ''Renaissance Compressor'']], which was used in order to create an enhanced polished effect. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', [[Audio engineering|mixing engineer]] [[Phil Tan]], who carried out the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] on "SOS", explained that he compressed the background vocals because "SOS" is a "high energy track", and he wanted the vocals to complement it. Tan also noted that the background vocals were pitch shifted to increase tonal quality and create an enhanced effect during the chorus. The pitch shifting consisted of making the left vocals [[Flat (music)|flat]] and the right vocals [[Sharp (music)|sharp]], with varying degrees of delay, and later mixing them together. When asked about the production of the [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], Tan described the song as "a pounding type of song, and the lyrics are a cry for help, so the vocals need to be 'in your face', almost aggressive," and said that he wanted the vocals to remain constant. As with the background vocals, the lead vocals were compressed using the Waves ''Renaissance Compressor''. Tan continued to note that the lack of [[Reverberation|reverb]] included on "SOS" was largely due to the fact that being an uptempo dance-pop song, there was not a lot of room left to add anything else. Tan explained the production process of sampling "Tainted Love", as well as the changes which were made:

{{quote|This song uses a stereo two-bar loop from Soft Cell's song 'Tainted Love' as its basis. J.R. played the additional parts with a combination of soft and hardware synths. There were probably 30 to 40 tracks in total. J.R. tends to give you [Pro Tools] Sessions that have a clear direction: there's not much guesswork. I didn't change or add much, just a bass drum and taking out the loop a couple of times for additional breaks. There was never any doubt that it was going to be a clubby song, so it had to be very immediate and hard-hitting.<ref name="PhilTanSoundOnSound">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb07/articles/insidetrack_0207.htm|title=Secrets Of The Mix Engineers: Phil Tan|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref>}}

==Critical reception==
Upon the release of the album, "SOS" garnered positive reviews from music critics.

===Official music video===

The video begins with Rihanna singing the hook while wearing a low-cut green dress and dancing in front of tropical trees on a island. [[Key light]]ing is used to place emphasis on Rihanna, whilst the backdrop remains virtually dark and unseeable. For the first [[Verse (music)#Verse|verse]], Rihanna is featured dancing against a plain grey background, wearing a white top and sequined silver miniskirt, whilst flirtatiously dancing with the male dancer. Halfway through the verse, another scene is introduced, with Rihanna wearing a pink dress in a mirrored room, showing multiple reflections of the singer from different angles. For the first [[Verse (music)#Chorus|chorus]], Rihanna is mainly featured wearing the green dress on the island, but a new scene of Rihanna wearing a midriff-baring black lace is introduced toward the end of the chorus, where she, as well as four male dancers, perform a choreographed dance routine. Scenes of Rihanna in the mirrored room are intercut with the previous scene for the duration of the chorus. For the second verse, a further scene of Rihanna is depicted, this time featuring the scenes performing a dance routine with a group of female dancers, in the same setting as the one at the start of the video. For the second chorus, another scene of the singer sitting on a chair whilst listening to music is shown. For the remainder of the video, including the [[Verse (music)#Bridge|bridge]] and final chorus, all scenes featured in the video are intercut with one another, displaying a total of five different scenes and settings.

===Nike version===

The video begins with a [[long shot]] of a group of dancers who have just finished rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to snap her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|fades]]. As the music begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the center. The scene is fairly dark with different colored lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of outfit. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a [[close-up]] of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna in the middle of the rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.
