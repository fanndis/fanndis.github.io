He went on to star as [[Edward Cullen]] in the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|film adaptations]] of the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' novels]], consisting of five films between 2008 and 2012, which earned a combined total of over $3.3&nbsp;billion worldwide.

After starring in the romantic dramas ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]'' (2010) and ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011), Pattinson eschewed roles in big-budget films in favour of independent productions helmed by auteurs.

He returned to mainstream films with a leading role in [[Christopher Nolan]]'s spy film ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]'' (2020).

Pattinson has sung songs for the [[Twilight (soundtrack)|''Twilight'' soundtrack]] and the film ''[[How to Be]]'' (both 2008). He supports several charities, including the [[GO Campaign]].

Pattinson began modelling at the age of 12, but his workload began to decrease four years later. In December 2008, he blamed the lack of modelling work on his masculine appearance: "When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I got lots of jobs, because it was during that period where the androgynous look was cool. Then, I guess, I became too much of a guy, so I never got any more jobs. I had the most unsuccessful modelling career."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/12/why_robert_pattinsons_modeling.html|title=Why Robert Pattinson's Modeling|work=New York|access-date=8 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617070150/http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/12/why_robert_pattinsons_modeling.html|archive-date=17 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Pattinson appeared as a model for British teen magazines, and in the advertising campaign for [[Hackett (clothing)|Hackett]]'s autumn 2007 collection.<ref name="Hackett">{{cite web|title=Robert Pattinson-Hackett Campaign|url=http://coolspotters.com/actors/robert-pattinson/and/stores/hackett#medium-70753|accessdate=26 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080543/http://coolspotters.com/actors/robert-pattinson/and/stores/hackett#medium-70753|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
