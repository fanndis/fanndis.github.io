A former [[2008 US Open – Girls' Singles|Junior US Open]] champion and top 10 singles player, she has also won two WTA titles, both at the [[Rosmalen Grass Court Championships]]  in [[Den Bosch]]. In 2017, she reached two Grand Slam semifinals and the final of the [[WTA Elite Trophy]] to move into the top 10 for the first time. She reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 9 on January 15, 2018. In addition to her two Grand Slam semifinals in 2017 at the [[Australian Open]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Vandeweghe has twice reached the quarterfinals at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] in both 2015 and 2017. Vandeweghe also owns one Grand Slam doubles title, which she won at the 2018 US Open with partner [[Ashleigh Barty]].

Despite being predominantly a singles player, she also excels at doubles. In 2016, she partnered with [[Martina Hingis]] in much of the second half of the season and reached the semifinals of the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], a performance that lifted her to a then-career-high ranking of No. 18 in the world. In that year, she also reached two Grand Slam mixed doubles finals at the [[2016 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. In 2018, Vandeweghe won her first Grand Slam title, and, partnering [[Ashleigh Barty]], she won the women's doubles title at the [[2018 US Open – Women's Doubles|US Open]].

Vandeweghe's prowess at both singles and doubles helped her win all eight of her [[Fed Cup]] rubbers in 2017 across three different ties to lead the US team to its first Fed Cup championship since 2000.

==Early life==
Vandeweghe was born to [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympic]] swimmer [[Tauna Vandeweghe]] and her then-husband Robert Mullarkey.<ref name="montrealgazette">{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/sports/tennis/babys-turning-pro-whats-up-with-that|title=Babys turning pro – what’s up with that?|date=September 11, 2008|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}</ref> Coco's maternal grandparents are 1952 Miss America [[Colleen Kay Hutchins]] and former [[New York Knicks]] basketball player [[Ernie Vandeweghe]]. Her uncle, her mother's brother, is basketball player [[Kiki VanDeWeghe]],<ref name="montrealgazette"/> and her grandmother's brother was NBA player [[Mel Hutchins]]. Coco first started playing tennis with her elder brother, Beau, at the age of eleven. Tennis was the last sport she chose in her early life, after trying, among other things, basketball and wrestling. Vandeweghe eventually turned pro in April 2008. Self-described as a "total California girl," she spends most of her off-season at the beach with her family. She is good friends with fellow American players [[Madison Keys]], [[Irina Falconi]], and [[Shelby Rogers]].<ref name=nj>Waldstein, David.

Retrieved on September 7, 2011.</ref>

==Playing style==
Vandeweghe is known to have one of the strongest serves on tour. In 2014, she hit 306 aces, third-highest on tour.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/SEWTATour-Archive/Rankings_Stats/match_stats_2014.pdf |work=WTA Tour |accessdate=January 22, 2017 |title=2014 WTA Tour statistics}}</ref> She plays very aggressively, and likes to take the ball early and on the rise on both sides. Her groundstrokes are heavy and are delivered flat and powerful, particularly her forehand. Vandeweghe is efficient at the net and enjoys moving forward to avoid extended rallies. Because of her consistent serve, she has a solid mental game. Overall fitness and movement are cited as her main weaknesses, although they have been steadily improved. Her favorite shot is her forehand down the line, and her preferred surfaces are hard and grass courts. Previously, she was coached by [[Robert Van't Hof]] in [[Newport Beach, California]], and [[Adam Peterson (tennis)|Adam Peterson]] on the road. [[Pat Cash]] currently coaches her.

==Junior career==
As a junior, Vandeweghe was coached by Guy Fritz, the father of [[Taylor Fritz]]. In 2008, she reached the singles final of the USTA Girls 18s national championship as the 3rd-seed, losing to top-seeded [[Gail Brodsky]]. Vandeweghe also won the doubles event with [[Jamie Hampton]], defeating the top-seeded pair of Brodsky and [[Mallory Cecil]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=2008 USTA NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS-GIRLS 18s Day 8|url=http://www.collegeandjuniortennis.com/NationalHardcourtsG18s080908.htm|website=College and Junior Tennis|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}</ref> With these results, she earned wildcards into the main draws of the singles and doubles events at the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|US Open]].

In general, Vandeweghe did not play many junior events and needed a wildcard to enter the [[2008 US Open – Girls' Singles|2008 US Open girls' singles]] tournament. Nonetheless, she would go on to win the championship without dropping a set.<ref>[http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/tournaments/tournamentresults.asp?Event=1100100650&Tournament=1100017716 US Open Junior Tennis Championships 2008].

The trio would win the competition, with Vandeweghe partnering with Williams to win their doubles match in the final.

She would then defeat world No. 18 [[Aravane Rezai]] and eventually make the quarterfinals before losing to [[Victoria Azarenka]].

In 2011, Vandeweghe came through the qualifying rounds at the [[Australian Open]] but was knocked out in the first round. Her first significant result of the year came at the [[2011 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup|Memphis Indoor Tennis Championships]], where she reached the quarterfinals to break into the WTA top 100 for the first time in her career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coco Vandeweghe Matches|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/314464/title/coco-vANDEWEGHE#matches|website=WTA|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}</ref> Towards the end of the season, Vandeweghe won first career match in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], defeating world No. 56 [[Alberta Brianti]] in the first round.

She followed this up by qualifying for [[2012 Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], but she ended up losing the first round. At her next tournament, Vandeweghe entered the main draw of [[2012 Bank of the West Classic|Bank of the West Classic]] at Stanford as a lucky loser and made it to her first career WTA final. In the semifinal, she upset fifth-seeded [[Yanina Wickmayer]] before falling to top-seeded [[Serena Williams]] in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/18846266 |title=Serena Williams to face Coco Vandeweghe in Stanford final |date=July 15, 2012 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/8168830/serena-williams-tops-coco-vandeweghe-stanford-title |title=Serena Williams tops Coco Vandeweghe for Stanford title – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/Serena-Williams-wins-at-Stanford-in-final-Olympic-tuneup/articleshow/14972966.cms |title=Serena Williams wins at Stanford in final Olympic tuneup |date=July 16, 2012 |publisher=timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}</ref> She was the first lucky loser to reach a final since [[Melinda Czink]] in early 2005 and also rose to a then career-high ranking of No. 69 in the world. Vandeweghe's best result in the rest of the year was a quarterfinal at the [[2012 Citi Open|Citi Open]].

In 2013, Vandeweghe began the season with another slow start. When her ranking fell outside the top 200, she began to rebound by reaching the quarterfinals at the [[2013 Bank of the West Classic|Bank of the West Classic]].

[[File:Coco Vandeweghe (33534687530).jpg|thumb|Coco Vandeweghe at 2016 French Open]]
Vandeweghe got off to a rough start in 2016. She commenced her season at the [[2016 ASB Classic|ASB Classic]], where she was the seventh seed but lost to her compatriot and good friend [[Irina Falconi]] in the first round 7–5, 4–6, 3–6, despite being up a break in the final set.

She then played at the [[2016 Aegon Classic|Aegon Classic]], where she beat world No. 3 and top seed Agnieszka Radwańska, [[Christina McHale]] and Yanina Wickmayer, before losing to [[Barbora Strýcová]] and thus ending her eight-match winning streak.

She then defeated seventh seed Garbine Muguruza in straight sets to advance to her first-ever semifinal of a Grand Slam, where she went head-to-head with the [[2003 Australian Open|2003]] finalist Venus Williams. Despite winning the first set in a tiebreak and delivering a brilliant performance, Vandeweghe was defeated by Williams 7–6<sup>(7–3)</sup>, 2–6, 3–6, who spoke brightly of Vandeweghe following the match. Vandeweghe also became the fourth North American woman other than the Williams sisters to make the semifinals at an Australian Open in five years, following [[Sloane Stephens]] (2013), Bouchard (2014), and [[Madison Keys]] (2015). Following the tournament, Vandeweghe rose into the top 20 for the first time in her career. Seeded 19th at the [[2017 French Open|French Open]], she lost in the first round to Magdaléna Rybáriková.

At the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], Vandeweghe was seeded 24th. She beat [[Mona Barthel]] in straight sets in the first round, then continued with straight-set victories over [[Tatjana Maria]] and American compatriot Alison Riske. She then defeated fifth seed Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round, advancing to the quarterfinals for the second time in three years. Rybárikova defeated her in the quarterfinals in straight sets, the second straight Major she was beaten by the Slovak. At the Stanford Classic, Vandeweghe reached the final for the third time, where she lost to fellow American Madison Keys.

Seeded 20th at the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Vandeweghe recovered from a set down to beat compatriot [[Alison Riske]] in the first round then conquered [[Ons Jabeur]] for her first victory on Arthur Ashe stadium and to advance to the third round of the US Open for the first time in her career. She then defeated tenth seed Agnieszka Radwanska in three tight sets followed by a victory over 2015 French Open finalist Lucie Safarova to reach her third Grand Slam quarterfinal of the year, where she stunned top seed and world No. 1, Karolina Pliskova in straight sets to advance to her second major semifinal, where Keys defeated her, thus being denied of the chance to reach her first Grand Slam final. Following the tournament, Vandeweghe rose to a career-high ranking of No. 16. She concluded the season by reaching the final of the [[2017 WTA Elite Trophy|Elite Trophy in Zhuhai]]. This result helped her break into the top 10 for the first time, ending the season as No. 10.

===2018: Out of the top 100 in singles, US Open doubles title===
[[File:Coco Vandeweghe 5 - Roland-Garros 2018.jpg|thumb|Coco Vandeweghe at the [[2018 French Open – Women's Singles|2018 French Open]]]]
At the [[2018 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Vandeweghe was eliminated in the first round by the Hungarian [[Timea Babos]]. During the match, she was warned for delaying the start of the second set while she demanded that a banana be delivered to the court. Towards the end of the match, she was penalized a point for shouting expletives at her opponent. She was later fined $10,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22103957/australian-open-women-coco-vandeweghe-goes-bananas-loss-babos|title=CoCo goes bananas in shock loss to Babos|date=January 15, 2018|work=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/coco-vandeweghe-fined-10000-for-foulmouthed-outburst-at-australian-open/news-story/115fee44bce422977d4ac9a9b15485cd|title=CoCo Vandeweghe fined $10,000 for foul-mouthed outburst at Australian Open|date=January 19, 2018|work=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref> The incident generated controversy in the press and on social media with tennis fans calling Vandeweghe's actions on the court "disgusting."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/australian-open-2018-coco-vandeweghe-blasted-for-calling-opponent-fing-bh-20180115-h0itwv.html|title=Coco Vandeweghe blasted for calling opponent 'f---ing b---h|date=January 16, 2018|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> Vandeweghe's on-court behavior has been criticized in the past.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/tennis/us-open-andy-murray-coco-vandeweghe-show-bad-behaviour-not-just-confined-to-nick-kyrgios/news-story/80da3d4ce2b1c41b937f1e6d76a05357|title=Andy Murray, Coco Vandeweghe show bad behavior not just confined to Nick Kyrgios|date=September 8, 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/855748-how-us-players-have-given-tennis-a-bad-rap|title=How US Tennis Players Have Given the Sport a Bad Rap|date=September 19, 2011|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref>

Shortly after, Vandeweghe revealed that she had suffered from a severe virus during the Australian Open and was ordered by her doctor to limit her travel, due to recovery. She withdrew from the Qatar Open in Doha. Vandeweghe returned to the tour at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells and was eliminated in the singles draw. At the Miami Open, Vandeweghe lost her first-round match in the singles draw, but she entered the doubles with Ashleigh Barty for the first time. The pair won their first doubles title together, with notable wins over fourth-seeded Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic in the first round, top-seeded Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina in the semifinal, and second-seeded Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in the final.

During the clay season, Vandeweghe reached the final at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, where she lost to Karolina Pliskova. Early elimination in the Madrid Open and Italian Open followed. At the French Open, she reached the second round.

The grass tournaments before Wimbledon showed the same results as the clay season. Vandeweghe reached the semifinals in Hertogenbosch before she lost to the eventual champion Aleksandra Krunic. An early defeat in Nottingham to Petra Martic followed. At Wimbledon, Vandeweghe was defeated by Katerina Siniakova in three sets, but worse was that she injured her right ankle during the match. The injury meant that Vandeweghe and Barty had to withdraw from the doubles competition, and she was sidelined during the US Open Series.

Vandeweghe made her comeback at the Western & Southern in Cincinnati and had another defeat. To get more matches before the US Open, Vandeweghe received a wild card for the Connecticut Open. She met Rybarikova in the first round and was forced to retire from the match in the third set with pain in her injured ankle.

At the US Open, Vandeweghe was defeated in singles by Kirsten Flipkens. But the US Open became a turning point for Vandeweghe when she and Ashleigh Barty made a big surprise by winning their first Grand Slam title in doubles. On their way to the final, the pair won their matches in two sets, including notable wins over 3rd seeded Andrea Sestini Hlavackova and Barbora Strycova in the third round and top-seeded Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova. In the final, they defeated second-seeded Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic 3–6, 7–6, 7–6. Vandeweghe and Barty held three championship points in the third set before they converted it on a double fault from the serve of Mladenovic.

===2019: Rehab from injury and comeback===
At the beginning of 2019, Vandeweghe was forced to withdraw from several tournaments, including the Australian Open, due to injury. Shortly after, she published a video on her social profile accounts how serious her ankle injury was. The ankle injury had plagued her since Wimbledon 2018 and kept her out through the early hardcourt season, as well as the entire clay and grass court seasons, including the French Open and Wimbledon.

Vandeweghe made her return in the end of July at the [[2019 Silicon Valley Classic|Silicon Valley Classic]] in San Jose, where she was awarded a wild card. At this point, her singles ranking had dropped to 636 in the world, having not played a tournament in ten months. She defeated the young Czech [[Marie Bouzková]] in the first round to record her first match win since June 2018. Vandeweghe revealed after her comeback match that her ankle problem was diagnosed as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, a nervous disease in the system which occurs after an injury. Vandeweghe also added what she went through after the nerves had calmed down.<ref>{{cite web|title=CoCo Vandeweghe Serves Up Her Return: 'It was so sudden that I was absolutely in shock'|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/1446492/coco-vandeweghe-serves-up-her-return-it-was-so-sudden-that-i-was-absolutely-in-shock|website=WTA Tennis|accessdate=July 31, 2019}}</ref> She was defeated by second seed and world No. 10 [[Aryna Sabalenka]] in the second round.
