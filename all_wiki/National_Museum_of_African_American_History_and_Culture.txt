The '''National Museum of African American History and Culture''' ('''NMAAHC''') is a [[Smithsonian Institution]] museum located on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. It was established in December 2003 and opened its permanent home in September 2016 with a ceremony led by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]].

Early efforts to establish a federally owned museum featuring [[African-American]] history and culture can be traced to 1915, although the modern push for such an organization did not begin until the 1970s. After years of little success, a much more serious legislative push began in 1988 that led to authorization of the museum in 2003. A site was selected in 2006, and a design submitted by [[Phil Freelon|Freelon Group]]/[[David Adjaye|Adjaye Associates]]/[[Davis Brody Bond]] was chosen in 2009. Construction began in 2012 and the museum completed in 2016. 

The NMAAHC is the world's largest museum dedicated to African-American history and culture.<ref>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/10-destinations-to-visit-for-african-american-history-and-culture/</ref>  It ranked as the fourth most-visited Smithsonian museum in its first full year of operation. The museum has more than 40,000 objects in its collection, although only about 3,500 items are on display. The {{convert|350000|sqft|adj=on}}, 10 story building (five above and five below ground) and its exhibits have won critical praise.

==History==
===Early efforts===
The concept of a national museum dedicated to [[African-American history]] and culture can be traced back to the second decade of the 20th century. In 1915, African-American veterans of the [[Union Army]] met at the [[Nineteenth Street Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.)|Nineteenth Street Baptist Church]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/09/24/we-did-it-read-john-lewiss-emotional-speech-at-the-african-american-museum-opening/|title='We did it': Read John Lewis's emotional speech at the African American Museum opening|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=September 24, 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref> for a reunion and parade. Frustrated with the [[racial discrimination]] they still faced, the veterans formed a committee to build a memorial to various African-American achievements. Their efforts paid off in 1929, when President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed [[Mary Church Terrell]], [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], and 10 others to a commission charged with building a "National Memorial Building" showcasing African-American achievements in the arts and sciences. But Congress did not back the project, and private fundraising also failed. Although proposals for an African-American history and culture museum would be floated in Congress for the next 40 years, none gained more than minimal support.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkins|first=Robert L.|title=A Museum Much Delayed|work=The Washington Post|date=March 23, 2003|page=B8}}</ref>

Proposals for a museum began circulating again in Congress in the early 1970s. In 1981, Congress approved a federal charter for a [[National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center|National Afro-American Museum]] in [[Wilberforce, Ohio]]. The museum, built and funded with private money, opened in 1987. In the early 1980s, Tom Mack (the African-American chairman of [[Tourmobile]], a tourist bus company) founded the National Council of Education and Economic Development (NCEED). Mack's intention was to use the non-profit group to advance his ideas about economic development, education, and the arts in the black community. Emboldened by Congress's action in 1981, Mack began using the NCEED to press for a stand-alone African-American museum in D.C. in 1985.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=80}} Mack did not collaborate with other black-led cultural foundations that were working to improve the representation of African Americans by Smithsonian and other federal institutions.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|pages=80–81}} Mack contacted [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Mickey Leland]] about his idea for a national museum focusing on African Americans, and won his support for federal legislation in 1985. Leland sponsored a non-binding resolution (H.R. 666) advocating an African-American museum on the National Mall, which passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1986. The congressional attention motivated the Smithsonian to improve its presentation of African-American history. In 1987, the [[National Museum of American History]] sponsored a major exhibit, "Field to Factory," which focused on the [[Great Migration (African American)|black diaspora]] out of the [[Deep South]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Blakey|1994|pages=45–46}}

[[File:Mickey Leland.jpg|thumb|Rep. [[Mickey Leland]], an early supporter of federal legislation for a black history museum.]]
"Field to Factory" encouraged Mack to continue pursuing a museum. In 1987 and 1988, NCEED began lining up support among black members of Congress for legislation that would establish an independent African-American national history museum in Washington, D.C. But NCEED ran into opposition from the African American Museum Association (AAMA), an umbrella group that represented small local African-American [[African-American art|art]], cultural, and history museums across the United States.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=81}} [[John Kinard]], president of the AAMA and co-founder of the [[Anacostia Museum|Anacostia Community Museum]] (which became part of the Smithsonian in 1967), opposed NCEED's effort. Kinard argued that a national museum would consume donor dollars and out-bid local museums for artifacts and trained staff.  Kinard and the AAMA instead advocated that Congress establish a $50 million fund to create a national foundation to support local black history museums as a means of mitigating these problems.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=82}} Others, pointing to the Smithsonian's long history of discrimination against black employees,{{Efn|As late as 1989, the Smithsonian was still refusing to hire blacks for important jobs as curators, researchers, and restorers.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=8}}}} questioned whether the white-dominated Smithsonian could properly administer an African-American history museum.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Robinson|2001|page=179}}<ref name="TrescottSplendid">{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=A Splendid Setting For Black History|work=The Washington Post|date=April 13, 1997|page=G1}}</ref>{{Efn|A 1989 internal report by the Smithsonian's cultural equity committee released in January 1989 bluntly observed that the Smithsonian had a "shocking absence of minorities in senior-level administrative and professional positions."<ref name=swisherdebate />}} Lastly, many local African-American museums worried that they would be forced to become adjuncts of the proposed Smithsonian museum. These institutions had fought for decades for political, financial, and academic independence from white-dominated, sometimes racist local governments. Now they feared losing that hard-won independence.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=82}}

In 1988, Rep. [[John Lewis]] and Rep. Leland introduced legislation for a stand-alone African-American history museum within the Smithsonian Institution. But the bill faced significant opposition in Congress due to its cost. Supporters of the African-American museum tried to salvage the proposal by suggesting that the [[National Museum of the American Indian|Native Indian museum]] (then moving through Congress) and African-American museum share the same space. But the compromise did not work and the bill died.<ref name=swisherdebate>{{cite news|last=Swisher|first=Kara|title=Black-History Museum Plan Sparks Debate|work=The Washington Post|date=October 16, 1989|page=A1}}</ref>

[[File:Johnlewis.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rep. [[John Lewis]], who championed the legislation for the museum after Rep. Leland's  death in a plane crash in 1989]]
Lewis and Leland introduced another bill in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|last=Swisher|first=Kara|title=Black American Museum Urged|work=The Washington Post|date=March 27, 1989|page=C7}}</ref> Once more, cost considerations killed the bill. The Smithsonian Institution, however, was moving toward support for a museum. In 1988, an ad hoc group of African-American scholars—most from within the Smithsonian, but some from other museums as well—began debating what an African-American history museum might look like.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|pages=82–83}} While the group discussed the issue informally, Smithsonian Secretary [[Robert McCormick Adams, Jr.]]{{Efn|The Secretary is the highest-ranking official at the Smithsonian.{{sfn|Worth|2016|page=69}}}} publicly suggested in October 1989 that "just a wing" of the [[National Museum of American History]] should be devoted to black culture, a pronouncement that generated extensive controversy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Swisher|first=Kara|title=Black History Museum Plan Sparks Debate|work=The Washington Post|date=October 16, 1989|page=A1}}</ref> The discussions by the ad hoc group prompted the Smithsonian to take a more formal approach to the idea of an African-American heritage museum. In December 1989 the Smithsonian hired nationally respected museum administrator [[Claudine K. Brown|Claudine Brown]]{{Efn|Brown was assistant director for government and community relations at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in New York City.<ref name=weinraublaunches />}} to conduct a formal study of the museum issue.<ref name=weinraublaunches>{{cite news|last=Weinraub|first=Judith|title=Smithsonian Launches Mall Project|work=The Washington Post|date=December 12, 1989|page=DS1}}</ref>

Brown's group reported six months later that the Smithsonian should form a high-level advisory board to conduct a more thorough study of the issue. The Brown study was blunt in its discussion of the divisions within the African-American community about the advisability of a stand-alone national museum of African-American culture and history, but also forceful in its advocacy of a national museum of national prominence and national visibility with a broad mandate to document the vast sweep of the African-American experience in the United States. The study was also highly critical of the Smithsonian's ability to adequately represent African-American culture and history within an existing institution, and its willingness to appoint African-American staff to high-ranking positions within the museum.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=83}}

The Smithsonian formed a 22-member advisory board, chaired by [[Mary Schmidt Campbell]],{{Efn|At the time, Campbell was the commissioner of cultural affairs for New York City, and the highest-ranking African-American public arts administrator in the United States.<ref name=trescotttoward />}} in May 1990.<ref name=trescotttoward>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Toward a Black Museum|work=The Washington Post|date=May 8, 1990|page=B2}}</ref> The creation of the advisory board was an important step for the Smithsonian. There were many on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents who believed that "African-American culture and history" was indefinable and that not enough artifacts and art of national significance could be found to build a museum.{{sfn|Ruffins|1998|page=83}} On May 6, 1991, after a year of study, the advisory board issued a report in favor of a national museum, and the Smithsonian Board of Regents voted unanimously to support the idea. However, the proposal the regents adopted only called not for a stand-alone institution but a "museum" housed in the East Hall of the existing [[Arts and Industries Building]]. The regents also agreed to keep the Anacostia Community Museum a separate facility; to give the new museum its own governing board, independent of existing museums; and to support the proposal for a grant-making program to help local African-American museums build their collections and train their staff.<ref>{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Kim|title=Smithsonian Backs African American Museum|work=The Washington Post|date=May 7, 1991|page=E1}}</ref> The regents also approved a "collections identification project" to identify donors who might be willing to donate, sell, or loan their items to the proposed new Smithsonian museum.<ref name="MastersBabyStep">{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Kim|title=New Museum Takes a Baby Step|work=The Washington Post|date=September 23, 1991|page=C7}}</ref>

===1990s efforts===
The Smithsonian Board of Regents agreed in September 1991 to draft museum legislation,<ref name="MastersBabyStep" /> and submitted their bill to Congress in February 1992.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Regents Back Museum Plans|work=The Washington Post|date=February 4, 1992|page=D8}}</ref> The bill was criticized by Tom Mack and others for putting the museum in a building that was too small and old to properly house the intended collection,<ref>{{cite news|last=Brace|first=Eric|title=Senate Okays Museum Bill|work=The Washington Post|date=October 5, 1992|page=C7|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Key Smithsonian Projects Get Early Nod|work=The Washington Post|date=March 18, 1993|page=D4}}</ref> and despite winning approval in both House and [[United States Senate|Senate]] committees the bill died once more. In 1994, Senator [[Jesse Helms]] refused to allow the legislation to come to the Senate floor (voicing both fiscal and philosophical concerns) despite bipartisan support.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Project Passes Key Hurdle|work=The Washington Post|date=June 10, 1994|page=D2|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Helms Stalls New Museum|work=The Washington Post|date=September 29, 1994|page=D1|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Black Museum Loses Again|work=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1994|page=H2}}</ref>

In 1995, citing funding issues, the Smithsonian abandoned its support for a new museum and instead proposed a new Center for African American History and Culture within organization.<ref name=newsomenewname>{{cite news|last=Newsome|first=Steven|title=New Name, Same Mission|work=The Washington Post|date=August 13, 1995|page=G2}}</ref> The Smithsonian's new Secretary, [[Ira Michael Heyman]], openly questioned the need for "ethnic" museums on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=African American Museum Is Stalled|work=The Washington Post|date=July 30, 1995|page=G1}}</ref> Many, including Mary Campbell Schmidt, saw this as a step backward, a characterization Smithsonian officials strongly disputed.<ref name=newsomenewname /> To demonstrate its support for African-American history preservation, the Smithsonian held a fundraiser in March 1998 for the new center which raised $100,000.<ref name=robertsgala>{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Roxanne|title=Smithsonian Gala Is a Big Boost to Anacostia Museum|work=The Washington Post|date=March 2, 1998|page=C1}}</ref>{{Efn|The new center was housed at the Anacostia Community Museum.<ref name=robertsgala />}}

Heymann left the Smithsonian in January 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Heyman to Leave Smithsonian|work=The Washington Post|date=January 23, 1999|page=A1}}</ref> In the meantime, other cities moved forward with major new African-American museums.

===Passage of federal legislation===
In 2001, Lewis and Representative [[J. C. Watts]] re-introduced legislation for a museum in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Congressmen to Push Again For African American Museum|work=The Washington Post|date=May 2, 2001|page=C1}}</ref> Under the leadership of its new Secretary, [[Lawrence M. Small]], the Smithsonian Board of Regents reversed course yet again  in June 2001 and agreed to support a stand-alone National Museum of African American History and Culture.<ref name=trescottendorsed>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Black History Museum On Mall Is Endorsed|work=The Washington Post|date=June 26, 2001|page=C4}}</ref> The Smithsonian asked Congress to establish a federally funded study commission. Congress swiftly agreed, and on December 29, President [[George W. Bush]] signed legislation establishing a 23-member commission to study the need for a museum, how to raise the funds to build and support it, and where it should be located. At the signing ceremony, the president expressed his opinion that the museum should be located on the [[National Mall]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=African American Museum Idea Moves Ahead|work=The Washington Post|date=December 29, 2001|page=C1}}</ref>

The study commission's work took nearly two years, not the anticipated nine months. In November 2002, in anticipation of a positive outcome, the insurance company [[AFLAC]] donated $1 million to help build the museum.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=African American Museum Plan Given $1 Million Boost|work=The Washington Post|date=November 25, 2002|page=C1}}</ref> On April 3, 2003, the study commission released its final report. As expected, the commission said a museum was needed, and recommended an extremely high-level site: A plot of land adjacent to the [[Capitol Reflecting Pool]], bounded by Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues NW and 1st and 3rd Streets NW. The commission ruled out establishing the museum within the Arts & Industries Building, concluding renovations to the structure would be too costly. It considered a site just west of the National Museum of American History and a site on the southwest Washington waterfront, but rejected both.<ref name=trescottsite>{{cite news|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|title=Capitol Site Favored for Black History Museum|work=The Washington Post|date=November 25, 2002|page=C1}}</ref> The commission considered whether the museum should have an independent board of trustees (similar to that of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]) or a board answerable both to the Smithsonian and independent trustees (similar to that of the [[National Gallery of Art]]), but rejected these approaches in favor of a board appointed by and answerable only to the Smithsonian Board of Regents.<ref>{{cite report|author=National Museum of African American History and Culture Plan for Action Presidential Commission|title=The Time Has Come: Report to the President and to the Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|date=April 2, 2003|pages=105–110|url=http://nmaahceis.si.edu/documents/The_Time_Has_Come.pdf|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> The commission proposed a 350,000 square-foot museum that would cost $360 million to build. Half the construction funds would come from private money, half from the federal government. Legislation to implement the commission's report was sponsored in the Senate by [[Sam Brownback]] and in the house by John Lewis.<ref name=trescottsite />

As Congress considered the legislation, the museum's location became the major sticking point. Various members of the public, Congress, and advocacy groups felt the Capitol Hill site was too prominent and made the National Mall look crowded.  Alternative proposed sites included the Liberty Loan Federal Building at 401 14th Street SW and [[Benjamin Banneker Circle|Benjamin Banneker Park]] at the southern end of [[L'Enfant Plaza|L'Enfant Promenade]]. This controversy threatened to kill the legislation. To save the bill, backers of the museum said in mid-November 2003 that they would abandon their push for the Capitol Hill site.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reel|first=Monte|title=Preservation Law Puts Leash on Mall Projects|work=The Washington Post|date=November 20, 2003|page=T10}}</ref> The compromise saved the legislation: The House passed the "National Museum of African American History and Culture Act" ({{USPL|108|184}}) on November 19, and the Senate followed suit two days later. President [[George W. Bush]] signed the bill into law on December 16.<ref name="Act">{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ184/pdf/PLAW-108publ184.pdf|title=National Museum of African American History and Culture Act.

The legislation established a committee to select a site, and required it to report its recommendation within 12 months. The site selection committee was limited to studying four sites: The site just west of the National Museum of American History, the Liberty Loan Federal Building site, Banneker Park, and the Arts and Industries Building.<ref name="Act" />

On February 8, 2005, with the site selection committee still deliberating, President Bush again endorsed placing the museum on the National Mall.<ref>{{cite news |last=Trescott |first=Jacqueline |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9166-2005Feb8.html |title=Bush Backs Mall Site For African American Museum |work=The Washington Post |date=February 9, 2005 |page=C1}}</ref>

The site selection committee did not issue its recommendation until January 31, 2006—a full 13 months late. It recommended the site west of the National Museum of American History. The area was part of the [[Washington Monument]] grounds, but had been set aside for a museum or other building in the [[L'Enfant Plan]] of 1791 and the [[McMillan Plan]] of 1902. The [[United States Department of State]] originally planned to build its headquarters there in the early 20th century, and the [[National World War II Memorial|National World War II Memorial Advisory Board]] had considered the parcel in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |last=Trescott |first=Jacqueline |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/30/AR2006013001562.html |title=Mall Site Is Chosen for Black History Museum |work=The Washington Post |date=January 31, 2005 |page=A1}}</ref> On March 15, 2005, the Smithsonian named Dr. [[Lonnie G.

The National Museum of African American History and Culture Council (the museum's board of trustees) sponsored a competition in 2008 to design a {{convert|350000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building with three stories below-ground and five stories above-ground. The building was limited to the {{convert|5|acre|m2|adj=on}} site chosen by the site selection committee, had to be [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Gold]] certified, and had to meet stringent federal security standards. The cost of construction was limited to $500 million (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|500000000|2008}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref>{{cite news |last=Trescott |first=Jacqueline |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071002623.html |title=Designer Sought for African American Museum |work=The Washington Post |date=July 11, 2008 |page=C3}}</ref> The competition criteria specified that the winning design had to respect the history and views of the Washington Monument as well as demonstrate an understanding of the African-American experience. The winning design was required to reflect optimism, spirituality, and joy, but also acknowledge and incorporate "the dark corners" of the African-American experience. The museum design was required to function as a museum, but also be able to host cultural events of various kinds.<ref>{{cite news |last=Trescott |first=Jacqueline |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032703481.html |title=Architectural Firms Compete to Design African American History Museum |work=The Washington Post |date=March 28, 2009 |page=C1}}</ref> Hundreds of architects and firms were invited to participate in the design competition.

Under federal law, the [[National Capital Planning Commission]], the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], and the D.C. Historic Preservation Commission all have review and approval rights over construction in the metropolitan D.C. area. As the design went through these agencies for approval, it was slightly revised. The building was moved toward the southern boundary of its plot of land, to give a better view of the Washington Monument from [[Constitution Avenue]]. The size of the upper floors were shrunk by 17 percent. Although three upper floors were permitted (instead of just two), the ceiling height of each floor was lowered so that the overall height of the building was lowered. The large, box-like first floor was largely eliminated. Added to the entrance on Constitution Avenue were a pond, garden, and bridge, so that visitors would have to "cross over the water" like slaves did when they came to America.<ref>{{cite news |last=Trescott |first=Jacqueline |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090204955.html |title=African American Museum's revised design gets favorable reviews by NCPC |work=The Washington Post |date=September 3, 2010 |page=C2}}</ref>

===Building design changes===
[[File:Interior of the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) looking south.jpg|thumb|The facade's 'scrim' viewed from the entrance lobby.]]
The design of the architectural scrim which surrounds the building was changed in September 2012.  The proposed building itself was a box-like structure. The three-part corona of the building's design was created by a structure only minimally attached to the building. The exterior of this structure, whose frames lean outward to create the corona, consisted of a thin screen or "scrim" perforated by geometrical patterns based on historic iron grilles found in African-American communities in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].{{sfn|Rybczynski|2013|page=176}} The original design proposed that the scrim be made of bronze, which would have made the museum the only one on the National Mall whose exterior was not made of limestone or marble. Cost issues forced the architects to change this to bronze-painted [[aluminum]] in September 2012. The change was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, but the commissioners criticized the change for lacking the warm, reflective qualities of bronze.{{sfn|Rybczynski|2013|page=177}} Noted architect [[Witold Rybczynski]] also criticized the change: "The appeal of bronze is its warm golden sheen and the rich patina that it acquires over time, but uniformly painted surfaces lack these attributes, and over time they don't age, they merely flake. ... At the time of this writing, the African American museum risks compromising its original intention.  In architecture, beauty sometimes really is only skin-deep."{{sfn|Rybczynski|2013|page=177}}

The Smithsonian then radically changed the landscaping of the under-construction museum in summer 2013. The original design for the museum planned a wetland with flowing creek, bridges, and native plants in this area. But cost considerations led the agency to completely eliminate it. At first, the Smithsonian proposed a low hedge. It brought this design to the Commission of Fine Arts in April 2013, which rejected it.  The Commission expressed "great concern about the possible loss of the symbolic meaning that had been skillfully woven into the design of both the landscape and the building". In July, the Smithsonian replaced the hedge with a low dull black granite wall.  The Commission of Fine Arts approved that redesign, and the Smithsonian brought it to the National Capital Planning Commission.  As of August 2013, the NCPC was anticipated to approve it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2013/08/value-engineering-costs-new.html |last=Neibauer |first=Michael |title='Value Engineering' Costs New Smithsonian Museum a Key Water Feature |work=Washington Business Journal |date=August 20, 2013 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

Debate over the corona's finish continued into 2014 before being resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts repeatedly urged the architects to use bronze for the scrim, as it created a "shimmering, lustrous effect under many lighting conditions" and "conveyed dignity, permanence and beauty".<ref name="Neibbronze">{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2014/02/fake-tan-how-the-smithsonian-will.html |last=Neibauer |first=Michael |title=How the Smithsonian Will Bronze Its Newest Museum, Without Using Real Bronze |work=Washington Business Journal |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref> Duranar paint was the first substitute proposed by the architects, but the commission members rejected it, noting that it had a "putty-like appearance under overcast conditions" and visually fell "far short of the beautiful poetic intention promised by the concept design".<ref name="Neibbronze" /> A second finish, the sprayable metal LuminOre, was rejected by the commission because it was difficult to produce in the high quality needed, and was prone to flaking and discoloration.<ref name="Neibbronze" /> [[Electroless nickel plating|Electroless plating]] and [[Anodizing#Anodized aluminum|anodized aluminum]] were rejected because they lacked durability. A [[physical vapor deposition]] process involving a [[nickel]]-[[Chromium|chrome]] plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth. In early 2014, tests were made with [[Polyvinylidene fluoride|polyvinyl difluoride]] (PVDF). This coating was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts on February 20, 2014,<ref name="Neibbronze" /> and by the National Capital Planning Commission in April 2014.<ref>{{cite report |author=National Capital Planning Commission |title=Delegated Action of the Executive Director: Façade Color and Finish, National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Clark Construction Group, Smoot Construction, and H.J. Russell & Company won the contract to build the museum. The architectural firm of [[McKissack & McKissack]] (which was the first African American-owned architectural firm in the United States) provided project management services on behalf of the Smithsonian, and acted as liaison between the Smithsonian and [[Public utility|public utilities]] and D.C. government agencies.<ref name="SernovitzBuild">{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2013/12/behind-the-fences-of-the-smithsonians.html |last=Sernovita |first=Daniel J. |title=Behind the Fences of the Smithsonian's African American Museum |work=Washington Business Journal |date=December 26, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> Guy Nordenson and Associates and Robert Silman Associates were the structural engineers for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11964-national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture|last=Minutillo|first=Josephine|title=National Museum of African American History and Culture|website=Architectural Record|date=November 1, 2016|accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Construction of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.JPG|thumb|right|Construction in September 2015]]
The NAAMHC became the deepest museum on the National Mall. Excavators dug {{convert|80|ft|m}} below grade to lay the foundations, although the building itself will be only {{convert|70|ft|m}} deep. The museum is located at a low point on the Mall, and groundwater puts {{convert|27.78|psi}} on the walls. To compensate, {{convert|85|USgal|L}} per minute of water were pumped out every day during construction of the foundation and below-grade walls, and a [[slurry]] of cement and sand injected into forms to stabilize the site. Lasers continually monitored the walls during construction for any signs of bulging or movement.<ref name="SernovitzBuild" />

The first concrete for the foundations was poured in November 2012.<ref name=sinhatrek>{{cite news |last=Sinha |first=Vandana |title=Lonnie Bunch's 10-year trek to showcase African-American history |work=Washington Business Journal |date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2016/02/knight-at-the-museum-lonnie-bunchs-10-year-trek-to.html}}</ref> As the lower levels were completed, cranes installed a segregated railroad passenger car and a guard tower from the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] on November 17, 2013. These items were so large that they could not be dismantled and installed at a later date. Instead, the museum had to be built around them.<ref name=sinhatrek /> By late December 2013, construction was just weeks from finishing the five basement levels, and above-ground work was scheduled to begin in late January 2014. At that time, the Smithsonian estimated the museum would be finished in November 2015.<ref name="SernovitzBuild" />

Guy Nordenson and Associates were the engineers for the superstructure of the museum building and long-span porch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2016/9/19/12947604/national-museum-african-american-history-culture|title=Darkness and light: A bold new museum helps tell multifaceted African-American story|last=Lange|first=Alexandra|date=September 19, 2016|website=Curbed|accessdate=January 8, 2019}}</ref> Robert Silman Associates oversaw the engineering of the below-grade structure and exhibit structural support. The steel was fabricated by SteelFab, Inc. While the below-grade floors were made of reinforced concrete, with columns supporting each floor above, the above-grade floors were primarily exhibit space and needed to be kept column-free. To support the upper floors, four massive walls, consisting of steel frames and cast-in-place concrete infill, were constructed. Design and fabrication of the steel members of the above-ground structure required extreme precision, as the steel elements penetrated one another at more than 500 places and some beams had several hundred bolt-holes in them. All structural steel elements also had to work almost perfectly with the [[rebar]] and [[Mechanical connections|rebar couplers]] so that elements would not run into one another and yet maintain structural integrity. A system of girders around the fifth above-ground floor supported the corona. Some of these girders were so complex they required more than 180 parts. The {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} long-span [[porch]] that covers the main entrance was built of long [[Girder|plate girders]] and box columns (also made of plate).

The entire steel superstructure and all above-ground concrete pouring was complete in January 2015. Glass for the windows and [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] began to be placed that same month, with glass enclosure of the building complete on April 14, 2015.

NMAAHC officials said that construction scaffolding around the exterior of the building should come down in April 2016, at which time some of the more dust-and-humidity resistant artifacts and displays could be installed. Installation of more delicate items would wait until the building's environmental controls had stabilized the interior humidity and removed most of the dust from the air. The museum identified 3,000 items in its collections which would form 11 initial exhibits. More than 130 video and audio installations would be installed as part of these exhibits.<ref name=mcgloneeight />

In January 2016, the museum announced the receipt of a $10 million gift from David Rubenstein, CEO of [[The Carlyle Group]] and a Smithsonian regent,<ref>{{cite news |last=McGlone |first=Peggy |title=Smithsonian donor David Rubenstein gives $10 million to African American museum |work=The Washington Post |date=January 20, 2016 |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/01/20/smithsonian-donor-david-rubenstein-gives-10-million-to-african-american-museum/}}</ref> as well as a $1 million donation from [[Wells Fargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Wells Fargo Donates Visual Art and $1 Million to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture |website=Smithsonian Institution |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/wells-fargo-donates-visual-art-and-1-million-smithsonian-s-national-museum-african-american}}</ref> As of January 30, 2016, the museum still needed to raise $40 million toward its $270 million construction goal.<ref name=mcgloneeight />

==Attendance and timed-entry ticketing==
More than 600,000 people visited the museum in its first three months. The Smithsonian required all visitors to have a ticket to access the museum. At first, the organization used pre-purchased timed-entry tickets, combined with a limited number of same-day tickets released every morning.  The timed-entry tickets allowed visitors to enter at a specific time of day, with a shorter wait in line than would be expected if everyone showed up at the same time.  Patron traffic proved so heavy that the NMAAHC began offering many fewer same-day tickets, and changed their release from early morning to early afternoon. As of mid-December 2016, the pre-purchased tickets were sold out through the end of March 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freed|first=Benjamin|title=More Than 600,000 People Have Already Visited the Smithsonian's African American History Museum|work=Washingtonian|date=December 13, 2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/13/more-than-600000-people-have-already-visited-the-smithsonians-african-american-history-musuem/}}</ref>{{Efn|Comparisons with other museums is difficult as they may be different in size, or designed for patrons to linger longer (thus slowing the entry of new visitors).

Visitors stood in line in the museum foyer to take an elevator down to the underground level. The exhibits start with the Middle Passage and slavery where the hallway is intentionally designed to be cramped and somewhat claustrophobic. The large number of visitors who stop to read the exhibit's signs caused dangerous overcrowding. Museum officials began to limit the number of people who could take the elevator (and thus enter the exhibit) to mitigate this problem, although this led to still longer lines in the foyer.<ref name=mcglonecrowds />

Smithsonian officials announced that the museum had 3 million visitors in its first full year of operation.

Beginning January 1, 2019, the NMAAHC implemented a new entry policy. From September 1 to February 28, no timed-entry tickets would be required on weekdays, although they still were needed on weekends. The rest of the year, which is the height of the tourist season, timed-entry tickets will be required all days of the week for entry before 1 PM.

In January 2012, the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Museum of American History partnered with the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]] (which owns Jefferson's home, [[Monticello]]) to create a major new exhibit, "Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: Paradox of Liberty."

"Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello" also received attention for the striking statue of Jefferson that graced the exhibit entrance. The Smithsonian used a [[Konica Minolta|Minolta]] [[3D scanner]] to create a digital image of a life-size bronze statue of Jefferson which is located at Monticello. RedEye on Demand (a subsidiary of [[Stratasys]]) used a [[fused deposition modeling]] printer, which laid down tiny layers of molten plastic to slowly build the statue. The statue was "printed" in four sections, which were then put together, detailed, and painted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/02/smithsonian-3d-technology-.html|last=Ng|first=David|title=Smithsonian Embracing Digital 3-D Technology|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 3, 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-57384166-52/smithsonian-turns-to-3d-to-bring-collection-to-the-world/|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel|title=Smithsonian Turns to 3D to Bring Collection to the World|work=CNET.com|date=February 24, 2012|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> Smithsonian officials were so pleased with the process that they began laying plans use it to laser image and 3D print a vast number of items in their collection, which they could then share inexpensively with the rest of the world.<ref name="UPI3D" />

Dozens of permanent curatorial staff and temporary contractors [[Accession number (library science)|accessed]] the items, repaired them, and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conserved them]] in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment.

Display cases for each item were also purchased, and exhibiting mounts or specially designed cases handcrafted for particularly fragile, important, or unusually sized objects. Museum officials said all artifacts and displays will be moved into the new museum in the summer of 2016, along with the museum's 175 full-time employees.<ref name=mcgloneeight />

==Reception==
In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', art critic [[Holland Cotter]] wrote, "The extremely complex narrative, with uplift and tragedy seemingly on a fixed collision course, spreads over five floors of galleries", and that it "holds some of the oldest and most disturbing material." Cotter added that "It's great that the museum mixes everything together: It means you can't just select a comfortable version of history." He concluded, "[I] hope, actually — that the museum will never be finished, or consider itself so; that its take on African-American history, which is American history, stays fluid, critical and richly confused: real, in other words."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/design/smithsonian-african-american-museum-review.html |title=Review: The Smithsonian African American Museum Is Here at Last.

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'''s critic at large, [[Edward Rothstein]], suggested that "even a full day's visit is insufficient for a careful survey. That alone is an imposing achievement". Rothstein wrote that the "museum is illuminating, disturbing, moving—and flawed". He wrote that we "see the evolution of African-American newspapers, businesses, churches and other institutions. Galleries devoted to music and sports make it plain how much African-American history and culture is simply American history and culture." He also wrote that there is a "reluctance, too, to cast doubt on one perspective or another, or to give a nuanced assessment of conflicts. The actual doctrines of [[Elijah Muhammad]], a leader of the [[Nation of Islam]] and mentor to [[Malcolm X]], are unmentioned. And, more troubling, the [[Black Panthers]] are characterized as if they were defensively armed social workers, a PC view of radicalism that recurs in other contexts.".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture-review-a-moving-but-flawed-accounting-of-history-1473893066 |title=National Museum of African American History and Culture Review: A Moving but Flawed Accounting of History |first=Edward |last=Rothstein |authorlink=Edward Rothstein |date=September 14, 2016 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=November 6, 2016 }}</ref> Museum reviewer [[Diana Muir]], while criticizing the Museum for repeatedly misleading visitors by failing to put facts in "comparative perspective" a deficiency that "misleads curators into making sweeping claims like the assertion in the introductory room that before 1400 "slavery was a temporary status," nevertheless concluded that "Taken as a whole, however, the NMAAHC shows that it is possible to do an identity museum well, to build a museum on a foundation of rigorous scholarship that can inform, excite, and even inspire."<ref name="MuseumTime">{{cite news|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Diana Muir|title=Museum Time|url=http://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/history/museum-time|accessdate=27 March 2017|publisher=The New Rambler|date=27 March 2017}}</ref>

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne wrote that the museum is the "most impressive and ambitious public building to go up in Washington in a generation" and that despite "some flaws and unfortunate signs of cost-cutting, the design succeeds almost precisely to the degree that it is enigmatic and even fickle, spanning huge gulfs in the national character without being naive enough to try to close them.

In ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', Susan Glaser wrote that the museum "is really two museums in one: Its historical exhibits encompasses about 60 percent of the gallery space, while cultural exhibits take up the other 40 percent." She wrote that the museum is "filled with difficult truths", such as a "statue of [[Thomas Jefferson]], author of the words 'All Men Are Created Equal,' who is depicted in front of a brick wall – and on every brick, the name of one of his 609 slaves, including at least six who were his own children." But she wrote that "[i]t was the coffin of [[Emmett Till]] that finally got to me." She describes 14-year-old Till, who was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] for allegedly whistling at a white woman: "Though his body was severely disfigured, his mother insisted on an open casket at his funeral, hoping to show the world the effects of racial injustice. It helped ignite the civil rights movement."<ref name=Glaser>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/travel/index.ssf/2016/11/inside_the_smithsonians_new_af.html |title=Inside the Smithsonian's New African American Museum |first=Susan |last=Glaser |date=November 6, 2016 |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |accessdate=November 6, 2016 }}</ref>

Because of its lengthy name and the unpronounceable acronym NMAAHC derived from it,<ref name="Hawthorne"/> a few journalists, following the trend established on social media, used the nickname "the Blacksonian" for the museum, based on its content and its relationship to the Smithsonian.<ref>{{cite news | work = The New York Times| accessdate = December 25, 2016 | date= October 6, 2016 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/podcasts/our-journey-to-the-blacksonian.html | title = Our Journey to the 'Blacksonian' | first1=Wesley | last1=Morris | authorlink1=Wesley Morris | first2= Jenna | last2= Wortham | authorlink2=Jenna Wortham }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | work= New Haven Independent | accessdate = December 26, 2016 | date = October 20, 2016 | url = http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/blacksonian_/ | title = The 'Blacksonian': A Way Out Of No Way | first= Markeshia | last= Ricks}}</ref>

''The Washington Post'' architectural critic Philip Kennicott assessed the museum as its one-year anniversary, concluding that the NMAAHC has "changed the center of gravity on the Mall" and created "energy along 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW that feels new, and welcome". Generally effusive in his praise, Kennicott found the museum to have an "allusive and mediated" feel, as opposed to the traditional "magisterial and transparent" aesthetic of most museums. He singled out the way the cornona cast shadows in the interior, the dramatic way the corona framed nearby monuments and memorials, and the museum's art gallery. Kennicott was unhappy with "the jumble of elevations throughout the history galleries". The problem particularly affected the Contemplative Court (where corrosion was also affecting the ceiling less than a year later). Museum designers correctly concluded that the cramped entrance to the underground galleries would create a powerful and negative emotional reaction, he said, but the side-effect has been to create a "fundamental flaw" in the museum by creating a terrific bottleneck in visitor traffic.<ref name=kennicottoneyear />  A 2018 exhibition review in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' noted the museum is practically — and unexpectedly to the museum's planners — "one of the toughest tickets to get in American culture" and posited that this was "proof that the nation wanted desperately to grapple with some of the thorniest questions about the people it brought here by force".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-ae-watching-oprah-african-american-museum-0722-story.html |title=Smithsonian's 'Watching Oprah' a powerful reminder of why we miss her |last=Johnson |first=Steve |work=Chicago Tribune |date=July 20, 2018 |access-date=2018-07-22 |language=en-US}}</ref>
== Controversies ==
In mid-July 2020, the museum removed a controversial chart from their website that was entitled "Aspects and Assumptions of Whiteness & White Culture in the United States" and had been put up on March 31.<ref name=mcglone>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/african-american-museum-site-removes-whiteness-chart-after-criticism-from-trump-jr-and-conservative-media/2020/07/17/4ef6e6f2-c831-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html |author=Peggu McGlone| title=African American Museum site removes 'whiteness' chart after criticism from Trump Jr. and conservative media |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 17, 2020 |accessdate=August 4, 2020}}</ref> Some examples that were claimed to be [[Whiteness theory|part of white culture]] were: objectivity; rational, linear thinking; emphasis on the scientific method; hard work being the key to success; delayed gratification; the nuclear family — father, mother, 2.3 children is the ideal social unit; self-reliance and being polite.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Marina |first1=Watts |title=In Smithsonian Race Guidelines, Rational Thinking and Hard Work Are White Values |url=https://www.newsweek.com/smithsonian-race-guidelines-rational-thinking-hard-work-are-white-values-1518333 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 July 2020}}</ref><ref name=mcglone/> After criticism, museum officials removed the chart explaining that it did not contribute to the discussion as planned and apologized.<ref name=mcglone/>
