On March 13, 2006, Lamont announced his campaign for the U.S. Senate against incumbent [[Joe Lieberman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/04/06/lamont-courts-local-voters/|title=Lamont courts local voters|first=Melina|last=Cordero|date=April 6, 2006|accessdate=February 8, 2013|work=[[Yale Daily News]]}}</ref>

On July 6, Lamont faced off against Lieberman in a televised debate that covered issues such as the [[Iraq War]], energy policy, and [[immigration]]. During the debate, Lieberman argued he was being subjected to a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] on the war, insisted he was a "bread-and-butter Democrat," and on many occasions asked, "who is Ned Lamont?" Lieberman then asked Lamont if he would release his [[income tax]] returns, which he did afterwards.<ref name=NBCFaceOff>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc30.com/politics/9481028/detail.html|title=Lieberman, Lamont Face Off In NBC 30 Debate|work=[[WVIT]]|date=July 6, 2006|accessdate=August 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225190159/http://www.nbc30.com/politics/9481028/detail.html|archivedate=December 25, 2007}}</ref>

Lamont focused on Lieberman's supportive relationship with Republicans, telling him "if you won't challenge [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and his failed agenda, I will." He criticized Lieberman's vote for the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], which he dubbed the "Bush-[[Dick Cheney|Cheney]]-Lieberman energy bill." In response to the assertion that he supported Republican policies, Lieberman stated he had voted with [[Senate Democratic Caucus|Senate Democrats]] 90% of the time. Lamont argued the three-term incumbent lacked the courage to challenge the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] on the Iraq War.<ref name="NBCFaceOff"/> He also criticized Lieberman for supporting federal intervention in the [[Terri Schiavo case]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/2549/why_ned_lamont_is_a_democrat|title=Why Ned Lamont is a Democrat|date=March 21, 2006|last=Seder|first=Sam|accessdate=August 15, 2018|work=In These Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/ned-lamont-the-truthdig-interview/|title=Ned Lamont: The Truthdig Interview|last=Golson|first=Blair|date=April 26, 2006|accessdate=August 15, 2018|work=TruthDig}}</ref>
