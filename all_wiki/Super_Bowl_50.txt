'''Super Bowl 50''' was an [[American football]] game to determine the champion of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]]. The [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) champion [[2015 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] defeated the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) champion [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], 24–10. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at [[Levi's Stadium]] in [[Santa Clara, California]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. As this was the 50th Super Bowl game, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with [[Roman numerals]] (under which the game would have been known as "'''Super Bowl L'''"), so the logo could prominently feature the [[Arabic numerals]] 5 and 0.<ref name="ESPN20140604">{{cite news|last=Rovell|first=Darren|title=NFL: It's Super Bowl 50, not L|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11031941/nfl-take-one-year-hiatus-roman-numerals-super-bowl-50|publisher=ESPN|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604184545/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11031941/nfl-take-one-year-hiatus-roman-numerals-super-bowl-50|archivedate=June 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Rosenthal">{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|title=NFL won't use Roman numerals for Super Bowl 50|url=https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-won-t-use-roman-numerals-for-super-bowl-50-0ap2000000355943|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=June 4, 2014|access-date=June 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the league's top offense, and quarterback [[Cam Newton]] was named the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player]] (MVP). They defeated the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] 49–15 in the [[NFC Championship Game]] and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise began playing in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, bolstered by having the league's top defense. The Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[2015 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] 20–18 in the [[AFC Championship Game]] joining the [[New England Patriots|Patriots]], [[Dallas Cowboys]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] as one of four teams that have made [[List of Super Bowl records#Games, victories, defeats|eight appearances in the Super Bowl]].

Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]]. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.

The Panthers' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback and regular season MVP [[Cam Newton]] had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards, while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best [[Passer rating|quarterback rating]] of 99.4. Newton's leading receivers were tight end [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]], who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver [[Ted Ginn Jr.]], who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers included veteran [[Jerricho Cotchery]] (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie [[Devin Funchess]] (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year receiver [[Corey Brown (American football)|Corey Brown]] (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers' backfield featured Pro Bowl running back [[Jonathan Stewart]], who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback [[Mike Tolbert]], who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center [[Ryan Kalil]] and guard [[Trai Turner]].

The Panthers' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle [[Kawann Short]] led the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman [[Mario Addison]] added {{frac|6|1|2}} sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive end [[Jared Allen]], a five-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end [[Kony Ealy]], who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers' three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: [[Thomas Davis (American football)|Thomas Davis]] and [[Luke Kuechly]]. Davis compiled {{frac|5|1|2}} sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety [[Kurt Coleman]], who led the team with a career-high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback [[Josh Norman (cornerback)|Josh Norman]], who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.

====Denver Broncos====
{{main|2015 Denver Broncos season}}
After losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos' general manager [[John Elway]] made numerous [[2015 Denver Broncos season#Coaching changes|coaching changes]], including a mutual parting with [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]] John Fox, who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by [[Gary Kubiak]], Elway's former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator. [[Wade Phillips]], a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding [[Jack Del Rio]] who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the [[Oakland Raiders]]. The team's 43–8 loss in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] two years earlier, despite holding the regular season's top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end [[DeMarcus Ware]], cornerback [[Aqib Talib]], safety [[T. J. Ward]], and wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] for the 2014 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-super-bowl-john-fox-broncos-haugh-spt-0209-20160208-column.html|title=John Fox's role on Broncos not forgotten, but much about Super Bowl will be|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=February 9, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209060205/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-super-bowl-john-fox-broncos-haugh-spt-0209-20160208-column.html|archivedate=February 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name="si.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/02/09/super-bowl-50-denver-broncos-von-miller-peyton-manning-gary-kubiak-john-elway-wade-phillips|title=Wild Ride: Tale of Super Bowl 50 champs Broncos|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211212729/https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/02/09/super-bowl-50-denver-broncos-von-miller-peyton-manning-gary-kubiak-john-elway-wade-phillips|archivedate=February 11, 2018}}</ref>

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with [[zone blocking]] to blend in with quarterback [[Peyton Manning]]'s shotgun passing style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as the aging and injured Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in {{nfly|1998}}. In addition to turning 39 in the 2015 offseason, Manning suffered a [[plantar fasciitis]] injury in his [[heel]] during the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13734150/denver-broncos-qb-peyton-manning-defies-weakening-body-best-brain-nfl|title=Denver Broncos QB Peyton Manning defies weakening body with best brain in NFL|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=January 28, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122105823/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13734150/denver-broncos-qb-peyton-manning-defies-weakening-body-best-brain-nfl|archivedate=January 22, 2016}}</ref> Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fascia in his left foot. He set the [[List of National Football League passing yards leaders|NFL's all-time record for career passing yards]] in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in favor of backup quarterback [[Brock Osweiler]], who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver's final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to Manning's return. Manning reclaimed the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paige|first=Woody|authorlink=Woody Paige|title=Paige: Peyton Manning is back, and so are the Broncos|url=http://www.denverpost.com/paige/ci_29339707/paige-peyton-manning-is-back-and-so-are-broncos|accessdate=January 30, 2016|work=[[The Denver Post]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|date=January 3, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126183710/http://www.denverpost.com/paige/ci_29339707/paige-peyton-manning-is-back-and-so-are-broncos|archivedate=January 26, 2016}}</ref> Under defensive coordinator [[Wade Phillips]], who replaced his predecessor's complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple aggressive approach of attacking the ball,<ref name="si.com"/> the Broncos' defense ranked No. 1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and [[Quarterback sack|sack]]s, and like the previous three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.

Manning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards and put up a better TD:INT ratio (10 touchdowns to six interceptions) for a higher rating of 86.4, but remained benched during the postseason in favor of Manning. Veteran receiver [[Demaryius Thomas]] led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while [[Emmanuel Sanders]] caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight end [[Owen Daniels]] was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards.  Midway through the season, Denver acquired veteran tight end [[Vernon Davis]], who finished the year with 38 receptions for 395 yards. Running back [[C. J. Anderson]] was the team's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running back [[Ronnie Hillman]] also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.

The Broncos' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends [[Derek Wolfe]] and [[Malik Jackson (defensive lineman)|Malik Jackson]] each had {{frac|5|1|2}} sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker [[Von Miller]] led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker [[DeMarcus Ware]] was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career, ranking second on the team with {{frac|7|1|2}} sacks. Linebacker [[Brandon Marshall (linebacker)|Brandon Marshall]] led the team in total tackles with 109, while [[Danny Trevathan]] ranked second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks [[Aqib Talib]] (three interceptions) and [[Chris Harris Jr.]] (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.

===Playoffs===
{{main|2015–16 NFL playoffs}}
The Panthers defeated the [[2015 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] 31–24 in the NFC divisional round. The Panthers then defeated the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] in the [[NFC Championship Game]] 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.

The Broncos defeated the [[2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] 23–16 in the AFC divisional round, by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. The next week, they defeated the defending [[Super Bowl XLIX]] champion [[2015 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the [[AFC Championship Game]] 20–18, by intercepting a pass on a New England 2-point conversion attempt that followed a Gronkowski touchdown reception with 17 seconds left on the clock. The Broncos recovered the subsequent onside kick attempt ensuring victory.

Carolina suffered a major setback when [[Thomas Davis (American football)|Thomas Davis]], an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game.

Concerns were raised over whether Levi's Stadium's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under [[Baltimore Ravens]] kicker [[Justin Tucker]], causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and [[Atlanta Braves]] field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in "great shape" for the game.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cull|first1=Ian|title=More Levi's Stadium Turf Concerns After Ravens Kicker Slips During Field Goal Attempt|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/More-Levis-Stadium-Turf-Concerns-After-Ravens-Kicker-Slips-During-Field-Goal-Attempt-334369851.html|website=[[KNTV|NBC Bay Area]]|publisher=NBCUniversal Media|accessdate=October 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022184245/http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/More-Levis-Stadium-Turf-Concerns-After-Ravens-Kicker-Slips-During-Field-Goal-Attempt-334369851.html|archivedate=October 22, 2015}}</ref><ref name="wpost-turf">{{cite news|title=Super Bowl: NFL says sinkhole field that nearly swallowed Ravens kicker will be fine|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/02/02/nfl-vows-sinkhole-field-at-levis-stadium-will-be-super-bowl-worthy/|accessdate=February 2, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=February 2, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202122957/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2016/02/02/nfl-vows-sinkhole-field-at-levis-stadium-will-be-super-bowl-worthy/|archivedate=February 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name="mercury-superbowlsod">{{cite news|title=Super Bowl sod going down at Levi's Stadium|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_29371198/super-bowl-sod-going-down-at-levis-stadium|accessdate=February 2, 2016|work=San Jose Mercury-News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309033839/http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_29371198/super-bowl-sod-going-down-at-levis-stadium|archivedate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Super Bowl 50 turf wreaking havoc on slipping players|url=https://nypost.com/2016/02/07/super-bowl-50-turf-wreaking-havoc-on-slipping-players/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=February 8, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208023104/http://nypost.com/2016/02/07/super-bowl-50-turf-wreaking-havoc-on-slipping-players/|archivedate=February 8, 2016}}</ref>

====Marketing====

On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with [[Arabic numerals]] as "Super Bowl 50"—rather than with [[Roman numerals]], a practice established at [[Super Bowl V]] under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L".<ref name="ESPN20140604" /><ref name="Rosenthal" /> NFL creative director Shandon Melvin, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter "L" using the standardized logo template introduced at [[Super Bowl XLV]]. He noted that "L" was harder to design around as it is [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]] unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter "L" could be interpreted as the [[Loser (hand gesture)|"loser" hand gesture]]. 73 mockups, incorporating either "L" or "50", were designed before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in gold behind the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.<ref name="ESPN20140604"/><ref name="sjmn-50logo">{{cite news|title=Super Bowl 50: NFL gets the L out of Roman numerals, but just for this year's game|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_29431953/super-bowl-50-nfl-gets-l-out-roman|accessdate=February 21, 2016|work=San Jose Mercury-News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209204041/http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_29431953/super-bowl-50-nfl-gets-l-out-roman|archivedate=February 9, 2016}}</ref>

Tying into the game's "golden anniversary," various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the [[2015 NFL season]]. The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL's properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on Week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos.

==Game summary==

===First half===
Denver took the opening kickoff of Super Bowl 50 and started out strong. Quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] completed an 18-yard pass to tight end [[Owen Daniels]] and a 22-yard throw to wide receiver [[Andre Caldwell]]. A pair of carries by running back [[C. J. Anderson]] moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina's defense dug in over the next three plays. First, linebacker [[Shaq Thompson]] tackled running back [[Ronnie Hillman]] for a 3-yard loss. Then after an incompletion, linebacker [[Thomas Davis (American football)|Thomas Davis]] tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a [[Brandon McManus]] 34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit.

[[File:Panthers Offense Super Bowl 50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Panthers on special teams during Super Bowl 50]]
After each team punted, Panthers quarterback [[Cam Newton]] appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to wide receiver [[Jerricho Cotchery]], but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee [[Mike Carey (American football)|Mike Carey]] stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seifert|first=Kevin|title=NFL's catch rule makes early Super Bowl 50 appearance|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/197920/197920|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=February 8, 2016|date=February 7, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208134653/http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/197920/197920|archivedate=February 8, 2016}}</ref> Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker [[Von Miller]] knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him, and defensive lineman [[Malik Jackson (defensive lineman)|Malik Jackson]] recovered it in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl XXVIII]] at the end of the 1993 season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Jill|title=Super Bowl 2016: Broncos' defense dominates as Peyton Manning wins second title|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/07/us/super-bowl-50-gameday/|publisher=CNN|date=February 8, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222152121/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/07/us/super-bowl-50-gameday/|archivedate=February 22, 2016}}</ref>

After a punt from both teams, Carolina got on track with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while [[Jonathan Stewart]] finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the second quarter. Later on, Broncos receiver [[Jordan Norwood]] received [[Brad Nortman]]'s short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a [[fair catch]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dubin|first=Jared|title=Jordan Norwood runs for longest punt return in Super Bowl history|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25476933/jordan-norwood-takes-off-for-the-longest-punt-return-in-super-bowl-history|publisher=[[CBSSports.com]]|accessdate=February 8, 2016|date=February 7, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208104853/http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25476933/jordan-norwood-takes-off-for-the-longest-punt-return-in-super-bowl-history|archivedate=February 8, 2016}}</ref> Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before [[Mario Addison]] dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.

On Carolina's next possession, fullback [[Mike Tolbert]] lost a fumble while being tackled by safety [[Darian Stewart]], which linebacker [[Danny Trevathan]] recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end [[Kony Ealy]] intercepted Manning, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 4:23 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line. With 11 seconds left and no timeouts, Newton was sacked by [[DeMarcus Ware]], causing time for the half to expire.

===Second half===
The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to [[Ted Ginn Jr.]], which was the longest pass play of the game for either team, on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play. However, the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when [[Graham Gano]] hit the right upright on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to [[Emmanuel Sanders]] for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus's 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to [[Corey Brown (American football)|Corey Brown]]. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety [[T. J. Ward]]. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.

[[File:Last Punt of Super Bowl 50.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5!|The last [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]] of Super Bowl 50]]
There would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by [[Devin Funchess]] and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.

With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller again stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt a recovery (following Ware and [[Mike Remmers]]) of the ball and while various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he'd dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the ball, which failed. This split-second decision later earned him criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Rodger|title=Cam Newton fumbled and didn't try to jump on it in the biggest play of the Super Bowl|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/2/7/10934554/super-bowl-cam-newton-von-miller-fumble|publisher=[[SB Nation|SBNation.com]]|accessdate=February 8, 2016|date=February 7, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209055245/http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/2/7/10934554/super-bowl-cam-newton-von-miller-fumble|archivedate=February 9, 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback [[Josh Norman (cornerback)|Josh Norman]] gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to [[Bennie Fowler]] for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives and managed one first down between them before the game ended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/07/super-bowl-50-denver-broncos-defense-overwhelms-carolina-panthers|title=Super Bowl 2016: Peyton Manning's Denver Broncos overwhelm Carolina Panthers|date=February 8, 2016|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 9, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209051749/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/07/super-bowl-50-denver-broncos-defense-overwhelms-carolina-panthers|archivedate=February 9, 2016}}</ref>

Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and the two teams. Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards (315–194) and first downs (21–11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in [[Super Bowl XXXV]].

==Aftermath==
Upon receiving the Lombardi Trophy, Broncos general manager and former quarterback [[John Elway]] raised it and exclaimed "This one's for Pat," in reference to owner [[Pat Bowlen]], who had been diagnosed the year before with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Bowlen had saluted Elway in the same fashion after the Broncos won their first championship in [[Super Bowl XXXII]] 18 years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|title=18 Years Later, John Elway Declares 'This One's For Pat'|url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/02/07/18-years-later-john-elway-declares-this-ones-for-pat/|publisher=[[CBSSports.com|Denver CBSSports]]|accessdate=March 5, 2019|date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>

It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week 1 of the following season since the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]] when the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]] held a rematch of [[Super Bowl IV]] to kick off the [[AFL–NFL merger|post-merger]] era of the NFL. The Broncos won 21–20 as Carolina's Graham Gano missed a field goal attempt to win the game.

Both teams would ultimately struggle during the season and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Panthers fell to 6–10 and finished in last place in the NFC South. The Broncos fell to 9–7 and came in third place in the AFC West. This was the first time the defending AFC and NFC champions would both miss the playoffs since the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]], after [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], when neither the [[Oakland Raiders]] nor the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] qualified for the postseason, and the fifth time overall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Michael David|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/12/26/both-of-last-years-super-bowl-teams-are-out-of-the-playoffs/|title=Both of last year's Super Bowl teams are out of the playoffs|publisher=[[Profootballtalk.com]]|date=December 26, 2016|accessdate=June 27, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709043055/http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/12/26/both-of-last-years-super-bowl-teams-are-out-of-the-playoffs/|archivedate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>
