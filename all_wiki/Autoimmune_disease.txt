== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Rheumatoid Arthritis.JPG|thumb|Rheumatoid arthritis]]

Autoimmune diseases present similar symptoms across the more than eighty different types.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|date=March 26, 2019|title=Autoimmune Diseases: Types, Symptoms, Causes and More|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/autoimmune-disorders|access-date=November 11, 2020|website=[[Healthline]]}}</ref> The appearance and severity of these signs and symptoms depends on the location and type of autoimmune response that occurs. An individual may also have more than one autoimmune disease simultaneously, and display symptoms of multiple diseases. Signs and symptoms presented, and the disease itself, can be influenced by various other factors such as age, hormones, and environmental factors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith DA, Germolec DR | title = Introduction to immunology and autoimmunity | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 107 Suppl 5 | issue = suppl 5 | pages = 661–5 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10502528 | pmc = 1566249 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.99107s5661 }}</ref> In general, the common symptoms are:<ref name="MedlinePlus">{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm |title=Autoimmune disorders | encyclopedia = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine |date=2016-01-12 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160112012705/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm |access-date=2020-04-14 |archive-date= 2016-01-12 }}</ref>

* Fatigue
* Low grade fever
* General feeling of unwell (malaise)
* Muscle aches and joint pain
* Rash on different areas of the skin

The appearance of these signs and symptoms can fluctuate, and when they reappear, it is known as a flare-up.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/> Such signs and symptoms may aid in diagnosis by supporting the results from biologic markers of autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{cite book | author = National Research Council (US) Subcommittee on Immunotoxicology |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235671/|title=Autoimmune Diseases|date=1992|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>

There are several areas that are commonly impacted by autoimmune diseases. These areas include: blood vessels, underlying connective tissues, joints and muscles, red blood cells, skin, and endocrine glands, like thyroid or pancreas glands.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/>

These diseases tend to have characteristic pathological effects that characterize them as an autoimmune disease. Such features include damage to or destruction of tissues where there is an abnormal immune response, altered organ growth, and altered organ function depending on the location of the disease.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/> Some diseases are organ specific and are restricted to affecting certain tissues, while others are systemic diseases that impact many tissues throughout the body. Signs and symptoms may vary depending on which of these categories an individual’s disease falls under.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L, Wang FS, Gershwin ME | title = Human autoimmune diseases: a comprehensive update | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 278 | issue = 4 | pages = 369–95 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26212387 | doi = 10.1111/joim.12395 }}</ref>

=== Cancer ===
Research suggests an overall correlation between autoimmune diseases and cancer, in that having an autoimmune disease increases the risk or likelihood of developing certain cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks AL, Slansky JE | title = Multiple associations between a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer | journal = Anticancer Research | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 1119–36 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22493341 | pmc = 3349285 }}</ref> Autoimmune diseases cause [[inflammation]] through a variety of mechanisms, however, the way in which [[inflammation]] is created does not greatly influence cancer risk.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Rather, the cancer risk is largely dependent on the fact that all autoimmune diseases increase chronic [[inflammation]] which has been linked to cancer.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Below are some autoimmune diseases most commonly linked to cancer including [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] ([[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]), [[multiple sclerosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[Lupus|systemic lupus erythematosus]].<ref name="Franks_2012" />

== Examples ==
Following are the few examples of autoimmune diseases. See [[List of autoimmune diseases]] for a more exhaustive list.

=== Coeliac Disease ===
[[Coeliac disease]] presents the strongest associations to gastrointestinal and lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> In [[coeliac disease]], the autoimmune reaction is caused by the body’s loss of immune tolerance to ingested [[gluten]], found primarily in wheat, barley, and rye.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> This explains the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers, as the gastrointestinal tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus, all areas that the ingested gluten would traverse in digestion.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> The incidence of gastrointestinal cancer can be partially reduced or eliminated if a patient removes [[gluten]] from their diet.<ref name="Franks_2012" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | s2cid = 24980464 | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–23 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Green PH, Fleischauer AT, Bhagat G, Goyal R, Jabri B, Neugut AI | title = Risk of malignancy in patients with celiac disease | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–5 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12935825 | doi = 10.1016/s0002-9343(03)00302-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Volta U, Vincentini O, Silano M | title = Papillary cancer of thyroid in celiac disease | journal = Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = e44-6 | date = 2011 | pmid = 20697293 | doi = 10.1097/mcg.0b013e3181ea11cb | s2cid = 24754769 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Catassi C, Bearzi I, Holmes GK | title = Association of celiac disease and intestinal lymphomas and other cancers | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S79-86 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15825131 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.02.027 }}</ref> Additionally, [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]] is correlated with lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Inflammatory Bowel Disease ===
[[Inflammatory bowel disease]] is associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and some lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can be further categorized as [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]].<ref name="Franks_2012" /> In both cases, individuals with IBD lose immune tolerance for normal bacteria present in the gut [[microbiome]].<ref name="Franks_2012" /> In this case, the immune system attacks the bacteria and induces chronic [[inflammation]], which has been linked to increased cancer risk.<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Multiple Sclerosis ===
[[Multiple sclerosis]] is associated with decreased risk of cancer overall but an increased risk of [[central nervous system]] cancer, primarily in the brain.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease in which [[T cell|T-cells]] – a specific type of immune cells – attack the important [[Myelin|myelin sheath]] in brain neurons.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frohman EM, Racke MK, Raine CS | title = Multiple sclerosis--the plaque and its pathogenesis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 9 | pages = 942–55 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16510748 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra052130 }}</ref> This reduces the nervous system function, creating [[inflammation]] and subsequent cancer of the brain.<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Rheumatoid Arthritis ===
[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] presents mild, yet significant associations with focal cancers all throughout the body as well as lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> In rheumatoid arthritis, cells that make up the body’s joints and cartilages become invasive and induce local inflammation.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Additionally, the chronic inflammation and over-activation of the immune system creates an environment that favors further malignant transformation of other cells. This can explain the associations to cancer of the lungs and skin as well as the increased risk of other hematologic cancers none of which are directly affected by the inflammation of joints.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Turesson|first1=Carl |last2=Matteson|first2=Eric L. | name-list-style = vanc |chapter=Clinical Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis: Extra-Articular Manifestations|date=2009|title =Rheumatoid Arthritis|pages=62–67|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-05475-1|doi=10.1016/b978-032305475-1.50014-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khurana R, Berney SM | title = Clinical aspects of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Pathophysiology | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–65 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16125918 | doi = 10.1016/j.pathophys.2005.07.009 }}</ref>

=== Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ===
[[Lupus|Systemic lupus erythematosus]] is associated with focal cancers throughout the body and lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Systemic lupus erythematosus affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by a widespread loss of immune tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsokos GC | title = Systemic lupus erythematosus | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 22 | pages = 2110–21 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22129255 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra1100359 }}</ref> The chronic [[inflammation]] throughout the entire body promotes the malignant transformation of other cells which contributes to the increased risk of systemic and lymphoproliferative cancers.<ref name="Franks_2012" /> Conversely, systemic lupus erythematosus is correlated with a decrease in some cancers. This is best explained by increased immunosurveillance in these areas, however, the mechanism for why these areas experience lower incidence is poorly understood.<ref name="Franks_2012" />

=== Aplastic anemia ===
In [[aplastic anemia]] the body fails to produce blood cells in sufficient numbers. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow by stem cells that reside there. Aplastic anaemia causes a deficiency of all blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

== Causes ==
The cause is generally unknown.<ref name=Bor2010/> Some autoimmune diseases such as [[lupus]] run in families, and certain cases may be triggered by [[infection]]s or other environmental factors.<ref name=NIH2012/> There are more than 100 autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aarda.org/diseaselist/|title=Autoimmune Disease List • AARDA|date=2016-06-01|website=AARDA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> Some common diseases that are generally considered autoimmune include [[celiac disease]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], [[Graves' disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[psoriasis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]].<ref name=NIH2012/><ref name=Hoh2016/>

=== Genetics ===
Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which the human immune system attacks healthy human tissues within the body. The exact genes responsible for causing each autoimmune disease have not been completely isolated.  However, several experimental methods such as the genome-wide association scans have been used to identify certain genetic risk variants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregersen PK, Olsson LM | title = Recent advances in the genetics of autoimmune disease | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 27 | pages = 363–91 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19302045 | pmc = 2992886 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132653 }}</ref>  Research focusing on both genome scanning and family trait inheritance analysis has enabled scientists to further understand the etiology of autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and Rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name="Hill_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill NJ, King C, Flodstrom-Tullberg M | title = Recent acquisitions on the genetic basis of autoimmune disease | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience: A Journal and Virtual Library | volume = 13 | issue = 13| pages = 4838–51 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18508549 | doi = 10.2741/3043 }}</ref>

* Rheumatoid arthritis: Although there is no complete genetic mapping for this condition, several genes are thought to play a role in causing RA.

=== Environmental factors ===
A range of environmental factors have been recognized as either having a direct role in development, or being a catalyst to many autoimmune diseases. Current studies indicate up to seventy percent of autoimmune disease are due to environmental factors, including: chemicals, infection, diet, and gut dysbiosis. A single set of steps has been identified to be the most likely theory for autoimmune disease onset.<ref name="pmid24688790">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vojdani A | title = A Potential Link between Environmental Triggers and Autoimmunity | journal = Autoimmune Diseases | volume = 2014 | pages = 437231 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24688790 | pmc = 3945069 | doi = 10.1155/2014/437231 }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The human [[immune system]] typically produces both [[T cell]]s and [[B cell]]s that are capable of being reactive with self-[[antigen]]s, but these self-reactive cells are usually either killed prior to becoming active within the immune system, placed into a state of anergy (silently removed from their role within the immune system due to over-activation), or removed from their role within the immune system by regulatory cells. When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.

Some infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. In this case, a normal immune response to ''C. jejuni'' can result in the production of antibodies that also react to a lesser degree with gangliosides of myelin sheath surrounding peripheral nerves' axons (i.e., [[Guillain–Barré]]). A major understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases has been the application of genome-wide association scans that have identified a degree of genetic sharing among the autoimmune diseases.<ref name="pmid23031829">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cotsapas C, Hafler DA | title = Immune-mediated disease genetics: the shared basis of pathogenesis | journal = Trends in Immunology | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–6 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23031829 | doi = 10.1016/j.it.2012.09.001 }}</ref>

[[Autoimmunity]], on the other hand, is the presence of self-reactive immune response (e.g., auto-antibodies, self-reactive T cells), with or without damage or pathology resulting from it.<ref name="McGraw-Hill Professional">{{cite book|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | volume = 1–2 |date=2011-08-11|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-174889-6 |edition=18th |language=en}}</ref> This may be restricted to certain [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s (e.g. in [[autoimmune thyroiditis]]) or involve a particular tissue in different places (e.g. [[Goodpasture's disease]] which may affect the [[basement membrane]] in both the [[lung]] and the [[kidney]]).

There are many theories as to how an autoimmune disease state arises.  Some common ones are listed below.

==Diagnosis==
For a disease to be regarded as an autoimmune disease it needs to answer to ''Witebsky's postulates'' (first formulated by [[Ernest Witebsky]] and colleagues in 1957 and modified in 1994):<ref name=EW>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witebsky E, Rose NR, Terplan K, Paine JR, Egan RW | title = Chronic thyroiditis and autoimmunization | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 164 | issue = 13 | pages = 1439–47 | date = July 1957 | pmid = 13448890 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1957.02980130015004 }}</ref><ref name="Defining criteria for autoimmune di"/>
* Direct evidence from transfer of disease-causing antibody or disease-causing [[T cell|T lymphocyte white blood cells]]
* Indirect evidence based on reproduction of the autoimmune disease in experimental animals
* Circumstantial evidence from clinical clues

Symptoms of early autoimmune disease are often the exact same as common illnesses, including: fatigue, fever, malaise, joint pain, and rash. Due to the fact symptoms vary for affected location, disease causing agents, and individuals, it is difficult for proper diagnosis.<ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Autoimmune disorders | encyclopedia = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine | access-date = 23 March 2020 | url = https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000816.htm }}</ref> Typically, diagnosis begins with looking into a patient’s family's history for genetic predisposition. This is combined with various tests, as no single test can identify an autoimmune disease.<ref name="BCH">{{cite web | title = Autoimmune Diseases: Symptoms & Causes | publisher = Boston Children's Hospital | access-date = 23 March 2020 | url = http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/a/autoimmune-diseases/symptoms-and-causes }}</ref>

=== Antinuclear antibody ===

A test used to identify abnormal proteins, known as antinuclear antibodies, produced when the body attacks its own tissues.<ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" /><ref name="BCH" /> It may test positive in several disorders. This test is most useful for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus, having a 95% positive test rate.<ref>{{cite web | title = Antinuclear Antibody (ANA). | access-date = 14 April 2020 | url = https://labtestsonline.org/tests/antinuclear-antibody-ana | work = labtestsonline.org }}</ref>

=== Complete blood count ===
A test taking measurements on maturity levels, count, and size of blood cells.<ref name="BCH" /><ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" /> Targeted cells include: red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. Based on increased or decreased numbers in these counts, underlying medical conditions may be present; typically, autoimmune disease is represented by low white blood cell count (Leukopenia). For proper diagnosis, further testing is needed.<ref>{{cite web | title = Complete blood count (CBC) | date = 19 December 2018 | access-date = 14 April 2020 | url = https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/complete-blood-count/about/pac-20384919 | work = www.mayoclinic.org }}</ref>

=== Complement ===
A test used to measure levels of a protein group of the immune system called complement within blood. If complement is found in low levels, this may be an indication of disease.<ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" /><ref name="BCH" />

=== C reactive protein ===
[[C reactive protein]], a protein made in the liver generally increases with inflammation, and may be high in autoimmune disease.<ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" /><ref name="BCH" />

=== Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ===

This test measures the rate at which a patient’s blood cells descend in a test tube. More rapid descents may indicate inflammation, a common symptom of autoimmune disease.<ref name="BCH" /><ref name="MedLinePlus_Autoimmune_disorders" />

If these tests are indicative antibody abnormalities and inflammation, further tests will be conducted to identify the autoimmune disease present.<ref name="BCH" />

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition. The majority of the autoimmune diseases are chronic and there is no definitive cure, but symptoms can be alleviated and controlled with treatment.<ref name="MedlinePlus"/> Overall, the aim of the various treatment methods is to lessen the presented symptoms for relief and manipulate the body’s autoimmune response, while still preserving the ability of the patient to combat diseases that they may encounter.<ref name="Rosenblum_2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenblum MD, Gratz IK, Paw JS, Abbas AK | title = Treating human autoimmunity: current practice and future prospects | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 125 | pages = 125sr1 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22422994 | pmc = 4061980 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003504 }}</ref> Traditional treatment options may include immunosuppressant drugs to weaken the overall immune response, such as:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li P, Zheng Y, Chen X | title = Drugs for Autoimmune Inflammatory Diseases: From Small Molecule Compounds to Anti-TNF Biologics | language = en | journal = Frontiers in Pharmacology | volume = 8 | pages = 460 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28785220 | pmc = 5506195 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2017.00460 }}</ref>

* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation
* Glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation
* Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to decrease the damaging tissue and organ effects of the inflammatory autoimmune response

Other standard treatment methods include:<ref name="MedlinePlus"/>

* Vitamin or hormone supplements for what the body is lacking due to the disease (insulin, vitamin B12, thyroid hormone, etc.)
* Blood transfusions if the disease is blood related
* Physical therapy if the disease impacts bones, joints, or muscles

Because these drugs aim to reduce the immune response against the body’s own tissues, there are side effects of these traditional treatment methods, such as being more vulnerable to infections that can potentially be life threatening. There are new advancements in medicine for the treatment of autoimmune diseases that are currently being researched, developed, and used today, especially when traditional treatment options fail. These methods aim to either block the activation of pathogenic cells in the body, or alter the pathway that suppresses these cells naturally.<ref name="Rosenblum_2012"/><ref name="Smilek_2014">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smilek DE, Ehlers MR, Nepom GT | title = Restoring the balance: immunotherapeutic combinations for autoimmune disease | journal = Disease Models & Mechanisms | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 503–13 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24795433 | pmc = 4007402 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.015099 }}</ref> The goal for these advancements is to have treatment options available that are less toxic to the patient, and have more specific targets.<ref name="Smilek_2014" /> Such options include:

* Monoclonal antibodies that can be used to block pro-inflammatory cytokines
* Antigen-specific immunotherapy which allows immune cells to specifically target the abnormal cells that cause autoimmune disease<ref name="Smilek_2014" />
* Co-stimulatory blockade that works to block the pathway that leads to the autoimmune response
* Regulatory T cell therapy that utilizes this special type of T cell to suppress the autoimmune response<ref name="Rosenblum_2012"/>

== Epidemiology ==
The first estimate of US prevalence for autoimmune diseases as a group was published in 1997 by Jacobson, et al. They reported US prevalence to be around 9 million, applying prevalence estimates for 24 diseases to a US population of 279 million.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacobson DL, Gange SJ, Rose NR, Graham NM | title = Epidemiology and estimated population burden of selected autoimmune diseases in the United States | journal = Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–43 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9281381 | doi = 10.1006/clin.1997.4412 }}</ref>  Jacobson's work was updated by Hayter & Cook in 2012.<ref name="HayterCook2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayter SM, Cook MC | title = Updated assessment of the prevalence, spectrum and case definition of autoimmune disease | journal = Autoimmunity Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 754–65 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22387972 | doi = 10.1016/j.autrev.2012.02.001 }}</ref> This study used Witebsky's postulates, as revised by Rose & Bona,<ref name="Defining criteria for autoimmune di">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose NR, Bona C | title = Defining criteria for autoimmune diseases (Witebsky's postulates revisited) | journal = Immunology Today | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 426–30 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8216719 | doi = 10.1016/0167-5699(93)90244-F }}</ref> to extend the list to 81 diseases and estimated overall cumulative US prevalence for the 81 autoimmune diseases at 5.0%, with 3.0% for males and 7.1% for females. The estimated community
prevalence, which takes into account the observation that many people have more than one autoimmune disease, was 4.5% overall, with 2.7% for males and 6.4% for females.<ref name="HayterCook2012" /> National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted in the US from the 1980s to present day, have shown an increase of antinuclear antibodies, a common biomarker for autoimmune diseases. This shows that there has been an increase in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in recent years pointing to a stronger influence of environment factors as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dinse|first=Gregg E.|last2=Parks|first2=Christine G.|last3=Weinberg|first3=Clarice R.|last4=Co|first4=Caroll A.|last5=Wilkerson|first5=Jesse|last6=Zeldin|first6=Darryl C.|last7=Chan|first7=Edward K.

==Research==
In both autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the condition arises through aberrant reactions of the human adaptive or innate immune systems. In autoimmunity, the patient's immune system is activated against the body's own proteins. In chronic inflammatory diseases, [[neutrophil]]s and other [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] are constitutively recruited by [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s, resulting in tissue damage.

Mitigation of inflammation by activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the suppression of inflammatory genes in immune cells is a promising therapeutic approach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mukundan L, Odegaard JI, Morel CR, Heredia JE, Mwangi JW, Ricardo-Gonzalez RR, Goh YP, Eagle AR, Dunn SE, Awakuni JU, Nguyen KD, Steinman L, Michie SA, Chawla A | display-authors = 6 | title = PPAR-delta senses and orchestrates clearance of apoptotic cells to promote tolerance | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1266–72 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19838202 | pmc = 2783696 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roszer T, Menéndez-Gutiérrez MP, Lefterova MI, Alameda D, Núñez V, Lazar MA, Fischer T, Ricote M | display-authors = 6 | title = Autoimmune kidney disease and impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells in mice with macrophage peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma or retinoid X receptor alpha deficiency | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 186 | issue = 1 | pages = 621–31 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21135166 | pmc = 4038038 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.1002230 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22155015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh RP, Waldron RT, Hahn BH | title = Genes, tolerance and systemic autoimmunity | journal = Autoimmunity Reviews | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 664–9 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22155015 | pmc = 3306516 | doi = 10.1016/j.autrev.2011.11.017 }}</ref> There is a body of evidence that once the production of [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] has been initialized, autoantibodies have the capacity to maintain their own production.<ref name="pmid12911286">{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhm I | s2cid = 37887253 | title = Disruption of the cytoskeleton after apoptosis induction with autoantibodies | journal = Autoimmunity | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–9 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12911286 | doi = 10.1080/0891693031000105617 }}</ref>

=== Altered glycan theory ===

According to this theory, the effector function of the immune response is mediated by the [[glycans]] (polysaccharides) displayed by the cells and humoral components of the immune system. Individuals with autoimmunity have alterations in their glycosylation profile such that a proinflammatory immune response is favored. It is further hypothesized that individual autoimmune diseases will have unique glycan signatures.<ref name="pmid25578468">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin ME, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | display-authors = 6 | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity: a critical review | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 }}</ref>

=== Hygiene hypothesis ===
According to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], high levels of cleanliness expose children to fewer antigens than in the past, causing their immune systems to become overactive and more likely to misidentify own tissues as foreign, resulting in autoimmune or allergic conditions such as asthma.<ref name="pmid22090147">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rook GA | s2cid = 15302882 | title = Hygiene hypothesis and autoimmune diseases | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22090147 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-011-8285-8 }}</ref>

=== Vitamin D Influence on Immune Response ===
