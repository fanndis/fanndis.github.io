'''M. E. Sharpe, Inc.,''' an [[academic publisher]], was founded by Myron Sharpe in 1958 with the original purpose of publishing [[translations]] from Russian in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mesharpe.com/about.htm|title=About M. E. Sharpe, Inc.}}</ref> These [[translations]] were published in a series of journals, the first of which was ''Problems of Economics'', now called ''Problems of Economic Transition''. In the 1960s, the translation project was expanded to include other [[Europe]]an languages, then [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Other [[academic journals]] launched by M.E. Sharpe during these years featured articles originating in [[English language|English]]. At present,{{when|date=October 2015}} the firm publishes over 35 periodicals including ''[[Challenge: The Magazine of Economic Affairs]]'', ''[[Journal of Management Information Systems]]'', ''International Journal of Electronic Commerce'', ''Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics'' and ''[[Problems of Post-Communism]]''. Shortly after it was established, M. E. Sharpe, Inc. also began to publish scholarly books in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]], with a special emphasis on [[international studies]]. In the 1980s, the book division was expanded and it currently publishes approximately 60 new titles a year, including works in [[economics]], [[business]], [[management]], [[public administration]], [[political science]], [[history]] and [[literature]]. Many of M. E. Sharpe's [[textbooks]] are available in digital editions through the Sharpe E-Text Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sharpe-etext.com/staticcms/aboutus|title=About Sharpe E-Text Center|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701074549/http://www.sharpe-etext.com/staticcms/aboutus|archivedate=1 July 2014}}</ref>

Several [[Nobel Prize]] winners, including [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] and [[Wassily Leontief]], are among M. E.
