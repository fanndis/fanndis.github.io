Poppy Parnell, a podcaster who rose to fame for her coverage on the trial, is a witness and the judge files against the appeal because of Lanie's fragile state following her father's murder. This however brings about a sense of worry and guilt for Poppy and prompts her to retell the events through her podcasts. Poppy soon decides on visiting Warren through his cancer-ridden mother and Lanie who refuses to participate. However, Warren's mother Melanie agrees on letting Poppy visit her son, but the meeting ends with Poppy leaving after Warren reveals numerous Nazi tattoos. Later, Poppy revisits Warren and believes he was changed by the system before revealing about his mother's cancer diagnosis and Cave reveals he used to infiltrate the Burnham's household for pills.

{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}
On the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series has a score of 32%, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 5.72/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A twisty thriller that never quite comes together, ''Truth Be Told''{{'}}s commitment to the true crime at its center is less interesting or engaging than the family drama orbiting in the periphery."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/truth_be_told_2019/s01 |title=Truth Be Told: Season 1 |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=March 3, 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116030715/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/truth_be_told_2019/s01 |url-status=live }}</ref>
