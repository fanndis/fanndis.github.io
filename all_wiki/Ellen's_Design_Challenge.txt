== Controversy ==
The finale of the first season has sparked some controversy. Katie Stout and Tim McClellan were the two remaining contestants and judges decided to declare McClellan as the winner during the final episode which aired on March 2, 2015. However, it turned out that the winning piece of furniture was very similar to an existing design by European craftsman Simon Schacht. McClellan was eventually disqualified and Stout was named the winner during the taping of ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/ellens-design-challenge-winner-disqualified-in-dramatic-finale-twist/|title=‘Ellen’s Design Challenge’ Winner Disqualified in Dramatic Finale Twist|first=Tony|last=Maglio|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2015|publisher=[[The Wrap]]}}</ref> McClellan appeared on ''Ellen'' as well shortly after the controversy and addressed the decision by saying that "the similarities of the two pieces are quite compelling," also adding that he agrees to the decision that has been made and "recognize[s] Katie as the legitimate winner of the show."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/home/2015/03/05/disqualified-ellen-design-challenge-winner-jerome-speaks/24400829/|title=Disqualified 'Design Challenge' winner speaks on 'Ellen'|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=March 6, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2015|first=Karen|last=Fernau}}</ref> The controversy has since raised some questions whether it was a publicity stunt.<ref name="wash">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/03/03/a-woodworking-plagiarism-scandal-on-ellens-design-challenge-hgtv-handling-of-finale-sparks-controversy/|title=A woodworking plagiarism scandal on ‘Ellen’s Design Challenge’?
