'''Special Olympics''' is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with [[intellectual disabilities]] and physical disabilities, providing year-round training and activities to 5 million participants and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/press/releases/SpecialOlympicsat50 |title=Smithsonian Highlights Special Olympics History and Athletes |date=July 6, 2018 |website=National Museum of American History |language=en |access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>  Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the world—including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year.<ref name="Reach">{{Cite web |url=http://media.specialolympics.org/resources/reports/reach-reports/2016_ReachReport_Final_4Pager.pdf |title=2016 Reach Report |website=Special Olympics}}</ref> Like the [[International Paralympic Committee]], the Special  Olympics organization is recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]]; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games.

The [[Special Olympics World Games]] is a major event put on by the Special Olympics. The World Games alternate between summer and winter games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. The first games were held on July 20, 1968 in [[Chicago]], Illinois, with about 1000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. At those first games, honorary event chair [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] announced the formation of the Special Olympics organization.  International participation expanded in subsequent games.  In 2003, the first summer games held outside the United States were in [[Dublin]], Ireland with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The most recent World Summer Games were held in [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates from March 14 to 21 2019. This was the first Special Olympics World Games to be held in the Middle East. The next World Summer Games will be held in [[Berlin]], Germany between June 16 to 25, 2023. This will be the first time for Germany to host the Special Olympics World Games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.specialolympics.org/about/press-releases/berlin-germany-selected-to-host-the-2023-special-olympics-world-games|title=Berlin, Germany selected to host the 2023 Special Olympics World Games|publisher=Special Olympics}}</ref>

The first World Winter Games were held in 1977 in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], Colorado, US. [[Austria]] hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games were held in [[Graz]], [[Schladming]] and [[Ramsau am Dachstein|Ramsau]], Austria from March 14, 2017 to March 25, 2017 (see also [[2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games]]).

==History==
In June 1963, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]] started a day camp called [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Camp Shriver]] for children with intellectual and physical disabilities at her home in [[Potomac, Maryland]].<ref name="so-history"/> The camp sought to address the concern that children with disabilities had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, head of the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]] and a member of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-Legacy/JFK-and-Disability.aspx|title=JFK and Disabilities – John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum|website=www.jfklibrary.org}}</ref> Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation gave grants to universities, recreation departments, and community centers to hold similar camps.

Also in the early 1960s, Kennedy Shriver wrote an article in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', revealing that her sister [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], also President John F. Kennedy's sister, was born with intellectual disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2009/08/13/history/post-perspective/eunice-kennedy-shriver-19212009.html|title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver 1921–2009 – The Saturday Evening Post|first=The Saturday Evening Post|last=Society|website=www.saturdayeveningpost.com}}</ref> This frank article about the President's family was seen as a "watershed" in changing public attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities.<ref>Kessler, p. 246</ref> Rosemary's disability provided Kennedy Shriver with an overall vision that people with intellectual disabilities could compete and at the same time unify in public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodnet.org/articles/10-facts-about-special-olympics-list-1|title=10 Facts about the Special Olympics [LIST] – Goodnet|work=Goodnet|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>  It has often been said that Rosemary's disability was Eunice's inspiration to form Special Olympics (as the movement came to be called), but she told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1995 that that was not exactly the case. "The games should not focus on one individual," she said.<ref>{{cite news|author=Johnson, Kirk|title=Reaching the Retarded: An Old Kennedy Mission|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/nyregion/reaching-the-retarded-an-old-kennedy-mission.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1995|access-date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

In 1958, Dr. James N. Oliver of England had conducted pioneering research, including a ground-breaking study showing that physical exercise and activities for children with intellectual disabilities had positive effects that also carried over into the classroom ("The Effects of Physical Conditioning Exercises and Activities on the Mental Characteristics of Educationally Sub-Normal Boys, British Journal of Educational Psychology, XXVIII, June 1958).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychsource.bps.org.uk/details/journalArticle/3584061/THE-EFFECT-OF-PHYSICAL-CONDITIONING-EXERCISES-AND-ACTIVITIES-ON-THE-MENTAL-CHARA.html|title=THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONING EXERCISES AND ACTIVITIES ON THE MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF EDUCATIONALLY SUB‐NORMAL BOYS – PsychSource|website=psychsource.bps.org.uk}}</ref> Dr. Oliver in 1964 served as a consultant to Camp Shriver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Out_of_the_Shadows__Events_Leading_to_the_Founding_of_Special_Olympics.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Out of the Shadows: Events Leading to the Founding of Special Olympics|website=www.specialolympics.org}}</ref>

The 1964 research of Dr. [[Frank Hayden]], a Canadian physical education professor from London, Ontario, demonstrated that persons with intellectual disabilities can and should participate in physical exercise. He believed that the benefits of such activity would be seen in all areas of the athletes' lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kch.uiuc.edu/Alumni/Hayden.aspx|title=Welcome to Kinesiology & Community Health – Kinesiology & Community Health|website=www.kch.uiuc.edu}}</ref> With the help of a local school that offered space in its gym, Hayden started one of the first public organised sports programs, [[floor hockey]] for individuals with intellectual disabilities, in the fall of 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.specialolympicsontario.ca/about-us|title=About Us – Special Olympics Ontario – Greater Ottawa|website=ottawa.specialolympicsontario.ca}}</ref>  In the mid-1960s, Hayden also developed an idea for national games, and his work brought him to the attention of the Kennedy Foundation. He shared his ideas for national games, while taking a teaching sabbatical and working for the foundation.<ref name=Moczulski>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-how-the-special-olympics-were-born/ |title=How the Special Olympics were born |last=Moczulski |first=J.P.  |date=July 16, 2018 |work=Globe and Mail |access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref>

The first Special Olympics games were held on July 20, 1968, at [[Soldier Field]] in Chicago. About 1,000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada took part in the one-day event, which was a joint venture by the Kennedy Foundation and the [[Chicago Park District]].<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=https://www.specialolympics.org/about/history/out-of-the-shadows-events-leading-to-the-founding-of-special-olympics|title=Out of the Shadows: Events Leading to the Founding of |publisher=Special Olympics |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>  [[Anne McGlone Burke]], then a physical education teacher with the Chicago Park District,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1998/ip980517.html |title=Feature Article |publisher=Lib.niu.edu |date=1968-07-20 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> began with the idea for a one-time, city-wide, Olympic-style athletic competition for people with special needs. Burke approached the Kennedy Foundation in 1967 to fund the event. Kennedy Shriver, in turn, encouraged her to expand the idea beyond the city and the foundation provided a grant of $25,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fotonique.com/limerick-collection/what-to-see-what-to-do-limerick/the-peoples-park-limerick/limerick-special-olympics-2014/|title=SPECIAL OLYMPICS 2014|website=www.fotonique.com|access-date=2017-10-09}}</ref>  When Burke had approached another charity for funding, she was told, "You should be ashamed of yourself putting these kinds of kids on display".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/one-of-historys-most-transformative-human-rights-movements-turns-50/2018/07/15/21c00c6c-8081-11e8-b660-4d0f9f0351f1_story.html |title=One of history's most transformative human rights movements turns 50 |last=McCallum  |first=Jack |date=July 15, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-07-21 |language=en}}</ref> The advisory committee to the Chicago Special Olympics included Dr. William Freeberg from Southern Illinois University, Dr. Hayden of the Kennedy Foundation, Dr. Arthur Peavy, Burke, William McFetridge, and Stephen Kelly of the Chicago Park District, as well as, Olympic decathlon champion [[Rafer Johnson]]. Kennedy Shriver was honorary chair. At the July 1968 games, Kennedy Shriver announced the formation of Special Olympics and that more games would be held every two years as a "Biennial International Special Olympics".<ref name="ReferenceC"/>  Hayden served as the games executive director through 1972, and then in international development for the games.<ref name=Moczulski/>

In 1971, The [[U.S. Olympic Committee]] gave the Special Olympics official approval to use the name "Olympics".<ref name="so-history"/> [[France]] sent the first athletes from outside North America to the second games held in 1970.

In 1997, [[Healthy Athletes]] became an official Special Olympics initiative, offering health information and screenings to Special Olympics athletes worldwide.<ref name="so-history"/><ref>Mary Davis,[http://www.herald.ie/opinion/mary-davis-how-health-checks-on-our-special-athletes-are-saving-lives-2612833.html], "How Health Checks on our Special Athletes are saving lives", Evening Herald, Thursday, April 7th 2011</ref> By 2010, the Healthy Athletes program had given free health screenings and treatment to more than 1 million people with intellectual disabilities.

[[File:2003 Special Olympics Opening Crowd.JPG|left|thumb|The crowd at the [[2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games]] Opening Ceremonies in [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]], Ireland.]]
The 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games – the first summer held outside of the United States – took place in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Approximately 7,000 athletes from 150 countries competed over 18 disciplines. The [[Dublin]] games were also the first to have their own opening and closing ceremonies broadcast live. President of Ireland [[Mary McAleese]] performed the ceremonial duties.  The 2003 games dramatically changed the perceptions and attitudes of international society regarding the abilities and limitations of people with intellectual disabilities. The opening ceremony of the [[2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games|2003 Games]] has been described by President McAleese as "a time when Ireland was at its superb best".<ref>Fiona Brady, [http://www.activecitizenship.ie/index.asp?locID=12&docID=47 Taskforce ON citizenship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118182202/http://www.activecitizenship.ie/index.asp?locID=12&docID=47 |date=2007-11-18 }}, "Her bridges built, McAleese reflects on a decade in office", Irish Independent, November 3, 2007</ref>

On October 30, 2004, President [[George W. Bush]] signed into law the "Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act," Public Law 108-406.  The bill authorized funding for its Healthy Athletes, Education, and Worldwide Expansion programs.<ref name="sosea"/>  Co-sponsored by Representatives [[Roy Blunt]] (R-MO), and [[Steny Hoyer]] (D-MD), and Senators [[Rick Santorum]] (R-PA) and [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV), the bills were passed by unanimous consent in both chambers.  In July 2006, the first [[Special Olympics USA]] Games were held at [[Iowa State University]].  Teams from all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]] participated.<ref name="so-usng"/>

In May 2016, [[Mary Davis (activist)|Mary Davis]] of Dublin, Ireland was named Chief Executive Officer. She is the first CEO from outside the U.S. in the organization's history.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/outstanding-achievement-award-for-mary-davis-entirely-fitting-1.3329312 |title=Outstanding Achievement award for Mary Davis entirely fitting |last=O'Riordan |first=Ian |date=December 16, 2017 |work=The Irish Times |access-date=2018-07-16 |language=en-US}}</ref> From 2017 to 2019, US Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]] attempted to eliminate federal funding for the Special Olympics. Each year the attempt was rejected by Congress, and the public outcry following a third annual attempt resulted in the funding being maintained in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/28/politics/betsy-devos-special-olympics/index.html|title=Betsy DeVos' utterly botched call for Special Olympics funding cuts, explained}}</ref> As part of the Special Olympics 50th Anniversary celebration in 2018, a new mission called the “Inclusion Revolution” was launched.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==Symbols==
The Special Olympics [[logo]] is based on the sculpture "Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World" by [[Zurab Tsereteli]] which was a gift to [[The College at Brockport, State University of New York|SUNY Brockport]] when the university hosted the Special Olympics in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brockport.edu/about/archives/special_olympics/gift.html|title=A Special Gift: The College at Brockport|website=www.brockport.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite document|title=Special Olympics Statue, ca. 1979|last=Unknown|first=College Photographer|date=13 February 2007|hdl = 1951/36531}}</ref> The logo has gone through several changes in its lifetime. The "stick figure" is an abstract but humanistic form designed to convey the impression of movement and activity.  The logo is a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives.

In 2018, the Chicago Park District dedicated the "Eternal Flame of Hope" in honor of the Special Olympics.  The {{convert|30|foot}} sculpture by [[Richard Hunt (sculptor)|Richard Hunt]] stands in a plaza next to Soldier Field, where the first games were held 50 years earlier in 1968.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/new-chicago-sculpture-honors-special-olympics-50th-anniversary/3782871/ |title=New Chicago sculpture honors Special Olympics' 50th anniversary |last=Holmes |first=Evelyn |date=2018-07-18 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2018/Break_Ground_on_Eternal_Flame_of_Hope.aspx |title=To Celebrate the 50th Anniversary Year, Special Olympics and the Chicago Park District Break Ground on Eternal Flame of Hope, a Permanent Monument to Convey the Hope for Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities |date=March 2, 2018 |language=en |access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>  The [[Flame of Hope (Special Olympics)|Flame of Hope]] is the name given to the torch that is carried to and lit at Special Olympics games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.disabled-world.com/sports/special-olympics/flame-of-hope.php |title=Special Olympics Flame of Hope |date=2017-12-24 |website=Disabled World |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>

==Participation==
Special Olympics programs are available for athletes free of charge. More than 5.7 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 172 countries.<ref name="ABILITY Magazine">{{cite web|last = Cooper|first = Chet|title = Timothy Shriver – Special Olympics|url = http://abilitymagazine.com/Special-Olympics-Shriver.html|publisher = ABILITY Magazine|access-date = 18 February 2014}}</ref> The organization offers year-round training and competition in 32 Olympic-style summer and winter sports.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2011/07/2011-special-olympics-summer-games/100104/ |title=2011 Special Olympics Summer Games |work=The Atlantic Photo |date = July 12, 2011}}</ref>

People with intellectual disabilities are encouraged to join Special Olympics for the physical activity, which helps lower the rate of cardiovascular disease and obesity, among other health benefits. Also, they gain many emotional and psychological benefits, including self-confidence, social competence, building greater athletic skills and higher self-esteem.<ref name="The Driving Force"/> Exercise has also been shown to be related to a decrease in anxiety levels amongst people with intellectual disabilities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Carraro|first1=Attilio|last2=Gobbi|first2=Erica|date=2012-07-01|title=Effects of an exercise programme on anxiety in adults with intellectual disabilities|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|volume=33|issue=4|pages=1221–1226|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2012.02.014|pmid=22502848}}</ref>

To participate in Special Olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require or have required specially designed instruction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Common/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Frequently-Asked-Questions|website=Special Olympics|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> For young people with and without intellectual disabilities ages 2–7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes program—an inclusive sport and play program with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents say their children in Young Athletes also develop better social skills. The confidence boost makes it easier for them to play and talk with other children on the playground and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/young_athletes.aspx |title=Young Athletes |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> A study by the Center for Social Development and Education (University of Massachusetts, Boston) found that the activities also had the effect of helping children with intellectual disabilities learn routines and approaches to learning, along with how to follow rules and directions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:xXCaCGRpyVgJ:www.dec-sped.org/uploads/docs/conference/2012%2520Handouts/RES622%2520Young%2520Athletes%2520Intervention.pdf+%22center+for+social+development+and+education%22+%22special+olympics%22+%22young+athletes%22&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShJeMIE5Bz08XSzCotEX17n7oAbE5iZSE8zmF7v-_2J0B3gifUNkgkZChkCLo79OZdlbu7sSsxq4shblS9GcWLrOfWHDpSUlunNl_-hdywUT2YVNUAYtNhC30CvEjvDN6d0I5eL&sig=AHIEtbTk4fdv8kGX6GH-fy6M8ECv8YibAw |title=Google Drive Viewer |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

Families can also get involved with the Special Olympics experience. Family members support their athletes to the best of their ability, which may involve attending or volunteering at the events. By being involved they can boost their athlete's self-esteem and will be looked at as a constant source of encouragement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/families.aspx |title=Our Families |work=specialolympics.org |access-date=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

Volunteers and supporters are an integral part of Special Olympics—and millions of people around the world are committed to its programs. Some are sponsors or donors. Many others are coaches, event volunteers and fans.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Who_We_Are/Our_Volunteers.aspx |title=Volunteer for Special Olympics |work=specialolympics.org |access-date=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

Coaches help the athletes be the best they can be regardless of ability—or disability. Special Olympics trains coaches through the Coaching Excellence program, which includes partnering with sports organizations. Special Olympics volunteers are introduced to lifetime friendships and great rewards.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

There are many events in which families and volunteers participate, but the biggest event is the [[Law Enforcement Torch Run]], which involves police chiefs, police officers, secret service, FBI agents, military police, sheriffs, state troopers, prison guards, and other law enforcement personnel assembling to raise awareness and funds for Special Olympics. Ahead of a Special Olympics competition, [[law enforcement]] officers carry the torch in intervals along a planned route covering most of the state or country to the site of the opening [[ceremonies]] of the chapter or Special Olympics World Summer or Winter Games. Then they pass the torch to a Special Olympics athlete and together they run up to the cauldron and light it, signifying the beginning of the games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.disabled-world.com/sports/special-olympics/flame-of-hope.php |title=Special Olympics Flame of Hope |date=2017-12-24 |website=Disabled World |language=en-US |access-date=2018-07-18}}</ref>

The Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/eunice-kennedy-shriver-1921-2009-she-changed-the-world-for-people-with-mental-disabilities-128100168/115313.html |title=Eunice Kennedy Shriver, 1921–2009: She Changed the World for People with Mental Disabilities |publisher=Learningenglish.voanews.com |date=2011-08-19 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> is "Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt." The origin of the oath came from Herbert J. Kramer, then Public Relations Advisor to the Kennedy Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bisd.us/specialservices/oath.htm |title=Origin of the Athlete Oath|access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somd.org/Volunteer/Volunteer_General_Orientation_-_September_2012.pdf |title=Volunteer General Orientation – Special Olympics Maryland |access-date=2016-06-12}}</ref>

==Sports offered==
In 1968, track and field, swimming and floor hockey were the first three official sports offered by Special Olympics. As in the Olympics, events are introduced in training and then added to the competitive schedule, and from there the list of sports and events continued to grow.

Special Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. As of 2016, these are:<ref name=SO-Our-Sports>{{cite web | url = http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/Sports-and-Games/Sports_and_Games.aspx | title = Our Sports | website = Special Olympics | publisher = The Joseph P.

Other sports and sports-related programs include the Motor Activity Training Program<ref name=SO-Our-Sports/> and Beach Volleyball. Availability of sports can depend on location and season.

A key difference between Special Olympics competitions and those of other sports organizations is that athletes of all ability levels are encouraged to participate. Competitions are structured so that athletes compete with other athletes of similar ability in equitable divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resources.specialolympics.org/Topics/Sports/Divisioning.aspx |title=Special Olympics: Divisioning |publisher=Resources.specialolympics.org |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> An athlete's ability is the primary factor in divisioning Special Olympics competitions. The ability of an athlete or team is determined by an entry score from a prior competition or the result of a seeding round or preliminary event at the competition itself. Other factors that are significant in establishing competitive divisions are age and gender.

At competitions, medals are awarded to the first, second and third-place winners in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.specialolympics.org/specialo.org/Special_/English/Coach/Coaching/Basics_o/Special_.htm#principles |title=Special Olympics: Sports and Games |publisher=Sports.specialolympics.org |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

==Unified Sports==
In recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates.<ref name="specialolympics1">{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/unified-sports.aspx |title=Unified Sports |publisher=Special Olympics |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref> The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The program has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports.<ref> {{Cite web|date=2018-08-03|title=Unified Sports|url=https://www.specialolympics.org/our-work/sports/unified-sports|access-date=2020-07-03|website=SpecialOlympics.org|language=en}}</ref> The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity.<ref name="specialolympics1"/>

Building on this, Special Olympics launched "The Revolution Is Inclusion," inviting people worldwide to sign the Inclusion Pledge.<ref>jointherevolution.org/pledge</ref>. This campaign aimed at celebrating all abilities began as Special Olympics marked its 50th anniversary.<ref>jointherevolution.org</ref> 

A recent study of Special Olympics Unified Sports in Serbia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and Hungary documented the benefits of Unified Sports, including the effect of changing attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. As one Unified Sports partner said, "I am ashamed to say that I used to laugh at these people (people with intellectual disabilities), now I will tell anybody to stop laughing if I see it and I will stand up for people if I can."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url = http://www.specialolympics.org/uploadedFiles/LandingPage/WhatWeDo/Final%20Report%20Unified%20Sports10%20Sept%202010.pdf|title = Unified Gives Us a Chance|access-date = June 4, 2017|website = specialolympics.org}}</ref> Other evaluations have also shown Unified Sports to be successful in building self-esteem and confidence in people with intellectual disabilities and also as a way to improve understanding and acceptance of people with intellectual disabilities among their non-disabled peers.<ref name=":1"/>

As part of their 50th anniversary, the Special Olympics created the first Unified Cup.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.specialolympics.org/50th/FirstEverUnifiedCup.aspx |title=Countdown to the Special Olympics Unified Cup |website=Special Olympics |language=en |access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>  The first competition is a [[soccer]] tournament with 440 athletes from 24 countries.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/07/17/special-olympics-50th-anniversary-2/ |title=400 Athletes Converge On Chicago For Special Olympics Anniversary |last=Victory |first=Lauren |date=2018-07-17 |work=CBS  |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/sports/special-olympics-unified-cup-kicks-off-tuesday/3771888/ |title=Special Olympics Unified Cup kicks off Tuesday |last=Varon |first=Roz |date=2018-07-16 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=2018-07-19 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Unified Robotics, a program that pairs Special Olympics students with [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST Robotics]] students to build robots, began in 2016, and has been bringing opportunities for technological skill development to Special Olympics students in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], Arizona, and in other regions since. Special Olympics Arizona also promotes inclusion through Unified Arts programming including robotics, music, photography, art competitions, and gardening.<ref>{{cite web |title=About – Special Olympics |url=http://unifiedrobotics.org/about/ |website=Special Olympics |access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>

==Healthy Athletes==
As Special Olympics began to grow, staffers and volunteers began to notice that athletes—children and adults with intellectual disabilities—also had many untreated health problems. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes, which offers health screenings to athletes in need.<ref name="specialolympics2">{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/healthy_athletes.aspx |title=Health Programs |publisher=Special Olympics |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

Healthy Athletes currently offers health screenings in eight areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUNfitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision), Special Smiles (dentistry), Strong Minds (Emotional Health). Screenings educate athletes on health and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUNfitness Program assess flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the areas screened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Sections/What_We_Do/Healthy_Athletes/Healthy_Athletes_FUNfitness.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Healthy Athletes FUNfitness|website=www.specialolympics.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref>

Since the Healthy Athletes program began, Special Olympics has become the largest global public health organization dedicated to serving people with intellectual disabilities. So far, more than 1.9 million Healthy Athletes screenings have been conducted for people with intellectual disabilities all around the world.<ref name="specialolympics2" />

The Special Olympics health initiative has attracted high-profile partners, including the Hear the World Foundation, which screened more than 1,000 athletes during the most recent World Winter Games in Korea; more than 200 of them were found to have hearing loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hear-the-world.com/en/how-we-help/projects-worldwide/projects-2013/special-olympics.html |title=Special Olympics |publisher=Hear The World |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/Healthy_Athletes/Forms/Healthy_Athletes_Stories.aspx |title=Healthy Athletes Stories |publisher=Special Olympics |access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref>

In 2012, the Special Olympics Healthy Communities initiative launched in eight countries—Kazakhstan, Malawi, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Romania, South Africa and Thailand, as well as six U.S. states. The goal is to improve the health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities and allow them to reach their full potential.<ref name=":2"/>

==Criticism==
Scholar Keith Storey summarized common objections in a 2004 article in ''Journal of Disability Policy Studies''. One criticism directed at the organization pertains to the role that corporate sponsors play in it, which critics feel has led to degrading [[paternalism]] toward athletic ability. While corporate fundraising makes the games possible, critics argue, it provides good public relations for the sponsors, but does not result in integration of people with disabilities into the workforce at those companies. People with disabilities are also not widely represented on the Special Olympics' board of directors, as only two members have disabilities. This has been criticized as a double standard that reflects poorly on the [[disability rights movement]] where people with disabilities control the service delivery system rather than relying on people without disabilities.<ref name="Storey">{{cite journal|last = Storey|first = Keith|title = The Case Against the Special Olympics|journal = Journal of Disability Policy Studies|year = 2004|volume = 15|issue = 1|pages = 35–42|doi = 10.1177/10442073040150010601|s2cid = 144279463}}</ref>
