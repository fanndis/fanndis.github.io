==History==
Bill and Flora Hewlett consolidated their philanthropic activity into the William R. Hewlett Foundation, which Bill, aged 53, founded in 1966 in their [[Palo Alto, California]], home.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/on-the-web/william-and-flora-hewlett-foundation | title=William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | last= | first= | date=2 January 2002 | website=Philanthropy News Digest | accessdate=19 March 2020 }}</ref> Founding board members were Bill, Flora, and the couple's oldest son, Walter Hewlett. The years 1966-1972 were referred to as "the living room years".<ref name="Hewlett">{{cite web | url=https://www.grantforward.com/sponsor/detail/william-and-flora-hewlett-foundation-2172 | title=William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | last= | first= | date= | website=grantforward | accessdate=19 March 2020 }}</ref> Flora Hewlett served as a board member and Bill Hewlett was an active part of the foundation until his death. Bill Hewlett sought to fund established organizations operating in his fields of interest. In its first ten years, the foundation awarded close to $15.3 million to organizations involved in education, population, performing arts, environment, health, and social services.<ref>{{cite book | last= | first= | date=October 1999 | title=Neighborhood Networks Funding Guide | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kq1AF8Pg3qMC&q=hewlett+foundation+AND+awarded+grants+to+organisation&pg=PA29 | location= | publisher= | page=29 | isbn= }}</ref>

In 1972, the foundation's board of directors was expanded with the addition of William A. Hewlett and James S. Hewlett. In 1974, the foundation hired its first executive director, John May, who was also the executive of the San Francisco Foundation.<ref name="Hewlett" /> Following Flora Hewlett's death in 1977, and in her memory, the foundation's name was changed to "The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation".<ref>{{cite book | last=Nielsen | first=Waldemar A. | date=2002 | title=Golden Donors A New Anatomy of the Great Foundations | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx4uDwAAQBAJ&q=flora+hewlett+AND+died+AND+foundation+changed+name&pg=PT263 | location=New York | publisher=Routledge | page= | isbn= 9781351516938}}</ref> Shortly after, the foundation appointed former [[University of California]] Chancellor [[Roger W. Heyns]] as president, with Bill Hewlett becoming the board chair.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/obituaries/roger-w-heyns-77-head-of-berkeley-in-the-60-s.html | title=Roger W.

Since 1981, the majority of the foundation's board has been composed of non-family members.<ref name="Hewlett" />

The foundation has received credit for its work in the areas of [[conflict resolution]], [[education]], [[environmental protection]], [[performing arts]], and as a supporter of organizations in the Bay Area.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/fundraising-bay-area-grants | title=Bay Area & NorCal: Funders | last= | first= | date= | website=Inside Philanthropy | accessdate=31 March 2020 }}</ref>

In 1993, with the appointment of former [[University of California]] President [[David P.

The foundation expanded its funding of environmental causes, formerly restricted to California, to all over the [[Western United States]] and [[Canada]]. The foundation also began focusing on [[K-12]] education reforms. Gardner introduced a new program supporting relations between the [[United States|US]] and [[Latin America]]. Gardner served for six years.<ref name="History">{{cite web | url=https://hewlett.org/about-us/hewlett-family-and-history/ | title=The Hewlett Family and Foundation History | last= | first= | date= | website=William and Flora Hewlett Foundation | accessdate=23 April 2020 }}</ref>

During Gardner's tenure, the foundation introduced the limitation of terms served as program officers with terms expiring after six years, followed by an extension of three years with board approval. In 2005, this term limit was extended to eight years.<ref name="History" />

In January 2000, [[Paul Brest]], the former dean of [[Stanford Law School]], was appointed as the new president of the foundation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/1999/may26/brest526.html | title=Brest to head Hewlett Foundation; reinforces commitment to Irvine initiative | last=Ray | first=Elaine | date=26 May 1999 | website=Stanford University | accessdate=27 April 2020 }}</ref> He served for 12 years.
