'''Newman''', originally named '''Mount Newman''' until 1981, is a town in the [[Pilbara region of Western Australia]].  It is located about {{Convert|1186|km}} north of [[Perth]], and {{convert|9|km}} north of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]].  It can be reached by the [[Great Northern Highway]]. Newman is a modern mining town, with homes contrasting with the surrounding reddish desert. The [[Hickman Crater]] is {{convert|35|km}} north of Newman.

==History==
[[File:Mt-Newman.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Mount Newman]]
Newman was established as Mount Newman by Mt. Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of [[BHP Billiton|BHP]]) in 1966 as a company town to support the development of iron ore deposits at nearby [[Mount Whaleback mine|Mount Whaleback]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 3 -Newman |url=https://www.landcorp.com.au/Documents/Corporate/Pilbara%20Vernacular/Part-3-NEWMAN.pdf |website=Pilbara Vernacular Handbook |publisher=LandCorp |accessdate=21 December 2016|location=Perth, WA|page=3|format=pdf}}</ref> The town takes its name from nearby Mount Newman, named in honour of government surveyor Aubrey Woodward Newman (son of [[Edward Newman (Australian politician)|Edward Newman]] who also died young) who died of typhoid aged 28 at [[Cue, Western Australia|Cue]] on 24 May 1896, while on an expedition from [[Nannine]] to the [[Ophthalmia Range]]. William Frederick Rudall then took charge of the expedition and named Mount Newman to honour his deceased leader.<ref>{{cite news|title=Death of Mr. A.

Aboriginal occupation of the area extends to around 26,000 years. The Martu people comprise about a dozen language groups that extend across the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts. The Martu progressively lost their land and nomadic lifestyle as European expansion crept inland from the late 19th Century. Western exploration, the establishment of Christian missions, and gold discoveries at [[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]] and [[Wiluna, Western Australia|Wiluna]] led to Indigenous people moving from their traditional lands.

==Commercial area and amenities==

Typical of company towns, Newman is laid out with a core, where shopping and hotels are located, surrounded by residential areas, with more industrial activities on the outskirts. There are two supermarkets in town (one [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and an [[IGA (Australian supermarket group)|IGA]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laneind.com.au/projects/parnawarri-iga-newman/|title=Parnawarri IGA, Newman - Lane Industries - Supermarket Shop Fitters|website=laneind.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref>), two shopping plazas, three hotels, and three bars/restaurants outside of those contained in the hotels. One public outdoor pool serves the town's population.

In late 2017, Parnawarri Retail centre (Parnawarri meaning "united" or "all together" in [[Nyiyaparli language|Nyiyaparli]])<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/north-west-telegraph/retail-centre-boost-for-town-ng-b88651458z|title=Retail centre boost for town|date=2017-11-17|work=The West Australian|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-GB}}</ref> was opened and housed the towns second supermarket ([[IGA (Australian supermarket group)|IGA]]) as well as a [[Dôme (coffeehouse)|Dome]] coffeehouse, SportsPower and a [[Chicken Treat]]. [[BHP]] invested $30 million to build the retail centre.<ref name=":0" />

The town contains Newman Primary School, South Newman Primary School, [[Newman Senior High School]], and Rawa Community School.

==Transport and infrastructure==
[[File:Newman, Pilbara, Western Australia.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Iron deposits]]
Newman is located at the end of route 138 meeting the [[Great Northern Highway]].

The town is served by [[Newman Airport]].

A privately owned railway, the [[Mount Newman railway]], was constructed linking it to [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] which itself was upgraded to handle shipment of the ore to the world market. On 21 June 2001 a train {{convert|7.353|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, comprising 682 ore cars and eight locomotives made the Newman—Port Hedland trip and is listed as the world's longest ever train.<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/hamersley/ Hamersley Freight Line, Australia] railway-technology.com, accessed: 4 November 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/bhp-breaks-its-own-39heaviest-train39-record/browse/3.html BHP breaks its own heaviest train record] ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'', published: 1 August 2001, accessed: 5 November 2010</ref> The ore trains are typically over 2&nbsp;km long. Newman is also a service town to the nearby mining settlements like [[Tom Price, Western Australia|Tom Price]] and [[Paraburdoo, Western Australia|Paraburdoo]].

Electricity is supplied by [[Alinta]] from its 180 MW gas-fired power station with a 30MW/11MWh Kokam battery at Newman. The station also supplies the [[Roy Hill]] mine,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parkinson |first1=Giles |title=Kokam commissions 30MW battery to help supply Gina Rinehart mine |url=https://reneweconomy.com.au/kokam-commissions-30mw-battery-to-help-supply-gina-rinehart-mine-35647/ |website=RenewEconomy |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20201028171516/https://reneweconomy.com.au/kokam-commissions-30mw-battery-to-help-supply-gina-rinehart-mine-35647/ |archivedate=28 October 2020 |language=en-AU |date=10 April 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Architecture==
Being founded in the 1960s, Newman's architecture reflects the modernist styles of that decade and the next, being predominantly functional and devoid of detail or embellishment. As the town was founded and built by a steel company, the majority of buildings use a steel frame construction. This applies to the homes themselves, most of them being two [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] halves inserted together into a steel I-section frame, the columns of which are left exposed on the exterior of the home.  This construction method serves not only to showcase the company's product, but also gives strong resistance to [[cyclone]] winds which can affect the region from time to time. For this same reason most houses are elevated from the ground by a few steps. Many houses also have large air-conditioning units situated next to them to provide adequate cooling against the very hot summer temperatures.

==Climate==
Newman has a [[semi-arid climate]], with very hot summers and mild winters. The temperature reaches or exceeds {{convert|38|C}} for many days in the summer. On 15 January 1998, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of {{convert|47|C}}.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is sparse, but the influx of monsoonal moisture in the summer, which generally begins in December and lasts until April, raises humidity levels and can cause occasional heavy storms. Winter months are mild to warm, with daily high temperatures ranging from the {{convert|20|C}} to {{convert|26|C}}, and low (nighttime) temperatures rarely dipping below {{convert|6|C}}.
