'''Cindy Lou Hensley McCain''' (born May 20, 1954)<ref name="trib-bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-041408-cindy-mccain-bio,1,2151434.story |title=Bio of Cindy Hensley McCain |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> is an American [[businessperson|businesswoman]], [[philanthropist]], and [[humanitarian]]. She is the widow of [[United States Senator]] and 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee [[John McCain]] from [[Arizona]] and the mother of television host and commentator [[Meghan McCain]].

She was born and raised in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] as the daughter of wealthy beer distributor [[Jim Hensley]]. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees from the [[University of Southern California]], she became a [[Special education in the United States|special education teacher]]. She married John McCain in 1980, and the couple moved to Arizona in 1981, where her husband was elected to the United States Congress the following year and reelected five more times. The couple had three children together, in addition to adopting another. From 1988 to 1995, she founded and operated a nonprofit organization, the American Voluntary Medical Team, which organized trips by medical personnel to disaster-stricken or war-torn third-world areas.

Upon her father's death in 2000, she inherited majority control and became [[Chair (official)|chair]] of [[Hensley & Co.]], one of the largest [[Anheuser-Busch]] beer distributors in the United States. She participated in both of her husband's presidential campaigns and, in 2008, drew both positive and negative scrutiny for her appearance, demeanor, wealth, spending habits, and financial obligations. She continues to be an active philanthropist and serves on the boards of [[Operation Smile]], [[Eastern Congo Initiative]], [[CARE (relief)|CARE]], and [[HALO Trust]], frequently making overseas trips in conjunction with their activities. During the 2010s, she has become prominent in the fight against [[human trafficking]]. From 2017 until his death the following year, she dealt with her husband's battle against [[glioblastoma]].

In 1989, McCain developed an addiction to [[Percocet]] and [[Vicodin]].<ref name="az-rebound"/> She initially took the [[opioid]] [[painkillers]] to alleviate [[pain]] after two spinal surgeries for [[Spinal disc herniation|ruptured discs]].<ref name="wapo091208"/><ref name="cnn112299">{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/11/22/cindy.mccain/index.html | title=Cindy McCain stays on an even keel | author=Bill Delaney | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=November 22, 1999 | accessdate=January 12, 2008}}</ref> She also used the drugs to ease emotional stress during the [[Keating Five|Keating Five scandal]].<ref name="az-rebound">{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter8.html |title=John McCain Report: Overcoming scandal, moving on |author1=Dan Nowicki |author2=Bill Muller |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 23, 2007}}</ref>  The addiction progressed to where she was taking upwards of twenty pills a day,<ref name="nw063008"/> and she resorted to having an AVMT physician write illegal prescriptions in the names of three AVMT employees without their knowledge.<ref name="alexander"/><ref name="wapo091208"/>  In 1992, her parents staged an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] to force her to get help;<ref name="nyt030200"/> she told her husband about her problem and subsequently attended a drug treatment facility where she began outpatient sessions to begin recovery from drug addiction.<ref name="az-rebound"/>  In 1993, she underwent surgery, which resolved her back pain.<ref name="az-rebound"/><ref name="alexander-more"/>

The severity of her husband's illness led to the possibility that he would not be able to finish his term in office and that the Governor of Arizona would have to appoint a successor until a special election could be held.

They're a military family first and a political family second."<ref name="pol-influence"/>  Nonetheless she still wielded some influence in terms of who would be picked.<ref name="pol-influence">{{cite news | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/28/cindy-mccain-arizona-senate-ducey-799200 | title=Cindy McCain wields quiet influence over Senate replacement | first=Christopher | last=Cadelago | first2=Daniel | last2=Strauss | first3=Daniel | last3=Lippman | work=[[Politico]] | date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>  On September 4, Ducey – who had by this time easily won the Republican gubernatorial primary – appointed former Arizona senator [[Jon Kyl]] to the seat, in a choice that was satisfactory to all factions within the state Republican party.<ref name="pol-kyl"/>  McCain referred to Kyl as "a dear friend of mine and John's.

==Later activities==
Following her husband's death, McCain moved back to her childhood neighborhood.<ref name="wapo-year"/>  She became chair of the McCain Institute's Board of Trustees.<ref name="parade-year">{{cite news | url=https://parade.com/915803/alexandra-hurtado/cindy-mccain-interview/ | title=One Year Later, Cindy McCain Remembers Late Husband John McCain: 'You Learn to Live With a Broken Heart' | first=Alexandra | last=Hurtado | magazine=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] | date=August 26, 2019}}</ref>  She also joined the family's #ActsofCivility campaign, with the aim of encouraging people to interact with those they disagree with.<ref name="parade-year"/>

In February 2019, she faced backlash after making claims on [[KTAR-FM]] that she saw human trafficking at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]]. Police rejected her claims, stating that there was "no evidence of criminal conduct or child endangerment". She later apologized in a tweet and praised police officers.<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/cindy-mccain-human-trafficking-phoenix-police/index.html</ref><ref>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-refute-cindy-mccain-s-claim-child-airport-was-trafficked-n968726</ref>

She continued to be critical of the state of American politics. In September 2019, she declaimed the Republican Party as "excluding people for the wrong reasons" and said it was no longer "the party that my husband and I belonged to."<ref name="msn-gop">{{cite news | url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/cindy-mccain-says-gop-no-longer-the-party-that-my-husband-and-i-belonged-to/ar-AAHPOZG | title=Cindy McCain says GOP no longer the 'party that my husband and I belonged to'  | first=Jamie | last=Ehrlich | agency=[[CNN]] | publisher=[[MSN]] | date=September 25, 2019}}</ref>  In contrast, with the [[2020 United States presidential election]] underway, she praised Democratic presidential front-runner [[Joe Biden]] and his wife [[Jill Biden]], saying that they were good friends to her and that "Joe has been a remarkable source of inspiration, kindness and just a shoulder throughout all of this."<ref name="msn-gop"/> In June 2020, McCain stated that she would not endorse the [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|incumbent's re-election campaign]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/politics/trump-biden-republicans-voters.html | title=These Republican Leaders Aren't on the Bandwagon | author-first=Jonathan | author-last=Martin | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 6, 2020}}</ref> While not explicitly endorsing Biden at the time, McCain spoke in a video segment shown at the August [[2020 Democratic National Convention]] about the friendship between her late husband and Biden.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cindy McCain details husband's friendship with Biden for DNC |url=https://apnews.com/2ab413939e3747215da2c34dcbd323cf |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 18, 2020 |author-first=Alexandra | author-last=Jaffe}}</ref> On September 22, McCain gave her full endorsement to [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|Biden's presidential candidacy]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bradner |first1=Eric |last2=Mucha |first2=Sarah |title=Cindy McCain endorses Joe Biden |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/politics/joe-biden-cindy-mccain-endorse/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=September 22, 2020}}</ref> McCain's endorsement, and the bad relationship between the incumbent and her late husband, has been given as one of a number of reasons why Biden was able to narrowly win the [[2020 United States presidential election in Arizona]].<ref name="joe-wins-az"/> In doing so Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1996, and only the second since 1948, to do so.<ref name="joe-wins-az">{{cite news | url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/biden-wins-arizona/index.html | title=Biden carries Arizona, flipping a longtime Republican stronghold | author-first=Dan | author-last=Merica | publisher=CNN | date=November 13, 2020}}</ref>
