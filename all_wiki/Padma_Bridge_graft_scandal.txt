The '''Padma Bridge graft scandal''' was a political scandal in [[Bangladesh]] during 2016 and 2017, involving the [[Bangladesh Awami League]] and the [[Padma Bridge]], a {{convert|6.51|km|adj=on|sp=us}} road—rail bridge across the [[Padma River]] and Bangladesh's largest bridge.

[[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] were to have financed the project with $1.2 billion (£764 million) of credit, but they pulled out citing corruption concerns, specifically that Canadian construction company [[SNC-Lavalin]] had bribed a Bangladeshi official in exchange for a construction contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-18655846|title=World Bank cancels Bangladesh bridge loan over corruption|date=30 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref>

Two SNC-Lavalin executives were charged in Canada, but after the court excluded wiretap evidence the prosecution withdrew and the court dismissed the case.<ref name="thedailystar.net">{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/world/north-america/canada-court-finds-no-proof-padma-bridge-graft-conspiracy-1359397|title=Canada court finds no proof of Padma bridge bribery conspiracy|date=11 February 2017|website=The Daily Star|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>

== World Bank personal statement ==
The World Bank has published a detailed statement about their allegation of corruption relating to the [[Padma Bridge]] and their subsequent pullout from the financing of the project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/06/29/world-bank-statement-padma-bridge|title=World Bank Statement on Padma Bridge|newspaper=World Bank|language=en|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> They have also published a FAQ ("Frequently Asked Questions" document) in order to better explain their position and activities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/07/17/frequently-asked-questions-related-to-the-cancellation-of-world-bank-credit-for-padma-multipurpose-bridge-project|title=Frequently Asked Questions Related to the Cancellation of the World Bank Credit for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project|newspaper=World Bank|language=en|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref>

The World Bank alleged that there had been a "conspiracy" plotted to stage a high-level corruption in the project:

<blockquote>''The World Bank has credible evidence corroborated by a variety of sources which points to a high-level corruption conspiracy among Bangladeshi government officials, SNC Lavalin executives, and private individuals in connection with the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project.''</blockquote>

They have provided the Bangladeshi government with evidence of the corruption plot and stated that they couldn't advance forward with the loan if no action was taken:

<blockquote>''To be willing to go forward with the alternative turnkey-style approach, they sought the following actions: (i) place all public officials suspected of involvement in the corruption scheme on leave from Government employment until the investigation is completed; (ii) appoint a special inquiry team within the ACC to handle the investigation, and (iii) agree to provide full and adequate access to all investigative information to a panel appointed by the World Bank composed of internationally recognized experts so that the panel can give guidance to the lenders on the progress, adequacy, and fairness of the investigation.  We worked extensively with the Government and the ACC to ensure that all actions requested were fully aligned with Bangladeshi laws and procedures''.</blockquote>

They also said that they sent a delegation to the Government of Bangladesh to seek an explanation from them, but the explanation from the Bangladeshi side was unsatisfactory:

<blockquote>''... we sent a high-level team to Dhaka to fully explain the Bank’s position and receive the Government’s response. The response has been unsatisfactory at the time.''</blockquote>

== Dismissal of charges by a Canadian court and Bangladesh ACC==

In 2015, Bangladesh's [[Anti-Corruption Commission (Bangladesh)|Anti-Corruption Commission]] (ACC) investigated the case after the [[World Bank]] continuously pushed the government to take action against the alleged perpetrators. After 53 days of investigation, ACC found nobody to be guilty. On the basis of ACC's report, Dhaka district judge court acquitted all the seven government officials who were alleged to have been involved in the corruption plot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/all-padma-bridge-graft-accused-acquitted-47466|title=All Padma bridge graft accused acquitted|date=26 October 2014|newspaper=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> Before that, the ACC exonerated [[Syed Abul Hossain]] and ex-state minister for foreign affairs [[Abul Hasan Chowdhury]] from the allegation of involvement in the corruption conspiracy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/10/27/63153/print|title=The Financialexpress-bd|website=print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com|access-date=26 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031054/http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/10/27/63153/print|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
