'''Nicolas Paul Stéphane Sarközy<!-- Please do not add an acute accent on the a --> de Nagy-Bocsa<!--Please do not add an acute accent on the o-->''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɑːr|ˈ|k|oʊ|z|i}}; {{IPA-fr|nikɔla pɔl stefan saʁkɔzi də naʒi bɔksa|lang|Sarkozy.ogg}};<!--Please do not add a stress mark: French is not stressed in this way (see the talk page)--> born 28 January 1955) is a retired French politician who served as [[President of France]] and ''ex officio'' [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince of Andorra]] from 16 May 2007 until 15 May 2012.

Born in [[Paris]], he is of one half Hungarian Protestant, one quarter Greek Jewish, and one quarter French Catholic origin. Mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] from 1983 to 2002, he was [[Ministry of the Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of the Budget]] under Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]] (1993–1995) during [[François Mitterrand]]'s second term. During [[Jacques Chirac's second term as President of France|Jacques Chirac's second presidential term]] he served as [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] and as [[Minister of Finances (France)|Minister of Finances]]. He was the leader of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) party from 2004 to 2007.

He won the [[2007 French presidential election]] by a 53.1% to 46.9% margin against Socialist [[Ségolène Royal]]. During his term, he faced the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] (causing a [[Late-2000s recession|recession]], the [[European debt crisis|European sovereign debt crisis]]), the [[Russo-Georgian War]] (for which he negotiated a ceasefire) and the [[Arab Spring]] (especially in [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]]). He initiated the [[Liberties and Responsibilities of Universities (France)|reform of French universities]] (2007) and the [[Pensions in France|pension reform]] (2010). He married Italian-French singer-songwriter [[Carla Bruni]] in 2008 at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris.

In the [[2012 French presidential election|2012 election]], [[François Hollande]], candidate of the Socialist Party, defeated Sarkozy by a 3.2% margin. After leaving the presidential office, Sarkozy vowed to retire from public life before coming back in 2014, being subsequently reelected as UMP leader (renamed [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in 2015). Being defeated at the [[The Republicans (France) presidential primary, 2016|Republican presidential primary]] in 2016, he retired from public life. He has been charged with [[Political corruption|corruption]] by French prosecutors in two cases, notably concerning the [[Alleged Libyan financing in the 2007 French presidential election|alleged Libyan interference in the 2007 French elections]].

== Personal life ==
=== Family background ===
{{Main|Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy}}

Sarkozy was born in Paris, and is the son of [[Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy|Pál István Ernő Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa]]{{NoteTag|"Sarkozy" is the westernized, or internationalized, version of his Hungarian name. In Hungarian the given name comes last rather than first. The French aristocratic particle "de" is also used instead of the Hungarian aristocratic ending "-i". This westernization of Hungarian names is frequent, particularly for people with an aristocratic name. For example the leader of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, whose Hungarian name is nagybányai Horthy Miklós, is known in English as [[Miklós Horthy|Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya]]. The French name of Pál Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa changed in 1948 to Paul Étienne Arnaud Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa, when Pál was translated as Paul in French, and the acute accents on the "a" of Sarközy and the "o" of Bocsa were dropped as these letters never carry an acute accent (''accent aigu'') in French. The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] on the "o" of Sárközy was kept, probably because French typewriters allow this combination, whereas it is impossible to write "a" or "o" with an acute accent using a French typewriter.}} ({{lang-hu|<!--Leave the lower case 'n' please, it's not an error!-->nagybócsai Sárközy Pál}}; {{IPA-hu|ˈnɒɟboːt͡ʃɒi ˈʃaːrkøzi ˈpaːl||Pal_sarkozy.ogg}}—in some sources ''Nagy-Bócsay Sárközy Pál István Ernő''),<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/opinion/15tue4.html | title = The New French President's Roots Are Worth Remembering | date =15 May 2007 | accessdate=28 September 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Serge | last=Schmemann}}</ref> (born 5 May 1928), a [[Protestant]] [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and [[Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy|Andrée Jeanne "Dadu" Mallah]] (12 October 1925 – 12 December 2017),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ledauphine.com/france-monde/2017/12/13/la-mere-de-nicolas-sarkozy-andre-mallah-dite-dadu-est-morte | title= La mère de Nicolas Sarkozy, Andrée Mallah dite "Dadu", est morte | date=13 December 2017 | publisher=Le Dauphiné | accessdate=20 July 2020 }}</ref> whose [[Greek Jews|Greek Jewish]] father converted to Catholicism to marry Sarkozy's French Catholic maternal grandmother.<ref name=BBCProf>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm |title=Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/22741|title=A Greek book on Nicolas Sarkozy|publisher=The European Jewish Press|accessdate=12 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417061636/http://www.ejpress.org/article/22741|archivedate=17 April 2008}}</ref> They were married in the Saint-François-de-Sales church, [[17th arrondissement of Paris]], on 8 February 1950, and divorced in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/noble/sarkozy.html |title=Ancestry of Nicolas Sarkozy |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner |accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref>

===Early life===
During Sarkozy's childhood, his father founded his own advertising agency and became wealthy. The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy's maternal grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the [[17th arrondissement]] of Paris. The family later moved to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], one of the wealthiest [[Commune in France|communes]] of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] ''[[Régions in France|région]]'' immediately west of Paris. According to Sarkozy, his staunchly [[Gaullist]] grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was raised Catholic.<ref name=BBCProf/>

Sarkozy said that being abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today. He also has said that, in his early years, he felt inferior in relation to his wealthier and taller classmates.<ref name="cath_nay"/> "What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood", he said later.<ref name="cath_nay"/>

===Education===
Sarkozy was enrolled in the ''[[Lycée Chaptal]]'', a well regarded public middle and high school in Paris' [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]], where he failed his ''[[Education in France#Secondary education|sixième]]''. His family then sent him to the ''Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau'', a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre student,<ref name="cath_nay"/> but where he nonetheless obtained his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1973.

Sarkozy enrolled at the ''[[University of Paris X: Nanterre|Université Paris X Nanterre]]'', where he graduated with an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[private law]] and, later, with a [[DEA (former French degree)|D.E.A.]] degree in business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the [[May 1968 events in France|May '68]] student movement and was still a stronghold of [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organization, in which he was very active.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} He completed his military service as a part-time [[French Air Force|Air Force]] cleaner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnours.com/2008/07/le-service-mili.html |title=Le service militaire de Sakozy |publisher=Nousnours |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214025105/http://www.newsnours.com/2008/07/le-service-mili.html |archivedate=14 February 2010  }}</ref>

After graduating from university, Sarkozy entered [[Sciences Po]], where he studied between 1979 and 1981, but failed to graduate<ref>Augustin Scalbert, [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/18/un-soupcon-de-vantardise-sur-les-cv-ministeriels Un soupçon de vantardise sur les CV ministériels], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 18 September 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> due to an insufficient command of the English language.<ref name="cath_nay">''Un pouvoir nommé désir'', [[Catherine Nay]], 2007</ref>

===Marriages===

====Marie-Dominique Culioli====
Sarkozy married his first wife, Marie-Dominique Culioli, on 23 September 1982; her father was a [[pharmacist]] from [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]] (a village north of [[Ajaccio]], Corsica), her uncle was [[Achille Peretti]], the mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] from 1947 to 1983 and Sarkozy's political mentor.

==Early political career==
Sarkozy is recognized by French parties on both the Right and Left as a skilled politician and striking [[orator]].<ref>"French Populism", by Ignacio Ramonet, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], June 2007 Edition, [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2007/06/RAMONET/14842 French version] {{in lang|fr}}, [http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/053107G.shtml English translation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612221707/http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/053107G.shtml |date=12 June 2007 }}</ref> His supporters within France emphasize his [[charisma]], political innovation and willingness to "make a dramatic break" amid mounting disaffection against "politics as usual". Overall, he is considered more pro-American and pro-Israeli than most French politicians.

From 2004 to 2007, Sarkozy was president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP), France's major right-wing political party, and he was [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] in the government of Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], with the honorific title of [[Minister of State]], making him effectively the number three official in the French State after President [[Jacques Chirac]] and Villepin. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Worship]]: in this role he created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]] (CFCM). Previously, he was a député in the [[French National Assembly]]. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including [[Finance Minister]].

===In Government: 1993–1995===
Sarkozy's political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. A member of the [[Neo-Gaullist]] party RPR, he went on to be elected [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor [[Achille Peretti]]. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. A more senior RPR councillor, [[Charles Pasqua]], wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy took that opportunity to propel himself into the office of mayor.<ref>''[[Le Parisien]]'', 11 January 2007</ref> He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].

In 1993, Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the "Human Bomb", a man who had taken small children hostage in a [[kindergarten]] in Neuilly.<ref name="NYTimesWin">{{cite news

At the same time, from 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]]. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a protégé of [[Jacques Chirac]]. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of €200&nbsp;billion (US$260&nbsp;billion) (FY 1994–1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP.{{NoteTag|See also [[:fr:Dette publique de la France|Dette publique de la France]] {{in lang|fr}}}} According to the [[Maastricht Treaty]], the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France's GDP.

In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed Édouard Balladur for [[President of France]]. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power.

However, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 parliamentary election]], as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader [[Philippe Séguin]] resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the [[1999 European Parliament election in France|1999 European Parliament election]], winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident [[Rally for France]] of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.

In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see [[2002 French presidential election]]), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for President in 1995.<ref>[http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html Sauced Sarkozy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902135114/http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html |date=2 September 2013 }} Felice E. Baker, The Dartmouth Independent, 31 October 2007</ref> Following Chirac's 14 July keynote speech on road safety, Sarkozy as interior minister pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads.

In the cabinet reshuffle of 30 April 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of [[Alain Juppé]] became clear.

In party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between ''sarkozystes'', such as Sarkozy's "first lieutenant", [[Brice Hortefeux]], and Chirac loyalists, such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].

Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]]) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]]. (As required by the constitution,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp#TITLE%20III |title=French Constitution, article 23 |publisher=Assemblee Nationale |access-date=9 March 2010 }}</ref> he had to resign as a deputy when he became minister in 2002.)

On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station ''[[France Info]]'' reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of [[Dominique de Villepin]] without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.

===First term as Minister of the Interior: 2002–2004===

Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004.

Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the [[Islam in France|Muslim community]]. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Conseil français du culte musulman]] ("French Council of the Muslim Faith"), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.<ref>''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|JO associations]]'', 28 May 2003</ref> In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public funds<ref>[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&sec=59&con=2 WorldWide Religious News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224071400/http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&sec=59&con=2 |date=24 December 2008 }}</ref> so that they are less reliant on money from outside France. It was not followed by any concrete measure.

===Minister of Finance: 2004===
During his short appointment as [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]], Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected ''libéralisme'' (a hands-off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state ''dirigisme'' (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]].

* In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in [[France Télécom]] from 50.4 percent to 41 percent.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thorel |first=Jerome |title=Le gouvernement finalise la privatisation de France Télécom |language=French |publisher=ZDNet France |date=1 September 2004 |url=http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/business/0,39020715,39169571,00.htm |accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref>
* Sarkozy backed a partial [[nationalisation]] of the large engineering company [[Alstom]] decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bruxelles valide le sauvetage d'Alstom |work=[[L'Expansion]] |publisher=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |location=France |language=French |date=22 September 2003 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/17.363.70036.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref>
* In June 2004, Sarkozy reached an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of two percent; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to one percent in September.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grande distribution&nbsp;: l'accord Sarkozy à moitié appliqué |work=L'Expansion |location=France |language=French |date=30 September 2004 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/2576.78716.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202200442/http://www.lexpansion.com/art/2576.78716.0.html |archivedate=2 December 2008 }}</ref>
* Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF ([[solidarity tax on wealth]]). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]]. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as [[Alain Madelin]], wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.<ref>{{cite news |last=Martine |first=Gilson |title=ISF, la tentation des députés |trans-title=press review |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |language=French |date=20 May 2004 |url=http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050208204557/http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archivedate=8 February 2005}}</ref>

===Second term as Minister of the Interior: 2005–2007===
[[File:2006 09 12 sarkozy 600.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior with U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], after their bilateral meeting in Washington, D.C., 12 September 2006]]
During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party.

{{Main|Response to the 2005 civil unrest in France}}
However, the [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest in autumn 2005]] put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from [[housing project]]s a "rabble" ''("[[wikt:racaille|racaille]]")'' in [[Argenteuil]] near Paris, and controversially suggested cleansing the minority suburbs with a [[Kärcher]]. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on "hoodlums" and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities [[Azouz Begag]].<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&objet_id=921072 Azouz Begag, principal opposant à Nicolas Sarkozy], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 2 November 2005 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants, <!--better/worse--> greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents.

===UMP leader: 2004–2007===
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit 14 December 2006 (15).jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy in 2006 with Cypriot opposition leader [[Nicos Anastasiades]]]]
Before he was elected President of France, Sarkozy was president of [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], the French conservative party, elected with 85 percent of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members increased significantly. In 2005, he supported a "yes" vote in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], but the "No" vote won.

Throughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France's economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://sarkozyblog.free.fr/index.php?2005/09/07/170-le-meilleur-pour-la-france |title = Interview with ''Le Monde'', 8 September 2005 |publisher=Sarkozy Blog |date=19 September 2004 |access-date=9 March 2010 }}</ref> Among other issues:
* he called for a simplified and "fairer" [[tax code|taxation system]], with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all ''direct'' taxes combined) at 50 percent of revenue;
* he approved measures reducing or denying social support to [[unemployment|unemployed]] workers who refuse work offered to them;
* he pressed for a reduction in the [[budget deficit]], claiming that the French state had been living off [[credit (finance)|credit]] for some time.

Such policies are what are called in France ''libéral'' (that is, in favour of [[laissez-faire]] economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, ''ultra-libéral''. Sarkozy rejects this label of ''libéral'' and prefers to call himself a pragmatist.

Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with [[:wikt:quota|quota]]s designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wanted to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enabled foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wanted to select the best students to the best curricula in France.

In early 2006, the [[French parliament]] adopted a controversial bill known as [[DADVSI]], which reforms [[French copyright law]]. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of [[peer-to-peer]] systems.

===Presidential election: 2007===

Sarkozy was a likely candidate for the presidency in 2007; in an oft-repeated comment made on television channel [[France 2]], when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, "Not just when I shave".<ref>[http://www.rtl.fr/rtlinfo/article.asp?dicid=159060 Broadcast of "France 2"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427000943/http://www.rtl.fr/rtlinfo/article.asp?dicid=159060 |date=27 April 2005 }}, 19 November 2003</ref>

On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was chosen by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy, who was running unopposed,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2288253&rubId=4076 |title=Boutin renonce à se présenter et soutient Sarkozy |work=La Croix |location=France |date=3 December 2006 |access-date=4 January 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084218/http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2288253&rubId=4076 |archive-date=29 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> won 98 percent of the votes. Of the 327,000 UMP members who could vote, 69 percent participated in the online ballot.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6260275.stm Sarkozy nod for presidential run]", ''BBC News'', 14 January 2007. Retrieved 14 January 2007.</ref>

In February 2007, Sarkozy appeared on a televised debate on [[TF1]] where he expressed his support for [[affirmative action]] and the freedom to work overtime. Despite his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], he advocated [[civil unions]] and the possibility for same-sex partners to inherit under the same regime as married couples. The law was voted in July 2007.{{NoteTag|It was included in the ''paquet fiscal'' that has been one of the first laws passed in Parliament.}}

On 7 February, Sarkozy decided in favour of a projected second, non-[[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[Future French aircraft carrier|aircraft carrier]] for the national Navy (adding to the nuclear ''[[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|Charles de Gaulle]]''), during an official visit in [[Toulon]] with Defence Minister [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]]. "This would allow permanently having an operational ship, taking into account the constraints of maintenance", he explained.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070712192502/http://www.marianne2007.info/index.php?id_plugin=266&path=newsAFP%2Fpage2News.php&ftpUrl=070207164849.bmmbl7vt.txt&pos=1&action=plugin Sarkozy pour un deuxième porte-avions français] (AFP)</ref>

On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac announced his support for Sarkozy. Chirac pointed out that Sarkozy had been chosen as presidential candidate for the ruling UMP party, and said: "So it is totally natural that I give him my vote and my support." To focus on his campaign, Sarkozy stepped down as interior minister on 26 March.<ref>[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/21/92845.shtml?s=os France's Jacques Chirac Backs Nicolas Sarkozy]. 21 March 2007.</ref>

During the campaign, rival candidates had accused Sarkozy of being a "candidate for brutality" and of presenting hard-line views about France's future.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6566649.stm French confused over the real Sarkozy]. 18 April 2007</ref> Opponents also accused him of courting conservative voters in policy-making in a bid to capitalise on right-wing sentiments among some communities. However, his popularity was sufficient to see him polling as the frontrunner throughout the later campaign period, consistently ahead of rival Socialist candidate, Ségolène Royal.

The first round of the presidential election was held on 22 April 2007. Sarkozy came in first with 31.18 percent of the votes, ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialists with 25.87 percent. In the second round, Sarkozy came out on top to win the election with 53.06 percent of the votes ahead of Ségolène Royal with 46.94 percent.<ref>Élection présidentielle de 2007—[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/FE.html résultats définitifs] French Ministry of the Interior</ref> In his speech immediately following the announcement of the election results, Sarkozy stressed the need for France's modernisation, but also called for national unity, mentioning that Royal was in his thoughts. In that speech, he claimed "The French have chosen to break with the ideas, habits and behaviour of the past. I will restore the value of work, authority, merit and respect for the nation."

On 6 May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy became the sixth person to be elected President of the Fifth Republic (which was established in 1958), and the 23rd President in French history.

The official transfer of power from Chirac to Sarkozy took place on 16 May at 11:00&nbsp;am (9:00 UTC) at the [[Élysée Palace]], where he was given the authorization codes of the [[Force de Frappe|French nuclear arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Samuel |first=Henry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/17/wfra17.xml |title=Radiant Cécilia puts Sarkozy in the shade |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010 }}</ref> In the afternoon, the new president flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].

In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including [[Éric Besson]], who served as [[Ségolène Royal]]'s economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister [[Rachida Dati]], is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, two attended the elite [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9226982 France's New Government – A study in perpetual motion], ''[[The Economist]]'', 23 June 2007</ref> The ministers were reorganised, with the controversial creation of a 'Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development'—given to his right-hand man [[Brice Hortefeux]]—and of a 'Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration'—handed out to [[Éric Wœrth]], supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire. However, after 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet was adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials.

Sarkozy broke with the custom of [[amnesty]]ing traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on [[Bastille Day]], a tradition that [[Napoleon]] had started in 1802 to commemorate the [[storming of the Bastille]] during the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="WP Moore" />

===Release of hostages===
Shortly after taking office, Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president [[Álvaro Uribe]] and the left-wing [[guerrilla]] [[FARC]], regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician [[Ingrid Betancourt]]. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's "chancellor" [[Rodrigo Granda]].<ref>[http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Internacional/08062007/244942.aspx Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberación de rehenes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225022851/http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Internacional/08062007/244942.aspx |date=25 December 2008 }}, ''La Cronica'', 8 June 2007 {{in lang|es}}</ref>

===Green policy===
On 8 June 2007, during the [[33rd G8 summit]] in [[Heiligendamm]], Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions by 50 percent by 2050 in order to prevent [[global warming]].

===Economic policy===
The [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), Sarkozy's party, won a majority at the [[2007 French legislative election|June 2007 legislative election]], although by less than expected. In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the ''[[Nouveau Centre]]'', ratified one of Sarkozy's electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the [[inheritance tax]].<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/pratique-patrimoine/20070713.FIG000000211_les_deputes_votent_la_quasi_suppression_des_droits_de_succession.html Les députés votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 13 July 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref><ref>[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/266891.FR.php Les droits de succession (presque) supprimés], ''[[Libération]]'', 13 July 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The inheritance tax formerly brought eight billion euros into state coffers.<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-07_Politique_Droits-de-succession-pour-une-minorite-de-menages-aises Droits de succession: pour une minorité de ménages aisés], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 7 June 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>
[[File:G8 summit in L'Aquila, family photo.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy (at left) attending the [[35th G8 summit|G-8 Summit]] in 2009]]
Sarkozy's UMP majority prepared a budget that reduced taxes, in particular for [[upper middle-class]] people, allegedly in an effort to [[Supply-side economics|boost GDP growth]], but did not reduce state expenditures.<!-- The vote of the budget hasn't taken place yet !! --> He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so.

On 23 July 2008, parliament voted the "loi de modernisation de l'économie" (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government has also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&story_id=11792306 |title=France—The reformist president |date=24 July 2008|access-date=27 July 2008 |work=The Economist }}</ref>

However, as a result of the [[global financial crisis of 2008|global financial crisis]] that came to a head in September 2008, Sarkozy has returned to the [[state interventionism]] of his predecessors, declaring that "laissez-faire capitalism is over" and denouncing the "dictatorship of the market". Confronted with the suggestion that he had become a socialist, he responded: "Have I become socialist? Perhaps." He has also pledged to create 100,000 state-subsidised jobs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12607041|title=Is Sarkozy a closet socialist?|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=14 November 2008|work=The Economist }}</ref> This reversion to ''[[dirigisme]]'' is seen as an attempt to stem the growing popularity of revolutionary socialist leader [[Olivier Besancenot]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5162679.ece|title=Carla Bruni 'stirs the Che Guevara' inside Nicolas Sarkozy|date=16 November 2008|accessdate=25 November 2008|work=The Times |location=UK | first=Matthew | last=Campbell}}</ref>

===Security policy===
Sarkozy's government issued a [[decree]] on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary [[biometric]] profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called 'Parafes', was to use fingerprints. The [[governmental databases|new database]] would be interconnected with the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons ([[Fichier des Personnes Recherchées|FPR]]). The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés ([[CNIL]]) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.<ref name=Parafes>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909160705/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html |date=9 September 2007 }}, ''[[Le Monde]]'', 8 August 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

===Constitutional reform===
On 21 July 2008, the French parliament passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. The vote was 539 to 357, one vote over the three-fifths majority required; the changes are not yet finalized. They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president's right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament, to set its own agenda. They would give parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, while ending government control over parliament's committee system. He has claimed that these reforms strengthen parliament, while some opposition socialist lawmakers have described it as a "consolidation of a monocracy".<ref>France backs constitution reform; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7517505.stm France backs constitution reform] BBC News, 21 July 2008</ref>

Sarkozy wielded special international power when France held the rotating EU Council Presidency from July 2008 through December 2008. Sarkozy has publicly stated his intention to attain EU approval of a [[progressivism|progressive]] energy package before the end of his EU Presidency. This energy package would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy has led the EU into a partnership with China.<ref>[http://www.eubusiness.com/China/climate-change.23 New chapter opens in EU-China Climate Change Partnership] EUbusiness.com, 29 April 2008</ref> On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of France's then presidency of the Council of the EU, met the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] in Poland and outraged China, which has announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hm4uz6lCdhPdwJhNTl63SxPrkKhA |title=France's Sarkozy meets Dalai Lama as China fumes |date=6 December 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2010|agency=AFP}}</ref>

===Military intervention in Libya===
[[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s official visit to Nicolas Sarkozy in December 2007 triggered a strong wave of protests against the President in France.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/la-photo-kadhafi-sarkozy-introuvable-sur-le-site-de-l-elysee_964940.html | work=L'Express Reuters| first=Jacky | last=Naegelen | title=2007 Gaddafi-Sarkozy photo disappeared from the website of the Elysée | date=22 February 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Paris Summit for the Support to the Libyan People 04.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy at the Paris Summit of 19 March 2011, which marked the start of a military intervention in Libya]]
In March 2011, after having been criticized for his unwillingness to support the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and persuaded by the philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] to have France actively engage against the forces of the Libyan leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Nicolas Sarkozy was amongst the first Heads of State to demand the resignation of Gaddafi and his government, which was then fighting a [[2011 Libyan Civil War|civil war in Libya]]. On 10 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy welcomed to the Elysee Palace, three emissaries from the [[National Transitional Council|Libyan National Transitional Council]] (NTC), brought to him by Bernard-Henri Levy who mediated at the meeting. Nicolas Sarkozy promised them a no-fly zone would be imposed on Gaddafi's aeroplanes. He also promised them French military assistance. On 17 March 2011, at the behest of France, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|resolution 1973]] was adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, permitting the creation of a "no fly" zone over Libya, and for the undertaking of "necessary measures" for the protection of the country's civilian population. On 19 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced the beginning of a [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]], with [[Opération Harmattan|France's participation]]. These actions of Nicolas Sarkozy were favorably received by the majority of the French political class and public opinion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lejdd.fr/International/Actualite/La-Libye-un-veritable-succes-diplomatique-pour-Sarkozy-285403/ |title=La Libye, un véritable succès diplomatique pour Sarkozy? |publisher=leJDD.fr |accessdate=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519121235/http://www.lejdd.fr/International/Actualite/La-Libye-un-veritable-succes-diplomatique-pour-Sarkozy-285403/ |archivedate=19 May 2011  }}</ref><ref>[http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2011-12-12#folio=CV1] "No Exit" by Philip Gourevitch, 12 December 2011, New Yorker</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/africa/02levy.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | title=In His Telling, One Man Made Libya a French Cause | date=1 April 2011}}</ref>

In 2016, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the [[British Parliament]] published a report stating that the military intervention "was based on erroneous assumptions" that the threat of a massacre of civilian populations has been "overvalued" and that the coalition "Has not verified the real threat to civilians"; He also believes that the true motivations of Nicolas Sarkozy were to serve French interests and to "improve his political situation in France".<ref>http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2016/09/14/01003-20160914ARTFIG00259-royaume-uni-un-rapport-parlementaire-ereinte-sarkozy-et-cameron-pour-l-intervention-en-libye.php</ref>

==After his defeat==

===Temporary retirement: 2012–2014===
After his defeat at the 2012 election, Nicolas Sarkozy asked his supporters to respect Hollande's victory. He invited his successor to attend his last 8 May [[Victory in Europe Day]] commemoration in office. His last day as President of the French Republic was 15 May.

Shortly after, Sarkozy briefly considered a career in private equity and secured a €250 million commitment from the [[Qatar Investment Authority]] to back his planned buyout firm. He abandoned his private equity plans when he decided to make a political comeback in 2014.<ref>Anne-Sylvaine Chassany and Camilla Hall (March 28, 2013), [https://www.ft.com/content/52b9eaba-97be-11e2-b7ef-00144feabdc0 Nicolas Sarkozy’s road from the Elysée to private equity] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref><ref name="ft.com">Anne-Sylvaine Chassany (21 February 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/1ed0309c-f859-11e6-9516-2d969e0d3b65 Nicolas Sarkozy joins AccorHotels to head international strategy] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

==Controversies==

Sarkozy is generally disliked by the left and has been criticised by some on the right, most vocally by moderate Gaullist supporters of [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.marianne2007.info/Cette-droite-qui-dit-non-a-Sarkozy_a313.html |title=Cette droite qui dit "non" à Sarkozy |publisher=Marianne2007.info |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108194215/http://www.marianne2007.info/Cette-droite-qui-dit-non-a-Sarkozy_a313.html |archive-date=8 January 2007 }}</ref> The [[French Communist Party|communist]]-leaning magazine ''[[L'Humanité]]'' accused Sarkozy of [[populism]].<ref>''[[L'Humanité]]'', [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-11/2005-06-11-808328 Humanite.presse.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427073035/http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-11/2005-06-11-808328 |date=27 April 2006 }}, 11 June 2005</ref>

===Views on religions===
[[File:Anti Sarko 480342767 8b13c8532f o d.jpg|thumb|Many on the left distrust Sarkozy; specific "anti-Sarko" movements have been started.]]
In 2004 Sarkozy co-authored a book, ''La République, les religions, l'espérance'' (''The Republic, Religions, and Hope''),<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thibaud Collin, Philippe Verdin|last2=Sarkozy|first2=Nicolas|title=La République, les religions, l'espérance|publisher=[[Les éditions du Cerf]]|year=2004|isbn=2-204-07283-4}}</ref> in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or [[Republicanism in France|republican]] values. He advocated reducing the [[separation of church and state]], arguing for the government [[subsidy|subsidies]] for mosques to encourage Islamic integration into French society.<ref>{{cite web|title=L'Etat Doit-Il Financer La Construction de Mosquées&nbsp;?|publisher=Libres.org|language=French|date=2 July 2007|url=http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualit%E9_1004/mosquees_a5_4504.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091010194121/http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualit%E9_1004/mosquees_a5_4504.htm|archivedate=10 October 2009}}</ref> He has opposed financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with [[Tom Cruise]], Sarkozy was criticized by some for meeting with a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], which has been seen by some as a cult.<ref>''Worldwide Religious News'', 2 September 2004</ref> Sarkozy was criticized by some Christians after he claimed "the roots of France are essentially Christian" at a December 2007 speech in Rome. Similarly, he drew criticism from Christians after he called Islam "one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known" at a speech in [[Riyadh]] in January 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=French President's religious mixing riles critics|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm|date=23 January 2008|work=Christianity Today}}</ref>

===Controversial statements===
In the midst of a tense period and following the death of an 11-year-old boy, caught in the crossfire of a gang brawl in the Paris suburb of [[La Courneuve]] in June 2005, Sarkozy went to the scene and said: "''on va nettoyer au [[Kärcher]] la cité''"" ("we will clean the area with a pressure washer"). Two days before the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 Paris riots]], he referred to young criminals of nearby housing projects as "''[[wikt:voyous|voyous]]''" ("thugs") and "''[[wikt:racaille|racaille]]''", a slang term which can be translated into English as "rabble", "scum" or "riff-raff", in answer to resident who addressed Sarkozy with "''Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille?''" ("''When will you rid us of these [[wikt:dregs|dregs]]?''")<ref>{{cite news|title=Banlieues&nbsp;: filmer et raconter avec Françoise Laborde, Claude Dilain, Nicolas Comte, Guillaume Biet (Les videos) |work=Arrêt sur images |language=French |publisher=[[France 5]] |date=6 November 2005 |url=http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703031423/http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm |archivedate=3 July 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The [[French Communist Party]] publication, ''L'Humanité'', branded this language as inappropriate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nicolas Sarkozy pompier pyromane|work=L'Humanité|location=France|date=2 November 2005|url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-11-02/2005-11-02-817109}}</ref> Following Sarkozy's use of the word ''racaille'' many people in the ''banlieues'' identified him as a politician of the far right. His period as Interior Minister saw the use of police as shock troops in the "banlieues", and a police "raid" on the suburb of [[Clichy-sous-Bois]] in October 2005 led to two boys being electrocuted in a power sub-station. The riots began that night.<ref>The Independent, 17 April 2007, p.&nbsp;20, "The banlieues prepare to vote: ''We hate Sarkozy because he hates us''."</ref>

In September 2005 Sarkozy was accused of pushing for a hasty inquiry into an arson attack on a police station in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], of which the alleged perpetrators were [[acquittal|acquitted]] for lack of proof.<ref>{{cite news|title=Incendie de Pau&nbsp;: les 8 accusés acquittés|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France|language=French|date=1 October 2005|url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/societe/20051001.OBS0822.html}}{{dead link|date=August 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> On 22 June 2005 Sarkozy told law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of "the judge" who had freed a man on parole who had later committed a murder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicolas Sarkozy veut faire "&nbsp;payer&nbsp;" un juge pour "&nbsp;sa faute&nbsp;"|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=23 June 2005|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-665357@51-660372,0.html|access-date=3 October 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050626010734/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-665357@51-660372,0.html|archive-date=26 June 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy had an interview with philosopher [[Michel Onfray]].<ref>[http://philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray-confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php online extracts], ''Philosophie Magazine'', nr 8, April 2007</ref> Sarkozy stated that disorders such as [[paedophilia]] and depression have a [[gene]]tic as well as social basis, saying "... I'd be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease"; he claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, "I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide." These statements were criticised by some scientists, including geneticist [[Axel Kahn]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20070604061336/http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2007-04-04/2007-04-04-848961 "Un gène ne commande jamais un destin humain"], 4 April 2007, ''[[L'Humanité]]''.</ref><ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-894367@51-893376,0.html "Tollé dans la communauté scientifique après les propos de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la génétique"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226181644/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-894367@51-893376,0.html |date=26 December 2007 }}, 11 April 2007''[[Le Monde]]'' (in French).</ref> Sarkozy later added, "What part is innate and what part is acquired?

===Position on the Iraq war===
Sarkozy opposed the U.S.-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. However, he was critical of the way Chirac and his foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] expressed France's opposition to the war.
