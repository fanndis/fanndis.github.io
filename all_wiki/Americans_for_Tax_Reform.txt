According to ATR, "The government's power to control one's life derives from its power to tax. We believe that power should be minimized." The organization is known for its "Taxpayer Protection Pledge", which asks candidates for federal and state office to commit themselves in writing to oppose all tax increases. The founder and president of ATR is [[Grover Norquist]], a conservative tax activist.

==Structure==
Americans for Tax Reform is a [[501(c)(4)]] organization with 14 employees, finances of $3,912,958, and a membership of 60,000 (as of 2004).<ref>{{cite web |title=Americans for Tax Reform |url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/americans-for-tax-reform |work=[[People For the American Way|Right Wing Watch]] |date=September 2006 |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref> It was founded by Grover Norquist in 1985.<ref name="about">{{cite web |title=About Americans for Tax Reform |work=Americans for Tax Reform |url=http://www.atr.org/about |year=2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2015}}</ref>

The associated educational wing is the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, which is classified as a 501(c)(3) research and educational organization. The purpose of both entities is to educate and/or lobby against all tax increases.

==Projects==

===Taxpayer Protection Pledge===
Since 1986, ATR has sponsored the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, a written promise by legislators and candidates for office that commits them to oppose tax increases. All candidates for state and federal office, and all incumbents are offered the Pledge. Nearly 1,400 elected officials, from state representatives, to governors, to US Senators, have signed the Pledge.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Americans for Tax reforms|url=http://www.atr.org/about|website=Americans for Tax Reforms|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> There are separate versions at the national and state level.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Taxpayer Protection Pledge Q & A |url=http://atr.org/userfiles/federaltaxpayerprotectionpledge_qanda.pdf |work=Americans for Tax Reform |accessdate=November 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616045724/https://atr.org/userfiles/federaltaxpayerprotectionpledge_qanda.pdf |archive-date=June 16, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State Taxpayer Protection Pledge Q & A |url=http://atr.org/userfiles/file/StatePledgeQ&A.pdf |work=Americans for Tax Reform |accessdate=November 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612230117/http://atr.org/userfiles/file/StatePledgeQ%26A.pdf |archive-date=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>

ATR's president [[Grover Norquist]] has written about the importance of the "Taxpayer Protection Pledge" for many publications including ''[[Human Events]]'' in June 2010. In this article, Norquist writes,

<blockquote>Raising taxes is what politicians do when they don't have the strength to actually govern. The taxpayer protection pledge was created in 1986 by Americans for Tax Reform as part of the effort to protect the lower marginal tax rates of Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986. It has grown in importance as one of the few black-and-white, yes or no, answers that politicians are forced to give to voters before they ask for their vote.<ref>{{cite news | first=Grover | last=Norquist | author-link=Grover Norquist | title=Anti-Tax Pledge Takes on Urgency | url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=37617 | newspaper=Human Events | location=Washington, DC | date=June 22, 2009 | access-date=October 9, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617181619/http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=37617 | archive-date=June 17, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) and individual Democratic candidates began attacking "The Taxpayer Protection Pledge" and its signers during the 2010 cycle with charges that the pledge protected tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas. The first appearance of the argument arose in the HI-01 special election.<ref>{{cite news | first=Josh | last=Kraushaar | title=DCCC hits Djou in new ads | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/35468.html | location =Washington, DC | newspaper=Politico | date=April 6, 2010}}</ref> Americans for Tax Reform responded by calling the attack ad "blatantly false." They pointed out that the Pledge does not prohibit any deduction or credit from being eliminated. It only prevents individuals and/or businesses from experiencing an overall increase in income taxes and allows for revenue-neutral tax reform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atr.org/dccc-attacks-charles-djou-false-claims-a4756 |title=DCCC Attacks Charles Djou with False Claims about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge|author=Radman, Adam |date=April 7, 2010 |work=Americans for Tax Reform |accessdate=October 9, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100917190948/http://atr.org/dccc-attacks-charles-djou-false-claims-a4756| archive-date= September 17, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

The non-partisan, nonprofit [[Factcheck.org]] reviewed the DCCC's ad and agreed with ATR that the ad was "blatantly false." The director of Factcheck.org, Brooks Jackson, wrote

<blockquote>It was called "blatantly false" by Americans for Tax Reform, the Republican-leaning group that got Djou's signature on its anti-tax pledge. We agree. ATR's tax pledge does protect corporations in general – but only from an overall increase in taxes. It says nothing about jobs at all. More important, it does not rule out an overhaul of the tax code. Signers agree to oppose any "net" reduction of deductions or credits "unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://factcheck.org/2010/04/a-false-tax-attack/ |title=A False Tax Attack |author=Jackson, Brooks |date=April 9, 2010 |work=Factcheck.org |accessdate=October 9, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101006041821/http://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/a-false-tax-attack/| archive-date= October 6, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref></blockquote>

According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', the Democrats' net pickup of eight seats in the House of Representatives in the November 2012 election, combined with several Republicans' disavowal of the pledge, means that the pledge will no longer have the support of a majority of that chamber when the new Congress convenes in January 2013. Norquist claims that 219 Republicans support the pledge; this figure, however, includes several Republicans who have signed the pledge only to disavow it later.<ref>Berman, Russell.

===Ronald Reagan Legacy Project===
Created in 1997, ATR's [[List of honors named for Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan Legacy Project]], has worked toward seeing each county in the United States commemorate the former president in a "significant" and "public" way, such as the naming of a public building. The project has also supported efforts to place Reagan on the [[United States ten-dollar bill|ten-dollar bill]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Reagan Backers Weigh Ways to Honor His Memory | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5166509 |agency=Associated Press | date=June 10, 2004 | accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}</ref> The project has also encouraged state governors declare February 6 to be "Ronald Reagan Day"; as of 2006, 40 governors have done so.<ref name=CFFA>{{cite web | title=About the Center for Fiscal Accountability | url=http://www.fiscalaccountability.org/about | work=Center for Fiscal Accountability | accessdate=November 7, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101114022/http://www.fiscalaccountability.org/about | archive-date=November 1, 2009 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Center for Fiscal Accountability===
Since 2008, ATR has sought to encourage transparency and accountability in government through the Center for Fiscal Accountability. The organization's mission includes supporting the creation of searchable online databases of government spending, among other initiatives.<ref name=CFFA/>

===Cost of Government Day===
ATR sponsors the calculation of "Cost of Government Day", the day on which, by its calculations, "Americans stop working to pay the costs of taxation, [[deficit spending]], and regulations by federal and state governments."<ref>{{cite web |title=Cost of Government Day, 2005: Wasteful Spending Takes Its Toll |publisher=Citizens Against Government Waste |url=http://www.cagw.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=9054 |accessdate=November 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002121341/http://www.cagw.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=9054 |archive-date=October 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Since 2008 the event has been sponsored by the Center for Fiscal Accountability.

===Property Rights Alliance=== <!-- courtesy note per [[MOS:LINK2SECT]], [[Property Rights Alliance]] redirects here, -->
The Property Rights Alliance<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=http://www.propertyrightsalliance.org/about |work=Property Rights Alliance |year=2009 |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref> is a project of Americans for Tax Reform. It produces the [[International Property Rights Index]] annually, ranking individual rights to own [[private property]] in countries worldwide. The index focuses on three main factors. These include: Legal and Political environment (LP), Physical Property Rights (PPR), and Intellectual Property rights (IPR).<ref>{{cite web|title=International Property Rights Index|url=http://www.americansfortaxreformfoundation.org/international-property-rights-index-a4|website=Americans For Tax Reforms Foundation|publisher=Braynard Group Inc|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref>

===Failure of IRS to protect confidential tax information===

In October 2014 the ATR said that a report by the [[Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration]] (TIGTA) found that the [[IRS]] has not been safeguarding federal tax information properly. The tax information is gathered by the [[IRS]]  from the [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]] filed in the United States.

The IRS provides confidential information to over 280 federal, state and local agencies.  According to this TIGTA report the IRS's Internal Revenue Manual does not require on-site validation of an agency's ability to protect federal tax information and does not set any guidelines for an agency's background investigation for accessing this information.

The TIGTA report surveyed 15 agencies that receive federal tax information and found that none of them conducted sufficient background checks on employees handling the data: one agency conducted national background investigations, four agencies fingerprint employees and only one checks [[Sex offender registries in the United States|the sex offender registry]]. Almost half of the agencies hire convicted criminals.

Federal tax information provided to other agencies must remain confidential by federal law.<ref>https://www.atr.org/new-report-finds-irs-failing-protect-confidential-tax-information</ref>

===Other projects===
ATR has several special project lines dedicated to specific issues including The American Shareholders Association (ASA), Alliance for Worker Freedom (AWF), and The Media Freedom Project (MFP).

In October 2010 ATR began mailing fliers to voters in Florida directing them to call Florida governor and Independent candidate for Senate, Charlie Crist. ATR's mailers included pictures of Crist with Obama and quotes from right wing authors.

==Wednesday meetings==

Shortly after [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, ATR headquarters became the site of a weekly, off-the-record get-together of conservatives to coordinate activities and strategy. The "Wednesday Meeting" of the [[Leave Us Alone Coalition]] soon became an important hub of conservative political organizing. Participants each week include Republican congressional leaders, right-leaning think tanks, conservative advocacy groups and [[K Street (Washington, DC)|K Street]] lobbyists. [[George W. Bush]] began sending a representative to the Wednesday Meeting even before he formally announced his candidacy for president in 1999, and continued to send representatives after his election in 2000.<ref name=SusanPage2001/>

ATR has helped to establish regular meetings for conservatives nationwide, modeled after the Wednesday meetings in Washington, with the goal of creating a nationwide network of conservative activists to help support initiatives such as tax cuts and deregulation. There are now meetings in 48 states<ref name="Wednesdays with Grover">{{cite news | first=John | last=Cassidy  |  title=Wednesdays With Grover | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/01/050801on_onlineonly01| newspaper=The New Yorker | date=July 25, 2001 | accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}</ref> and more internationally, with meetings in Canada, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/grover-norquist/gIQAr6BAAP_topic.html  |title=Grover Norquist |work=WhoRunsGov.com |publisher=The Washington Post Company |accessdate=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

The significance of the Wednesday meeting has influenced liberals and Democrats to organize similar meetings to coordinate activities about their shared agenda. In 2001, ''USA Today'' reported that Rep. [[Rosa DeLauro]] initiated such a meeting at the urging of then-House Democratic leader [[Richard Gephardt]], even holding it on a Wednesday.<ref name=SusanPage2001>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Page  | title=Norquist's Power High, Profile Low | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-06-01-grover.htm | newspaper=USA Today | date=June 1, 2001 | accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}</ref>

===Legislation===
ATR supported the [[American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to modify the calculation method and the rate for the [[Research & Experimentation Tax Credit|tax credit for qualified research expenses]] that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent.<ref name=4438cbo>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4438|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45324|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref> ATR argued that the bill would be "permanent tax relief for American employers" and pointed to the fact that the credit has been in existence since 1981, but businesses had always faced uncertainty about it due to Congress being forced to renew it 14 times.<ref name=ATRmay5>{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Ryan|title=ATR Supports H.R. 4438, Permanent Research and Development Tax Cut|url=http://www.atr.org/atr-supports-hr-4438-permanent-research-and-development-tax-cut|publisher=American for Tax Reform|accessdate=7 May 2014|date=5 May 2014}}</ref> ATR also argued that businesses already face high corporate income tax rates and that "investment in new technologies and sources of capital is under pressure from other areas of the tax code."<ref name="ATRmay5"/>

ATR supports H.R. 6246, the Retirement Inflation Protection Act of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/atr-supports-hr-6246-retirement-inflation-protection-act-2016|title=ATR Supports H.R. 6246, the Retirement Inflation Protection Act of 2016|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|date=November 2, 2016}}</ref> This act is designed to reduce the capital gains tax by reducing the tax on capital gains by the standardized inflation rate over the time period in which the capital was invested. ATR argues that by taxing the capital gains without taking into account the gains that occurred simply due to inflation, that investors are being punished for investing over a long period of time. The organization published an open letter to congressman urging them to vote in favor of the bill, which focuses on the harm that occurs to seniors due to the lack of protections that this bill would provide. This bill was introduced on September 28, 2016 into the U.S. Congress and as of November 2, 2016 has not been voted upon.<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6246 "H.R.6246 — 114th Congress (2015-2016)"] ''Congress'', November 2, 2016.</ref>

===CARES Act===
During the 2020 [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the group received assistance between $150,000 and $350,000 in federally backed small business loans from [[PNC Bank]] as part of the [[Paycheck Protection Program]]. The group stated it would allow them to retain 33 jobs.
