In 1994, Abdul sought treatment for [[bulimia nervosa]], which she revealed years later she first developed as a teenager and only intensified after she became a pop star, explaining: "Battling bulimia has been like war on my body. Me and my body have been on two separate sides. We’ve never, until recently, been on the same side. I learned at a very early age I didn't fit in physically. I learned through years of rejections from auditions. I would ask myself, 'Why can’t I be tall and skinny like the other dancers?' I felt nervous and out of control, and all I could think about was food. Food numbed the fear and anxiety. I'd eat and then run to the bathroom. I thought, 'God I’m not perfect. I’m going to disappoint people. That’s what I thought. It became a living hell for me. I wanted to get help. I want to be free from weighing myself on the scales. Whether I was sticking my head in the toilet or exercising for hours a day, I was spitting out the food – and the feelings."<ref name="YBR"/>

When sources including ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' questioned the veracity of this, Abdul responded in an onstage monologue at her [[Paula Abdul: Forever Your Girl|''Forever Your Girl'' Vegas residency]], "there are seven other people that were on the plane, who were in that plane accident with me. So, I really don't care what people have to say. ''I don't.''"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Lyndsey |title=Paula Abdul opens up about mysterious 1992 plane crash: 'I didn't want to talk too much about it{{'-}} |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/paula-abdul-opens-up-about-mysterious-1993-plane-crash-i-didnt-want-to-talk-too-much-about-it-182841961.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG5nI4z1A8bvrZLtA5BZJ02k4hu_ZxE_aR-FMzpcJdPMS_j28A-lFk9IjILz9PfXY5cfJiPi6kbS7rIbMHn6RIo4LLtl18pI0XwKG8fn2kcf334hXHuDWofLegRmEbAa1zxH78IRuIOCTf5xyd-5z1tyG1NtzmZyAb-a9Tm8vVVK |website=Yahoo!

In May 2009, ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' posted an article on its website that said that Abdul told them she stayed at the [[Omni La Costa Resort and Spa|La Costa Resort and Spa]] in [[Carlsbad, California]] for three days the previous year to recover from [[physical dependence]] on prescription pain medications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/122701/paula-abdul-no-painkillers-no-rehab|title=Paula Abdul: No Painkillers, No Rehab|website=E!

According to the article, Abdul said the medications made her "get weird" at times and that she suffered from physical [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms during her recovery.<ref name="med"/> Later that same week, in an interview with Detroit radio station [[WKQI]], Abdul rejected the article's accuracy. She told the radio station she never checked into a rehab clinic and never had a drug abuse problem.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.tvguide.com/American-Idol/Paula-Abdul-Denies-1005889.aspx?imw=Y|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120128175649/http://www.tvguide.com/American-Idol/Paula-Abdul-Denies-1005889.aspx?imw=Y|url-status=dead|archive-date =January 28, 2012|title=Paula Abdul Denies Report She Abused Painkillers; Magazine Stands by Story|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=May 8, 2009}}</ref>
