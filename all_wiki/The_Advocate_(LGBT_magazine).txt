''The Advocate'' brand also includes a website. Both magazine and website have an editorial focus on news, politics, opinion, and arts and entertainment of interest to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) people. The magazine, established in 1967,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sandra L.

==History==
[[File:Advocate1.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Masthead from ''The Advocate'', volume 1, issue 1]]
''The Advocate'' was first published as a local newsletter by the activist group [[Personal Rights in Defense and Education]] (PRIDE) in Los Angeles. The newsletter was inspired by a police raid on a Los Angeles gay bar, the [[Black Cat Tavern]], on January 1, 1967, and the demonstrations against [[police brutality]] in the months following that raid.<ref>{{cite news|department=Past Out|first=Liz|last=Highleyman|title=What Is the History of The Advocate?|url=http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue09_14_07/past_out.htm|work=Letters From CAMP Rehoboth|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070503112345/http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue09_14_07/past_out.htm|archivedate= May 3, 2007}}</ref> Richard Mitch (using the pseudonym "Dick Michaels") and Bill Rau (under the name "Bill Rand") joined PRIDE and, along with [[Aristide Laurent]] and artist Sam Winston, transformed the newsletter into a newspaper titled ''The Los Angeles Advocate''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hogan|first1=Steve|first2= Lee|last2=Hudson |name-list-style=amp|year=1998|title=Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia|location=New York|publisher= Henry Holt|isbn=0-8050-3629-6|page=13}}</ref> The first issue bore a cover date of September 1967, and was sold for 25 cents in gay bars in Los Angeles. By early 1968, PRIDE was struggling to stay viable and Mitch and Rau paid the group one dollar for ownership of the paper in February of that year.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Tobin|first1=Kay |first2= Randy|last2=Wicker|name-list-style=amp|year=1972|title= The Gay Crusaders|location= New York|publisher= Paperback Library|oclc=1922404|page=80}}</ref> In 1969 the newspaper was renamed ''The Advocate'' and distributed nationally. By 1974, Mitch and Rau were printing 40,000 copies for each issue.<ref name="SurveyLA">{{cite report|title=SurveyLA: LGBT historic context statement|author=GPA Consulting|date=September 2014|publisher=City of Los Angeles, Office of Historic Resources|url=http://preservation.lacity.org/sites/default/files/LosAngeles_LGBT_HistoricContext.pdf|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref>

The newspaper attracted the attention of [[David B. Goodstein]], an investment banker from San Francisco who bought the publication in 1974. Under Goodstein's direction, ''The Advocate'' transformed into a bi-weekly national news magazine covering events important to the LGBT community, including the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], along with arts and culture. Goodstein also worked toward reducing sex-oriented advertisements in favor of more mainstream sponsors.<ref name="Campbell">{{cite book|title=The Wiley Blackwell encycolpedia of consumption and consumer studies|pages=1–4|edition=first|last=Campbell|first=John|editor1-last=Cook|editor1-first=Daniel|editor2-last=Ryan|editor2-first=Michael|chapter=Gay and lesbian/queer markets/marketing|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd.|date=2015|doi=10.1002/9781118989463.wbeccs128|isbn=9781118989463}}</ref><ref name="SGNAdvocate">{{cite news|title=What is the history of The Advocate?|first=Liz|last=Highleyman|publisher=Seattle Gay News|url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews35_39/page30.cfm|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=39}}</ref>

Goodstein and Dr. Rob Eichberg created ''The Advocate Experience''. Loosely based on the then-popular [[Erhard Seminars Training|EST]] (Erhardt Seminars Training), it was a two-weekend, all-day series of extensive self-realization workshops to bring self-acceptance, awareness and tolerance within the [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|LGBT community]]. Goodstein and Eichberg facilitated the workshops for much of their duration. Goodstein's later editorials remained strongly opposed state intervention during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. He argued even though "our lifestyle can become an elaborate suicidal ritual...our safety and survival depends on each of us and our individual behaviour," as opposed to government [[public health]] regulations.<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Goodstein |title= Editorial |work= The Advocate |page= 6 |date= March 18, 1982 }}</ref>

Soon after Goodstein's death in 1985, the magazine was transformed from a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-size newspaper format in two sections (with the second section carrying sexually explicit advertisements) to a standard magazine format, beginning with the October 1, 1985 issue.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://advocate.com/40/covers/imgbig.asp?id=0430 |title= The Advocate |date= October 1, 1985 |at= Front Cover}}</ref>  Breakthroughs in straight celebrity covers came under the flamboyant command of editor in chief, Richard Rouilard in the 1980s and early 1990s. After his death from AIDS, this editorial trend continued successfully with editor in chief Jeff Yarbrough. It was during this time that the magazine stopped carrying sexually explicit advertisements, and in 1992 it launched a sister publication, ''Advocate Classifieds''. Under the leadership of its first female editor in chief, Judy Wieder, (1996—2002; editorial director, 2002-2006), ''The Advocate'' brought in a variety of voices, won numerous mainstream publishing awards, and set records for newsstand sales, circulation, and advertising.<ref name="Heching">{{cite news|title=It was "The New York Times of homosexuality"|first=Dan|last=Heching|date=June 28, 2016|url=https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2016/6/28/watch-history-advocate-americas-oldest-lgbt-magazine|publisher=Out|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref name="WiederHuffpost">{{cite news|title=The not-so-sudden death of The Advocate|first=Judy|last=Wieder|date=6 December 2016|publisher=Huffpost|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-not-so-sudden-death-o_b_342725|access-date=4 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="Bendix">{{cite news|title=Does LGBT media have a future?|first=Trish|last=Bendix|publisher=BuzzFeed News|date=25 January 2019| url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/trishbendix/future-of-lgbt-media-out-advocate-autostraddle-into-grindr|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Haninia">{{cite news|title=Closeted no longer: Magazines: Increasing ad revenues, mainstream media interest and attractive demographics have made an increasingly diverse gay press a vibrant market|first=Joseph|last=Haninia|date=October 29, 1995|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-10-29-ls-62323-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 1, 2019}}</ref> Wieder and her staff's coming-out interviews with such diverse gay luminaries as [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[George Michael]], [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[Chaz Bono]], [[Jim McGreevey]], [[Melissa Etheridge]] and [[Rob Halford]] garnered the magazine much television exposure and helped to lift the status of ''The Advocate'' Interview" as well as the visibility of the publication.<ref name="WiederHuffpost"/><ref name="Bendix"/>

''The Advocate '' changed hands through a series of mergers and acquisitions, first unsuccessfully with PlanetOut in 2006, and later with [[Here Media]]. In a cost-cutting move in 2008, Here Media, conceding that ''The Advocate'' print edition could no longer compete with local weekly LGBT newspapers and the Internet for hard news, switched the magazine from a bi-weekly to a monthly publication cycle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moses|first=Lucia |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/advocate-go-monthly-110784|title=The Advocate to Go Monthly|work=Adweek |date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Starting in 2010, Here Media consolidated the distribution for ''The Advocate'' and ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazines. ''The Advocate'' print version continues to be published and is available enclosed with ''Out'' as a combination package via subscription. In 2010 there were press reports of freelance writers not being paid for their work.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleischer|first=Matthew|title='The Advocate' Does Not Pay Its Freelancers|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlLA/magazines/the_advocate_does_not_pay_its_freelancers_167500.asp|work=FishbowlLA|accessdate=November 28, 2010|date=July 13, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920070911/http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/magazines/the_advocate_does_not_pay_its_freelancers_167500.asp|archivedate=September 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As of May 2013, ''The Advocate'' is no longer produced in-house at Here Media but by Grand Editorial for Here Media.

In 2017, Here Media sold its magazine operations to a group led by Oreva Capital, who renamed the parent company Pride Media.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Publisher of High Times acquires LGBT publications|work=Reuters|accessdate =April 4, 2020|date=September 7, 2017|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oreva-lgbt-idUSKCN1BI1QW}}</ref>

[[Zach Stafford]] served as the editor in chief in 2019, the first Black person to hold that role in the magazine's 50+ year history.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Advocate names first black editor-in-chief in its 50-year history|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/advocate-names-first-black-editor-chief-its-50-year-history-n950641|access-date=2020-10-04|website=NBC News|language=en}}</ref> In February 2020, Tracy E.

==Comics==
''The Advocate'' provided a venue for several noteworthy LGBT cartoonists in the 1970s and 1980s. Early in its history the publication ran single-panel gag cartoons by [[Joe Johnson (cartoonist)|Joe Johnson]] featuring effeminate Miss Thing and beefy Big Dick,<ref name="GLBTQ">{{cite web|last1=Theophano|first1=Teresa|title=Comic Strips and Cartoons|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/arts/comic_strips_cartoons_A.pdf|website=GLBTQ Archive|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> and "Gayer Than Strange" by [[Sean (cartoonist)|Sean]]. After these were discontinued, ''It's a Gay Life'' by [[Donelan (cartoonist)|Donelan]] debuted in 1977 and ran for 15 years.<ref name="GLBTQ"/> [[Howard Cruse]]'s strip ''Wendel'' appeared from 1983 to 1989, transitioning from a single tabloid-size page to two magazine-size pages when the publication changed format. ''Leonard and Larry'' by [[Tim Barela]]<ref name="GLBTQ"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Leonard & Larry|url=http://gaycomicslist.free.fr/pages/reviews.php?review=ll|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=Gay Comics List}}</ref> and ''Servants to the Cause'' by [[Alison Bechdel]] also appeared briefly during the late 1980s.

==Podcast==
''The Advocate'' produces a podcast called [[LGBTQ&A]], which was created and is hosted by Jeffrey Masters. The LGBTQ&A podcast features interviews with notable LGBTQ figures such as [[Pete Buttigieg]], [[Laverne Cox]], [[Lili Reinhart]], [[Roxane Gay]] and [[Trixie Mattel]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bromwich|first=Jonah Engel|date=2017-05-26|title=Stuck in Memorial Day Traffic?
