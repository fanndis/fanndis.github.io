In [[Christian eschatology]], the '''Antichrist''', or '''anti-Christ''', is a person prophesied by the [[Bible]] to oppose [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and substitute himself in Christ's place before the [[Second Coming]].

The similar term ''pseudokhristos'' or "false Christ" is found in the Gospels. In Matthew ([[Matthew 24#Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple|chapter 24]]) and Mark ([[Mark 13|chapter 13]]), Jesus alerts his disciples not to be deceived by the [[False prophet#Christianity|false prophets]], who will claim themselves as being [[Christ (title)|Christ]], performing "great [[Sign#Christianity|signs]] and [[Miracle#Religious views|wonders]]".<ref>Matthew 24:3-5, 24 (KJV)</ref> Two other images often associated with the Antichrist are  the "little horn" in [[Daniel's final vision]] and the "[[man of sin]]" in [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chrysostom|translator=John A.

==Etymology==
''Antichrist'' is translated from the combination of two ancient [[Koine Greek|Greek]] words {{Lang|grc|αντί + Χριστός}} (anti + Christos). In Greek, {{Lang|grc|Χριστός}} means "anointed one" and the word Christ derives from it.<ref>See Strong's Bible Dictionary:[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G5547&t=KJV χριστος] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120711175622/http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G5547&t=KJV |date=July 11, 2012 }}</ref> "{{Lang|grc|Αντί}}" means not only anti in the sense of "against" and "opposite of", but also "in place of".<ref>See Strong's Bible Dictionary: [http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G473&t=KJV αντί] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120716020304/http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/Lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G473&t=KJV |date=July 16, 2012 }}</ref><ref>See the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0072%3Aentry%3Da%29nti%2F Lexicon to Pindar].

===New Testament===
Whether the New Testament contains an individual Antichrist is disputed. The Greek term ''antikhristos'' originates in 1 John.<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Horbury|authorlink=William Horbury|title=Messianism Among Jews and Christians: Biblical and Historical Studies|publisher=[[A&C Black]]|location=London, England|date=2003|isbn=978-0567088086|page=333|quote=Against this background it can be seen that the technical Greek term ''antichristos'', although it is known only from Christian … ''Antichristos'' first occurs in the Johannine epistles, and it is not used by other Greek Jewish or early Christian writings ...}}</ref> The similar term ''pseudokhristos'' ("False Messiah") is also first found in the [[New Testament]], but never used by [[Josephus]] in his accounts of various false messiahs.<ref name=pseudochrist>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Mauser|title=The Gospel of Peace: A Scriptural Message for Today's World|date=1992|page=70|quote=From Josephus's writings we collect, first of all, without much critical comment, some statements showing the close affinity of the … nowhere in his extensive accounts of the Jewish–Roman war uses the word "pseudo-Christ" (pseudochristos).}}</ref> The concept of an ''antikhristos'' is not found in Jewish writings in the period 500 BC–50 AD. However, [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] conjectures that the concept may have been generated by the frustration of Jews subject to often-capricious [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] or [[Roman Judaea|Roman rule]], who found the nebulous Jewish idea of a [[Satan]] who is more of an opposing angel of God in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]] insufficiently humanised and personalised to be a satisfactory incarnation of evil and threat.{{sfn|Cabinet|2001}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}}

The five uses of the term "antichrist" or "antichrists" in the [[Johannine epistles]] do not clearly present a single latter-day individual Antichrist. The articles "the deceiver" or "the antichrist" are usually seen as marking out a certain category of persons, rather than an individual.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Yarbrough|title=1-3 John|publisher=[[Baker Publishing Group|Baker Academic]]|location=Ada, Michigan|isbn=9780801026874|page=344|date=2008|quote=The articles in front of "deceiver" (ὁ πλάνος, ''ho planos'') and "antichrist" (ὁ ἀντίχριστος, ''ho antikhristos'') should be seen as marking out a certain category of persons (Wallace 1996: 227–30). This is a common Johannine usage (1 John 2:23)}}</ref>

[[Irenaeus]] (2nd century AD – c. 202) wrote ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' to refute the teachings of the [[Gnostic]]s. In Book V of ''Against Heresies'' he addresses the figure of the Antichrist referring to him as the "recapitulation of [[apostasy]] and rebellion." He uses "[[666 (number)#The Number of the Beast|666]]", the [[Number of the Beast]] from Revelation 13:18, to [[Numerology|numerologically]] decode several possible names. Some names that he loosely proposed were "Evanthos", "Lateinos" ("Latin" or pertaining to the [[Roman Empire]]). In his [[exegesis]] of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:21, he stated that the ten horns of the beast will be the Roman empire divided into ten kingdoms before the Antichrist's arrival. However, his readings of the Antichrist were more in broader theological terms rather than within a historical context.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Kevin L.|title=Constructing antichrist : Paul, biblical commentary, and the development of doctrine in the early Middle Ages|year=2005|publisher=[[Catholic University of America Press]]|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780813214153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ttvHhsEkXoC&q=Irenaeus+antichrist&pg=PA30|pages=29–31}}</ref>

[[Tertullian]] (c. 160 – c. 220 AD) held that the Roman Empire was the restraining force written about by [[Saint Paul|Paul]] in 2 Thessalonians 2:7–8. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the disintegration of the ten provinces of the Roman Empire into ten kingdoms were to make way for the Antichrist.

{{quote|By, "For that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first," he [Paul] means indeed this present empire, "and the man of lawlessness is revealed"—that is to say, the Antichrist, "the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or religion, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you? And you know what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed when his time comes. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who now restrains it is removed." What obstacles are there but the Roman state, the rebellion of which, by being scattered into the ten kingdoms, will introduce the Antichrist upon its own ruins? "And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming.

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c. 170 – c. 236) held that the Antichrist would come from the [[tribe of Dan]] and would [[Third Temple|rebuild the Jewish temple]] on the [[Temple Mount]] in order to reign from it. He identified the Antichrist with the Beast out of the Earth from the book of Revelation.

{{quote|By the beast, then, coming up out of the earth, he means the kingdom of Antichrist; and by the two horns he means him and the false prophet after him. And in speaking of "horns like a lamb," he means that he will make himself like the Son of God, and set himself forward as king. And the terms, "it spoke like a dragon," mean that he is a deceiver, and not truthful.<ref>Hippolytus's [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Extant Works and Fragments of Hippolytus/Dogmatical and Historical/Treatise on Christ and Antichrist|Treatise on Christ and Antichrist, part 2]]</ref>}}

[[Origen]] (185–254) refuted [[Celsus]]' view of the Antichrist. Origen utilized Scriptural citations from [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Saint Paul|Paul]], and the [[Gospels]]. He argued:
{{quote|Where is the absurdity, then, in holding that there exist among men, so to speak, two extremes—the one of virtue, and the other of its opposite; so that the perfection of virtue dwells in the man who realizes the ideal given in Jesus, from whom there flowed to the human race so great a conversion, and healing, and amelioration, while the opposite extreme is in the man who embodies the notion of him that is named Antichrist?... one of these extremes, and the best of the two, should be styled the Son of God, on account of His pre-eminence; and the other, who is diametrically opposite, be termed the son of the wicked demon, and of Satan, and of the devil. And, in the next place, since evil is specially characterized by its diffusion, and attains its greatest height when it simulates the appearance of the good, for that reason are signs, and marvels, and lying miracles found to accompany evil, through the cooperation of its father the devil.<ref>{{harvnb|Origen|1872|p=386}}</ref>}}

[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], in the mid-4th century, delivered his [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf207.ii.xix.html 15th] [[Cyril of Jerusalem#Catechetical lectures|Catechetical lecture]] about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, in which he also lectures about the Antichrist, who will reign as the ruler of the world for three and a half years, before he is killed by Jesus Christ right at the end of his three-and-a-half-year reign, shortly after which the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will happen.

[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] (c. 298–373)  wrote that [[Arius]] of Alexandria is to be associated with the Antichrist, saying, "And ever since [the Council of Nicaea] has Arius's error been reckoned for a heresy more than ordinary, being known as Christ's foe, and harbinger of Antichrist."<ref>from Athanasius' "[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/28161.htm Four Discourses]"</ref>

[[John Chrysostom]] (c. 347–407) warned against speculating about the Antichrist, saying, "Let us not therefore enquire into these things". He preached that by knowing Paul's description of the Antichrist in 2 Thessalonians, Christians would avoid deception.<ref>Chrysostom [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume XIII/On Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians/On 2 Thessalonians/Argument|Homily 1 on the 2nd Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians]]</ref>

[[Jerome]] (c. 347–420) warned that those substituting false interpretations for the actual meaning of Scripture belonged to the "synagogue of the Antichrist".<ref>{{harvnb|Jerome|1893b|p=334}}</ref>  "He that is not of Christ is of Antichrist", he wrote to [[Pope Damasus I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jerome|1893|p=19}}</ref>  He believed that "the mystery of lawlessness" written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 was already in action when "every one chatters about his views."<ref>{{harvnb|Jerome|1893c|p=449}}</ref>  To Jerome, the power restraining this mystery of lawlessness was the Roman Empire, but as it fell this restraining force was removed. He warned a noble woman of [[Gaul]]:

{{quote|He that letteth is taken out of the way, and yet we do not realize that Antichrist is near. Yes, Antichrist is near whom the Lord Jesus Christ "shall consume with the spirit of his mouth." "Woe unto them," he cries, "that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days."... Savage tribes in countless numbers have overrun all parts of Gaul.

In his ''Commentary on Daniel'', Jerome noted, "Let us not follow the opinion of some commentators and suppose him to be either the Devil or some demon, but rather, one of the human race, in whom Satan will wholly take up his residence in bodily form." Instead of rebuilding the Jewish Temple to reign from, Jerome thought the Antichrist sat in God's Temple inasmuch as he made "himself out to be like God." He refuted [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry's]] idea that the "little horn" mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 was [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] by noting that the "little horn" is defeated by an eternal, universal ruler, right before the final judgment.<ref name="Commentary on Daniel">{{harvnb|Jerome|1958|pp=}}</ref> Instead, he advocated that the "little horn" was the Antichrist:

{{quote|We should therefore concur with the traditional interpretation of all the commentators of the Christian Church, that at the end of the world, when the Roman Empire is to be destroyed, there shall be ten kings who will partition the Roman world amongst themselves.

Circa 380, an apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]] describes Constantine as victorious over [[Gog and Magog]]. Later on, it predicts:
{{quote|When the Roman empire shall have ceased, then the Antichrist will be openly revealed and will sit in the House of the Lord in Jerusalem.

[[Protestant Reformers]], including [[John Wycliffe]], [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]], [[John Knox]], [[Roger Williams]], [[Cotton Mather]], and [[John Wesley]], as well as most [[Protestants]] of the 16th-18th centuries, felt that the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] had been led into the [[Great Apostasy]] by the [[Papacy]] and identified the [[Pope as Antichrist|Pope with the Antichrist]].<ref name="Johnstone">{{cite book |last1=Johnstone |first1=Nathan |date=June 2009 |title=The Devil and Demonism in Early Modern England |chapter=The synagogue of Satan: anti-Catholicism, false doctrine and the construction of contrariety |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge]] |pages=27–59 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511495847.002|isbn=9780511495847 }}</ref><ref name="Burgess">{{cite book|editor1=Joseph A.

Among the others who interpreted the biblical [[prophecy]] historically there were many [[Church Fathers]]; [[Justin Martyr]] wrote about the Antichrist: "He Whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time and times and an half, is even now at the door".<ref>''Dialogue with Trypho'', ch. 32, in Ante-Nic.

Fath. III:463f.</ref> [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''Treatise on Christ and Antichrist'' wrote: "As Daniel also says (in the words) 'I considered the Beast, and look!

Some [[Franciscan]]s had considered the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] a positive Antichrist who would purify the Catholic Church from opulence, riches and clergy.<ref>{{cite book | title = Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches: The Riddles of Culture | first = Marvin | last = Harris | author-link = Marvin Harris | publisher = [[Vintage Books]] | location = New York City | isbn = 978-0679724681 | page = [https://archive.org/details/cowspigswarswitc00marv/page/196 196] | url = https://archive.org/details/cowspigswarswitc00marv/page/196 | year = 1989 }}</ref>

[[Historicity|Historicist]] interpretations of Book of Revelation usually included the identification of one or more of the following:
* the Antichrist ([[First Epistle of John|1]] and [[Second Epistle of John|2 John]]);
* the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]] of [[Revelation 13]]; 
* the [[Man of Sin]], or Man of Lawlessness, of [[2 Thessalonians 2]] ({{Bibleverse-nb||2 Thessalonians|2:1-12|ESV}}); 
* the "Little horn" of [[Daniel 7]] and [[Daniel 8|8]];
* The [[Abomination of desolation]] of [[Daniel 9]], [[Daniel 11|11]], and [[Daniel 12|12]]; and
* the [[Whore of Babylon]] of [[Revelation 17]].

The Protestant Reformers tended to hold the belief that the Antichrist power would be revealed so that everyone would comprehend and recognize that the Pope is the real, true Antichrist and not the vicar of Christ. Doctrinal works of literature published by the [[Lutherans]], the [[Reformed Churches]], the [[Presbyterians]], the [[Baptists]], the [[Anabaptists]], and the [[Methodists]] contain references to the Pope as the Antichrist, including the [[Smalcald Articles]], Article 4 (1537),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4|title=Smalcald Articles - Book of Concord}}</ref> the ''[[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]]'' written by [[Philip Melanchthon]] (1537),<ref>[[Philip Melanchthon]], ''[[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]]'' ([http://www.bookofconcord.com/treatise.html full text]) in the Triglot translation of the [[Book of Concord]].</ref> the [[Westminster Confession]], Article 25.6 (1646), and the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith]], Article 26.4. In 1754, [[John Wesley]] published his ''[[Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament]]'', which is currently an official Doctrinal Standard of the [[United Methodist Church]]. In his notes on the [[Book of Revelation]] (chapter 13), he commented: "The whole succession of Popes from [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] are undoubtedly Antichrists. Yet this hinders not, but that the last Pope in this succession will be more eminently the Antichrist, the Man of Sin, adding to that of his predecessors a peculiar degree of wickedness from the bottomless pit."<ref>[https://archive.today/20070202121310/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1648 Archived copy] at the [[Library of Congress]] (May 8, 2009).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/frames.asp?url=http://www.livingweb.com/library/projects/notes/index.html|title=UMC.org : the official online ministry of The United Methodist Church}}</ref>

The identification of the Pope with the Antichrist was so ingrained in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Era]], that Luther himself stated it repeatedly:

{{quote|"This teaching [of the supremacy of the pope] shows forcefully that the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ, because he will not permit Christians to be saved without his power, which, nevertheless, is nothing, and is neither ordained nor commanded by God".<ref>Smalcald Articles, II.</ref>}} and,

{{quote|"nothing else than the [[Whore of Babylon|kingdom of Babylon]] and of the very Antichrist. For who is the man of sin and the [[son of perdition]], but he who by his teaching and his ordinances increases the sin and perdition of souls in the church; while he yet sits in the church as if he were God? All these conditions have now for many ages been fulfilled by the papal tyranny."<ref>Martin Luther, ''First Principles'', pp. 196–197.</ref>}}

[[John Calvin]] similarly wrote:

{{quote|"Though it be admitted that Rome was once the mother of all Churches, yet from the time when it began to be the seat of Antichrist it has ceased to be what it was before. Some persons think us too severe and censorious when we call the Roman Pontiff Antichrist. But those who are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the same charge of presumption against Paul himself, after whom we speak and whose language we adopt ... I shall briefly show that (Paul's words in II Thess. 2) are not capable of any other interpretation than that which applies them to the Papacy."<ref>John Calvin, ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', Vol. 3, p. 149.</ref>}}

[[John Knox]] wrote on the Pope:

{{quote|"Yea, to speak it in plain words; lest that we submit ourselves to Satan, thinking that we submit ourselves to Jesus Christ, for, as for your Roman kirk, as it is now corrupted, and the authority thereof, whereon stands the hope of your victory, I no more doubt but that it is the [[synagogue of Satan]], and the head thereof, called the pope, to be that man of sin, of whom the apostle speaks."<ref>John Knox, ''[[The History of the Reformation in Scotland]]'', p. 65.</ref>}}

[[Thomas Cranmer]] on the Antichrist wrote:

{{quote|"Whereof it followeth Rome to be the seat of Antichrist, and the pope to be very antichrist himself. I could prove the same by many other scriptures, old writers, and strong reasons."<ref>''Works by Cranmer'', Vol. 1, pp. 6–7.</ref>}}

[[John Wesley]], speaking of the identity given in the Bible of the Antichrist, wrote:

{{quote|"In many respects, the Pope has an indisputable claim to those titles. He is, in an emphatical sense, the man of sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure. And he is, too, properly styled, the son of perdition, as he has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers, destroyed innumerable souls, and will himself perish everlastingly. He it is that opposeth himself to the emperor, once his rightful sovereign; and that exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped – Commanding angels, and putting kings under his feet, both of whom are called gods in scripture; claiming the highest power, the highest honour; suffering himself, not once only, to be styled God or vice-God. Indeed no less is implied in his ordinary title, "Most Holy Lord," or, "Most Holy Father." So that he sitteth – Enthroned. In the temple of God – Mentioned Rev. xi, 1. Declaring himself that he is God – Claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone."<ref>John Wesley, ''[[Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament]]'', p. 216.</ref>}}

[[Roger Williams]] wrote about the Pope:

{{quote|"the pretended [[Vicar of Christ]] on earth, who sits as God over the Temple of God, exalting himself not only above all that is called God, but over the souls and consciences of all his vassals, yea over the Spirit of Christ, over the Holy Spirit, yea, and God himself ... speaking against the God of heaven, thinking to change times and laws; but he is the Son of Perdition."<ref>Froom, ''The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers'', Vol. 3, p. 52.</ref>}}

The identification of the Roman Catholic Church as the apostate power written of in the Bible as the Antichrist became evident to many as the Reformation began, including [[John Wycliffe]], who was well known throughout Europe for his opposition to the [[Catholic theology|doctrine and practices of the Catholic Church]], which he believed had clearly deviated from the original teachings of the early Church and to be contrary to the Bible. Wycliffe himself tells (''Sermones'', III. 199) how he concluded that there was a great contrast between what the Church was and what it ought to be, and saw the necessity for reform. Along with John Hus, they had started the inclination toward ecclesiastical reforms of the Catholic Church.

When the [[Swiss Reformation|Swiss Reformer]] [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the pastor of the [[Grossmünster]] in [[Zurich]] (1518) he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church.  Zwingli, who was a Catholic priest before he became a Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the Antichrist. He wrote: "I know that in it works the might and power of the Devil, that is, of the Antichrist".<ref>''Principle Works of Zwingli'', Vol. 7, p. 135.</ref>

The [[English Reformation|English Reformer]] [[William Tyndale]] held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise ''The Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.<ref>Tyndale, William, ''Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008) at pages 4-5.</ref> Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the "Man of Lawlessness" reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,<ref>"Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2", R. Davis, [[Matthew Bible#Literature|New Matthew Bible Project]]; a shorter version of this article was also published in the Tyndale Society Journal No. 36, Spring 2009, under the title ''Tyndale, the Church, and the Doctrine of Antichrist'').</ref> including the [[Authorized King James Version#Committees|King James Bible committee]], which followed the [[Vulgate]] more closely.

In 1973, the  United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' [[Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs]] and the USA National Committee of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in the official [[Catholic–Lutheran dialogue]] officially signed an agreement on ''Papal Primacy and the Universal Church,'' including this passage:

{{quote|In calling the pope the "Antichrist", the early [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] stood in a [[Antichrist#Pre-Reformation Western Church accusers|tradition that reached back into the eleventh century]]. Not only dissidents and [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]] but even saints had called the bishop of Rome the "Antichrist" when they wished to castigate his [[abuse of power]]. What Lutherans understood as a [[Papal supremacy|papal claim to unlimited authority]] [[Temporal power (papal)|over everything and everyone]] reminded them of the [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic imagery]] of [[Daniel 11]], a passage that even prior to the Reformation had been applied to the pope as the Antichrist of the [[End time#Christianity|last days]].<ref name="Burgess"/>}}

In 1988 [[Ian Paisley]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical minister]] and founder of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], made headlines in an infamous manner by accusing [[Pope John Paul II]] as the Antichrist during one of the pope's speeches before the European Parliament, which at the time Paisley was member of. His accusation, and the reactions of both Pope John Paul II and other members of the European Parliament, was recorded on video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/16/weekinreview/headliners-papal-audience.html|title=Papal Audience|date=October 16, 1988|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlbmIMbKZa4 Ian Paisley Heckles the Pope (1988)]</ref>

The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] states about the Pope and the Catholic Church:<ref name="WELS"/>
{{quote|There are two principles that mark the papacy as the Antichrist. One is that [[Papal supremacy|the pope takes to himself the right to rule the church]] that belongs only to [[Christ]]. He can make laws forbidding the marriage of priests, eating or not eating meat on Friday, birth control, divorce and remarriage, even where there are not such laws in the Bible. The second is that he teaches that salvation is not by faith alone but by faith and works. The present pope upholds and practices these principles. This marks his rule as [[Anti-Christian|antichristian rule]] in the church. All popes hold the same office over the church and promote the same antichristian belief so they all are part of the reign of the Antichrist. The Bible does not present the Antichrist as one man for one short time, but as an office held by a man through successive generations. It is a title like King of England.<ref name=WELS-CL>{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=4242 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Roman Catholic |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=July 5, 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927213220/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=4242 |archivedate=September 27, 2009 }}</ref>}}

Currently, many Protestant and [[Restorationism|Restorationist denominations]] still officially maintain that the Papacy is the Antichrist, such as the [[Confessional Lutheranism|conservative Lutheran Churches]]<ref name="WELS">{{cite web |url=https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/antichrist/ |title=Doctrinal Statements: Antichrist |date=2018 |website=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |access-date=August 17, 2018 |quote=We reject the idea that the teaching that the Papacy is the Antichrist rests on a merely human interpretation of history or is an open question. We hold rather that this teaching rests on the revelation of God in Scripture which finds its fulfillment in history. The Holy Spirit reveals this fulfillment to the eyes of faith (cf. ''The Abiding Word'', Vol. 2, p. 764). Since Scripture teaches that the Antichrist would be revealed and gives the marks by which the Antichrist is to be recognized ({{Bibleverse||2 Thessalonians|2:6-8|ESV}}), and since this prophecy has been clearly fulfilled in the history and development of the Roman Papacy, it is the Scripture which reveals that the Papacy is the Antichrist.}}</ref><ref>Nolting, Paul F., [http://www.clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/endtimes/antichrist1.html The Antichrist (part 1)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522192542/http://www.clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/endtimes/antichrist1.html |date=May 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://clclutheran.org/library/BriefStatement.html A Brief Statement of our Doctrinal Position], 1932</ref> and the [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-day Adventists]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.666truth.org/ | title = 666 Truth}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | date = July 6, 2002 | first = Samuele | last = Bacchiocchi | place = Berrien Springs, MI | url = http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/endtimeissues/eti_86.html | title = Islam and The Papacy in Prophecy | journal = Endtime Issues | number = 86 | publisher = Biblical perspectives | access-date = August 16, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130822065910/http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/endtimeissues/eti_86.html | archive-date = August 22, 2013 | url-status = dead }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = September 11 and God's Mysterious Mercy | journal = End Time Issues | number = 90 | date = October 17, 2002 | first1 = Jon | last1 = Paulien | last2 = Bacchiocchi | first2 = Samuele | place = Berrien Springs, MI | publisher = Biblical perspectives | url = http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/endtimeissues/eti_90.html}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | contribution = Reformed | title = Eschatology | url = http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/eschatology/reformedescha.html | publisher = Mountain Retreat}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.presenttruthmag.com/archive/XVII/17-2.htm | title = Antichrist Today | journal = Present Truth | volume = XVII | number = 2}}.</ref>

===Counter Reformation===
In the [[Counter-Reformation]], the views of [[Preterism]] and [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurism]] were advanced by Catholic Jesuits beginning in the 16th century in response to the identification of the Papacy as Antichrist. These were rival methods of prophetic interpretation: the futurist and the preterist systems both are in conflict with the historicist method of interpretation.

Historically, preterists and non-preterists have agreed that the Jesuit [[Luis del Alcázar|Luis de Alcasar]]  (1554–1613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy—''Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi'' (published in 1614)—during the [[Counter-Reformation]].

==Christian views==

===Roman Catholicism===
From the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]], the Catholic Church teaches that priests may not "preach or declare a fixed time for...the coming of antichrist..."<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum18.htm PapalEncyclicals: Lateran Council V, Session 11] They are in no way to presume to preach or declare a fixed time for future evils, the coming of antichrist or the precise day of judgment; for Truth says, it is not for us to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. Let it be known that those who have hitherto dared to declare such things are liars, and that because of them not a little authority has been taken away from those who preach the truth .</ref> The church also teaches that it must undergo trials before the [[Second Coming]],<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p1.htm#769 Catechism of the Catholic Church 769]</ref> and that the church's ultimate trial will be the mystery of iniquity.<ref name="vatican.va">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c2a7.htm#675 Catechism of the Catholic Church 675]</ref> In Judaism, iniquity is a sin done out of moral failing.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13761-sin Jewish Encyclopedia: Sin]</ref> The mystery of iniquity, according to the church, will be a religious deception: Christians receiving alleged solutions to their problems at the cost of [[apostasy]].<ref name="vatican.va"/> The supreme religious deception, according to the church, will be the Antichrist's [[messianism]]: mankind glorifying himself rather than God and Jesus.<ref name="vatican.va"/> The church teaches that this supreme deception is committed by people who claim to fulfill Israel's [[messiah in Judaism|messianic hopes]], such as [[millenarianism]]  ([[British Empire|British empire]]/[[European Union]])and secular messianicism.<ref name="vatican.va"/>

====Popes====
[[Pope Pius IX]] in the encyclical ''Quartus Supra'', quoting [[Cyprian]], said Satan disguises the Antichrist with the title of Christ.<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius09/p9quartu.htm Papal Encyclicals: Quartus Supra, 2]</ref> [[Pope Pius X]] in the encyclical ''E Supremi'' said that the distinguishing mark of the Antichrist is claiming to be God and taking his place.<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-x/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_04101903_e-supremi.html Vatican.Va: Pius X encyclical  Supremi, 5]</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]], in his August 18, 1985 address on his apostolic journey to Africa, said 1 John 4:3 ("Every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God.

====Speculation====

The ''[[Prophecy of the Popes]]'' claims Rome will be destroyed during the pontificate of the last Pope, implying a connection to the Antichrist.

===Eastern Orthodox===
In a [[Christmas in Russia|Christmas]] 2018 interview on Russian state television, [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] warned that "The Antichrist is the person that will be at the head of the world wide web controlling all of humanity. That means that the structure itself poses a danger. There shouldn't be a single centre, at least not in the foreseeable future, if we don't want to bring on the apocalypse." He exhorted listeners not to "fall into slavery to what's in your hands"..."You should remain free inside and not fall under any addiction, not to alcohol, not to narcotics, not to gadgets."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/08/smartphones-paving-way-antichrist-says-russian-church-leader/|title=Smartphones are paving way for the Antichrist, says head of Russian church|website=The Telegraph}}</ref>

===Old Believers===
After [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] reformed the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the second half of the 17th century, a large number of [[Old Believers]] held that [[Peter the Great]], the [[Tsar]] of the [[Russian Empire]] until his death in 1725, was the Antichrist because of his treatment of the Orthodox Church, namely subordinating the church to the state, requiring clergymen to conform to the standards of all Russian civilians (shaved beards, being fluent in French), and requiring them to pay state taxes.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/pe/Peter1-Rus.html|title=Peter I, czar of Russia|encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|location=New York City|date=1935|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080212044338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/pe/Peter1-Rus.html| archivedate= February 12, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Age of Enlightenment===
Bernard McGinn noted that complete denial of the Antichrist was rare until the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Following frequent use of "Antichrist" laden rhetoric during religious controversies in the 17th century, the use of the concept declined during the 18th century due to the rule of [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened absolutists]], who as European rulers of the time wielded significant influence over official state churches. These efforts{{explain|date=June 2018|reason= why?}} to cleanse Christianity of "legendary" or "folk" accretions effectively removed the Antichrist from discussion in mainstream Western churches.{{sfn|Cabinet|2001}}

===Mormonism===
In [[Mormonism]], the "Antichrist" is anyone or anything that counterfeits the true gospel or [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] and that openly or secretly is set up in opposition to Christ. The great antichrist is [[Lucifer]], but he has many assistants<ref>[[Korihor]] is directly referred to in ''The Book of Mormon'' as an anti-Christ ([[Book of Alma|Alma]] 30:6)</ref> both as spirit beings and as mortals."<ref>{{cite web|last=LDS|first=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|title=Bible Dictionary: Antichrist|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/antichrist?lang=eng|publisher=[[Intellectual Reserve]], Inc}}</ref> [[Latter-day Saint]]s use the New Testament scriptures, 1 John 2:18, 22; 1 John 4:3–6; 2 John 1:7 and the [[Book of Mormon]], [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]] 7:1–23, [[Book of Alma|Alma]] 1:2–16, Alma 30:6–60, in their [[exegesis]] or interpretation of the Antichrist.

===Seventh-day Adventists===
[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] teach that the "Little Horn Power", which (as predicted in the [[Book of Daniel]]) rose after the break-up of the Roman Empire, is the [[Papacy]]. The [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed in the late 5th century. In 533, [[Justinian I]], the emperor of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (which historians have labelled the Byzantine Empire), legally recognized the bishop (pope) of Rome as the head of all the Christian churches.<ref>

Because of the [[Arianism|Arian]] domination of some of the Roman Empire by barbarian tribes, the bishop of Rome could not fully exercise such authority. In 538, [[Belisarius]], one of Justinian's generals, [[Siege of Rome (537–38)|succeeded in withstanding a siege of the city of Rome]] by Arian [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] besiegers, and the bishop of Rome could begin establishing universal civil authority. So, by the military intervention of the Eastern Roman Empire, the bishop of Rome became all-powerful throughout the area of the old Roman Empire.<ref>http://adventist.org.uk/__data/assets/text_file/0011/10910/1260days.txt</ref> The Ostrogoths promptly [[Sack of Rome (546)|re-captured the city of Rome eight years later in 546]], and [[Siege of Rome (549–550)|again in 550]].

Seventh-day Adventists understand the 1260 years as lasting AD 538 to 1798 as the (supposed) duration of the papacy's domination over Rome.<ref>''The Great Controversy'' by Ellen White, p266.

Like many [[Reformation Era|Reformation-era]] Protestant leaders, the Adventist pioneer [[Ellen G. White]] (1827–1915) spoke of the [[Catholic Church]] as a fallen church in preparation for its nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's true church; she saw the pope as the Antichrist.  Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther, John Knox, William Tyndale and others held similar beliefs about the Catholic Church and the papacy when they broke away from the Catholic Church during the Reformation.<ref name="whitehorsemedia.com">{{cite web|url= http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44|title= Articles - White Horse Media|work= White Horse Media}}</ref>

Ellen White writes,
{{quote|His word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is.

Seventh-day Adventists view the length of time the apostate church's unbridled power was permitted to rule as shown in Daniel 7:25: "The little horn would rule a time and times and half a time" - or 1,260 years. They regard papal rule as supreme in Europe from 538 (when the Arian Ostrogoths retreated from Rome into temporary oblivion) until 1798 (when the French general [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] took [[Pope Pius VI]] captive)—a period of 1,260 years<ref>
Paulien, John (2006) - "[https://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/sites/default/files/pdf/1260%20Days%20in%20Revelation.pdf The 1260 Days in the Book of Revelation]"
</ref> - including the 67 years of the [[Avignon Captivity]] (1309-1376).

===Other Christian interpretations===
====Martin Wight====
Devout Christian and political theorist [[Martin Wight]], writing immediately after World War Two, favoured the revival of the Antichrist doctrine; not as a person, but as a recurrent situation featuring 'demonic concentrations of power'.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ian|last=Hall|title=The International Thought of Martin Wight|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=London, England|date=2006|isbn=978-1403969279|page=37}}</ref>

====As "man of lawlessness"====
{{main|Man of sin}}
The Antichrist has been equated with the "man of lawlessness" or "lawless one" of 2 Thessalonians 2:3, though commentaries on the identity of the "man of lawlessness" greatly vary.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.F.|last=Schink|chapter=The Scriptural Doctrine of the Antichrist|title=Our Great Heritage: Vol. 3|editor1-first=Lyle|editor1=Lange|editor2-first=Jerome G.|editor2-last=Albrecht|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod#Publishing|Northwestern Publishing House]]|date=1991|isbn=978-0810003798|page=572}}</ref> The "man of lawlessness" has been identified with [[Caligula]],<ref name="netbible"/> Nero,<ref>St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on II Thess., Nicene-Post Nicene Fathers</ref> and the end times Antichrist. Some scholars believe that the passage contains no genuine prediction, but represents a speculation of the apostle's own, based on contemporary ideas of the Antichrist.<ref name="netbible">[http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=MAN%20OF%20SIN Net Bible: Man of sin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707075356/http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=MAN%20OF%20SIN |date=July 7, 2009 }}</ref>

====As "being in league with other figures"====
Several American [[evangelical]] and [[fundamentalist]] theologians, including Cyrus Scofield, have identified the Antichrist as being in league with (or the same as) several figures in the Book of Revelation including the Dragon (or [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]), the Beast, the False Prophet, and the [[Whore of Babylon]].<ref>See footnotes in [http://www.studylight.org/com/srn/view.cgi?book=re Revelation 7 and 13] in the ''Scofield Reference Bible'', 1917</ref>  Voices in the [[Emerging Church]], such as [[Rob Bell]], reject the identification of the Antichrist with any one person or group. They believe a loving Christ would not view anyone as an enemy.<ref>Bell, Rob; Golden, Don ''Jesus Wants to Save Christians'' 2008.</ref>

====As Satan====
Bernard McGinn described multiple traditions detailing the relationship between the Antichrist and [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]]. In the dualist approach, Satan will become incarnate in the Antichrist, just as [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God became incarnate in Jesus]]. However, in [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] thought, this view was problematic because it was too similar to Christ's incarnation. Instead, the "indwelling" view became more accepted. It stipulates that the Antichrist is a human figure inhabited by Satan, since the latter's power is not to be seen as equivalent to God's.{{sfn|Cabinet|2001}} Luca Signorelli's fresco, ''The Sermon and Deeds of the Antichrist'' (see above), depicts the indwelling view. Satan whispers in the ear of this Christlike figure and his left arm is slipped through the Antichrist's garment as if he is manipulating him. Similar to the whore of Babylon's clothing (Rev. 17:4), the Antichrist's robe is purple.<ref>James L. Resseguie, ''Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 217.</ref>

==Non-Christian views==
{{Eschatology}}

===Judaism===
There are warnings against [[false prophet]]s in the [[Hebrew Bible]], but no personal anti-Messiah figure.<ref>G. W. Lorein (2003). ''The Antichrist Theme in the Intertestamental Period''. p. 31. "Deuteronomy 13:1–6.... The functional equation of the religious aspect of the Beast, of the False Prophet and of the Antichrist in the book of Revelation is already being prepared here. There are also remarkable links with the Antichrist passage in the First Epistle of John.172 b."</ref>

A parodic anti-Messiah type figure known as [[Armilus]], said to be the offspring of Satan and a [[Miraculous births#Christianity|virgin]], appears in some non-legalistic, philosophical schools of [[Jewish eschatology]], such as the 7th century CE [[Sefer Zerubbabel]] and 11th century CE [[Midrash Vayosha]] (also: "''Midrash wa-Yosha''"). He is described as "a monstrosity, bald-headed, with one large and one small eye, deaf in the right ear and maimed in the right arm, while the left arm is two and one-half ells long." Being [[Gog and Magog|Gog]]'s successor, his inevitable destruction by a "[[Messiah ben Joseph]]" (Messiah, son of Joseph (son of Jacob)), symbolizes the ultimate victory of good over evil in the [[Messianic Age]].<ref name="armilus">[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1789&letter=A&search=Armilus Jewish Encyclopedia: Armilus]:</ref> This is confronted with the medieval Christian Antichrist and Islamic [[Masih ad-Dajjal|Dajjal]], who will conquer Jerusalem and persecute the Jews.

===Islam===
''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' ({{lang-ar|الدّجّال}}, literally "The Deceiving Messiah"), is an important figure in [[Islamic eschatology]]. Absent in the [[Quran]], this figure is mentioned and described in the [[Hadith]]. Like in Christianity, the Dajjal is said to emerge out the east, the specific location varies among the sources.<ref name="ReferenceA">David Cook ''Studies in Muslim Apocalyptic'' The Darwin Press, Inc. Princeton, New Jersey {{ISBN|0878501428}} pp. 99-104</ref> He will try to imitate the miracles performed by Jesus, such as healing the sick and raising the dead, the latter done with aid of demons (''[[Shaitan|Shayatin]]''). He will deceive many people, such as weavers, magicians, half-castes and children of prostitutes, but the majority of his followers will be Jews. Eventually the Dajjal will be killed by [[Jesus in Islam|'Isa]] (Jesus), who upon seeing the Dajjal will cause him to slowly dissolve (like salt in water). Jesus will eventually kill him at the gate of Ludd.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

====Ahmadiyya====
Prophecies concerning the emergence of the Antichrist (''Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl'') are interpreted in [[Ahmadiyya]] teachings as designating a specific group of nations centred upon a false theology (or Christology) instead of an individual, with the reference to the Antichrist as an individual indicating its unity as a class or system rather than its personal individuality. As such, Ahmadis identify the Antichrist collectively with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of [[European Christianity]] throughout the world that was propelled by the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glassé|first1=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2003|publisher=Altamira Press|isbn=0-7591-0190-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC|page=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Valentine|first=Simon|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat: history, belief, practice|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-70094-8|page=148}}</ref><ref name="aaiil.org">Muhammad Ali.

'The death of Jesus Christ' explained one of Ahmad's biographers ‘was to be the death-knell of the Christian onslaught against Islam'. As Ahmad argued, the idea of Jesus dying in old age, rather than death on a cross, as taught by the gospel writers, 'invalidates the divinity of Jesus and the doctrine of Atonement'."</ref>

===Baha'i===
The Antichrist is considered to subvert the religion of God from the inner reality of man as [['Abdu'l-Baha]] narrates: "Christ was a divine Center of unity and love. Whenever discord prevails instead of unity, wherever hatred and antagonism take the place of love and spiritual fellowship, Antichrist reigns instead of Christ."<ref>{{cite web|last1='Abdu'l-Baha|first1=Abbas Effendi|title=Some Answered Questions|url=http://www.bahai.org/r/901747607|website=bahai.org|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref>
