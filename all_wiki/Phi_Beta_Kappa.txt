The '''Phi Beta Kappa Society''' ('''ΦΒΚ''') is the oldest academic [[honor society]] in the [[United States]], and is often described as its most prestigious one,<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/26/nyregion/phi-beta-kappa-key-being-turned-down-by-many-honorees.html|title = Phi Beta Kappa Key Being Turned Down By Many Honorees|last= Bernstein|first= Emily|newspaper= New York Times|access-date= May 15, 2018|quote= "The upshot is that Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's most prestigious honor society, has an image problem."|date = 1996-05-26}}</ref> owing to its long history and academic selectivity.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.honorsociety.org/phi-beta-kappa|title = Phi Beta Kappa|website= Honor Society|access-date= May 15, 2018}}</ref> Phi Beta Kappa aims to promote and advocate excellence in the [[liberal arts]] and [[sciences]], and to induct the most outstanding students of arts and sciences at American colleges and universities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://college.as.virginia.edu/phi-beta-kappa|title= Phi Beta Kappa|website= University of Virginia - The College of Arts & Sciences|access-date= May 15, 2018}}</ref> It was founded at the [[College of William and Mary]] on December 5, 1776 as the first collegiate Greek-letter [[fraternity]] and was among the earliest collegiate fraternal societies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.achsnatl.org/warren2.asp |title=Historical Information |accessdate=2009-03-10 |last= Warren |first=John |publisher= Association of College Honor Societies |year=2000}}</ref>

Phi Beta Kappa ({{lang|el|ΦΒΚ}}) stands for {{lang|el|Φιλοσοφία Βίου Κυβερνήτης}} (''{{lang|el-Latn|Philosophia Biou Kybernētēs}}''), which means "Love of learning [lit. wisdom] is the guide [lit. helmsman] of life".<ref>{{cite web |title=Phi Beta Kappa - College of Arts and Sciences |url=https://www.scu.edu/phi-beta-kappa/ |website=www.scu.edu |publisher=Santa Clara University |accessdate=17 August 2019}}</ref>

Membership in Phi Beta Kappa is limited to undergraduates with very high [[GPA]]s, typically at least 3.8 out of a 4.0 scale. In 2001, a quorum of PBK alumni voted to raise the GPA cutoff: though all chapters set their standards for induction, they were now instructed to be much more selective in terms of GPA. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:PBKclose.jpg|thumb|[[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]] entrance at [[The College of William & Mary]], now undergoing demolition.]] 

The Phi Beta Kappa Society had its first meeting on December 5, 1776 at the [[College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] by five students, with John Heath as its first President. The society established the precedent for naming American college societies after the initial letters of a secret Greek motto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/History|title=PBK_History|last=Society|first=Phi Beta Kappa|website=www.pbk.org|publisher=[[Phi Beta Kappa]]|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

The group consisted of students who frequented the [[Raleigh Tavern]] as a common meeting area off the college campus. A persistent story maintains that a Masonic lodge also met at this tavern, but the [[Freemasons]] actually gathered at a different building in Williamsburg<ref name="Brinkley, M. Kent Brinkley">{{cite web |url=http://www.acacia16.org/GL/History |title=Freemasonry in Williamsburge: An Overview History of Williamsburg Lodge #6, A.F.& A.M. of Virginia |author=Brinkley, M.

Whether the students organized to meet more freely and discuss non-academic topics, or to discuss politics in a Revolutionary society is unknown.  The earliest records indicate only that the students met to debate and engage in oratory, and on topics that would have been not far removed from the curriculum.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|83–85}}<ref name="Fleming, Bill">{{cite web|accessdate= October 26, 2015|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~eng_wpf/frat_hist.html |date=May 6, 1996 |publisher=Sam Houston State University|work=Brief History of Fraternities |title=Phi Beta Kappa|author=Fleming, Bill}}</ref> In the Phi Beta Kappa Initiation of 1779, the new member was informed, "here then you may for a while disengage yourself from scholastic cares and communicate without reserve whatever reflections you have made upon various objects; remembering that every thing transacted within this room is transacted ''[[sub rosa]]'', ...here, too, you are to indulge in matters of speculation that freedom of enquiry which ever dispels the clouds of falsehood by the radiant sunshine of truth...".<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|5}}

===Latin letter fraternal societies===
There had been an earlier fraternal society established at [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]], the F.H.C. Society (nicknamed "the [[Flat Hat Club]]"), which was founded in 1750. The F.H.C. Society is the first recorded collegiate secret society in North America, but unlike Phi Beta Kappa, it was a Latin-letter society. Its name was taken from letters of a secret Latin motto with acronym F.H.C.<ref name=DoG_Becca2004>{{cite web

A second Latin-letter fraternity at [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] was the P.D.A. Society (publicly known as "Please Don't Ask").<ref name="ReferenceA">Robert W. Storm, "In Token of Friendship: Early Fraternity Medals at the College of William and Mary"; 1973; typescript in university archives, Earl Gregg Swem Library, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia.</ref>  [[John Heath (politician)|John Heath]], chief organizer of Phi Beta Kappa, according to tradition earlier sought but was refused admission to the P.D.A., though he may instead have disdained to join it. Heath's friend and fellow student William Short later wrote that the P.D.A. "had lost all reputation for letters, and was noted only for the dissipation & conviviality of its members".<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|84}}

===Secret fraternal society===
[[File:Phi Beta Kappa DC.JPG|thumb|The Phi Beta Kappa Society National Headquarters located in the historic [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

The new society was intended to be "purely of domestic manufacture, without any connection whatever with anything European, either English or German."<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|84}}  The founders of Phi Beta Kappa declared that the society was formed for congeniality and to promote good fellowship, with "friendship as its basis and benevolence and literature as its pillars."<ref name=Hastings/>

Like the older, Latin-letter fraternities, the Phi Beta Kappa was a secret society.  To protect its members and to instill a sense of solidarity, each had the essential attributes of most modern fraternities:  an oath of secrecy, a badge (or token) and a diploma (or certificate) of membership, mottoes (in the case of the Phi Beta Kappa, in Greek rather than in Latin), a ritual of initiation, a handclasp of recognition; to these, the Phi Beta Kappa would soon add another attribute, branches or "chapters" at other colleges.  The new society was given the motto, {{lang|el|Φιλοσοφία Βίου Κυβερνήτης}} or in Latin letters ''{{lang|el-Latn|Philosophia Biou Kybernētēs}}'', which means in English ''Love of learning is the guide of life''. [[Greek language|Greek]] was chosen, because Greek was in [[Roman times]] the language of science like [[Latin language|Latin]] in [[Middle Ages|medieval times]].

Later, in May 1777, a new sign of recognition was devised: "a salutation of the clasp of the hands, together with an immediate stroke across the mouth with the back of the same hand, and a return with the hand used by the saluted".  This new complex of gestures was created to allow the mutual recognition of members "in any foreign country or place."<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|10}}

Before the British invasion of Virginia forced the temporary closure of the [[College of William and Mary]] and disbandment of the Phi Beta Kappa there early in 1781, Elisha Parmelee, an alumnus of [[Yale University|Yale College]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard College]], passed through Williamsburg and took charters from the Phi Beta Kappa to establish branches of the society at these schools.  A second chapter was founded at Yale College in late 1780; a third, at Harvard College in 1781; and a fourth, at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1787.

===Transition to academic honor society===
Further chapters appeared at [[Union College]] in 1817, [[Bowdoin College]] in 1825, and [[Brown University]] in 1830.  The original chapter at [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] was re-established.  In 1831, the Harvard chapter publicly disclosed the fraternity's secrets during a period of strong anti-[[Masonic]] sentiment.  The first chapter established after the Phi Beta Kappa became an "open" society was that at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)]], in 1845.

In the pre-Civil War period, Society chapters frequently sponsored addresses by distinguished speakers.  Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1837 address at Harvard, "The American Scholar" is the best-known of those addresses, but there were dozens of others at schools such as Bowdoin, Brown, Harvard, Union, and Yale.<ref name="blurblawg.typepad.com">Alfred L. Brophy, [http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/greene.pdf The Rule of Law in College Literary Addresses: The Case of William Greene, Cumberland Law Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329200920/http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/greene.pdf |date=March 29, 2016 }} (2001) 32: 231–85.</ref>

As the first collegiate organization of its type to adopt a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]-letter name, the Phi Beta Kappa is generally considered a forerunner of modern college [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] as well as the model for later collegiate honorary societies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/26/nyregion/phi-beta-kappa-key-being-turned-down-by-many-honorees.html|title=Phi Beta Kappa Key Being Turned Down By Many Honorees|last=Bernstein|first=Emily M.|date=1996-05-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  Ironically, it was partly the rise of true "social" fraternities modelled after Phi Beta Kappa later in the nineteenth century which obviated the social aspects of membership in the organization, transforming it into the honorary society it is today.

By 1883, when the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa was established, there were 25 chapters. The first women were elected to the Society at the [[University of Vermont]] in 1875, and the first African-American member was elected at the same institution two years later. In 1885, however, Phi Beta Kappa eliminated those majoring in engineering from eligibility. This practice continues today.

Each chapter is designated by its state and a Greek letter indicating its position in the order in which that state's chapters were founded. For example, Alpha of Pennsylvania refers to the chapter at [[Dickinson College]], founded in 1887; Beta of Pennsylvania, the chapter at [[Lehigh University]] (founded later that same year); Gamma of Pennsylvania, the chapter at [[Lafayette College]] (1890); and Delta of Pennsylvania, the chapter at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1892).

By 1920, a total of 89 chapters existed at a variety of schools.

In the 1960s, [[Vanderbilt University]] professor [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]] claimed that Phi Beta Kappa was under the influence of Communists.<ref name="southerncharacter177">{{cite book |last1=Houston |first1=Benjamin|editor-first1=Lisa |editor-last1=Tendrich Frank |editor-first2=Kilbride |editor-last2= Daniel |title=Southern Character: Essays in Honor of Bertram Wyatt-Brown |chapter=Donald Davidson and the Segregationist Intellect |date=2011 |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville, Florida |page=177|isbn=9780813036908|oclc=949154540}}</ref>

In 1988, the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa officially changed its name to ''The Phi Beta Kappa Society'', recalling the name under which the organization had been established in 1776.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Key==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
The symbol of the Phi Beta Kappa Society is a golden key engraved on the obverse with the image of a pointing finger, three stars, and the Greek letters from which the society takes its name. On the reverse are found the initials "SP" in script. One official historian of the society, William T. Hastings, and some others believe that the "S" and "P", which stood for ''Societas Philosophiae'', "Philosophical Society", was the original name of the Society and that "Phi Beta Kappa" came only over time to be taken as the name of the society.  The heading on the original list of members states, "A List of the members, who have been initiated into the S.P. alias Phi Beta Kappa Society."<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|5}}

The "key" of Phi Beta Kappa did not begin as a copy of a watchkey. The first insignia was in fact a larger, cut-and-engraved silver medallion, essentially a square of metal with a loop cut integrally with the body of the square from the same sheet of silver, in order to allow for suspension from one or two ribbons worn around the member's neck in the manner in which the older fraternities (and the Masonic bodies on which the collegiate societies were in part patterned) wore their own insignia.<ref name="ReferenceA" />  Later, the size of the medallion was reduced and men took to wearing the insignia on their watch chains as fobs. 

Though several stylistic details have survived since the earliest days—the use of the stars, pointing hand, and Greek letters on the obverse, for example—notable differences exist between older keys and current examples.  The name of the recipient was not engraved on the earliest fobs or keys, and was not until the first decade of the nineteenth century.  The name of the school from which the fob or key came was also not routinely included on the earliest models, and sometimes the only way to trace a key to a particular school's chapter is by researching the name of the recipient against surviving class records.  The number of stars on the obverse has also changed over the years, with never fewer than three, but on some known examples with as many as a dozen (the explanation as to the meaning of the stars in these early cases varies from chapter to chapter).  Also, the date of the awarding of the honor is only seen on keys from the second quarter of the nineteenth century onward (some people mistake the date that appears on the fob or key—December 5, 1776—as the date that a particular fob or key was awarded, when in fact it is merely the date of the founding of the society).  Only in 1912 was the key made to a uniform standard of size, golden appearance (some are plated), and engraving with the school's name, recipient's name, and date of the award.

==Activities and publications==
The Phi Beta Kappa Society publishes ''The Key Reporter'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keyreporter.org|title=The Key Reporter - Welcome!|website=www.keyreporter.org}}</ref> a newsletter distributed quarterly to all contributing members and biannually to all other members, and ''[[The American Scholar (magazine)|The American Scholar]]'', a quarterly subscription-based journal that accepts essays on literature, history, science, public affairs, and culture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phi Beta Kappa|url=https://undergrad.stanford.edu/opportunities-research/awards-and-graduation-honors/phi-beta-kappa|website=Stanford University|publisher=Stanford|accessdate=15 May 2017}}</ref>

Phi Beta Kappa also funds a number of awards, fellowships, and programs.

The Phi Beta Kappa Book Awards are the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson Award]], the Christian Gauss Award (named for [[Christian Gauss]]), and the [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Awards |url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/AWARDS___FELLOWSHIPS/PBK_Book_Awards/PBK_Member/Programs/Awards___Fellowships/Book_Awards.aspx?hkey=2e9f4fb1-8783-4a57-be70-477f88a62c69|website=The Phi Beta Kappa Society|publisher=The PBK Society|accessdate=15 May 2017}}</ref><ref>https://www.pbk.org/Book-Awards</ref> The Book Awards are given annually to outstanding scholarly books published in the United States.  Winning works, which are drawn from the fields of the humanities, the social sciences, the natural sciences and mathematics, must be of broad interest and accessible to the general reader. Each award carries a $10,000 prize.  The winners were selected from five short listed titles in each category.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/web/2016BookAwards|title=Book Awards 2016 Winners|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org|access-date=2017-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808233407/https://www.pbk.org/web/2016BookAwards|archive-date=2017-08-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Mary Isabel Sibley Fellowship is awarded annually, alternating in the fields of Greek and French. The award may be used for the study of Greek language, literature, history, or archaeology, or the study of French language or literature. Established in 1934 by Isabelle Stone (ΦΒΚ, Wellesley College) in honor of her mother, Mary Isabel Sibley, the fellowship was designed to reward the women in these two fields of study with the experience of studying and living abroad, which Miss Stone did in Greece during her studies. The fellowship carries a stipend of $20,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/AWARDS___FELLOWSHIPS/Sibley_Fellowship/PBK_Member/Programs/Awards___Fellowships/Sibley_Fellowship.aspx?hkey=fe51c0cb-0859-40c6-965f-665744f69cab|title=Sibley Fellowship|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref>

The Walter J. Jensen Fellowship for French Language, Literature, and Culture aims to help educators and researchers improve education in standard French language, literature and culture and in the study of standard French in the United States. Established in 2001 by Professor Walter J. Jensen (ΦΒΚ, UCLA), the fellowship is awarded for at least six continuous months of study in France and carries a stipend originally set in 1995 at $10,000, to be adjusted for inflation. The stipend for 2016 was $15,500.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/AWARDS___FELLOWSHIPS/Jensen_Fellowship/PBK_Member/Programs/Awards___Fellowships/Jensen_Fellowship.aspx?hkey=c74e1292-5356-43b0-babc-c781a0cc356a|title=Jensen Fellowship|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref>

The Dr. Martin R. Lebowitz and Eve Lewellis Lebowitz Prize for Philosophical Achievement and Contribution is awarded by the Phi Beta Kappa Society in conjunction with the [[American Philosophical Association]]. The associated Lebowitz Symposium is presented annually at a divisional meeting of the American Philosophical Association. The prize was established in 2013 by Eve Lewellis Lebowitz in honor of her late husband, Martin R. Lebowitz, to provide a significant, tangible recognition for excellence in philosophical thought. The Symposium program consists of a pair of lectures to be delivered at an annual APA division meeting and a Phi Beta Kappa event. The topic of the lectures should be an important philosophical issue of current interest, and the lectures should offer contrasting (not necessarily opposing) views on that topic. Honoraria for the symposiasts are funded at an adjusted rate based on the current size of the endowment. Previous winners have won as much as $25,000 each.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/AWARDS___FELLOWSHIPS/The_Lebowitz_Prize/PBK_Member/Programs/Awards___Fellowships/The_Lebowitz_Prizes.aspx?hkey=9d095cb3-20c0-4a57-84f9-66f1020ec722|title=The Lebowitz Prizes|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref>

The Romanell-Phi Beta Kappa Professorship is awarded annually to scholars in the field of philosophy, without restriction to any one school of philosophical thought. The professorship recognizes not only distinguished achievement but also the recipient's contribution or potential contribution to public understanding of philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/AWARDS___FELLOWSHIPS/Romanell_Professorship/PBK_Member/Programs/Awards___Fellowships/Romanell_Professorship.aspx?hkey=2a4f48c1-d7e9-4dc6-99f0-0818fd1d2473|title=Romanell Professorship|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref>

Since 1956, the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar Program has offered undergraduates the opportunity to spend time with some of America's most distinguished scholars. The purpose of the program is to contribute to the intellectual life of the campus by making possible an exchange of ideas between the Visiting Scholars and the resident faculty and students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/Visiting_Scholars/PBK_Member/Programs/Visiting_Scholars/Visiting_Scholars.aspx?hkey=ffc468af-95a4-48af-86c7-e03e68b2f18e|title=Visiting Scholars|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref>

Phi Beta Kappa also sponsors a National Arts & Sciences Initiative, which taps into its cross-country network of members, chapters, and associations to connect with leaders, shares the value of the arts and sciences through all of life, and advocates for policies that strengthen an arts and sciences education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/WEB/PBK_Member/PROGRAMS/Arts_Sciences/PBK_Member/Programs/Arts___Sciences/National_Arts_and_Sciences_Initiative.aspx?hkey=783e28d2-51de-4b92-bfab-c60eb602c14e|title=National Arts and Sciences Initiative|first=Phi Beta Kappa|last=Society|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref>
