The '''Samsung Group'''<ref>{{Cite web |title=SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS Co., Ltd. 2020 Half-year Business Report |url=https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/p5/global/ir/docs/2020_Half_Year_Report.pdf |access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> is a South Korean [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] headquartered in [[Samsung Town]], [[Seoul]].<ref name="samsung.co.kr" /> It comprises numerous affiliated businesses,<ref name="samsung.co.kr" /> most of them united under the ''Samsung'' brand, and is the largest South Korean ''[[chaebol]]'' (business conglomerate).

Samsung was founded by [[Lee Byung-chul]] in 1938 as a [[trading company]]. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the [[electronics industry]] in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into four business groups&nbsp;– Samsung Group, [[Shinsegae]] Group, [[CJ Group]] and [[Hansol]] Group. Since 1990, Samsung has increasingly globalised its activities and electronics; in particular, its mobile phones and semiconductors have become its most important source of income. As of 2020, Samsung has the 8th highest global [[brand valuation|brand value]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20201018162839/https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/</ref>

==History==

=== 1938–1970 ===
[[File:Lee Byung-chul.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Lee Byung-chul]], founder of Samsung]]
In 1938, during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-ruled Korea]], [[Lee Byung-chul]] (1910–1987) of a large landowning family in the [[Uiryeong]] county moved to nearby [[Daegu]] city and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company ({{nihongo|株式会社三星商会|Kabushiki gaisha Mitsuboshi Shōkai}}), or ''Samsung Sanghoe'' (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung started out as a small trading company with forty employees located in Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong).<ref name="Samsung">{{Cite web |title=History – Corporate Profile – About Samsung – Samsung |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/corporateprofile/history06.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415235250/http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/corporateprofile/history06.html |archive-date=15 April 2011 |access-date=21 October 2015 |website=Samsung Group |publisher=Samsung Group}}</ref> It dealt in dried-fish,<ref name="Samsung" /> locally-grown groceries and noodles. The company prospered and Lee moved its head office to Seoul in 1947. When the [[Korean War]] broke out, he was forced to leave Seoul. He started a [[sugar refinery]] in [[Busan]] named [[CJ Group|''Cheil Jedang'']]. In 1954, Lee founded [[Cheil Industries|''Cheil Mojik'']] and built the plant in Chimsan-dong, [[Daegu]]. It was the largest woollen mill ever in the country.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Samsung diversified into many different areas. Lee sought to establish Samsung as a leader in a wide range of industries. Samsung moved into lines of business such as insurance, securities, and retail.

In 1947, Cho Hong-jai, the Hyosung group's founder, jointly invested in a new company called Samsung Mulsan Gongsa, or the Samsung Trading Corporation, with the Samsung's founder Lee Byung-chull. The trading firm grew to become the present-day [[Samsung C&T Corporation]]. After a few years, Cho and Lee separated due to differences in management style. Cho wanted a 30 equity share. Samsung Group was separated into Samsung Group and [[Hyosung]] Group, [[Hankook Tire]] and other businesses.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 November 2009 |title=Industrial giant's roots tied to nylon products |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2912292 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120034605/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2912292 |archive-date=20 January 2011 |access-date=5 February 2011 |publisher=Joongangdaily.joins.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=19 June 2007 |title=효성 40년史..오너 일가 뒷얘기 '눈길' |url=http://www.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/06/19/2007061900326.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501034012/http://www.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/06/19/2007061900326.html |archive-date=1 May 2011 |access-date=5 February 2011 |publisher=www.chosun.com}}</ref>

In the late 1960s, Samsung Group entered the electronics industry. It formed several electronics-related divisions, such as Samsung Electronics Devices, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning and Samsung Semiconductor & Telecommunications, and made the facility in [[Suwon]]. Its first product was a black-and-white television set.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1980, Samsung acquired the [[Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do|Gumi]]-based ''Hanguk Jeonja Tongsin'' and entered telecommunications hardware. Its early products were switchboards. The facility was developed into the telephone and fax manufacturing systems and became the center of Samsung's mobile phone manufacturing. They have produced over 800 million mobile phones to date.<ref>{{in lang|ko}} [http://www.gumisamsung.com/jsp/gp/GPHistory03.jsp Gumisamsung.com]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The company grouped them together under Samsung Electronics in the 1980s.

After Lee, the founder's death in 1987, Samsung Group was separated into five business groups—Samsung Group, [[Shinsegae]] Group, [[CJ Group]], [[Hansol]] Group and the [[JoongAng Ilbo|JoongAng Group]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 March 2010 |title=Samsung to celebrate 100th anniversary of late founder |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/business/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100122000028 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429191227/http://www.koreaherald.com/business/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100122000028 |archive-date=29 April 2011 |access-date=21 January 2011 |publisher=koreaherald.com}}</ref> Shinsegae (discount store, department store) was originally part of Samsung Group, separated in the 1990s from the Samsung Group along with CJ Group (Food/Chemicals/Entertainment/logistics), Hansol Group (Paper/Telecom), and the JoongAng Group (Media).

One Hansol Group source asserted, "Hansol, Shinsegae, and CJ have been under independent management since their respective separations from the Samsung Group". One Shinsegae department store executive director said, "Shinsegae has no payment guarantees associated with the Samsung Group".<ref name="ja1">[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1877426 Hansol, Shinsegae Deny Relations with Saehan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513092152/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1877426 |date=13 May 2011 }} 24 May 2000.

In 1980s, Samsung Electronics began to invest heavily in research and development, investments that were pivotal in pushing the company to the forefront of the global electronics industry. In 1982, it built a television assembly plant in Portugal; in 1984, a plant in New York; in 1985, a plant in Tokyo; in 1987, a facility in England; and another facility in [[Austin, Texas]], in 1996. As of 2012, Samsung has invested more than {{currency|13 billion|USD}} in the Austin facility, which operates under the name Samsung Austin Semiconductor. This makes the Austin location the largest foreign investment in [[Texas]] and one of the largest single [[foreign investments]] in the United States.<ref name="abj2012">{{Citation |title=Samsung invests $4B in Austin to boost chip output |date=21 August 2012 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/morning_call/2012/08/samsung-invests-4b-in-austin-to-boost.html |work=[[Austin Business Journal]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005094431/http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/morning_call/2012/08/samsung-invests-4b-in-austin-to-boost.html |access-date=22 August 2012 |archive-date=5 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=9 June 2010 |title=Samsung Austin Semiconductor Begins $3.6B Expansion for Advanced Logic Chips |url=http://www.austinchamber.com/TheChamber/AboutTheChamber/NewsReleases/2010/SASpressrelease.pdf |access-date=13 September 2010 |publisher=Austinchamber.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Samsung started to rise as an international corporation in the 1990s.

In 1996, the Samsung Group reacquired the [[Sungkyunkwan University]] foundation.

Samsung became the world's largest producer of memory chips in 1992 and is the world's second-largest chipmaker after [[Intel]] (see Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Market Share Ranking Year by Year).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cho |first=Kevin |date=24 April 2009 |title=Samsung Says Hopes of Recovery Are 'Premature' as Profit Falls |publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=a0wNfW_5OZ5s&refer=asia |url-status=dead |access-date=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826171938/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/court-bans-sales-of-some-apple-samsung-products-in-south-korea-as-patent-war-unfolds/2012/08/23/80c9b1da-ed99-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html |archive-date=26 August 2012}}</ref> In 1995, it created its first [[Liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]] screen.

[[S-LCD]] was owned by Samsung (50% plus one share) and Sony (50% minus one share) and operates its factories and facilities in Tanjung, South Korea.

Compared to other major Korean companies, Samsung survived the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] relatively unharmed. However, [[Samsung Motor]] was sold to [[Renault]] at a significant loss. {{As of|2010}}, [[Renault Samsung]] is 80.1 percent owned by [[Renault]] and 19.9 percent owned by Samsung. Additionally, Samsung manufactured a range of [[aircraft]] from the 1980s to the 1990s. The company was founded in 1999 as Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), the result of a merger between then three domestic major [[aerospace]] divisions of [[Samsung Aerospace]], Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hyundai Space and Aircraft Company.

; [[Rollei]]&nbsp;– Swiss watch battle
: [[Samsung Techwin]] acquired the German camera manufacturer [[Rollei]] in 1995. Samsung (Rollei) used its optic expertise on the crystals of a new line of 100% Swiss-made watches, designed by a team of watchmakers at Nouvelle Piquerez S.A. in Bassecourt, Switzerland. Rolex's decision to fight Rollei on every front stemmed from the close resemblance between the two names and fears that its sales would suffer as a consequence. In the face of such a threat, the Geneva firm decided to confront. This was also a demonstration of the Swiss watch industry's determination to defend itself when an established brand is threatened. Rolex sees this front-line battle as vital for the entire Swiss watch industry. Rolex has succeeded in keeping Rollei out of the German market. On 11 March 1995, the [[Cologne]] District court prohibited the advertising and sale of Rollei watch on German territory.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 June 1997 |title=Voigtländer & Rollei non-camera items |url=http://web.me.com/fwstutterheim/rugarchives/1997-06/00189.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821022936/http://web.me.com/fwstutterheim/rugarchives/1997-06/00189.html |archive-date=21 August 2011 |access-date=5 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=June 1996 |title=Basel 96 Watches Take Back the Spotlight |url=http://www.jckonline.com/article/284233-Basel_96_Watches_Take_Back_The_Spotlight.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110205184829/http://www.jckonline.com/article/284233-Basel_96_Watches_Take_Back_The_Spotlight.php |archive-date=5 February 2011 |access-date=5 February 2011 |publisher=jckonline.com}}</ref> In 1999, Rollei management bought out the company.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Franke & Heidecke – Rollei TLRs |url=http://www.tlr-cameras.com/German/Rollei.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930040224/http://www.tlr-cameras.com/German/Rollei.html |archive-date=30 September 2015 |access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>

In 2007, former Samsung chief lawyer Kim Yong Chul claimed that he was involved in [[bribing]] and [[False evidence|fabricating evidence]] on behalf of the group's chairman, [[Lee Kun-hee]], and the company. Kim said that Samsung lawyers trained executives to serve as [[scapegoats]] in a "fabricated scenario" to protect Lee, even though those executives were not involved. Kim also told the media that he was "sidelined" by Samsung after he refused to pay a $3.3 million bribe to the U.S. Federal District Court judge presiding over a case where two of their executives were found guilty on charges related to memory chip price-fixing.

===Labor abuses===
Samsung was the subject of several complaints about child labor in its supply chain from 2012 to 2015.

In July 2014, Samsung cut its contract with Shinyang Electronics after it received a complaint about the company violating child labor laws.<ref name="CLW" /> Samsung says that its investigation turned up evidence of Shinyang using underage workers and that it severed relations immediately per its "zero tolerance" policy for child labor violations.

One of Samsung's Chinese supplier factories, HEG, was criticized for using underage workers by China Labor Watch (CLW) in July 2014. HEG denied the charges and has sued China Labor Watch.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Another Samsung supplier factory exploiting child labor |url=http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/90 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121183504/http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/90 |archive-date=21 January 2015 |access-date=20 September 2018 |website=www.chinalaborwatch.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Cover-up involving underage workers at Samsung supplier alleged by labor group |language=en |work=PCWorld |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2854812/coverup-involving-underage-workers-at-samsung-supplier-alleged-by-labor-group.html |url-status=live |access-date=20 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122003944/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2854812/coverup-involving-underage-workers-at-samsung-supplier-alleged-by-labor-group.html |archive-date=22 January 2015}}</ref>

CLW issued a statement in August 2014 claiming that HEG employed over ten children under the age of 16 at a factory in [[Huizhou]], [[Guangdong]]. The group said the youngest child identified was 14 years old. Samsung said that it conducted an onsite investigation of the production line that included one-on-one interviews but found no evidence of child labor being used. CLW responded that HEG had already dismissed the workers described in its statement before Samsung's investigators arrived.<ref name="CLW">{{Cite news |last=Reisinger |first=Don |date=28 August 2014 |title=Samsung supplier factory found to use child labor, watchdog says |work=CNET |location=United States |url=https://cnet.com/news/samsung-supplier-factory-found-to-have-child-labor-watchdog-says/ |url-status=live |access-date=10 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228095047/http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-supplier-factory-found-to-have-child-labor-watchdog-says/ |archive-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>

CLW also claimed that HEG violated overtime rules for adult workers. CLW said a female college student was only paid her standard wage despite working four hours of overtime per day even though Chinese law requires overtime pay at 1.5 to 2.0 times standard wages.<ref name="CLW" />

===Price fixing===
On 19 October 2011, Samsung companies were fined €145,727,000 for being part of a price cartel of ten companies for [[DRAM]]s which lasted from 1 July 1998 to 15 June 2002. The companies received, like most of the other members of the cartel, a 10-% reduction for acknowledging the facts to investigators. Samsung had to pay 90% of their share of the settlement, but Micron avoided payment as a result of having initially revealed the case to investigators.<ref name="Antitrust: Commission fines DRAM producers € 331 million for price cartel; reaches first settlement in a cartel case">{{Cite web |title=Antitrust: Commission fines DRAM producers € 331 million for price cartel; reaches first settlement in a cartel case |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/586 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707041505/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP%2F10%2F586 |archive-date=7 July 2010 |access-date=22 April 2012 |website=European Commission |publisher=European Commission}}</ref>

In Canada, during 1999, some [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] microchip manufacturers [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspired]] to price fix, among the accused included Samsung. The price fix was investigated in 2002. A recession started to occur that year, and the price fix ended; however, in 2014, the Canadian government reopened the case and investigated silently. Sufficient evidence was found and presented to Samsung and two other manufacturers during a [[class action lawsuit]] hearing. The companies agreed upon a $120 million agreement, with $40 million as a fine, and $80 Million to be paid back to Canadians who purchased a computer, printer, MP3 player, gaming console or camera from April 1999 to June 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Canadian DRAM Class Action |url=http://www.themoneyismine.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915090924/http://themoneyismine.com/ |archive-date=15 September 2015 |access-date=31 August 2015 |website=themoneyismine.com}}</ref>

===Illegal sales of DRAM in the USA===
In 1987, United States International Trade Commission order that the Samsung Group of South Korea unlawfully sold computer chips in the United States without licenses from the chip inventor, Texas Instruments Inc. The order requires Samsung to pay a penalty to Texas Instruments within the coming weeks. Otherwise, sales of all dynamic random access memory chips made by Samsung and all products using the chips would be banned in the United States. The ban includes circuit boards and equipment called single-in-line packages made by other companies that use D-RAM's made by Samsung with 64,000 or 256,000 characters of memory. It also covers computers, facsimile machines and certain telecommunications equipment and printers bearing either of the Samsung chips.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hayes |first=Thomas .C |date=22 September 1987 |title=Samsung Sold Chips Illegally |agency=The New York TImes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/business/samsung-sold-chips-illegally.html |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>
