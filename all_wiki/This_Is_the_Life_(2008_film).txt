'''''This is the Life''''' is a 2008 documentary film directed by [[Ava DuVernay]], which chronicles the alternative [[hip hop]] movement that flourished in 1990s [[Los Angeles]] and its legendary center, the [[Good Life Cafe]]. 

Interviewees include [[Myka 9]] and [[Peace (rapper)|P.E.A.C.E.]] of [[Freestyle Fellowship]], [[Chali 2na]] and [[Cut Chemist]] of [[Jurassic 5]], [[Medusa]], [[Abstract Rude]], [[Pigeon John]], [[2Mex]], [[Chillin Villain Empire]], [[Busdriver]] and many others.

== Good Life Cafe ==

The Good Life Health Food Centre's  weekly [[open-mic]] night started in December 1989 on the corner of Crenshaw & Exposition. Promoted by B. Hall and her son R/KainBlaze with his friends The Mighty O-Roc and The Dynamic Flow, KNGR: The Underground Radio at the Good Life offered a workshop-like atmosphere for aspiring MCs, poets and musicians to hone their craft. On Thursday nights from 8-10pm, artists were allowed to perform one song. Some would perform written songs, and some would [[Freestyle music|freestyle]]. When a performance was not up to par, the audience would call out "Please pass the mic!" and the emcee had to end the performance promptly. In addition, there was a strict policy that no cursing was allowed. B. Hall once explained, "Young people needed a place to go to develop their own art. The no-cussing policy wasnâ€™t about us being uptight church people, it was about wanting the atmosphere of a serious arts workshop. Most of the crowd respected the rule, some said it made rapping more challenging, that it created more respect and brotherhood."

[[Ice Cube]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[will.i.am]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Macy Gray]], and [[Lenny Kravitz]] reportedly attended the open-mic, while artists such as [[The Pharcyde]], [[Biz Markie]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Skee-Lo]], and [[Kurupt]] occasionally performed there. Good Life Regulars [[Rebels of Rhythm]] and Unity Committee came together to form [[Jurassic 5]]. Other Good Life regulars included [[Freestyle Fellowship]], [[Pigeon John]], [[Abstract Rude]], Chillin Villain Empire, Rifleman Ellay Khule, [[Volume 10 (rapper)|Volume 10]], Medusa, Figures of Speech, OMD, Spoon Iodine, Ganjah K, and Fat Jack, among many others.
