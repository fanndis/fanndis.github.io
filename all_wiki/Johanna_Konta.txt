==Career==
===2008: $10,000 title===
Konta won her first ITF singles title at a $10k tournament in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly before her 17th birthday in May 2008. She commented that the best was yet to come.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===2009: $25,000 title===
Konta achieved a significant breakthrough at a $25k tournament in Sutton, England, in February 2009. Entering as a wild card, she defeated the top seed, [[Corinna Dentoni]], who was ranked 153 at the time, and two other top 250 players to reach the final where she lost in three sets to [[Katie O'Brien]]. Konta backed this performance up by winning a $25k tournament in June at the W.O.W. Challenger in Waterloo, Ontario, over [[Heidi El Tabakh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowchallenger.com/WOW/2009_Event.html |title=2009 Event |work=wowchallenger.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326120107/http://www.wowchallenger.com/WOW/2009_Event.html |archivedate=26 March 2012 }}</ref>

Konta then went through a difficult time in the second half of the year, losing her first match in eight of the nine tournaments entered, six of these losses going to three sets. However, with the help of the earlier results, she rose from 668 to 360 in the world rankings during the year.

===2010: $50,000 title===
Konta regained some form at the start of 2010. In May, she reached the quarterfinal of the $50k tournament at Indian Harbour Beach, Florida. The following week she took the title on the green clay courts of [[RBC Bank Women's Challenger|Raleigh, North Carolina]], another $50k tournament, where, the day before her 19th birthday, she defeated [[Lindsay Lee-Waters]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/women%27s-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1100021700|title=Raleigh Tournament Details|work=[[International Tennis Federation]]|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

Highlights later in the year included another $50k quarterfinal appearance, two semifinal appearances in $25k tournaments and her second ITF singles title of the year at a $10k event in Westende, Belgium, where, in the final, she defeated Nicky Van Dyck for the loss of just one game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=9J2UBJS2|title=Nicky Van Dyck kansloos in finale tegen Johanna Konta|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=10 January 2013|language=Dutch}}</ref> Konta also played her first [[WTA Tour]] event when she entered the qualifying for [[2010 e-Boks Danish Open|Copenhagen]], winning a match before exiting the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/SEWTATour-Archive/posting/2010/1042/QS.pdf|title=e-Boks Sony Ericsson Open 2010 – Qualifying Singles|work=[[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]|accessdate=18 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921064404/http://www.wtatennis.com/SEWTATour-Archive/posting/2010/1042/QS.pdf|archivedate=21 September 2012}}</ref>

===2011: Drop in ranking===
In April 2011, she lost in three sets in the qualifying draw of [[2011 Family Circle Cup|Charleston]] to [[Sania Mirza]]. She also fell in qualifying at [[2011 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem|Fes]] and [[2011 Internationaux de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]]. Konta reached the main draw of a WTA Tour event for her first time when she qualified at [[2011 e-Boks Sony Ericsson Open|Copenhagen]] in June, falling in the first round to fourth seed [[Lucie Šafářová]], who was ranked 38 at the time, in a match that lasted over two and half hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/rubriche/monday-s-net/2016/01/25/news/jo_konta_la_ragazza_cocciuta_che_melbourne_non_ama-132007900/|title=Jo Konta, la ragazza di Sydney che Melbourne non-ama|work=[[la Repubblica]]|date=25 January 2016|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=Italian}}</ref>

After a patchy couple of months interrupted by injury, Konta got back to her winning ways at the $10k event in Madrid, beating Lucy Brown in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lta.org.uk/fans-major-events/Tournament-Calendar/2011/September/10000-Madrid-2011/|title=LTA – $10,000 Madrid 2011|work=[[Lawn Tennis Association|LTA]]|date=12 September 2011|accessdate=10 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825133200/http://www.lta.org.uk/fans-major-events/Tournament-Calendar/2011/September/10000-Madrid-2011/|archivedate=25 August 2012}}</ref> However, her year ended during a second meeting with Robson in the first round at [[Aegon GB Pro-Series Barnstaple|Barnstaple]] in October, with Konta having to retire this time. She slipped from 248 to 305 in the world rankings over the course of the season, and showed an improvement of only 55 places over the previous two years.<ref name="WTA"/>

In April, Konta played in the [[2013 Fed Cup World Group II Play-offs|Fed Cup World Group II play-off]] against Argentina. Konta was initially nominated to represent Britain in two of the singles rubbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/tennis/fed-cup-2/2013/gb-s-robson-and-konta-to-face-argentina-in-singles-rubbers_sto3720135/story.shtml|title=GB's Robson and Konta to face Argentina in singles rubbers|work=[[Eurosport]]|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref> However, after losing her opening match against [[Paula Ormaechea]], Great Britain captain [[Judy Murray]] decided that [[Elena Baltacha]] would replace Konta in the Sunday reverse singles.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/10009139/Laura-Robsons-surprise-defeat-sees-Great-Britain-lose-to-Argentina-and-end-Fed-Cup-World-Group-hopes.html</ref>

Konta's next tournament was the [[2013 Portugal Open|Portugal Open]] in Oeiras, where she beat top-100 player [[Yulia Putintseva]] in the first qualifying round but was then forced to retire in the second qualifying round against [[Stéphanie Foretz Gacon]]. Konta also reached the second qualifying round at the [[2013 French Open|French Open]], losing to [[Galina Voskoboeva]] in three sets.

In June, Konta entered the [[2013 Aegon Trophy|Aegon Trophy]], a $75k tournament, reaching the semifinals after victories over [[An-Sophie Mestach]], fifth seed [[Misaki Doi]] and [[Alison Riske]]. In the semifinals, Konta lost a tough battle against third seed [[Karolína Plíšková]], going down in three sets. Following the event, she was handed a wild card for the Aegon Classic in Birmingham. In the first round Konta defeated qualifier [[Kurumi Nara]] to set up a meeting with French player [[Kristina Mladenovic]], the 12th seed at the tournament, who beat her in straight sets.

Konta also received a wild card for the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], where she was drawn against 16th seed [[Jelena Janković]] in the first round. She lost in straight sets against the Serbian former world number one.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-2013-johanna-konta-joins-firstround-exodus-of-british-players-8671715.html|title=Wimbledon 2013: Johanna Konta joins first-round exodus of British players|work=[[The Independent]]|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=28 June 2013|location=London|first=Eleanor|last=Crooks}}</ref>

Following Wimbledon, Konta started her build-up to the US Open by winning a $25k event in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where she defeated fellow British player [[Samantha Murray (tennis)|Samantha Murray]] in the final. She then kept up her form by winning the [[2013 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open|Odlum Brown Vancouver Open]], a $100k event, where she defeated [[Sharon Fichman]] in the final after eliminating top seed (and world No. 41) [[Hsieh Su-wei]] along the way. This propelled Konta to a then career-high ranking of 115.

At the [[2013 Guangzhou International Women's Open|Guangzhou International Open]], Konta won two rounds of qualifying to reach the main draw. In the first round, she beat fellow qualifier [[Richèl Hogenkamp]] in straight sets,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/24128577|title=Laura Robson and Johanna Konta progress in China|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=17 September 2013|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> before upsetting fourth seed and world No. 38 [[Peng Shuai]], equaling her best career-win in terms of ranking to this point.

Konta is known for creating sharp angles, being able to hit winners from any position on the court. According to WTA match stats in 2016, she was fourth in ace counts, won 62% of her service points, 74.8% of service games and won most of the second serve points at 52.7%.<ref>{{cite web|title=WTA Stats|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/stats|website=WTA|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>  She prefers to attack from the baseline, rather than to come to the net to volley. Konta has been criticized by former pro players for a lack of mental toughness and a lack of variety or a "plan B" in tough match situations,<ref>{{Citation|last=Jay Thakkar|title=Konta lacks variety Virginia Wade Analysis of Johanna Konta Wimbledon 2017|date=14 July 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4js5glJ8LlY|access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/44727875|title=Johanna Konta: What has gone wrong for the British number one?|date=5 July 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=9 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> but after hiring Dimitri Zavialoff as her coach, she has utilised more drop shots and has played more at the net.
