'''Miranda Priestly''' (born '''Miriam Princhek'''; October 25, 1949) is a character in [[Lauren Weisberger]]'s 2003 [[novel]] ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', portrayed by [[Meryl Streep]] in [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|the 2006 film adaptation of the novel]].

She is a powerful [[New York City]]-based [[Fashion journalism|editor-in-chief]] of the fictional [[fashion]] [[magazine]] ''Runway''. She is known as much for her icy demeanor and diva attitude as for her outstanding power within the fashion world.

== Fictional biography ==
Miranda Priestly was born Miriam Princhek on October 25 1949, in the [[East End of London]]. Her family members were poor but devout [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jews]]. The family relied on the community for support, because her father worked odd jobs occasionally and her mother died in childbirth. Miriam's grandmother moved in with the family to assist in raising the children. Miriam saved the small bills that her siblings would give her and worked as an assistant to a British designer. She made a name for herself in London's fashion world and studied [[French language|French]] at night and was made junior editor of the ''Chic'' magazine in [[Paris]]. When she was twenty-four Miriam changed her name to Miranda Priestly and replaced her rough accent with a sophisticated one. Miranda spent ten years at French ''Runway'' before Elias-Clark transferred her to American ''Runway''. She, her twin daughters, and her husband moved to a penthouse apartment on [[Fifth Avenue]] and 76th Street. She is the editor-in-chief of ''Runway'', a very chic and influential fashion magazine published by the Elias-Clark company. She is known for wearing a white [[Hermès]] scarf in her everyday outfit and treating her subordinates in a manner that borders on [[emotional abuse|emotional]] and [[psychological abuse]].

While she reminds employees "a million girls would kill for this job", Priestly's cruel treatment of staff causes a high turnover rate among [[personal assistant]]s; the focus of her characterization in the book and the film being her newest assistant, recent journalism graduate Andrea Sachs.

Priestly has twin daughters (from her second of three husbands), Caroline and Cassidy, who one review suggested "look like extras from ''[[The Omen]]''."<ref name="ThedevilinMsStreep">Peter Howell, "The devil in Ms. Streep", ''Toronto Star'', Toronto ON: Torstar, 30 June 2006. Page C3, 6 columns.</ref>

In the film version, her past is not mentioned at all.

==Characterization==
Miranda Priestly's personality comes in ranking as an [[ENTJ]] according to the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/devil-wears-prada-characters-mbti/|title=MBTI Of The Devil Wears Prada Characters|date=June 11, 2019|website=ScreenRant}}</ref><ref>https://bookriot.com/2018/09/28/which-literary-heroine-shares-your-personality-type/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/150420/movie-personality-types-mbti|title=What Movie To Watch, Based On Your Myers Briggs|first=Elena|last=Nicolaou|website=www.refinery29.com}}</ref> Her personage has been reviewed as 'Bossy' and 'Diva', referring her as an arrogant, [[megalomaniac]] and [[egomaniac]] person.

==Comparisons of the character==

===Novel===
Weisberger denies that Miranda Priestly is modeled on ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor-in-chief [[Anna Wintour]], saying in the publicity material for the book<ref name="Weisberger">Weisberger, Lauren; [http://www.randomhouse.com/features/devilwearsprada/qanda.html Q and A]; randomhouse.com; retrieved September 3, 2006.</ref> that her antics and demands are partially fictional and partially a composite of actual experiences she and her friends had in their first jobs, however in [[Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns|the sequel]] the writer describes Miranda at a basketball game with [[Rafael Nadal]] (a reference to Wintour’s friendship with [[Roger Federer]]) and mentions that she’s now the editorial director of the whole of Runway’s parent company (a reference to Wintour's role of [[Condé Nast]] artistic director).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/lauren-weisbergers-revenge-wears-prada-the-devil-returns/2013/06/03/1d48e35e-c7a7-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html|title=Lauren Weisberger’s ‘Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns’|date=June 3, 2013 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

===Film===
In the film she is a more sympathetic character than portrayed in the book. Whilst she remains just as ruthless and manipulative as she was in the book she is seen in a few moments of vulnerability three quarters of the way into the film in she confides to Andrea her distress about her failing marriage and the effect she is worried it will have on her daughters. The film incarnation of Priestly also speaks with an [[American accent]], which strongly suggests the film character is not a [[United Kingdom|Briton]] as portrayed in the novel.

Most, if not all reviews and articles of the movie made reference to Wintour. Nicknamed "Nuclear Wintour", Anna has been known to possess most of the same traits as Priestly, although she has shown more redeeming traits. Streep has told multiple reporters that she did not personally base her portrayal on Wintour, but instead on men she has known; Streep actually didn't meet Wintour until a pre-release [[Film screening|screening]] of the movie. Other inspirations for Streep's portrayal include [[Cruella de Vil]], [[Martha Stewart]] and the ghost of [[Joan Crawford]] from ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]''.<ref name="ThedevilinMsStreep"/><ref name="EW Reviews">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2006/06/30/reviewing_the_r_6/ |title=Reviewing the Reviews: 'The Devil Wears Prada' |last=Slezak |first=Michael |date=June 30, 2006 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref>

As for Miranda's appearance, Streep thought of the famous 85-year-old model [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]], known for her trademark white bouffant. "I wanted a cross between her and the unassailable elegance and authority of [[Christine Lagarde]]", Streep later says in a coverage for [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]].<ref name="The Devil Wears Prada’ Turns 10"/>

Meryl often said her performance was inspired by men, but kept their identities a closely guarded secret until now. "The voice I got from [[Clint Eastwood]]," Streep says. “He never, ever, ever raises his voice and everyone has to lean in to listen, and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room." But he is not funny. That I stole from [[Mike Nichols]]. The walk, I’m afraid, is mine".<ref name="The Devil Wears Prada’ Turns 10"/>

==Critical reception==
Streep's performance was praised for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than she had been in the novel. "With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Ms. Streep's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe," wrote [[A. O. Scott]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. "No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace."<ref name="NYTreview">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/30/movies/30devi.html |title=In 'The Devil Wears Prada,' Meryl Streep Plays the Terror of the Fashion World |last=Scott |first=A. O. |date=June 30, 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>
[[Kyle Smith (critic)|Kyle Smith]] agreed at the ''[[New York Post]]'': "The snaky Streep wisely chooses not to imitate ''Vogue'' editrix Anna Wintour, the inspiration for the book, but creates her own surprisingly believable character."<ref name="Postreview">{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2006/06/29/wintour-wonderland-it-may-not-be-in-vogue-but-its-in-fashion-for-fashion-a-model-movie/ |title=Wintour Wonderland – It May Not Be in Vogue, but It's in Fashion; For Fashion, a Model Movie |last=Smith |first=Kyle |date=June 29, 2006 |website=[[New York Post]] |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

[[Liz Jones]], former editor of British ''[[Marie Claire]]'', wrote that the movie was "a chilling reminder of the most surreal three years of my life." The only detail she found inaccurate was the absence of flowers in Miranda's Paris hotel room—during her tenure as editor, her rooms there or in [[Milan]] received so many flowers from designers that she thought she "had died prematurely." She personally vouched for Miranda's personality: "It took only a few weeks in the job for me to mutate into that strangely exotic and spoilt creature: the magazine maven, whose every whim, like those of Miranda ... must be pandered to."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hwang|first=Priscilla|title=The Devil Is In The Details: How ''The Devil Wears Prada'' Brands the Fashion Journalist|url=https://www.ijpc.org/uploads/files/IJPC%20Student%20Journal%20-%20Priscilla%20Hwang.pdf|website=The Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture|publisher=[[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]]|page=18|date=August 2011|accessdate=September 24, 2020}}</ref>

Janet Brennan Croft of the [[University of Oklahoma]] reads the movie as a modern retelling of the [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche myth]], with Miranda in the role of [[Aphrodite]], in which the character matures under the tutelage of an older female who at first seems purely to be tormenting her. "This authoritative female figure may even appear to be an enemy, at least at times, but actually mentors and guides [Psyche]'s growth into full participation in society." She compares the seemingly pointless tasks Miranda assigns Andy with those Aphrodite requests of Psyche: "By working through the conflict, the daughter/mentee also reaches a healthy balance of independence from and respect or love for the mother/mentor."<ref name="Psyche myth paper">{{cite journal |last1=Croft |first1=Janet Beecher |title=Psyche in New York: ''The Devil Wears Prada'' Updates the Myth |journal=[[Mythlore]] |date=2012 |volume=30 |issue=3/4 |pages=55–69 |url=https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/7985/Croft_Psyche_in_New_York.pdf?sequence=2 |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>

==Impact and legacy==
In May 2007, the popular American soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'' introduced a new character [[Kate Howard]] (originated by [[Megan Ward]]) patterned after the character of Miranda Priestly. Kate is much like Miranda, the only noticeable difference being age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/generalhospital/update/1978/3|title=The Devil (from Benson Hurst!) Wears Prada. - General Hospital Daily Updates - Soaps.com<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> Later that year, the "[[Money (The Office)|Money]]" episode from [[The Office (American season 4)|fourth season]] of the US version of ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]'' began with [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), who had just been watching the film, yelling "Steak!" and "Get me Armani!" to the Dunder-Mifflin receptionist, Pam.
In February 2018, on American [[reality television]] series [[Keeping Up With the Kardashians]] (Episode 18 Season 14), [[Kris Jenner]] dressed as Miranda, channeling her 'Boss Lady' persona.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-season-14-episode-18-recap.html|title=The Kardashian Sisters Take a Break From Fertility Concerns by Playing Dress-Up|date=February 26, 2018 |work=[[New York (magazine)|Thecut.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nqIuUFCA28&list=PLX_Icid-tSv9EADw-3QGA_1-ZklKvwkC4&index=4|title=Too Many Miranda Priestlys!KUWTK}}</ref>

On the film's 10th anniversary, Alyssa Rosenberg wrote for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Miranda anticipated female [[antihero]]ines of popular television series of the later 2000s and 2010s such as ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Olivia Pope]] and [[Cersei Lannister]] in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Like them, she observes, Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters, despite her moral failings, that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it, to "prov[e], as a creature of sentiment, that she never belonged there in the first place." In doing so, however successfully to herself and others, "she has zipped herself into a life as regimented and limited as a skintight [[pencil skirt]]."<ref name="Washington Post antiheroines">{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|title=How 'The Devil Wears Prada' foreshadowed an age of antiheroines|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/06/30/how-the-devil-wears-prada-foreshadowed-an-age-of-antiheroines/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> ''Variety''<nowiki>'</nowiki> observed that "[the characterization] showed Hollywood that it was never wise to underestimate a strong woman's worth."<ref name="The Devil Wears Prada’ Turns 10">{{cite news|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Turns 10: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt Tell All|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/features/the-devil-wears-prada-turns-10-meryl-streep-anne-hathaway-and-emily-blunt-tell-all-1201802311/#respond|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 23, 2016}}</ref>

In 2020, ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Monica Torres wrote about how much more she appreciated Miranda upon watching the film for the first time since her teens. Then, she had identified strongly with Andrea and hated Miranda. "But after rewatching as a working adult, I'm struck to find I have a much more complex understanding of [her], and of how many missteps her ''Runway'' staff take in their careers." Despite Andrea's dramatic break with her, Torres notes, Miranda still gives her a favorable job recommendation at the end. "That's better than most people would do for an employee who burnt a bridge!"<ref>{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Monica|title=In 'The Devil Wears Prada,' It's Clear Andy Sucks, Too|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/devil-wears-prada-career-lessons_l_5e1c9247c5b6640ec3d85d41|date=January 15, 2020|accessdate=January 15, 2020}}</ref>
