==Early life and education==
Hurd was born in New York City, the son of Teresa A. (Fanoni), a debutante, and Ralph Steiner Hurd, a financier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://traditioncare.com/tribute/details/798/Teresa-Hurd/obituary.html|title=Obituary of Teresa F.

He received a Tennis Scholarship to attend Baylor University and was a member of [[Phi Delta Theta]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/HP-taps-operational-genius-to-lead-the-way-2719382.php |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Benjamin|last=Pimentel|title=Mark Hurd has earned a name at Hewlett-Packard|date=March 30, 2005}}</ref>

==Career==
===NCR (1980–2005)===
Hurd spent 25 years at [[NCR Corporation]], culminating in a two-year tenure as chief executive officer and president. He was named president of NCR in 2001 and was given additional responsibilities as [[chief operating officer]] in 2002. He began working for NCR as a junior salesman in San Antonio in 1980, and subsequently held a variety of positions in general management, operations, and sales and marketing. He also served as head of the company's [[Teradata]] data-warehousing division for three years.<ref name="fortune"/>

===Hewlett-Packard (2005–2010)===
[[File:Mark Hurd Stock Chart.png|thumb|right|400px|This chart shows the share price of NCR, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle during Mark Hurd's tenure.]] After the board forced chairman and CEO [[Carly Fiorina]] to resign in January 2005 over policy differences following the [[Compaq]] merger, executive vice president and CFO [[Robert Wayman|Robert P. Wayman]] became interim CEO for several months. Hurd was appointed permanent CEO and also held the title of President, a post which was not used by several of his predecessors ([[Michael Capellas]] was President of HP for a transitional period in 2002 after its merger with [[Compaq]]).

Hurd was also elected to the board of directors but unlike previous CEOs, he was initially not designated to be chairman of the board which was instead filled by a non-executive director. On September 22, 2006, Hurd succeeded [[Patricia C. Dunn|Pat Dunn]] as board chairman after she resigned due to the [[2006 HP Spying Scandal|pretexting controversy]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Grace|title=HP's Dunn resigns from board|url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/09/22/technology/hurd_conference/|publisher=CNN|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}</ref>

Under his leadership, the company became the leader of the sale of [[laptop]] computers in 2006, and the leader in the sale of [[desktop computer]]s in 2007. In 2008, it increased its market share in [[inkjet printer]]s and [[laser printer]]s to 46% and 50.5%, respectively.<ref name="fortune">{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/news/companies/lashinsky_hurd.fortune/index.htm|title=Mark Hurd's moment|work=Fortune|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|date=March 3, 2009|accessdate=July 15, 2009}}</ref> In March 2009, Hurd forecast that HP's sales could drop as much as 5% that year, in the midst of the recession, but that its profit would increase by nearly 6%.<ref name="fortune" /> Under Hurd's tenure, the company met Wall Street expectations in 21 out of 22 quarters and increased profits for 22 straight quarters, while its revenue rose 63% and stock price doubled.<ref name=":0" />

While the merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq was heavily criticized back in 2002, Hurd managed to make the combined company execute successfully, something his predecessor Fiorina had failed to do.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Ben|author-link1=Benjamin M.

Hurd was said to have run HP "with a founder's authority. He was the de facto CEO, CFO, COO and head salesman".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Ricadela|first1=Aaron|last2=Vance|first2=Ashlee|title=Can Meg Whitman Reverse Hewlett-Packard's Free Fall?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-10/can-meg-whitman-reverse-hewlett-packards-free-fall|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}</ref> Hurd had a reputation for aggressive cost-cutting. He laid off 15,200 workers &nbsp;&mdash; 10% of the workforce&nbsp;&mdash; shortly after becoming CEO. Other cost-cutting includes reducing the IT department from 19,000 to 8,000, reducing the number of software applications that HP used from 6,000 to 1,500, and consolidating HP's 85 data centers to 6.<ref name="fortune"/> During the 2009 recession, Hurd imposed a temporary 5% pay cut on all employees and removed many benefits. He himself took a base salary pay cut of 20%, although the compensation committee increased his bonus by the same amount. Hurd's emphasis on short-term results and financial management, particularly cutting costs, taking the lead in the PC business, plus acquisitions (EDS and 3Com), were successful in raising profits and shareholder return. Detractors, however, viewed it as a continuation of [[empire building]], which started with the acquisition of [[Compaq]] in 2002 several years before Hurd joined HP.

In 2007. while serving as chairman and CEO at Hewlett-Packard, Hurd was named one of [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine's]] 25 most powerful people in business.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hurd|first1=Mark|title=25 most powerful people in business|url=http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0711/gallery.power_25.fortune/16.html|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref> In 2008, [[The San Francisco Chronicle]] named Hurd as CEO of the year.<ref name="SFGATE">{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Ryan|date=April 20, 2008|title=Mark Hurd has earned a name at Hewlett-Packard|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Mark-Hurd-has-earned-a-name-at-Hewlett-Packard-3287281.php|accessdate=March 7, 2017|publisher=SFGATE}}</ref> In 2009, Hurd was listed as one of Forbes' top gun CEOs.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Pictures: The Top Gun CEOs|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/22/top-gun-ceos-intelligent-investing-survey_slide_10.html|work=Forbes|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>

In 2008, Hurd's total compensation was $39,952,237, including a base salary of $1,450,000, stock award of $7,907,660, cash bonus of $23,931,882, and $662,695 in perquisites and other compensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/mark_v_hurd/index.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Times Topics: Mark V.

===Oracle Corporation (2010–2019)===
On September 6, 2010, Hurd was named president of Oracle Corporation alongside [[Safra A.

Hurd revamped the company's salesforce in 2013, a process that had initially started two years prior. Hurd changed the compensation for Oracle's sales representatives in order to sell more hardware, hired additional sales representatives, and reduced the number of accounts covered by each salesperson. In April 2013, he reported that the sales force had increased by 4,000.<ref name="Sales Force Change">{{cite web|last1=Bort|first1=Julie|date=September 17, 2013|title=The Moment of Truth: It's Crunch Time For Oracle And Mark Hurd|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-sales-force-changes-2013-9|accessdate=March 10, 2017|publisher=Business Insider}}</ref> His plans to revamp initially faced flak from veteran sales representatives, some of whom left Oracle to work for competitors.<ref name="Sales Force Change" />

In 2013, Hurd launched the “Class Of” program to hire thousands of college graduates and groom those graduates to become sales representatives, helping to sell Oracle's cloud. His idea was inspired by a dinner he had with his daughter and her friends who recently graduated from college. As a result of the program's success and plans for expansion, the company built a new campus in Austin, Texas, to house employees that were part of Hurd's "Class Of" program.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bort|first1=Julie|date=October 2, 2016|title=How Oracle turned a program that salespeople hated into one of its secret weapons|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-class-of-program-college-recruiting-mark-hurd-2016-9|accessdate=March 10, 2017|publisher=Business Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Galligan|first1=Jude|date=May 19, 2016|title=Oracle moving fast to start construction in Austin|url=http://austin.towers.net/oracle-moving-fast-to-start-construction-in-austin/|accessdate=March 10, 2017|publisher=Towers}}</ref> Hurd reported in 2015 that Oracle recruits 1,300 students each year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Greg|title=Oracle CEO Mark Hurd: 'It's hard to get people to come to Boston' |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2015/04/23/oracle-ceo-mark-hurd-it-s-hard-to-get-people-to.html | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=April 23, 2015}}</ref>
