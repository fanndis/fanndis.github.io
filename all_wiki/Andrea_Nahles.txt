'''Andrea Maria Nahles''' (born 20 June 1970) is a [[Germany|German]] politician who served as Leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from April 2018 until June 2019 and the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag from September 2017 until June 2019. She served as a [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs]] from 2013 to 2017 and [[Young Socialists in the SPD|SPD Youth]] leader. Since 2020, Nahles has been serving as president of the Federal Posts and Telecommunications Agency.<ref>Martin Greive (June 26, 2020), [https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/spd-nahles-zur-neuen-praesidentin-der-bundesanstalt-fuer-post-und-telekommunikation-gewaehlt/25952808.html Nahles zur neuen Präsidentin der Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation gewählt] ''[[Handelsblatt]]''.</ref>

Nahles is known within the party for criticising [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s [[Agenda 2010]]. In June 2019, in the aftermath of the SPD's result in the 2019 European elections,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahlen/2019/ergebnisse.html|title=Ergebnisse - Der Bundeswahlleiter|website=www.bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=2019-06-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801110635/https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/europawahlen/2019/ergebnisse.html|archive-date=2019-08-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> she announced her resignation as leader of the SPD and as parliamentary leader of the SPD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/2019-06/nahles-kuendigt-ruecktritt-als-partei-und-fraktionschefin-an|title=SPD: Andrea Nahles tritt zurück|website=ZEIT ONLINE|language=de|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> For the transition period until a new SPD-leader is voted in, Manuela Schwesig, Malu Dreyer and Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel acted as her successors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/spd-schaefer-guembel-schwesig-dreyer-sollen-partei-kommissarisch-fuehren-a-1270518.html|title=Schwesig, Dreyer, Schäfer-Gümbel: Trio soll SPD kommissarisch führen|date=3 June 2019|via=[[Spiegel Online]]}}</ref>
Nahles left the Bundestag on 31 October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bundestag.de/abgeordnete/ausgeschiedene-abgeordnete-532298 |title=Deutscher Bundestag - Ausgeschiedene Abgeordnete der 19. Wahlperiode |website=Deutscher Bundestag |language=de |access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Born in 1970 in [[Mendig]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], to a bricklayer and an office clerk, Nahles grew up in the rural Eifel region in West Germany.<ref name="auto">Tobias Buck (February 28, 2018), [https://www.ft.com/content/cdc30708-1b9b-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6 New SPD leader courts German voters with pleas and provocation] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref><ref>Janosch Delcker	(27 September 2017), [http://www.politico.eu/article/andrea-nahles-german-social-democrats-brace-for-left-wing-makeover/ German Social Democrats brace for left-wing makeover] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>  She finished high school ([[Abitur]]) through a continuing education program in 1989. She obtained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] after studying [[politics]], [[philosophy]] and [[German studies]] at the [[University of Bonn]] for 20 semesters (10 years), during which time she was an assistant to a member of parliament.

In 2004, Nahles began working towards a doctorate in [[Germanistics]]. She abandoned her dissertation in 2005 when she returned to the [[Bundestag]]. The title of her planned dissertation was ''[[Walter Scott]]'s influence on the development of the historical novel in Germany''.

==Political career==

===Party career===
In 1988, Nahles joined the SPD at the age of 18. Shortly after, she was the youth representative for the constituency of Mayen-Koblenz. From 1993 to 1995 she was the youth representative for Rheinland-Pfalz. In 1995 she became the national youth representative, following [[Thomas Westphal]], a post she held until 1999. Since 1997 she has been a member of the SPD executive.

In 2000, Nahles was one of the founders of the "[[Forum Demokratische Linke 21]]" (Forum of the Democratic Left 21). As leader of the SPD's left wing and former head of party's youth section, she opposed many of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s economic reforms, namely the [[Agenda 2010]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ecf97862-4b44-11da-aadc-0000779e2340.html Andrea Nahles, 35] ''[[Financial Times]]'', November 2, 2005.</ref> She and others repeatedly criticized the leadership style of the party's chairman [[Franz Müntefering]], saying the party was never consulted over Schröder's decision in May 2005 to call early elections or the decision to join a grand coalition under Merkel that would include the major parties.<ref>Judy Dempsey (November 1, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/01/world/europe/01iht-germany.html Merkel is dealt another setback] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

As party leaders sought to reconcile the bickering factions in the post-Schröder era, Nahles gained in leverage.<ref name="auto1">Patrick Donahue (December 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-15/merkel-s-third-term-cabinet-social-democratic-party-ministers.html Merkel’s Third-Term Cabinet: Social Democratic Party Ministers] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref> On 31 October 2005, she was voted the SPD's general secretary, defeating [[Kajo Wasserhövel]], the favoured man from the conservative side of the party. Wasserhövel's defeat prompted [[Franz Müntefering]] to declare that he no longer felt he had the confidence of the party and would step down. As a result, Nahles refused to accept the position of general secretary.

Between 2005 and 2009, Nahles served on the Committee on Labour and Social Affairs. From 2008, she was also a member of the SPD parliamentary group's leadership under chairman [[Peter Struck]].

Ahead of the [[2009 German federal election|2009 elections]], German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] included her in his [[shadow cabinet]] of 10 women and eight men for the Social Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent [[Angela Merkel]] as chancellor.<ref>Bertrand Benoit (July 30, 2009), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0e9d8278-7d3d-11de-b8ee-00144feabdc0.html Lagging SPD starts campaign] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> During the campaign, Nahles served as shadow minister for education and integration policies, being a counterweight to incumbent [[Annette Schavan]].<ref>Veit Medick and Markus Feldenkirchen (July 29, 2009), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-s-election-pre-game-social-democrats-to-announce-campaign-team-steinmeier-a-639055.html Germany's Election Pre-Game: Social Democrats to Announce Campaign 'Team Steinmeier'] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref>

===General Secretary of the SPD, 2009–2013===
Nahles was elected as the SPD's secretary general in November 2009 at the party congress held in [[Dresden]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Gabriel mit SPD-Parteitag hoch zufrieden  | url=http://www.vorwaerts.de/node/9086 | first=Lars | last=Haferkamp  | work= [[Vorwärts]] | date=2009-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=New SPD leaders flag fresh tax approach  | url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20091115-23281.html | work= [[The Local]] | date=2009-11-15}}</ref> She succeeded [[Hubertus Heil]] in the position, and worked together with new-elected party leader [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. Her appointment was widely seen as a signal the SPD would shift to the left.<ref>Dave Graham (October 5, 2009), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/10/05/uk-germany-coalition-talks-idUKTRE5943LZ20091005 German parties start coalition talks] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In her capacity as secretary general, Nahles oversaw the SPD's electoral campaign in 2013.<ref name="auto1"/> After the SPD's defeat in the [[2013 German federal election|federal elections]], she was in charge of organizing a referendum among her party's 472,000 members before signing any coalition treaty with re-elected Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and her conservative bloc. In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the elections, Nahles was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Merkel, Gabriel and [[Horst Seehofer]].

At a three-day party convention held in Leipzig in November 2013, delegates re-elected Nahles to her post with reduced majority. She received 67.2 percent of members’ ballots.<ref>Brian Parkin and Birgit Jennen (November 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/german-spd-chief-set-to-sell-party-on-merkel-coalition.html German SPD Chief Set to Sell Party on Merkel Coalition] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.</ref>

===Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, 2013–2017===
As Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s [[Third Merkel cabinet|third Cabinet]], Nahles has overseen the introduction of a national minimum wage for Germany, guaranteeing workers at least 8.50 euros per hour ($11.75).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/04/02/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-minimum-wage.html German Cabinet Approves National Minimum Wage] ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 2, 2014.</ref> Merkel had campaigned against a statutory minimum wage in 2013, saying it would threaten Germany's competitive edge and that wage-setting belonged in the hands of companies and employees; however, her party gave ground to the Social Democrats, who made the measure a condition for helping her stay in power for a third term.<ref>Patrick Donahue (July 3, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-03/germany-set-to-approve-minimum-wage-after-merkel-cedes-to-spd German Lawmakers Back Minimum Wage After Merkel Cedes to SPD] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> In early 2015, however, Nahles bowed to pressure from Germany's eastern neighbours, particularly [[Poland]], and suspended controls by state authorities to check whether foreign truck drivers were being paid the minimum wage.<ref>Jeevan Vasagar (January 30, 2015), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f677c876-a878-11e4-bd17-00144feab7de.html Germany suspends minimum wage for foreign truck drivers] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

After having campaigned on the promise of early retirement for longtime workers during the elections, Nahles also managed the introduction of an early retirement law in 2014. The move, which – at expected total costs of about 160 billion euros between 2015 and 2030<ref>Henrik Böhme (February 3, 2015), [http://www.dw.de/opinion-minimum-wage-law-is-overbureaucratized/a-18232504 Opinion: Minimum wage law is overbureaucratized] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref> – is likely to be the most expensive single measure of the legislative period,<ref>Erik Kirschbaum and Monica Raymunt (January 29, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/01/29/business/29reuters-germany-pensions.html Germany Loosens Own Pension Rules While Asking EU for Austerity] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> was sharply criticized as Germany grapples with an aging population and a shrinking work force and promotes austerity among its European Union neighbors.<ref>Melissa Eddy (June 30, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/business/international/in-reversal-germany-loosens-rules-on-retirement-age.html After Tightening Pensions, Germany Eases Rules for Some] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> In late 2014, Nahles also announced that the combined pension contributions from employers and employees would be cut by a total of 2 billion euros in 2015 due to the high level of reserves.<ref>Holger Hansen (November 6, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/06/us-germany-pensions-nahles-idUSKBN0IQ1YU20141106 Germany to cut pension contributions, free up 2 billion euros] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Following annual negotiations between the [[Claims Conference]] and the German government in 2014, Nahles successfully introduced a proposal for extending German pension payments totaling 340 million euros ($461 million) for some 40,000 [[Holocaust]] survivors who were used by the [[Nazis]] in ghettos as laborers in exchange for food or meager wages. Most Holocaust survivors suffered serious malnutrition during [[World War II]] and also lost almost all of their relatives, leaving them with many medical problems and little or no family support network to help them cope.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/05/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-jewish-claims.html German Parliament Extends Holocaust Pensions] ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2014.</ref>

Following a succession of strikes that disrupted Germany's air and train travel in 2014, Nahles introduced a bill which amended [[German labour law|labor laws]] to allow only one trade union to represent employees of one company in negotiating [[Collective bargaining|wage agreements]], a move critics say in effect will deprive small unions of their right to strike.<ref>Andrea Thomas (December 11, 2014), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-looks-to-curb-trades-union-power-1418300430 Germany Looks to Curb Trade-Union Power] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>
 
In 2015, Nahles commissioned an in-depth study to establish a definition of [[Occupational stress|work-related stress]] and calculate its economic cost, leading to speculation that the study could pave the way for an "anti-stress act" as proposed by Germany's [[IG Metall|metalworkers' union]].<ref>Philip Oltermann (September 18, 2014), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/germany-law-work-related-stress Germany ponders ground-breaking law to combat work-related stress] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>

In response to rightwing populist assaults on chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal immigration policies, Nahles presented plans in early 2016 to ban EU migrants from most unemployment benefits for five years after their arrival.<ref>Stefan Wagstyl (April 28, 2016), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25bec884-0d52-11e6-9cd4-2be898308be3.html Germany plans 5-year benefit ban for jobless migrants] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

===Leader of SPD in Bundestag, 2017–2019===
After the Social Democrats experienced their worst result in German post-war history in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 elections]], their chairman [[Martin Schulz]] nominated Nahles to lead the party's group in the German Parliament.<ref>Emma Anderson (September 25, 2017), [http://www.politico.eu/article/martin-schulz-picks-andrea-nahles-to-lead-spd-in-german-parliament-elections-2017/ Schulz picks Nahles to lead SPD in German parliament] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref> She replaced [[Thomas Oppermann]] and was the first woman to serve in this role.<ref>Janosch Delcker (27 September 2017), [http://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-social-democrats-elect-andrea-nahles-as-parliamentary-group-leader/ Germany’s SPD elects Nahles as parliamentary group leader] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref> In the negotiations to form a [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|fourth]] coalition government under Merkel, Nahles led the working group on social affairs, alongside [[Barbara Stamm]] and [[Karl-Josef Laumann]].

In addition to her role as chairwoman, Nahles also joined the Committee on the Election of Judges (''Wahlausschuss''), which is in charge of appointing judges to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].

===Leader of the Social Democratic Party, 2018–2019===
Nahles was elected as the first ever female leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] on 22 April 2018 at the party convention in Wiesbaden. She won the election with 414 delegate votes, against her opponent [[Simone Lange]], who received 172 delegate votes, which worked out as 66% to 27% respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nahles-spd-103.html|title=Parteitag: Nahles mit 66 Prozent zur SPD-Chefin gewählt|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref> She succeeds [[Olaf Scholz]] who was acting leader for two months after the resignation of [[Martin Schulz]] who led the party to their worst election result since 1933. Nahles was the first female leader of the party in its 155-year history. Furthermore, this was the first time ever in German history that the country's two largest parties were led by women, the other being [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] with its leader [[Angela Merkel]].

Nahles was widely credited with stewarding the party toward another coalition government with Merkel's Christian Democrats.<ref>Madeleine Schwartz (April 22, 2018), [https://www.politico.eu/article/andrea-nahles-spd-germany-last-hope/ Andrea Nahles: German SPD’s last hope] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

On 2 June 2019, Nahles announced that she would resign as SPD leader in the face of personal unpopularity, a major defeat for the SPD in the [[2019 European Parliament election in Germany|2019 European Parliament election]], and a record low result in the Forsa poll of 1 June 2019. She stated she would also resign as leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/germanys-spd-leader-andrea-nahles-081557066.html|title=German SPD leader Nahles quits as party's popularity hits low|date=2 June 2019|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref>

Since July 2020, Nahles has been serving as a special advisor to [[European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights]] [[Nicolas Schmit]].<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/service-standards-and-principles/transparency/special-advisers_en Non-institutional special advisers] [[European Commission]]. </ref><ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/andrea-nahles-wird-beraterin-von-eu-sozialkommissar-a-560c8c6c-aefd-4669-ae22-64efa6196ad4 Ex-SPD-Chefin: Andrea Nahles wird Beraterin von EU-Sozialkommissar] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', July 10, 2020.</ref>
