'''''Charlie's Angels''''' is a 2000 American [[action comedy film]] directed by [[McG]], and written by Ryan Rowe, [[Ed Solomon]], and [[John August]]. It is the first installment in the [[Charlie's Angels (franchise)|''Charlie's Angels'' film series]], a continuation of the [[Charlie's Angels|television series of the same name]] created by [[Ivan Goff]] and [[Ben Roberts (writer)|Ben Roberts]], which is also a continuation of the series story. Unlike the original series, which had dramatic elements, the film features more comical elements.

It stars [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Drew Barrymore]], and [[Lucy Liu]] as three women working in a private detective agency in [[Los Angeles]]. [[John Forsythe]] reprised his role as the unseen Charlie's voice from the original series. [[Bill Murray]] also stars as [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|John Bosley]], replacing [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] who played the role in the original series. It also stars [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Tim Curry]] and [[Kelly Lynch]] while [[Crispin Glover]], [[Matt LeBlanc]], [[Luke Wilson]] and [[Tom Green]] appear in supporting roles.

It was released on November 3, 2000, in the United States by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] under its [[Columbia Pictures]] label, and has grossed $264 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Diaz, Barrymore, Liu and Murray as well as its action sequences and humor, but criticisms aimed at the plot and "lack of originality".<ref name="metacritic" />

==Plot==
Natalie Cook ([[Cameron Diaz]]), Dylan Sanders ([[Drew Barrymore]]), and Alex Munday ([[Lucy Liu]]) are the "Angels", three talented, tough, attractive women who work as [[private investigator]]s together for an unseen millionaire named Charlie (voiced by [[John Forsythe]]). Charlie uses speakers in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|Bosley]] ([[Bill Murray]]) works with them directly when needed.

Charlie assigns the Angels to find Eric Knox ([[Sam Rockwell]]), a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin ([[Tim Curry]]), who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar. The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot a suspicious-looking man that they had previously seen from surveillance videos of Knox's kidnapping. Dubbing him the "Thin Man" ([[Crispin Glover]]), the Angels chase him down and fight him; he gets away, but the Angels find Knox, safely held nearby.

After the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood ([[Kelly Lynch]]), Charlie explains that they must determine whether the Thin Man has stolen Knox's voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer. Dylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, and they end up having sex. Afterwards, Knox betrays her; simultaneously, attacks are made on Natalie and Alex, Bosley is captured by Vivian, and Corwin is murdered by the Thin Man. Knox tells Dylan his kidnapping was all faked to get the Angels to help him access the Redstar satellite network. He plans to use it along with his voice recognition software to find and kill Charlie, who Knox asserts killed his father in the [[Vietnam War]].

Dylan escapes and reunites with Natalie and Alex, who survived their attacks. They approach Charlie's office just as the building explodes. They find a radio transmitter that Bosley is able to communicate through via a tooth implanted radio transmitter. Bosley provides enough information of where he's captured to allow Natalie to deduce its location, an abandoned lighthouse. With help from Dylan's boyfriend Chad ([[Tom Green]]), the Angels stealthily approach it. Upon finding Knox, Dylan is captured by his henchmen, tied up and gagged. The Angels are too late to stop Knox from determining Charlie's location, though they rescue Bosley while Dylan fights off her captors. They come together to defeat Vivian, the Thin Man, and other assorted henchmen, but Knox blows up the lighthouse and flies off in an attack helicopter towards Charlie's house. Bosley helps the Angels board it, where Alex reprograms the missile to have it shoot backwards; blowing up the helicopter and killing Knox while the Angels land safely.

Seeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, they enter the nearby beach house that Knox had targeted, but Charlie has already left. He remotely congratulates the Angels on a job well done through another speaker, and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. Charlie also tells them that Knox's father was undercover; he was discovered and killed, but not by Charlie. When he speaks to the Angels by telephone on the beach, they ask if they could ever meet him in person. Dylan suspects she sees him nearby talking into a cell phone, but doesn't tell the group; opting to raise a toast to Charlie instead. Bosley playfully douses the Angels with his drink, and they chase him towards the ocean. From afar, a silhouetted Charlie watches them and walks off.

David Edelstein for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']], wrote, despite expecting to hate the film, he found he loved it, calling it "A charming, hyper-energetic, and wittily self-aware action comedy about gorgeous girls".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=92656|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020126190506/http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=92656|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 26, 2002|title=Angel Cake – Charlie's Angels delivers Hong Kong action thrills without serving the bogus spirituality.

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "a movie without a brain. ''Charlie's Angels'' is like the trailer for a video game movie, lacking only the video game, and the movie" and gave it half a star out of a possible 4 stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/charlies-angels-2000|title=Charlie's Angels Movie Review (2000) – Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=April 1, 2019}}</ref> [[Manohla Dargis]] wrote "Of course, it's terrible – but did it have to be this bad?"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/film/head-trips-2132652|title=Head Trips|first=Manohla|last=Dargis|date=November 1, 2000|website=L.A.

Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it "An utter debacle" and said the film "makes the show look like the height of creativity, imagination and restraint". LaSalle blames director McG comparing the film to a trailer or music video. He was also critical of the deliberate decision to make the three women very similar, and says "The Angels' goofiness is a big disappointment, second only to the shocking ineptitude of McG."

<!-- Other repsonses -->
During the making of ''[[Blade II]]'', [[Guillermo del Toro]] commented that while films like ''Charlie's Angels'' had helped to popularize the [[wire fu]] style of fighting choreography in Western films, they also served as a "nail in the coffin" and prompted many filmmakers to want to get back to more "hard-hitting" action.<ref name="Commentary">"Production Workshop" documentary. ''Blade II'' DVD. Roadshow Entertainment, 2002.</ref> "The moment you see Cameron Diaz flying in the air, and you ''know'' that she is incapable of flying in the air and kicking five guys... you realize that it is done using wires. [...] I mean, ''Charlie's Angels'' was great, but it[s fighting style] was almost satirical," he said.<ref name="Commentary"/>
