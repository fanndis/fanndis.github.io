'''''Michael Jackson's Thriller''''' is a 1983 music video made for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", directed by [[John Landis]] and written by Landis and Jackson. It references numerous horror films, and stars Jackson performing a dance routine with a horde of the [[undead]]. [[Ola Ray]] co-stars as Jackson's girlfriend. The music video was released on December 2, 1983, just two days after the first anniversary of his sixth album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (1982).

Jackson contacted Landis after seeing his film ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981)''.'' The pair conceived a short film with a budget much larger than previous music videos. It was filmed at the [[Broadway Theater District (Los Angeles)#Surviving theaters on Broadway|Palace Theatre]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], the junction of Union Pacific Avenue and South Calzona Street in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and the [[Angeleno Heights]] neighborhood at 1345 [[Carroll Avenue]]. It was accompanied by a making-of documentary, ''Making Michael Jackson's Thriller,'' produced to sell to television networks.

''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' was launched to great anticipation and played regularly on [[MTV]]. It doubled the sales of the album, helping it become the [[List of best-selling albums|bestselling album in history]], and sold over a million copies on [[VHS]], becoming the bestselling videotape at the time. It is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment, and popularizing the making-of documentary. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global [[pop culture]].<ref name="Griffin" />

Many elements of ''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' have had a lasting impact on popular culture, such as the zombie dance and Jackson's [[Thriller jacket|red jacket]], designed by Landis's wife [[Deborah Nadoolman Landis|Deborah Nadoolman]]. Fans worldwide re-enact its zombie dance and it remains popular on [[YouTube]]. The [[Library of Congress]] described it as "the most famous music video of all time", and it has been named the greatest video of all time by various publications and readers' polls. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] as "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant.

== Plot ==
In the 1950s, Michael Jackson and a young woman ([[Ola Ray]]) run out of gas while driving in a wooded area. They walk into the forest and Michael asks her to be his girlfriend. She accepts. He warns her that he is "not like other guys", transforms into a [[werecat]], and attacks her.

This scene turns out to be part of a film being watched in a movie theatre by Michael and his girlfriend. She leaves, scared by the film. In the street, Michael teases her by performing the verses of  "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]". They pass a graveyard, wherein the [[undead]] rise from their graves. The couple are surrounded and Michael becomes a [[zombie]]. He and the zombies dance to the song.

Michael and the zombies chase his girlfriend into an abandoned house. She screams and wakes up, realizing it was a nightmare. Michael embraces her, but turns to the camera and grins, revealing his werecat eyes.

==Financing==
Michael Jackson's album ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' was released in 1982 and spent more than a year at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Griffin" /> It was backed by successful music videos for the singles "[[Billie Jean]]" and "[[Beat It]]", which are credited for demonstrating the promotional power of videos and raising creative standards.<ref name="Griffin" />

In June 1983, ''Thriller'' was displaced from the top slot on the Billboard 200 chart by the [[Flashdance (soundtrack)|''Flashdance'' soundtrack]]. It briefly regained the position in July, before being removed again by ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' by the [[The Police|Police]]. Jackson urged record executives [[Walter Yetnikoff]] and Larry Stessel to help conceive a plan to return the album to the top of the charts. Jackson's manager [[Frank DiLeo]] suggested making a third music video, for the title track, "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]". He recalled telling Jackson: "It’s simple—all you’ve got to do is dance, sing, and make it scary."<ref name="Griffin">{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Nancy|date=January 24, 2010|title=The "Thriller" Diaries|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/07/michael-jackson-thriller-201007|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref> Jackson's tastes, according to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', "generally ran to benign Disney-esque fantasies where people were nice and children were safe", and he ensured the video would be "creepy-comical, not genuinely terrifying".<ref name="Griffin" /> 

In early August, after seeing his horror film ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981), Jackson contacted director [[John Landis]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/31/john-landis-on-the-making-of-michael-jacksons-thriller-i-was-adamant-he-couldnt-look-too-hideous|title=John Landis on the making of Michael Jackson's Thriller: 'I was adamant he couldn't look too hideous'|last1=L|first1=John|last2=is|date=August 31, 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=October 27, 2018}}</ref> At the time, commercial directors did not direct music videos, but Landis was intrigued. He and Jackson conceived a short film shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] with the production values of a feature film, with a budget of $900,000, much larger than any previous music video. According to Landis, when he called Yetnikoff to propose the film, Yetnikoff swore so loudly he had to remove the phone from his ear.<ref name="Griffin" /> Jackson's record company, [[Epic Records|Epic]], had little interest in making another video for ''Thriller'', believing that the album had peaked.<ref name=":0" /> Yetnikoff eventually agreed that the company would contribute only $100,000.<ref name="Griffin" />

Initially, the television networks refused to finance the project, sharing the view that ''Thriller'' was "last year's news".<ref name=":0" /> [[MTV]], which had found success with Jackson's videos for "[[Billie Jean]]" and "[[Beat It]]", had a policy of not financing music videos itself, instead expecting record companies to pay for them. However, after [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], then a new channel, agreed to pay half the budget, MTV agreed to pay the rest, justifying the expenditure as financing for a motion picture and not a music video.<ref name=":0" />

To help finance the production, Landis's producer [[George Folsey Jr.]] suggesting a making-of documentary that, combined with the "Thriller" video, would produce an hour-long film that could be sold to television.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|last=Hebblethwaite|first=Phil|date=November 21, 2013|title=How Michael Jackson's Thriller changed music videos for ever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/21/michael-jackson-thriller-changed-music-videos|access-date=October 29, 2018|website=The Guardian}}</ref> The documentary, ''Making Michael Jackson's Thriller,'' was directed by Jerry Kramer.<ref name=":0" /> It includes home video footage of a young Jackson dancing and footage of his performances from ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]''.<ref name=":0" />

MTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights.<ref name="Griffin" /> Jackson covered additional costs, for which he would be reimbursed.<ref name="Griffin" /> [[Vestron Video|Vestron Music Video]] offered to distribute ''Making Michael Jackson’s Thriller'' on VHS and Betamax; this was a pioneering concept, as most videos at the time were sold to rental stores rather than directly to viewers.

== Production ==
Jackson wanted to make a video in which he transformed into a four-legged beast, similarly to the transformation scene in ''An American Werewolf in London''. This idea was replaced with a two-legged monster, as this made it easier for him to dance.<ref name=":0" /> Landis felt Jackson should become scary and creepy, but not ugly. Landis suggested that Jackson should become a [[werewolf]] in a 1950s setting, inspired by the 1957 film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Makeup artist Rick Baker decided to turn Jackson into a werecat, "because I just didn’t want to do another werewolf."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=2018-10-31|title=Michael Jackson's "Thriller" is the eternal Halloween bop — and so much more|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/31/18046940/michael-jackson-thriller-facts-trivia-making-of-john-landis|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Vox|language=en}}</ref>[[File:Palace Thriller.jpg|thumb|right|The Palace Theatre is featured in the music video.]]Jackson created the zombie dance with choreographer [[Michael Peters]], who had choreographed the "Beat It" video. Jackson said his first concern was to create a zombie dance that did not seem comical. He and Peters imagined how the zombies would move by making faces in the mirror, incorporating "jazzy" moves, "not too much ballet or whatever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1615220/20090702/jackson_michael.jhtml?rsspartner=rssMozilla|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706010101/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1615220/20090702/jackson_michael.jhtml?rsspartner%3DrssMozilla|title=Michael Jackson's Life & Legacy: Global Superstar (1982–86)|publisher=VH1|archivedate=July 6, 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}</ref>

Landis's wife [[Deborah Nadoolman Landis|Deborah Nadoolman]], who recently worked on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', designed the costumes, including Jackson's red jacket.<ref name="Griffin" /> She chose red to contrast with the night setting and dark palette, dressing him in "hip", casual clothes that would be comfortable to dance in, and used the same color for his jacket and jeans to make Jackson appear taller.<ref name="Griffin" />

''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' was the first time Jackson had interacted with a woman in a video, which Landis described as a "breakthrough". [[Jennifer Beals]] turned down an offer to play the girlfriend.<ref name="Griffin" /> According to Landis, Ola Ray, a former [[Playboy Playmate]], was cast as she was "crazy for Michael" and had a "great smile".<ref name="Griffin" /> Landis encouraged Jackson and Ray to improvise during their scenes,<ref name=":0" /> and urged Jackson to act "sexy" and "show virility" for his female fans.<ref name="Griffin" /> According to Ray, the chemistry between them was real and they shared "intimate moments" during the shoot.<ref name="Griffin" />

''Thriller'' was filmed at the [[Broadway Theater District (Los Angeles)#Surviving theaters on Broadway|Palace Theatre]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], the zombie dance sequence at the junction of Union Pacific Avenue and South Calzona Street in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and the final house scene in the [[Angeleno Heights]] neighborhood at 1345 [[Carroll Avenue]].

The director of photography was [[Robert Paynter]], who had worked with Landis on ''[[Trading Places]].<ref name="Griffin" />''

Entertainment figures including [[Marlon Brando]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy Onassis]] visited the set.<ref name=":12"/> Jackson's parents [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]] and [[Katherine Jackson]] also visited. According to Landis, Michael asked him to be removed; Joseph refused to leave and had to be escorted off the set by police. Joseph denied this.<ref name=":0" />

Weeks before the premiere, Jackson, who was a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]], was told by church leaders that the film promoted demonology and that he would be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]]. Jackson called his assistant, [[John Branca]], and ordered him to destroy the [[Negative (photography)|negatives]]. The production team agreed to protect the negatives and locked them in Branca's office.<ref name=":0" /> Branca mollified Jackson by suggesting they include a disclaimer at the start of the film stating that it did not reflect Jackson's personal convictions.<ref name=":0" /> In a statement published in ''[[Awake!]]'', a magazine published by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]], Jackson said: "I just intended to do a good, fun short film, not to purposely bring to the screen something to scare people or to do anything bad. I want to do what's right. I would never do anything like that again." He said he had blocked further distribution and promotion of the film where he had been able.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Author Unknown|date=May 22, 1984|title=Young People Ask..."What About Music Videos?"|journal=Awake!|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society}}</ref>

==Horror elements==
The ''Thriller'' video makes many allusions to horror films.<ref name="Mercer">Mercer (2005), p. 85-89</ref> The opening scene parodies 1950s [[B movie|B-movie]] films, with Jackson and Ray dressed as 1950s teenagers. The metamorphosis of the polite "boy next door" into a [[werewolf]] has been interpreted as a depiction of male sexuality, depicted as naturally bestial, predatory, and aggressive. Critic [[Kobena Mercer]] found similarities with the werewolf in ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984).<ref name="Mercer">Mercer (2005), p. 85-89</ref>

The second metamorphosis has Michael becoming a zombie, introducing a dance sequence of dancing zombies, corresponding to a song lyric mentioning a [[masquerade ball]] of the dead.<ref name="Mercer2">Mercer (1991), p. 316-317</ref> Jackson's make-up casts "a ghostly pallor" over his skin and emphasizes the outline of his skull, an allusion to the mask from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).<ref name="Mercer2" />

According to [[Peter Dendle]], the zombie invasion sequence was inspired by ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968). Dendle wrote that the video captures the feelings of [[claustrophobia]] and helplessness essential to zombie films.<ref name="Dendle">Dendle (2001), p. 171</ref>

== Release ==

On November 14, 1983, ''Thriller'' was shown to a private audience at the [[Majestic Crest Theatre|Crest Theater]] in Los Angeles. In attendance celebrities including [[Diana Ross]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Eddie Murphy]]. Jackson stayed in the projection booth, declining Ray's invitation to join the audience. The audience gave the film a standing ovation. At Murphy's insistence, the film was played again.<ref name="Griffin"/>

The video debuted on MTV alongside ''Making Michael Jackson's Thriller'' on December 2, 1983.<ref name=":12"/> After each broadcast, MTV advertised when they would next play it, and recorded audience figures ten times the norm.<ref name="Griffin" /> ''Showtime'' aired the video six times in February.<ref name="Griffin" /> Within months, the cassette tape sold a million copies, making it the bestselling video release at that point.<ref name="Griffin" /> To make the film eligible for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], which required theatrical screenings, Landis arranged for the film to play before screenings of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940) at a Los Angeles cinema, though it was not nominated.<ref name=":12"/>

The video dramatically boosted sales of the ''Thriller'' album, which sold a million copies a week following its debut.<ref name=":12"/> It doubled album sales, helping make ''Thriller'' the bestselling album of all time.<ref name="Griffin" /> According to Landis, the response was "a surprise to everyone but Michael".<ref name=":0" /> The success transformed Jackson into a dominating force in global pop culture, and cemented his status as the "king of pop".<ref name="Griffin" />

At the [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards]], ''Thriller'' won the awards for [[MTV Video Music Award – Viewer's Choice|Viewers Choice]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Overall Performance|Best Overall Performance]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]], and was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Concept Video|Best Concept Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video|Best Male Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/mtv/tubescan/vma_archive/1984.html|title=VMA Archive 1984|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=March 1, 2000|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000301211539/http://www.mtv.com/mtv/tubescan/vma_archive/1984.html|archive-date=March 1, 2000|access-date=October 13, 2020}}</ref>

In 1984, the National Coalition on Television Violence (NCTV) reviewed 200 MTV videos and classified more than half as too violent, including ''Thriller''.

The ''Thriller'' video sealed MTV's position as a major cultural force, helped disassemble racial barriers for black artists, revolutionized music video production, popularized the making-of documentaries, and drove rentals and sales of VHS tapes.

==Litigation==
Jackson was sued by Landis in a dispute over [[royalties]] for the video; Landis claims that he is owed four years worth of royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/legal_thriller_michael_jackson_sued_by/81041|title=A Legal Thriller: Michael Jackson Sued by John Landis|last=Grossberg|first=Josh|date=January 27, 2009|publisher=E!|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/42356|title=Michael Jackson sued by 'Thriller' director|date=January 27, 2009|website=NME|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref>

Ola Ray has also complained about difficulties collecting royalties. At first, Ray blamed Jackson, but then she apologized to him in 1997. However, Ray did sue Jackson on May 6, 2009 less than two months before Jackson's death on June 25, 2009.  Eventually the Jackson Family Trust settled.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://latimes.com/news/local/la-me-michael-jackson-dead26-2009jun26,0,2152435.story|title=Michael Jackson, King of Pop, is dead at 50|date=June 26, 2009|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref>
