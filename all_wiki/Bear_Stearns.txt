'''The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc.''' was a New York-based global [[investment bank]], [[security (finance)|securities]] trading and [[brokerage firm]] that failed in 2008 as part of the [[Great Recession|global financial crisis and recession]], and was subsequently sold to [[JPMorgan Chase]]. The company's main business areas before its failure were [[capital market]]s, investment banking, [[wealth management]], and global [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] services, and it was heavily involved in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

In the years leading up to the failure, Bear Stearns was heavily involved in [[securitization]] and issued large amounts of [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] which were; in the case of mortgages, pioneered by [[Lewis Ranieri]], "the father of mortgage securities".<ref>Lowenstein, Roger The End Of Wall Street, Penguin Press 2010, pp.xvii,22 {{ISBN|978-1-59420-239-1}}</ref> As investor losses mounted in those markets in 2006 and 2007, the company actually increased its exposure, especially to the mortgage-backed assets that were central to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. In March 2008, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] provided an emergency loan to try to avert a sudden collapse of the company. The company could not be saved, however, and was sold to JPMorgan Chase for $10 per share,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/business/24deal-web.html|title=JPMorgan Raises Bid for Bear Stearns to $2 a Share|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|date=2008-03-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> a price far below its pre-crisis 52-week high of $133.20 per share, but not as low as the $2 per share originally agreed upon by Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17bear.html | title = JP Morgan Pays $2 a Share for Bear Stearns | author = Ross, Andrew | date = March 17, 2008 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}  Retrieved on September 30, 2008.</ref>

The collapse of the company was a prelude to the risk management meltdown of the investment banking industry in the United States and elsewhere that culminated in September 2008, and the subsequent [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis of 2008–2009]].

== History ==
[[File:BearStearns.JPG|thumb|200px|Bear Stearns' former offices at [[383 Madison Avenue]]]]
Bear Stearns was founded as an [[equity trading]] house on May 1, 1923 by [[Joseph Ainslie Bear]], [[Robert B. Stearns]] and Harold C. Mayer with $500,000 in capital. Internal tensions quickly arose among the three founders. The firm survived the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] without laying off any employees and by 1933 opened its first branch office in Chicago. In 1955 the firm opened its first international office in [[Amsterdam]].<ref name="better">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/business/17dealbook-could-be21779.html|title=Could Bear Stearns Do Better?|date=March 17, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 17, 2008}}
</ref>

In 1985, Bear Stearns became a publicly traded company.<ref name=better/>  It served corporations, institutions, governments, and individuals. The company's business included corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, institutional equities, fixed income sales & risk management, trading and research, private client services, derivatives, foreign exchange and futures sales and trading, asset management, and custody services. Through Bear Stearns Securities Corp., it offered global clearing services to broker dealers, prime broker clients and other professional traders, including [[securities lending]].<ref name=BizHist>{{Citation | title =  International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 52 | publisher = St. James Press | year = 2003 | chapter = Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. }}</ref>  Bear Stearns was also known for one of the most widely read market intelligence pieces on the street, known as the "Early Look at the Market."{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Bear Stearns' World Headquarters was located at [[383 Madison Avenue]], between East 46th Street and East 47th Street in [[Manhattan]]. By 2007, the company employed more than 15,500 people worldwide.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/28/us-bearstearns-jobs-idUSN2861070720071128|title= Bear Stearns to cut 650 jobs globally|author=Tim McLaughlin|work=[[Reuters]] |date =November 28, 2007 }}</ref> The firm was headquartered in New York City with offices in [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], Chicago, [[Dallas]], [[Denver]], [[Houston]], Los Angeles, [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]]; [[Whippany, New Jersey]]; and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Internationally the firm had offices in London, Beijing, [[Dublin]], [[Frankfurt]], Hong Kong, [[Lugano]], [[Milan]], [[São Paulo]], [[Mumbai]], Shanghai, [[Singapore]] and Tokyo.

In 2005–2007, Bear Stearns was recognized as the "Most Admired" securities firm in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "America's Most Admired Companies" survey, and second overall in the securities firm section.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/2007/industries/industry_52.html |title=America's Most Admired Companies 2007 FORTUNE |work= CNN|access-date=August 23, 2011}}</ref> The annual survey is a prestigious ranking of employee talent, quality of risk management and business innovation. This was the second time in three years that Bear Stearns had achieved this "top" distinction.

=== Lead-up to the failure – increasing exposure to subprime mortgages ===
By November 2006, the company had total capital of approximately $66.7 billion and total assets of $350.4 billion and according to the April 2005 issue of ''Institutional Investor'' magazine, Bear Stearns was the seventh-largest securities firm in terms of total capital.

A year later Bear Stearns had [[Notional amount|notional contract amounts]] of approximately $13.40 trillion in [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] financial instruments, of which $1.85 trillion were listed futures and option contracts. In addition, Bear Stearns was carrying more than $28 billion in [[Fair price#Fair Value Measurements (US markets): Exposure Draft|'level 3']] assets on its books at the end of fiscal 2007 versus a net equity position of only $11.1 billion. This $11.1 billion supported $395 billion in [[asset]]s,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/03/28/magazines/fortune/boyd_bear.fortune/ |author=Boyd, Roddy |title=The last days of Bear Stearns |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=March 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919002944/https://money.cnn.com/2008/03/28/magazines/fortune/boyd_bear.fortune/ |archive-date=September 19, 2008 |df=mdy }}  Retrieved on September 30, 2008.</ref> which means a [[leverage ratio]] of 35.6 to 1. This highly leveraged balance sheet, consisting of many illiquid and potentially worthless assets, led to the rapid diminution of investor and lender confidence, which finally evaporated as Bear was forced to call the New York Federal Reserve to stave off the looming cascade of [[counterparty]] risk which would ensue from forced liquidation.

=== Start of the crisis – two subprime mortgage funds fail ===
{{main|2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis}}
{{See also|Subprime lending|Collateralized debt obligation}}

On June 22, 2007, Bear Stearns pledged a collateralized loan of up to $3.2 billion to "bail out" one of its funds, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Fund, while negotiating with other banks to loan money against collateral to another fund, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund.  Bear Stearns had originally put up just $25 million, so they were hesitant about the bailout; nonetheless, CEO James Cayne and other senior executives worried about the damage to the company's reputation.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Burrough |first=Bryan |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/bear_stearns200808 |title=Bringing Down Bear Stearns |magazine=Vanity Fair |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Creswell |first=Julie  | last2 = Bajaj  | first2 = Vikas |title=$3.2 Billion Move by Bear Stearns to Rescue Fund | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date=June 23, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/23/business/23bond.html  |access-date=April 16, 2008}}</ref> The funds were invested in thinly traded [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).  [[Merrill Lynch]] seized $850 million worth of the underlying collateral but only was able to auction $100 million of them.

During the week of July 16, 2007, Bear Stearns disclosed that the two subprime hedge funds had lost nearly all of their value amid a rapid decline in the market for subprime mortgages.

On August 1, 2007, investors in the two funds took action against Bear Stearns and its top board and risk management managers and officers.  The law firms of [[Jake Zamansky (lawyer)|Jake Zamansky]] & Associates and Rich & Intelisano both filed arbitration claims with the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]] alleging that Bear Stearns misled investors about its exposure to the funds.  This was the first legal action made against Bear Stearns. Co-President Warren Spector was asked to resign on August 5, 2007, as a result of  the collapse of two hedge funds tied to subprime mortgages.  A September 21 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that Bear Stearns posted a 61 percent drop in net profits due to their hedge fund losses.<ref>{{Citation |title=Bear Stearns Profit Plunges 61% on Subprime Woes |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 21, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/business/20cnd-wall.html |access-date=September 14, 2008 | first=Michael M. | last=Grynbaum}}</ref>  With Samuel Molinaro's November 15 revelation that Bear Stearns was writing down a further $1.2 billion in mortgage-related securities and would face its first loss in 83 years, [[Standard & Poor's]] downgraded the company's [[credit rating]] from AA to A.<ref>{{Citation |last=Basar |first=Shanny | last2 = Ahuja| first2 = Vivek |title=Bear downgraded in face of first loss in 83 years | newspaper = Financial News Online |date=November 15, 2007 |url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/investmentbanking/content/2449185055/20755/ |access-date=April 16, 2008}}</ref>

They were also named in civil lawsuits brought in 2007 by investors, including [[Barclays Bank]], who claimed they had been misled. Barclays claimed that Bear Stearns knew that certain assets in the Bear Stearns [[High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund]] were worth much less than their professed values. The suit claimed that Bear Stearns managers devised "a plan to make more money for themselves and further to use the Enhanced Fund as a repository for risky, poor-quality investments." The lawsuit said Bear Stearns told Barclays that the enhanced fund was up almost 6% through June 2007—when "in reality, the portfolio's asset values were plummeting."<ref name="ap 61908">[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080619/ap_on_bi_ge/bear_stearns_investigation Ex-Bear Stearns managers arrested at their homes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620125236/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080619/ap_on_bi_ge/bear_stearns_investigation |date=June 20, 2008 }} By Tom Hays, Associated Press, 6/19/08.</ref>

=== Fed bailout and sale to JPMorgan Chase ===
On March 14, 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("FRBNY") agreed to provide a $25 billion loan to Bear Stearns collateralized by unencumbered assets from Bear Stearns in order to provide Bear Stearns the liquidity for up to 28 days that the market was refusing to provide. Shortly thereafter, FRBNY had a change of heart and told Bear Stearns that the 28-day loan was unavailable to them.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/video/flv/generic.html?s=frol02s1f81q752 FRONTLINE: Inside the Meltdown – You Have a Weekend to Save Yourself] Retrieved February 26, 2009</ref> The deal was then changed to where FRBNY would create a company (what would become [[Maiden Lane Transactions|Maiden Lane LLC]]) to buy $30 billion worth of Bear Stearns' assets, and Bear Stearns would be purchased by JPMorgan Chase in a [[stock swap]] worth $2 a share, or less than 7 percent of Bear Stearns' [[market value]] just two days before.<ref name="bloomberg.com">[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&refer=worldwide&sid=a7coicThgaEE Fed Aided Bear Stearns as Firm Faced Chapter 11, Bernanke Says].

Eventually, after renegotiating the purchase of Bear Stearns, Maiden Lane LLC was funded by a $29 billion first priority loan from FRBNY and a $1 billion subordinated loan from JPMorgan Chase, without further recourse to JPMorgan Chase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/Satellite?c=JPM_Content_C&cid=1159339104093&pagename=JPM_redesign%2FJPM_Content_C%2FGeneric_Detail_Page_Template|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326180008/http://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/Satellite?c=JPM_Content_C&cid=1159339104093&pagename=JPM_redesign%2FJPM_Content_C%2FGeneric_Detail_Page_Template|archive-date=March 26, 2008|title=JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns Announce Amended Agreement|date=March 24, 2008|publisher=JPMorgan Chase & Co.}}</ref>  The structure of the transaction, with both loans collateralized by securitized home mortgages<ref name="seekingalpha.com">{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/70098-bear-stearns-bondholders-win-big |title=Bear Stearns Bondholders Win Big |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=March 27, 2008 |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref> and with the JPMorgan Chase loan bearing losses before the FRBNY loan, meant that FRBNY could not seize or otherwise encumber [[JPMorgan Chase]]'s assets if the underlying [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] became insufficient to repay the FRBNY loan.<ref name="seekingalpha.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc080324.htm |title=Weekly Market Comment: Why is Bear Stearns Trading at $6 Instead of $2 |publisher=Hussman Funds |date=March 24, 2008 |access-date=June 19, 2013}}</ref>  Chairman of the Fed, [[Ben Bernanke]], defended the bailout by stating that a bankruptcy of Bear Stearns  would have affected the [[real economy]] and could have caused a "chaotic unwinding" of investments across the US markets.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/03/business/main3991713.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_3991713 | work=CBS News | title=Bernanke Defends Bear Stearns Bailout | date=April 3, 2008}}</ref>

On March 20, [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] Chairman [[Christopher Cox]] said the collapse of Bear Stearns was due to a lack of confidence, not a lack of capital. Cox noted that Bear Stearns's problems escalated when rumors spread about its [[liquidity crisis]] which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm. "Notwithstanding that Bear Stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings, market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with Bear Stearns," said Cox. Bear Stearns' liquidity pool started at $18.1 billion on March 10 and then plummeted to $2 billion on March 13. Ultimately market rumors about Bear Stearns' difficulties became self-fulfilling, Cox said.<ref>{{Citation |title=Chairman Cox Letter To Basel Committee In Support Of New Guidance On Liquidity Management |date=March 20, 2008 |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-48_letter.pdf |format=PDF|access-date=April 16, 2008}}</ref>
