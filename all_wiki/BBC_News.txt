All nations and English regions produce their own local news programmes and other current affairs and sport programmes.

The BBC is a [[Quasi-autonomous non-government organisation|quasi-autonomous]] corporation authorised by [[list of organisations in the United Kingdom with a royal charter|royal charter]], making it operationally independent of the government, who have no power to appoint or dismiss its director general, and require it to report impartially.

===1950s===
Television news, although physically separate from its radio counterpart, was still firmly under radio news' control in the 1950s. Correspondents provided reports for both outlets, and the first televised bulletin, shown on 5 July 1954 on the then [[BBC One|BBC television service]] and presented by [[Richard Baker (broadcaster)|Richard Baker]], involved his providing narration off-screen while stills were shown.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The BBC performs painful internal surgery|work=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/01/30/the-bbc-performs-painful-internal-surgery|access-date=2020-05-31|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> This was then followed by the customary ''Television Newsreel'' with a recorded commentary by [[John Snagge]] (and on other occasions by [[Andrew Timothy]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

On-screen newsreaders were introduced a year later in 1955{{snd}} [[Kenneth Kendall]] (the first to appear in vision), [[Robert Dougall]], and Richard Baker–three weeks before [[ITN]]'s launch on 21 September 1955.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Obituary: Kenneth Kendall, newsreader and presenter|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-kenneth-kendall-newsreader-and-presenter-1596900|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

Mainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in 1950<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1950.htm|title=Chronomedia: 1950|accessdate=8 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016210036/http://terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1950.htm| archivedate= 16 October 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> to larger premises{{snd}} mainly at [[Lime Grove Studios]] in [[Shepherd's Bush]], west London{{snd}} taking Current Affairs (then known as Talks Department) with it.

A newsroom was created at Alexandra Palace, television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts–without having to cover stories for radio too.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In 1987, [[John Birt, Baron Birt|John Birt]] resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both TV and radio with the introduction of bi-media journalism,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Forgan|first=Liz|date=2000-10-17|title=Comment: Liz Forgan on BBC radio at White City|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/oct/17/broadcasting.bbc|access-date=2020-05-31|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and 2008 saw tri-media introduced across TV, radio, and online.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Uncorrected Evidence m274|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/memo/annual/ucm27402.htm|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

[[BBC Two|BBC2]] started transmission on 20 April 1964 and began broadcasting a new show, ''[[Newsroom (BBC programme)|Newsroom]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=House of Lords - Communications - Minutes of Evidence|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldcomuni/122/8040202.htm|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

''[[The World at One]]'', a lunchtime news programme, began on 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, and the year before ''News Review'' had started on television. ''News Review'' was a summary of the week's news, first broadcast on Sunday, 26 April 1964<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1964.htm|title=Chronomedia: 1964|accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303014530/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1964.htm| archivedate= 3 March 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly ''Newsreel Review of the Week'', produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition ("super") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news [[footage]], committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at [[Alexandra Palace]]. The programme ran until the 1980s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html |title=TV Ark: BBC News |accessdate=16 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516061628/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html |archivedate=16 May 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref>{{snd}} by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor{{snd}} to be superseded by [[Ceefax]] subtitling (a similar [[Teletext]] format), and the signing of such programmes as ''[[See Hear]]'' (from 1981).

On Sunday 17 September 1967, ''[[The World This Weekend]]'', a weekly news and current affairs programme, launched on what was then Home Service, but soon-to-be [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].

Preparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on Thursday 7 March 1968 ''Newsroom'' on BBC2 moved to an early evening slot, becoming the first UK news programme to be transmitted in colour<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/1960s.pdf History of the BBC – key dates page 5] BBC Heritage 1960s.</ref>{{snd}} from Studio A at Alexandra Palace. ''News Review'' and ''Westminster'' (the latter a weekly review of [[Palace of Westminster|Parliamentary]] happenings) were "colourised" shortly after.

However, much of the insert material was still in black and white, as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour [[reversal film]] [[film stock|stock]], and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one [[RCA]] colour [[Quadruplex videotape]] machine and, eventually two [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]] [[Diode gun Plumbicon#Plumbicon|plumbicon]] colour [[telecine]]s–although the news colour service started with just one.

Black and white national bulletins on BBC 1 continued to originate from Studio B on weekdays, along with ''[[Town and Around]]'', the London regional "[[opt out]]" programme broadcast throughout the 1960s (and the BBC's first regional news programme for the South East), until it started to be replaced by ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]'' on Tuesday to Thursday from Lime Grove Studios early in September 1969. ''Town and Around'' was never to make the move to Television Centre{{snd}} instead it became ''London This Week'' which aired on Mondays and Fridays only, from the new TVC studios.<ref>''London This Week'' had started in early 1969 as a once per week "opt out" replacing the Friday edition of ''Town and Around'' {{cite web|url=http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/|title=TV & Radio Bits: BBC South East: History|accessdate=21 June 2007}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[File:BBC TV Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Television News moved to [[BBC Television Centre]] in September 1969.]]

The BBC moved production out of Alexandra Palace in 1969. BBC Television News resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on BBC1{{snd}} in black and white{{snd}} from Television Centre, where it remained until March 2013.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks, thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid-1950s.

[[Angela Rippon]] became the first female news presenter of the ''Nine O'Clock News'' in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on ''The [[Morecambe and Wise]] Christmas Show'' in 1976 singing and dancing.<ref name=Dougall/>

The first edition of ''[[John Craven]]'s Newsround'', initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just ''[[Newsround]]'', came from studio N3 on 4 April 1972.

Afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the ''Nine O'Clock News'' got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.

Also in the mid-1970s, the late night news on BBC2 was briefly renamed ''Newsnight'',<ref>

News on radio was to change in the 1970s, and on Radio 4 in particular, brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the ''Broadcasting in the Seventies '' report. These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present, as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process. New programmes were also added to the daily schedule, ''[[PM (Radio 4)|PM]]'' and ''[[The World Tonight]]'' as part of the plan for the station to become a "wholly speech network".<ref name="bbcnews1" /> ''[[Newsbeat]]'' launched as the news service on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] on 10 September 1973.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/1970s.pdf History of the BBC – key dates page 4] BBC Heritage 1970s.</ref>

On 23 September 1974, a [[teletext]] system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The [[Ceefax]] service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.

By the end of the decade, the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining, with the introduction of [[Electronic news gathering|ENG]] technology into the UK. The equipment would gradually become less cumbersome{{snd}} the BBC's first attempts had been using a [[Philips]] colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable [[Sony]] [[U-matic]] recorder in the latter half of the decade.

Two years earlier, the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]] had been shot electronically by the BBC Television News [[Outside broadcasting]] team, and the work of reporter [[Kate Adie]], broadcasting live from [[South Kensington|Prince's Gate]], was nominated for BAFTA actuality coverage, but this time beaten by ITN for the 1980 award.<ref>[http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=1981 BAFTA awards 1981] British Academy of Film and Television Arts.</ref>

''[[Newsnight]]'', the news and current affairs programme, was due to go on air on 23 January 1980, although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week.<ref name="bbcnews2">{{cite news|title=About BBC NEWS – Timeline of events – 1980s|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1980s.stm|accessdate=25 August 2007}}</ref> On 27 August 1981 [[Moira Stuart]] became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television.

The ''Six O'Clock News'' first aired on 3 September 1984, eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 it has been overtaken by the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]''). In October 1984, images of millions of people starving to death in the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] were shown in [[Michael Buerk]]'s ''Six O'Clock News'' reports.<ref name="BBCLiveAid">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/702700.stm "Live Aid: The show that rocked the world"].

Starting in 1981, the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles–a set of computer animated "stripes" forming a circle<ref>The circle had been a recurring theme of the BBC1 news logo since the start of the ''Nine'' in 1970, as it was thought to fit in nicely with the long-running BBC 1 globe ident, and clock face which normally precedes news broadcasts. Used until 1986, the hard wired news version was known as ANT (Animated News Titles) [http://www.bbceng.info/Designs/RDCE/part_I/101to200/ipage_43.htm BBCEng.info] and this new logo was drawn live{{snd}} triggered by an audio tone on track two of the two-track mono quarter-inch audio tape of opening title music to ensure sychronisation{{snd}} and also produced the "venetian blind" wipe to the opening story.</ref> on a red background with a "BBC News" typescript appearing below the circle graphics, and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards. The ''Nine'' used a similar (striped) number 9. The red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987.

By 1987, the BBC had decided to re-brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music, the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the ''Nine'', although the "stripes" introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html |title=TV Ark: BBC News Report: Zeebrugge ferry disaster from 6&nbsp;March 1987 |accessdate=1 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095542/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

===1990s===
[[File:BBC Television Centre Newsroom KristynaM Flickr.jpg|thumb|right|The combined newsroom for domestic television and radio was opened at Television Centre in West London in 1998.]]

During the 1990s, a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News, with the split of [[BBC World Service Television]] to become [[BBC World]] (news and current affairs), and [[BBC Prime]] (light entertainment). Content for a 24-hour news channel was thus required, followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent [[BBC News 24]]. Rather than set bulletins, ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary. In 1998, after 66 years at Broadcasting House, the '''BBC Radio News''' operation moved to [[BBC Television Centre]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/120791.stm|title= BBC NEWS – New era for BBC radio news|accessdate=18 August 2007| date=26 June 1998 | work=BBC News}}</ref>

New technology, provided by [[Silicon Graphics]], came into use in 1993 for a re-launch of the main BBC 1<!-- Not 'BBC One' until 1997. --> bulletins, creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically. The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring, titles, and music to differentiate each. A computer generated cut-glass sculpture of the [[BBC coat of arms]] was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999.

In 1999, the biggest relaunch occurred, with BBC One bulletins, BBC World, BBC News 24, and [[BBC News Online]] all adopting a common style. One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the [[:Category:BBC Regional News shows|BBC regional news programmes]], giving a common style across local, national and international BBC television news. This also included ''[[Newyddion]]'', the main news programme of [[Welsh language]] channel [[S4C]], produced by BBC News Wales.

===2000s===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2020}}
Following the relaunch of BBC News the previous year, regional headlines were included at the start of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the ''Nine O'Clock News'' moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]'' programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned ''News at Ten'' but following poor ratings when head to head against the BBC's ''Ten O'Clock News'', the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.

The retirement of [[Peter Sissons]] and departure of [[Michael Buerk]] from the ''Ten O'Clock News'' led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The ''Six O'Clock News'' became double headed with [[George Alagiah]] and [[Sophie Raworth]] after [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] and [[Fiona Bruce]] moved to present the ''Ten''. A new set design featuring a projected fictional newsroom backdrop was introduced, followed on 16 February 2004 by new programme titles to match those of BBC News 24.

BBC News 24 and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December 2003, that was slightly altered on 5 July 2004 to mark 50 years of BBC Television News.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3829605.stm|title= Fifty years of TV news |accessdate=3 April 2007 |date=5 July 2004 |work=BBC News |first=Chris |last=Heard}}</ref>

The individual positions of editor of the ''One'' and ''Six O'Clock News'' were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while [[Craig Oliver (media executive)|Craig Oliver]] was later named editor of the ''Ten O'Clock News''. The bulletins also began to be [[simulcast]] with News 24, as a way of pooling resources.

Bulletins received new titles and a new set design in May 2006, to allow for ''Breakfast'' to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997. The new set featured [[Barco NV|Barco]] videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for ''Breakfast''. This was later replaced following viewer criticism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/5048764.stm|title=Breakfast's new look|accessdate=3 April 2007 | date=5 June 2006|work=BBC News}}</ref> The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced [[ITV News]] in 2004, though ITN uses a [[Colour-separation overlay|CSO]] [[Virtual studio]] rather than the actual screens at BBC News. Also, May saw the launch of ''World News Today'' the first domestic bulletin focused principally on international news.

BBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November 2006 as part of a restructuring of the BBC. The then-Director of BBC News, [[Helen Boaden]] reported to the then-Deputy Director-General and head of the journalism group, [[Mark Byford]] until he was made redundant in 2010.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8057696/BBCs-Mark-Byford-made-redundant.html ''BBC's Mark Byford made redundant'', Neil Midgley, Daily Telegraph,11 October 2010].

On 18 October 2007, [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] announced a six-year plan, ''Delivering Creative Future'', merging the television current affairs department into a new "News Programmes" division.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml|title=Radical reform to deliver a more focused BBC|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=25 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020051207/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml| archivedate= 20 October 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/10/post_51.html|title=BBC cuts: look on the bright side|work=Guardian |date=22 October 2007|accessdate=25 October 2007 | location=London |first=Steve |last=Hewlett| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071024120744/http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/10/post_51.html| archivedate= 24 October 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> Thompson's announcement, in response to a £2 billion shortfall in funding, would, he said, deliver "a smaller but fitter BBC" in the digital age, by cutting its payroll and, in 2013, selling [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7050440.stm|title=BBC cuts back programmes and jobs|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=25 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071020035603/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7050440.stm#tables| archivedate= 20 October 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>

The various separate newsrooms for television, radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department. [[BBC World Service]] director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/11/multimedia_news.html|title=Multimedia News|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=19 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071115103603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/11/multimedia_news.html| archivedate= 15 November 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref>

A new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January 2007. This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins, editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on.

The first new BBC News bulletin since the ''Six O'Clock News'' was announced in July 2007 following a successful trial in the Midlands.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6291338.stm|title=BBC One gets extra news bulletin|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 July 2007 | date=11 July 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714232708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6291338.stm| archivedate= 14 July 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> The summary, lasting 90 seconds, has been broadcast at 20:00 on weekdays since December 2007 and bears similarities with ''[[60 Seconds]]'' on [[BBC Three]], but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary.

As part of a long-term cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the ''BBC News at One'', ''Six'' and ''Ten'' respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3735982.ece |title=BBC rings changes with news revamp |work=The Times |location=London|date= 13 April 2008|accessdate=30 April 2009 | first=Dipesh | last=Gadher}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/bbcnews24/2008.html |title=BBC News Channel – 2008 |publisher=TV Ark |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510021938/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/bbcnews24/2008.html |archivedate=10 May 2011  }}</ref> BBC World was renamed ''BBC World News'' and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style, designed by [[Lambie-Nairn]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Horrocks |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/04/new_news.html |title=BBC NEWS – The Editors Blog – New News |publisher=BBC|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=30 April 2009}}</ref>

The studio moves also meant that Studio N9, previously used for BBC World, was closed, and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News 24. Studio N9 was later refitted to match the new branding, and was used for the BBC's [[2009 United Kingdom local elections|UK local elections]] and [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections]] coverage in early June 2009.

==Opinions==
{{Main|BBC controversies|Criticism of the BBC}}

===Political and commercial independence===
The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners. This political objectivity is sometimes questioned. For instance, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (3 August 2005) carried a letter from the [[KGB]] defector [[Oleg Gordievsky]], referring to it as "The Red Service". Books have been written on the subject, including anti-BBC works like ''Truth Betrayed'' by W J West and ''The Truth Twisters'' by Richard Deacon.

The BBC's Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that whilst "the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged", "the government of the day will often be the primary source of news".<ref name=BBCEditorialGuidelines>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review_report_research/impartiality_21century/f_editorial_guidelines_extracts.txt "Editorial Guidelines Extracts"], ''[[BBC]]''.</ref>

The BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and, by the opposition, of bias in favour of the government. Similarly, during times of war, the BBC is often accused by the UK government, or by strong supporters of British military campaigns, of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy. An edition of ''[[Newsnight]]'' at the start of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 was described as "almost treasonable" by [[John Page (UK politician)|John Page]], MP, who objected to [[Peter Snow]] saying "if we believe the British".<ref name="Falklands Newsnight">Denis Taylor, "BBC broadcasts jammed", ''The Times'', 4 May 1982, p. 2.</ref>

During the first [[Gulf War]], critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name "Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation".<ref name="news24"/> During the [[Kosovo War]], the BBC were labelled the "Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation" (suggesting favouritism towards the [[FR Yugoslavia]] government over ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] rebels) by British ministers,<ref name="news24">{{cite news|publisher=News 24 |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1390672,00.html |title=BBC versus British government |date=21 July 2003 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309115833/http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0%2C%2C2-10-1462_1390672%2C00.html |archivedate=9 March 2008  }}</ref> although [[Slobodan Milosević]] (then FRY president) claimed that the BBC's coverage had been biased ''against'' his nation.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=22 August 2002|title=Milosevic attacks BBC 'bias'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2220904.stm | accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref>

Conversely, some of those who style themselves anti-establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro-establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to "anti-war" voices. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a study by the Cardiff University School of Journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that, out of the main British broadcasters covering the war, the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties, the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report's author, [[Justin Lewis (media scholar)|Justin Lewis]], wrote "Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis."<ref>{{cite book|last=McNair|first=Brian|title=News and Journalism in the UK|date=18 February 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134128846|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlB8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA79|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>

Prominent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of [[Greg Dyke]] as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, as well as a friend of [[Tony Blair]]. The BBC's former Political Editor, [[Nick Robinson (journalist)|Nick Robinson]], was some years ago a chairman of the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor [[Andrew Marr]] faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.

[[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]], former Director-General of the BBC, admitted the organisation has been biased "towards the left" in the past. He said, "In the BBC I joined 30 years ago, there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left".<ref>{{cite news|last=Yesawich |first=Avi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=186893 |title=Report: BBC dir.-gen. admits previous organizational bias |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> He then added, "The organization did struggle then with impartiality. Now it is a completely different generation. There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC."

Historian [[Mark Curtis (British author)|Mark Curtis]] finds that BBC news resembles a "straightforward state propaganda organ" that provides "critical support for the [British and Western] elite's promotion of foreign policy", such as the 2003 war of aggression against Iraq.  He says this militant nationalism is "not even subtle", and, citing Glasgow university, says BBC News is a chief example of "manufactured production of ideology."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=Mark|title=Web of Deceit: Britain's Real Role in the World|date=2003|publisher=Vintage|url=http://markcurtis.info/2017/05/01/the-medias-propaganda-role/}}</ref>

Since the aftermath of the EU referendum, some critics have charged that the BBC is biased in favour of leaving the EU.  For instance, in 2018, the BBC has received many complaints by Remainers who took issue at the BBC not sufficiently covering anti-Brexit marches whilst giving smaller-scale events hosted by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage more airtime.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Galsworthy |first1=Mike |title=HOMECOMMENT & ANALYSISCOMMENTWHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH THE BBC AND BREXIT BIAS?

===India===
In 2008, the BBC was criticised by some Indian outlets for referring to the terrorists who carried out the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]] as "gunmen".<ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Dec222008/editpage20081221108056.asp Mealy-mouthed BBC]{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The BBC cannot see the difference between a criminal and a terrorist|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/dec/14mumterror-mj-akbar-slams-bbc-for-biased-coverage-of-mumbai-terror-attack.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=5 July 2012|website=|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]}}</ref> The response to this added to prior criticism from some Indian commentators suggesting that the BBC may have an [[Indophobic]] bias.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=42169 |title=BBC coverage biased, say British Hindus |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> In March 2015, the BBC was criticised for airing a documentary interviewing one of the rapists in India.

===Hutton Inquiry===
{{Main|Hutton Inquiry}}

BBC News was at the centre of a political controversy following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Three BBC News reports ([[Andrew Gilligan]]'s on ''[[Today programme|Today]]'', Gavin Hewitt's on ''The Ten O'Clock News'' and another on ''[[Newsnight]]'') quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister's office) had embellished the [[September Dossier]] with misleading exaggerations of Iraq's [[weapons of mass destruction]] capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism.

In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]] was named in the press as the source for Gilligan's story on 9 July 2003. Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]] was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly's death, concluding that "Dr. Kelly took his own life."<ref>{{cite web|author=Vikram Dodd|title=Dr David Kelly: 10 years on, death of scientist remains unresolved for some|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/16/david-kelly-death-10-years-on|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 July 2013}}</ref>

In his report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan's original accusation was "unfounded" and the BBC's editorial and management processes were "defective". In particular, it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC Director of News, [[Richard Sambrook]], the report said, had accepted Gilligan's word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete. Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under the chairman's, [[Gavyn Davies]], guidance, accepted that further investigation of the Government's complaints were unnecessary.

Because of the criticism in the Hutton report, Davies resigned on the day of publication. BBC News faced an important test, reporting on itself with the publication of the report, but by common consent (of the Board of Governors) managed this "independently, impartially and honestly".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3890821.stm |title=BBC Iraq war coverage criticised |accessdate=11 April 2007 |date=13 July 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Davies' resignation was followed by the resignation of [[Director-General of the BBC|Director General]], [[Greg Dyke]], the following day, and the resignation of Gilligan on 30 January. While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation, an ICM poll in April 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3889595.stm |title=BBC report 2004: At a glance |accessdate=11 April 2007 |date=13 July 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
{{See also|Criticism of the BBC#Middle East and Israel|Balen Report}}
The BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti-[[Israel]] and anti-[[State of Palestine|Palestine]] bias.

Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', has described the BBC's coverage of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] as "a relentless, one-dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors [which] bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that, wittingly or not, has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half-century.".<ref name=Davis130>Davis, Douglas. "Hatred in the air: the BBC, Israel and Antisemitism" in Iganski, Paul & Kosmin, Barry. (eds) ''A New Anti-Semitism? Debating Judeophobia in 21st century Britain''. Profile Books, 2003, p. 130.</ref> However two large independent studies, one conducted by Loughborough University and the other by Glasgow University's Media Group concluded that Israeli perspectives are given greater coverage.<ref>{{cite document |title=The BBC's reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict |last1=Downey |first1=John |last2=Deacon |first2=David |last3=Golding |first3=Peter |last4=Oldfield |first4=B |last5=Wring |first5=Dominic |year=2006|hdl = 2134/3158}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3827207.stm|title=Palestine issue confuses Britons |work=BBC News |first=James |last=Read |date=22 June 2004}}</ref>

Critics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers' pounds from preventing the report being released to the public.<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2398870.ece BBC fights to suppress internal report into allegations of bias against Israel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013035628/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2398870.ece |date=13 October 2008}} by Andy McSmith (''The Independent'') 28 March 2007.</ref><ref>T''Telegraph'', [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/10/15/nbeeb15.xml BBC mounts court fight to keep 'critical' report secret], 15 October 2006.</ref>

[[Jeremy Bowen]], the Middle East Editor for BBC world news, was singled out specifically for bias by the [[BBC Trust]] which concluded that he violated "BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality."<ref name=ind160409>''[[The Independent]]'', 16 April 2009, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/bowen-breached-rules-on-impartiality-1669278.html Bowen 'breached rules on impartiality'].</ref>

An independent panel appointed by the [[BBC Trust]] was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the BBC's coverage of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbcgovernorsarchive.co.uk/docs/reviews/panel_report_final.pdf |title=Impartiality Review: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict |publisher=BBC Governors |accessdate=14 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614000035/http://www.bbcgovernorsarchive.co.uk/docs/reviews/panel_report_final.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 |url-status = dead}}</ref> The panel's assessment was that "apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias." While noting a "commitment to be fair accurate and impartial" and praising much of the BBC's coverage the independent panel concluded "that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict. In some ways the picture is incomplete and, in that sense, misleading." It notes that, "the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, [reflects] the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation".

Writing in the ''Financial Times'', [[Philip Stephens (journalist)|Philip Stephens]], one of the panellists, later accused the BBC's director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions. He further opined "My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process. If I am right, the BBC, too, is lost".<ref>Philip Stephens: BBC is losing public service plot, ''Financial Times'', 20 June 2006.</ref> Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day.<ref>The BBC's success story has a public service plot, Mark Thompson, ''Financial Times'', 21 June 2006.</ref>

The description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of [[Yassir Arafat]] that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality, particularly from Martin Walker<ref name=Walker>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-2174641,00.html |title=The BBC pro-Israeli? Is the Pope Jewish?-Comment-Columnists-Guest contributors |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=11 April 2007 |date=11 May 2006 |first=Martin |last=Walker}}</ref> in a guest opinion piece in ''[[The Times]]'', who picked out the apparent case of Fayad Abu Shamala, the [[BBC Arabic]] Service correspondent, who told a [[Hamas]] rally on 6 May 2001, that journalists in Gaza were "waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the Palestinian people."<ref name=Walker/>

Walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Ariel Sharon]]'s stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry only looked at the BBC's domestic coverage, and excluded output on the [[BBC World Service]] and BBC World.<ref name=Walker/>

[[Tom Gross]] accused the BBC of glorifying [[List of Hamas suicide attacks|Hamas suicide bombers]], and condemned its policy of inviting guests such as [[Jenny Tonge]] and [[Tom Paulin]] who have compared Israeli soldiers to [[Nazis]]. Writing for the BBC, Paulin said [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli soldiers]] should be "shot dead" like [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s S.S, and said he could "understand how suicide bombers feel."{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} According to Gross, Paulin and Tonge continue to be invited as regular guests, and they are among the most frequent contributors to their most widely screened arts programme.<ref>[http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/gross200406181018.asp Tom Gross on BBC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628025507/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/gross200406181018.asp |date=28 June 2010 }} National Review Online.</ref>

The BBC also faced criticism for not airing a [[Disasters Emergency Committee]] aid appeal for Palestinians who suffered in Gaza during 22-day war there in late 2008/early 2009. Most other major UK broadcasters did air this appeal, but rival Sky News did not.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

British journalist [[Julie Burchill]] has accused BBC of creating a "climate of fear" for [[British Jews]] over its "excessive coverage" of Israel compared to other nations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burchill |first=Julie |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=178724 |title=How the British media get their kicks|publisher=Jpost.com |date=18 June 2010 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref>

===Partners===
BBC and ABC share video segments and reporters as needed in producing their newscasts. with the BBC showing ''[[ABC World News Tonight]] with [[David Muir]]'' in the UK. However, in July 2017, BBC announced a new partnership with [[CBS News]] allows both organisations to share video, editorial content, and additional newsgathering resources in New York, London, Washington and around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-bbc-join-forces/ |title=CBS News and BBC News join forces around the globe |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=13 July 2017 |website=CBS News |publisher=CBS Interactive |access-date= }}</ref>

BBC News subscribes to wire services from leading international agencies including [[PA Media]] (formerly Press Association), [[Reuters]], and [[Agence France-Presse]]. In April 2017, the BBC dropped [[Associated Press]] in favour of an enhanced service from AFP.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://photoarchivenews.com/news/the-bbc-drops-ap-for-afptv-ap-statement/ |title = The BBC drops AP for AFPTV – read the AP Statement|date = 30 March 2017}}</ref>

===The view of foreign governments===
BBC News reporters and broadcasts are now and have in the past been banned in several countries primarily for reporting which has been unfavourable to the ruling government. For example, correspondents were banned by the former [[apartheid]] régime of South Africa. The BBC was banned in [[Robert Mugabe#Prime Minister and President|Zimbabwe under Mugabe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/News2002/zim040_joytv_bbc.htm|title=Broadcasting of BBC in Zimbabwe stopped|accessdate=11 April 2007|publisher=afrol – African News Agency}}</ref> for eight years as a terrorist organisation until being allowed to operate again over a year after the [[2008 Zimbabwean presidential election|2008 elections]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/07/resuming_operations_in_zimbabw.html|title=Resuming operations in Zimbabwe|accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref>

The BBC was banned in Burma (officially [[Myanmar]] ) after their coverage and commentary on anti-government protests there in September 2007. The ban was lifted four years later in September 2011.

In June 2015, the Rwandan government placed an indefinite ban on BBC broadcasts following the airing of a controversial documentary regarding the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]], ''Rwanda's Untold Story'', broadcast on BBC2 on 1 October 2014.
