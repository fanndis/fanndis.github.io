'''{{Lang|de|Ariadne auf Naxos}}''' (''[[Ariadne]] on [[Naxos]]''), [[Opus number|Op.]] 60, is an [[opera]] by [[Richard Strauss]] with a German libretto by [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lismann | first=Else Mayer | title=Ariadne Auf Naxos | journal=Tempo | volume=28 | issue= 28| pages=25–28 | date=Summer 1953 | doi=10.1017/S0040298200051159 }}</ref>The opera's unusual combination of elements of low [[commedia dell'arte]] with those of high [[opera seria]] points up one of the work's principal themes: the competition between high and low art for the public's attention.

== First version (1912) ==
[[File:Strauss, Richard - Ariadne auf Naxos - Restoration.jpg|thumb|1916 vocal score]]
The opera was originally conceived as a 30-minute [[divertissement]] to be performed at the end of Hofmannsthal's adaptation of [[Molière]]'s play ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]].'' Besides the opera, Strauss provided [[Le bourgeois gentilhomme (Strauss)|incidental music]] to be performed during the play.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/30/glyndebourne2013-michael-kennedy-ariadne-auf-naxos-strauss-hofmannsthal|title=The odd couple|last=Kennedy|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 May 2013|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref> In the end, the opera occupied ninety minutes, and the performance of play plus opera occupied over six hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/edinburgh-festival-97-hit-or-myth-1246333.html|title=Edinburgh Festival 97: Hit or myth?|last=Hayes|first=Malcolm|website=[[The Independent]]|date=20 August 1997|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref> It was first performed at the [[Staatsoper Stuttgart|Hoftheater Stuttgart]] on 25 October 1912, directed by [[Max Reinhardt]].<ref name="Guardian"/> The combination of the play and opera proved to be unsatisfactory to the audience: those who had come to hear the opera resented having to wait until the play finished.<ref name="Guardian"/>

The opera-and-play version was produced in [[Zürich]] on 5 December 1912 and [[Prague]] on 7 December 1912.<ref name=Loewenberg>{{harvnb|Loewenberg|1978|loc=column 1317}}</ref> The [[Munich]] premiere followed on 30 January 1913 in the old [[Residenz Theatre|Residenztheater]], a venue which was inferior for the presentation of opera, both acoustically and due to lack of space for the musicians. Hofmannsthal overruled the conductor [[Bruno Walter]]'s preference for the [[National Theatre Munich|Hofoper]], on the grounds that the smaller theatre was more suitable for a work of this kind. The cast included the American [[Maude Fay]] as Ariadne, Otto Wolf as Bacchus, and [[Hermine Bosetti]] as Zerbinetta.

Strauss, being a native son, had a close association with Munich and was held in high regard, but had to miss the performance as he was on a concert tour in Russia. The audience openly expressed its disapproval of the piece by hissing after the first act. For the succeeding performances, Walter introduced cuts and moved the production to the Hoftheater, and the attendance began to improve.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riding |first1=Erik S. |last2= Pechefsky|first2= Rebecca |year=2001|title= Bruno Walter: A World Elsewhere |page= 106&ndash;107 |location= New Haven |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 978-0-300-08713-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFwzgkxoI30C&q=Ariadne%20auf%20Naxos&pg=PA74}}</ref> The 1912 version was also produced in Berlin beginning on 27 February 1913 and in Amsterdam in 1914.<ref name=Loewenberg/>

In London the early version was given eight times at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] beginning on 27 May 1913. The Hofmannsthal adaptation of Molière's play was presented in an English translation by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] under the title ''The Perfect Gentleman.'' The opera was sung in German with [[Eva von der Osten]], Hermine Bosetti and Otakar Marák, conducted by [[Thomas Beecham]]. The reviewer in ''The Musical Times'' found the incidental music for the play to be more attractive than that for the opera, which nevertheless had "many strong emotional appeals." However, the orchestration of the opera was thought to be "peculiar", and in the finale, the love-making of Bacchus and Ariadne, tedious.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Ariadne in Naxos |journal=The Musical Times |date=1 July 1913 |volume=54 |page=456 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4bcnXXgdYwC&pg=PA456}}</ref>{{sfn|Rosenthal|1958|p=378}}

In 2012, the [[Salzburg Festival]] revived the first version, staged by Sven-Eric Bechtolf, and sung by [[Emily Magee]], [[Elena Moșuc]] and [[Jonas Kaufmann]], with conductor [[Daniel Harding]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e6c2149a-dbc0-11e1-8d78-00144feab49a.html#axzz2o4LDwVAK|title=Ariadne auf Naxos/Orchestra Mozart Bologna, Salzburg Festival|work=Financial Times}}</ref>

== Second version (1916) ==
[[File:Ariadne auf Naxos at Hamburgische Staatsoper 2012 - Photo No 203 by Monika Rittershaus.jpg|thumb|[[Anne Schwanewilms]] (Ariadne) and [[Johan Botha (tenor)|Johan Botha]] (Bacchus), [[Hamburg State Opera]] 2012]]
After these initial performances, it became apparent that the work as it stood was impracticable:  it required a company of actors as well as an opera company, was thus very expensive to mount, and its length was likely to be a problem for audiences.  So in 1913, Hofmannsthal proposed to Strauss that the play should be replaced by a prologue, which would explain why the opera combines a serious classical story with a comedy performed by a [[commedia dell'arte]] group.  He also moved the action from Paris to Vienna.  Strauss was initially reluctant, but he composed the prologue (and modified some aspects of the opera) in 1916, and this revised version was first performed at the [[Vienna State Opera]] on 4 October of that year. This is the version that is normally staged today, although the original play-plus-opera has been occasionally performed, such as at the 1997 [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and at the 2012 Salzburg Festival.

The most important aria in either version is Zerbinetta's {{Lang|de|Großmächtige Prinzessin}} (High and mighty princess). Other important pieces of the opera are the arias of Ariadne {{Lang|de|Wo war ich?}} (Where was I?), {{Lang|de|Ein Schönes war}} (There was something beautiful) and {{Lang|de|Es gibt ein Reich}} (There is a realm). Also of note is the Composer's aria {{Lang|de|Sein wir wieder gut!}} (Let's be friends again).

===Performance history of the second version===
After its premiere in Vienna, the second version was first performed in Berlin on 1 November 1916, followed by Zürich on 28 January 1917 (in a production by the [[National Theatre Mannheim|Mannheim Opera]]). It was first presented in Budapest on 19 April 1919 (in a Hungarian translation by Z. Harsányi), and in German in [[Graz]] on 12 March 1920, Amsterdam in January 1924,<ref name=Loewenberg /> and London at the [[Royal Opera House]] on 27 May 1924 with [[Lotte Lehmann]] as Ariadne, [[Maria Ivogün]] as Zerbinetta (in her debut with the company), [[Elisabeth Schumann]] as the Composer, Karl Fischer-Niemann as Bacchus, and [[Karl Alwin|Carl Alwin]] conducting. Despite the stellar cast, the production was not successful, with one of the lowest box office returns of the season. It was repeated only once.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenthal|1958|pp=428, 772–773}}. Note that Rosenthal spells the conductor's name as Karl Alwin, but Carl Alwin is the preferred spelling based on a more recent source, i.e., Puritz, Gerd (1993). ''Elisabeth Schumann: A Biography''. London: Andrea Deutsch. {{ISBN|978-0-233-98794-1}}.</ref>

It was first performed in Italy in [[Turin]] at the {{il|Teatro di Turino|it}} on 7 December 1925 (in an Italian translation by O. Schanzer); in Sweden in Stockholm on 27 November 1926 (in Swedish); in Brussels on 17 March 1930 (in a French translation by P. Spaak); in Helsinki on 12 May 1931 (in a Finnish translation by A. af Enehjelm); in Rome at the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Teatro Reale]] on 28 March 1935 (in German); [[Antwerp]] on 28 September 1935 (in [[Flemish]]); and in Paris at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] on 10 September 1937 (in German).<ref name=Loewenberg />

The United States premiere of the opera was given in German by the [[Philadelphia Civic Opera Company]] at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] on 1 November 1928. Conducted by [[Alexander Smallens]], the cast included Alma Peterson as the Primadonna/Ariadne, Charlotte Boykin as Zerbinetta, Irene Williams as the Composer, and Judson House as the Tenor/Bacchus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1928/11/02/archives/strauss-opera-has-american-premiere-ariadne-of-naxos-is-admirably.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Civic+Opera+Company%2522&scp=26&st=p|title=Strauss Opera Has American Premiere; ''Ariadne of Naxos'' is Admirably Given by Philadelphia Civic Company|author=Olin Downes|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 2, 1928|author-link=Olin Downes}}</ref> It was presented by the [[Juilliard School]] in New York City in English in a translation by A.

In 1926, the opera was first presented at the [[Salzburg Festival]], staged by [[Lothar Wallerstein]] in Viennese settings, twice conducted by [[Clemens Krauss]] and once by Richard Strauss himself. [[Lotte Lehmann]] was Salzburg's first Ariadne. Wallerstein was also the stage director of the second Viennese production in 1935, with settings by [[Oskar Strnad]] and costumes by Ladislaus Czettel.

==Synopsis==
[[File:John Vanderlyn 001.jpg|thumb|''The Sleeping Ariadne in Naxos'' by [[John Vanderlyn]]]]

''Ariadne auf Naxos'' is in two parts, called the Prologue and the Opera. The first part shows the backstage circumstances leading up to the second part, which is in fact an opera within an opera.

===Prologue===
At the home of the richest man in Vienna, preparations for an evening of music are under way. Two troupes of musicians and singers have arrived. One is a burlesque group, led by the saucy comedienne Zerbinetta. The other is an opera company, who will present an ''[[opera seria]]'', ''Ariadne auf Naxos'', the work of the Composer. Members of the two companies quarrel over which performance should be presented first.  However, the preparations are thrown into confusion by an announcement by the Major-domo. The dinner for the assembled guests has run longer than planned. Therefore, both performances must take place at the same time as they have been ordered and paid for. The performances must not run one minute later than scheduled, despite the late start, since at nine o'clock there will be fireworks in the garden.

At first, the impetuous young Composer refuses to discuss any changes to his opera. But his teacher, the Music Master, points out that his pay depends on accepting the situation, and counsels him to be prudent, and Zerbinetta turns the full force of her charm on him, so he drops his objections. The cast of the ''opera seria'' intrigue against each other, each demanding that his arias be not cut while the other performers' parts are cut instead. A dancing master introduces Zerbinetta into the plot, which she understands from her very own perspective, and she gets ready for the performance. The Composer realizes what he has assented to, plunges into despair and storms out.

===Opera===
[[File:Ariadne auf Naxos at Hamburgische Staatsoper 2012 - Photo No 180 by Monika Rittershaus.jpg|thumb|''Ariadne auf Naxos'' at the [[Hamburg State Opera]] 2012: the thespians attempt to cheer up Ariadne]]
[[Ariadne]] is shown abandoned by her former lover, [[Theseus]], on the desert island of [[Naxos]], with no company other than the nymphs [[Naiad]], [[Dryad]], and [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]]. Ariadne bewails her fate, mourns her lost love, and longs for death. Zerbinetta and her four companions from the burlesque group enter and attempt to cheer Ariadne by singing and dancing, but without success. In a sustained and dazzling piece of [[coloratura]] singing, Zerbinetta tells the Princess to let bygones be bygones and insists that the simplest way to get over a broken heart is to find another man. In a comic interlude, each of the clowns pursues Zerbinetta.  Eventually, she chooses Harlequin, a baritone, and the two sing a love duet together while the other clowns express frustration and envy.

The nymphs announce the arrival of a stranger on the island. Ariadne thinks it is [[Hermes]], the messenger of death, but it is the god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], who is fleeing from the sorceress [[Circe]]. At first they do not understand their mistaken identification of each other. Bacchus eventually falls in love with Ariadne, who agrees to follow him to the realm of death to search for Theseus. Bacchus promises to set her in the heavens as a constellation. Zerbinetta returns briefly to repeat her philosophy of love: when a new love arrives, one has no choice but to yield. The opera ends with a passionate duet sung by Ariadne and Bacchus.

==Instrumentation==

The instrumentation of the work is unusual, as its complement of 'double woodwind' is accompanied by significantly reduced brass and string forces on the one hand, and by a generous percussion section on the other.
* [[Woodwind instrument|Woodwind]]: 2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (alternating on [[piccolo]]s), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s (clarinet 2 doubles [[bass clarinet]] in A), 2 [[bassoon]]s
* [[Brass instrument|Brass]]: 2 [[French horn|horns]], [[trumpet]], [[trombone]]
* [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]]: [[timpani]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tambourine]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[celesta]], [[piano]]
* [[String section|Strings]]: 6 [[violin]]s, 4 [[viola]]s, 4 [[cello]]s, 2 [[double bass]]es, 2 [[harp]]s
