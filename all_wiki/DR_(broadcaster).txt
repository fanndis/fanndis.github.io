DR is a founding member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

DR is funded by a [[television licence|media licence]] which is charged to all Danish households and companies with television sets, computers, smartphones and other devices with internet access.

Today, DR operates six television channels, all of which are distributed [[free-to-air]] via a nationwide [[DVB-T]] network.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE DANISH DVB-T NETWORK|url=http://digi-tv.dk/In_English/|publisher=Digi-TV|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> DR also operates eight radio channels.

==History==
DR was founded on 1 April 1925 under the name of ''Radioordningen'', which was changed to ''Statsradiofonien'' in 1926, then to ''Danmarks Radio'' in 1959,<ref name="um-massmedia">{{cite web|title=Denmark – Culture – Mass Media |url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap4/4-13-5.asp#4-13-5 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=2009-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110120850/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap4/4-13-5.asp |archive-date=January 10, 2007 }}</ref> and to ''DR'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=DANMARKS RADIO 1925-|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/danmarks-radio-1925/|website=Danmarkshistorien.dk|publisher=Aarhus Universitet|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>

During the German [[occupation of Denmark]] in [[World War II]], radio broadcasts were censored – under particularly harsh conditions from August 1943 – leading many Danes to turn to Danish-language broadcasts from the [[BBC]] or the illegal press,<ref name="befrielsen1945">{{cite web | title=Censur | url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/stikord/censur.html | publisher=www.befrielsen1945.dk | accessdate=2009-04-30 | language=da}}</ref> as well as Swedish radio in 1944–1945.<ref name="um-massmedia" />

Statsradiofonien's second FM radio station, Program 2 (P2), was added in 1951, followed by P3 in 1963.

Experimental television broadcasts started in 1949, with regular programming beginning on 2 October 1951 with the launch of Denmark's first television channel. Daily programming began in 1954.<ref name="um-massmedia" /> Colour television test broadcasts were started in March 1967, with the first large-scale colour broadcasting occurring for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], France.<ref name="colour">[http://www.recordere.dk/indhold/templates/design.aspx?articleid=2528&zoneid=3 40 år med farve-tv fra DR]</ref> Danmarks Radio officially ended its "test" transmissions of colour television on 1 April 1970, although it wasn't until 1978 that the organisation's last black-and-white television programme (''TV Avisen''—The News) went over to colour.<ref name="colour" />

At 14.00 local time on 16 May 1983  DR launched its first [[teletext]] information service, which is still available on all DR channels.<ref>{{cite news|title=30 år på tekst-tv-tronen|url=http://www.dr.dk/om-dr/nyheder/30-aar-paa-tekst-tv-tronen|accessdate=8 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=14 May 2013}}</ref>

Danmarks Radio's monopoly on national television lasted until 1988, when [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] started broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV2, 1988-|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/tv2-1988/|publisher=Danmarkshistorien|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> 8 years later DR launched their second television channel, [[DR2]], on 30 August 1996.<ref>[https://www.dr.dk/OmDR/About+DR/20060622150803.htm ''Om DR''] (''About DR''), Danmarks Radio corporate website, Undated. Retrieved January 12, 2012.</ref> It was sometimes called ''den hemmelige kanal'' ("the secret channel") in its early years because it could not be seen nationwide at its launch.

The first trials of [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] were carried out in 1995,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kum.dk/sw1915.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419113636/http://kum.dk/sw1915.asp |archive-date=April 19, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with eight channels officially launching in October 2002.<ref name="dr2000-">{{cite web | title=DR i årene fra 2000 og frem til i dag | url=https://www.dr.dk/OmDR/Fakta+om+DR/Historie/20060504132635.htm | publisher=DR | accessdate=2009-05-02 | language=da}}</ref>

On 7 June 2007 DR launched an online-only news channel [[DR Update]].<ref>{{cite news|title=DR lancerer nyhedskanal til nettet: DR Update|url=https://www.dr.dk/presse/dr-lancerer-nyhedskanal-til-nettet-dr-update|accessdate=8 April 2017|publisher=DR|date=21 May 2007}}</ref> It was later added as a traditional channel. With the switch to over-the-air digital signals on 1 November 2009, DR added three new channels to its lineup<ref>{{cite web | title=Danish switchover completed | url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2009/11/01/danish-switch-over-completed/ | publisher=Broadband TV News | date=November 1, 2009 | accessdate=2009-11-16 }};</ref>
* [[DR K]] - an intercultural, documentary and "odd-film" channel.
* [[DR HD]] – Denmark's first [[free-to-air]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] channel intended to air successful shows from the other DR channels in true HD only, with no upscaling.
* [[DR Ramasjang]], a children's channel.

In 2013 a new logo in which the letters "DR" featured in a white [[sans-serif]] font on a black background was introduced, and the line-up of television channels was changed once again. A new channel targeting young people, [[DR3]] replaced DR HD. Another channel for children, [[DR Ultra]] replaced DR Update. The closure of DR Update was the start of a revamping of [[DR 2]] as a channel for news and society.

A nationwide switch from DAB to the newer DAB+ format took place on 1 October 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Overgangen til DAB+ udsat til 1. oktober 2017|url=http://danskemedier.dk/nyhed/overgangen-til-dab-udsat-til-1-oktober-2017/|accessdate=8 April 2017|agency=Danske Medier|date=18 May 2016}}</ref> All of DR's stations plus the privately owned, public service channel - Radio24Syv, moved to the second national DAB+ multiplex (DAB-blok 2).

== Financing ==
The principal means of funding DR is through the [[television licence|media licence]], costing 2,492 DKK per year per household since 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prisen for medielicens|url=https://www.dr.dk/om-dr/licens/prisen-medielicens|publisher=DR|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> Traditionally it was the owners of radio and television receiving sets who were obliged to pay the licence fee. The increased availability of online streaming, however, led to the replacement on 1 January 2007 of the television licence by a more widely payable "media licence". This licence is mandatory not just for those with television sets but also for all those who own a computer, smartphone, or any other device enabling access to the internet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skal jeg betale medielicens?|url=http://dr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/40|publisher=DR|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref>

In 2007 approximately 180,000 households did not pay media licence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Så mange betaler ikke licens|url=http://www.business.dk/media/saa-mange-betaler-ikke-licens|accessdate=9 April 2017|publisher=Berlingske Business|date=16 October 2007}}</ref>

Additional revenue comes from such commercial activities as the mounting of DR-organized concerts and other events in the [[Koncerthuset]], the sale of books, CDs, and DVDs, as well as overseas sales from the catalogue of DR-made programmes.

Over a period of four years starting in 2019 through 2022 the media licence will be replaced by general taxation, as announced on 16 March 2018 by a majority in the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] consisting of [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservatives]], [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]], and [[Danish People's Party]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borre|first1=Martin|title=Officielt: Regeringen afskaffer licensen og skærer 20 procent i DR|url=https://www.b.dk/politiko/officielt-regeringen-afskaffer-licensen-og-skaerer-20-procent-i-dr|accessdate=8 May 2018|agency=Berlingske|date=16 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Aftale om fokusering af DR og afskaffelse af medielicensen|url=https://www.regeringen.dk/media/5024/ny-aftale-om-fokusering-af-dr-og-afskaffelse-af-medielicensen.pdf|publisher=Regeringen|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Geographical terrestrial coverage ===
{{See also|Digital terrestrial television in Denmark}}

'''Denmark'''

All of Denmark is covered by digital terrestrial reception through a nationwide [[DVB-T]] and [[MPEG-4]] network comprising six multiplexes (MUX).  DR owns MUXes 1 and 2 in a joint-venture between DR and TV 2.  MUXes 1 and 2 broadcast all six DR channels unencrypted. Given the low topography of the Danish mainland and islands, so-called [[signal overspill]] is inevitable if every part of the country is to receive coverage. Hence, all DRs' channels are available in northernmost Germany, and [[Scania]] the southernmost part of Sweden.

'''Greenland'''

Every city in [[Greenland]] can receive DR1, DR2 and DR Ultra free-to-air via a public DVB-T network.

'''Faroe Islands'''

The company, Televarpið, a subsidiary of Faroese Telecom covers the [[Faroe Islands]] with a DVB-T network broadcasting DR1, DR2, DR3, DR Ramasjang and DR Ultra.<ref>{{cite web|title=Televarpið|url=http://tv.fo/|website=Televarpið|accessdate=9 April 2017}}</ref>

== Orchestras and Ensembles ==
* [[Danish National Symphony Orchestra]]
* [[DR Big Band]]
* [[Danish National Vocal Ensemble]]
* [[Danish National Concert Choir]]
* [[Danish National Girls Choir]]

'''Disbanded DR Orchestras'''
* [[Danish National Chamber Orchestra]]

==Rosenkjær Prize==
Since 1963, DR has awarded the Rosenkjær Prize to a person who has proven an ability to make a difficult subject accessible to a wider audience in an understandable and vivid form. The prizewinner commits to hold a number of radio lectures. The prize is named after Jens Rosenkjær (1883–1976), Head of State Broadcasting 1937–53. The prize is now DKK 50,000, up from 25,000 in 2008, and 40,000 in 2009<ref>[https://www.dr.dk/search/forside.htm?q=rosenkjaer&output=xml_no_dtd&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&getfields=*&filter=p&client=default_frontend Rosenkjaer Prize]</ref>

==Board of directors==
DR's board of directors comprises 11 members appointed for a four-year period. Three members, including the chair, are appointed by the [[Culture Minister of Denmark|Minister of Culture]], and six by Parliament, while the employees of DR elect two members. The board has overall responsibility for DR programs and for the hiring of DR's chief executive, the director general, and the remaining management positions.

Various measures to mitigate the impact on the public service obligations of the institution were contemplated by the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]], and a compromise was agreed to limit the impact of the deficit.

==Accusations of bias==
For over a decade, the [[Danish People's Party]], a [[nativism (politics)|nativist]]<ref name=collins>{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Lauren |title=Danish Postmodern Why are so many people fans of Scandinavian TV? |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/danish-postmodern |website=newyorker.com |publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] political party,<ref name="Atlantic">{{cite web|last1=Delman|first1=Edward|title=How Not to Welcome Refugees|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/denmark-refugees-immigration-law/431520/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref> has criticised DR for alleged bias in its political news coverage, citing the process for appointment to DR's board of directors. In response, DR set up a "watchdog committee" intended to detect and report upon any bias.

The first large-scale scientific content analysis of political news coverage on DR published by the [[Centre for Journalism (University of Southern Denmark)|Centre for Journalism]] at the [[University of Southern Denmark]], studying election news coverage in the years 1994–2007, documented no persistent political bias towards either the left or the right.<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> News coverage of political actors and parties was found to be largely similar to the news coverage on DR's competitor [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]]. The study concluded that political news coverage on both broadcasters was guided by journalistic professional criteria as to the newsworthiness of political actors and political issues, not by partisan considerations.

In 2008, [[Mikael Rothstein]], Jewish author and professor of [[religious history]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], was highly critical of DR when it issued a [[Christian values]] policy, declaring that Muslims would feel excluded.
