'''The Most Noble Order of the Garter''' is an [[order of chivalry]] founded by [[Edward III of England]] in 1348. It is the most senior [[order of knighthood]] in the [[British honours system]], outranked in [[order of precedence|precedence]] only by the [[Victoria Cross]] and the [[George Cross]]. The Order of the Garter is dedicated to the image and arms of [[Saint George]], England's [[patron saint]].

Appointments are made at the Sovereign's sole discretion. Membership of the Order is limited to the Sovereign, the [[Prince of Wales]], and no more than 24 living members, or Companions.  The order also includes [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] knights and ladies (e.g., members of the [[British royal family]] and foreign monarchs).

The order's emblem is a [[garter (stockings)|garter]] with the [[motto]] ''{{lang|frm|[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]}}'' ([[Middle French]]: "Shame on him who thinks evil of it") in gold lettering. Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions.

==History==
[[King Edward III]] founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his [[English claims to the French throne|claim to the French throne]].<ref name="SGC">{{cite web |url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/history/the-order-of-the-garter.html |title=College of St George – Windsor Castle – The Order of the Garter |publisher=College of St George – Windsor Castle |accessdate=4 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715135657/https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/history/the-order-of-the-garter.html |archivedate=15 July 2017  }}</ref> The traditional year of foundation is usually given as 1348 (when it was formally proclaimed). However, ''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', under "The Founders of the Order of the Garter", states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344, listing each founding member as knighted in 1344. The list includes Sir [[Sanchet D'Abrichecourt]], who died on 20 October 1345.<ref name="Complete Peerage 1887 pg 276">{{cite book |editor-last=Cokayne |editor-first=George Edward |year=1887 |title=Complete peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, extant, extinct or dormant (A to Bo) |volume=1 |edition=1st |location=London |publisher=George Bell & Sons |page=276}}</ref> Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed. The King's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348. Also, its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight (what would now be referred to as a [[knight bachelor]]) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year.<ref name="ne">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|pp=851–867}}</ref> The foundation is likely to have been inspired by the Spanish [[Order of the Band]], established in about 1330.<ref>Rogers 2018, pp. 131–34.</ref>

The earliest written mention of the Order is found in ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', a [[chivalric romance]] written in [[Valencian|Catalan]] mainly by Valencian [[Joanot Martorell]]. It was first published in 1490. This book devotes a chapter to the description of the origin of the Order of the Garter.<ref>II 85 ([http://www.visat.cat/traduccions-literatura-catalana/cat/fragments/153/29/eng/5/classics-medievals/joanot-martorell.html Joanot Martorell – trad.

===Legendary origins===
[[File:Statutes of the Order of the Garter (Alexander III of Russia).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statutes of the Order of the Garter]]
Various legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the "Countess of Salisbury", whose [[garter (stockings)|garter]] is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at [[Calais]]. When the surrounding [[courtier]]s sniggered, the king picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, "''Honi soit qui mal y pense!''" ('Shame on him who thinks ill of it!'), the phrase that has become the motto of the Order.<ref name="SGC"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=James|author-link=James Harrison (author and academic)|date=1996|chapter=The Plantagenets|title=Children's Encyclopedia of British History|edition=Rev., reformatted and updated|location=London|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Kingfisher]]|page=46|isbn=1-85696-026-9}}</ref> However, the earliest written version of this story dates from the 1460s, and it seems to have been conceived as a retrospective explanation for the adoption of what was then seen as an item of female underclothing as the symbol of a band of knights. In fact, at the time of the Order's establishment in the mid-14th century, the garter was predominantly an item of male attire.<ref>Rogers 2018, pp. 126–31.</ref>

According to another legend, [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]] was inspired in the 12th century by St George the Martyr while fighting in the [[Crusades]] to tie garters around the legs of his knights, who subsequently won the battle. King Edward supposedly recalled the event in the 14th century when he founded the Order.<ref name="ne" /> This story is recounted in a letter to the [[Annual Register]] in 1774:<ref name="ar">{{cite journal|title=On the Origin of the Order of the Garter; from the Supplement to Granger's Biographical History|journal=[[The Annual Register]]|volume=17|date=December 1774|page=145|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=ar.1774.x.x.17.x.a.145}}</ref>
{{Quotation|In Rastel's Chronicle, I. vi. under the life of Edward III is the following curious passage: "About the 19 yere {{sic}} of this kinge, he made a solempne feest at Wyndesore, and a greate justes and turnament, where he devysed, and perfyted substanegally, the order of the knyghtes of the garter; howe be it some afferme that this order began fyrst by kynge Rycharde, Cure de Lyon, at the sege of the citye of Acres; where, in his great necessyte, there were but 26 knyghtes that fyrmely and surely abode by the kynge; where he caused all them to were thonges of blew leyther about theyr legges. And afterwarde they were called the knyghtes of the blew thonge." I am obliged for this passage to John Fenn, Esq; a curious and ingenious gentleman of East-Dereham, in Norfolk, who is in possession of the most rare book whence it is taken. Hence some affirm, that the origin of the garter is to be dated from Richard I* and that it owes its pomp and splendor to Edward III.

: *Winstanley, in his ''Life of Edward III'' says that the original book of the institution deduces the invention from King Richard the First.}}
The motto in fact refers to Edward's claim to the French throne, and the Order of the Garter was created to help pursue this claim.<ref>Rogers 2018, pp. 134–38.</ref> The use of the garter as an emblem may have derived from straps used to fasten armour, and may have been chosen because it held overtones of a tight-knit "band" or "bond" of knightly "supporters" of Edward's cause.<ref name="SGC"/><ref>Rogers 2018, pp. 139–44.</ref>

There is a connection between the Order of the Garter and the Middle English poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' (late 14th century).
The motto is inscribed, as ''hony soyt qui mal pence'', at the end of the text in the sole surviving manuscript in the [[British Library]], albeit in a later hand.<ref>Cotton Nero A.x [http://contentdm.ucalgary.ca/cdm/singleitem/collection/gawain/id/356/rec/176 128v]</ref>
In the poem, a girdle, very similar in its erotic undertones to the garter, plays a prominent role. A rough equivalent of the Order's motto 
has been identified in Gawain's exclamation  ''corsed worth cowarddyse and couetyse boþe'' ("cursed be both cowardice and coveting", v. 2374).<ref name=woot>{{Cite journal |last= Friedman |first=Albert B. |year=1997 |first2=Richard H. |last2=Osberg |journal= The Journal of American Folklore |title=Gawain's Girdle as Traditional Symbol |volume=90 |issue=157 |pages=301–315 |doi= 10.2307/539521 |publisher=American Folklore Society |jstor= 539521}}</ref> 
While the author of that poem remains disputed, there seems to be a connection between two of the top candidates and the Order of the Garter, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], and [[Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand de Coucy]], seventh [[Lords of Coucy|Sire de Coucy]]. De Coucy was married to King Edward III's daughter, Isabella, and was given admittance to the Order of the Garter on their wedding day."<ref name=holler>{{Cite journal |last=Savage |first=Henry L. |year=1938 |journal=ELH |title= Sir Gawain and the Order of the Garter |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=146–149 |doi= 10.2307/2871614 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor= 2871614}}</ref>

===Ladies Companion of the Garter===
Soon after the founding of the Order, women were appointed "Ladies of the Garter", but were not made companions. [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] discontinued the practice in 1488; his mother, [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort]], was the last Lady of the Garter before [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]. Except for female sovereigns, the next Lady of the Garter named was [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], by her husband [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]. [[George V|King George V]] also made his consort, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], a Lady of the Garter and [[George VI|King George VI]] subsequently did the same for his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]. Throughout the 20th century, women continued to be associated with the Order, but save for foreign female monarchs, they were not made companions.<ref name="RH2">{{cite web |url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderoftheGarter/OrderoftheGarter.aspx |title= The Monarchy Today – Queen and Public – Honours – The Order of the Garter |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=4 June 2010 |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614210437/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderoftheGarter/OrderoftheGarter.aspx |archivedate= 14 June 2009 }}</ref> In 1987, however, it became possible to install "Ladies Companion of the Garter" under a statute of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waddington |first=Raymond B. |year=1993 |journal= Sixteenth Century Journal |title= Elizabeth I and the Order of the Garter |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=97–113 |doi= 10.2307/2541800 |publisher=The Sixteenth Century Journal |jstor= 2541800}}</ref>

===Members===
Membership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the Monarch, the [[Prince of Wales]], not more than 24 companion members, and various [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] members. The monarch alone can grant membership.<ref name="PN">{{Cite web |last=Gay |first=Oonagh |date=20 March 2006 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-02832.pdf |format=PDF |title=Honours Standard Note: SN/PC/2832 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] |accessdate=7 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016235112/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-02832.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2006}}</ref> They are known as the ''Sovereign of the Garter'', and the Prince of Wales is known as a ''Royal Knight Companion of the Garter''.<ref name="SGC2">{{cite web |url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/orders-of-chivalry.html |title=College of St George – Windsor Castle – Orders of Chivalry |publisher=College of St George – Windsor Castle |accessdate=4 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219220802/http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/orders-of-chivalry.html |archivedate=19 February 2010  }}</ref>

Male members of the Order are titled "Knights Companion" and female members are called "Ladies Companion". Formerly, the Sovereign filled vacancies upon the nomination of the members. Each member would nominate nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of [[earl]] or higher, three the rank of [[baron]] or higher, and three the rank of [[knight]] or higher. The Sovereign would choose as many nominees as were necessary to fill any vacancies in the Order. They were not obliged to choose those who received the most nominations. Candidates were last nominated in 1860, and appointments have since been made by the Sovereign acting alone, with no prior nominations. The statutes prescribing the former procedure were not amended, however, until 1953.<ref name="begent-chesshyre">{{Cite book |last=Begent |first=P.J. |year=1999 |last2=Chesshyre |first2=H. |title=The Most Noble Order of the Garter: 650 Years |publisher=Spink and Son |location=London |isbn=1-902040-20-1}}</ref>{{rp|198}}

From the 18th century, the Sovereign made their choices on the advice of the Government. In 1946, with the agreement of Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] and Leader of the Opposition [[Winston Churchill]], membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the [[Order of the Thistle]] and the dormant [[Order of St. Patrick]]) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again.<ref name="RH2"/> Thus, the Sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit the advice of the Government.<ref name="SC">{{Cite web |date=13 July 2004 |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/212/21204.htm |title=Select Committee on Public Administration Fifth Report |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=8 November 2006}}</ref> Appointments are announced on [[Saint George's Day]] (23 April).<ref name="RH2"/>

===Supernumerary members===
[[File:Emperor Taisho the Order of the Garter.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Emperor Taishō]] in the robes of the Order of the Garter, as a consequence of the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]]]
In addition, the Order includes [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] members, who do not count towards the limit of 24 companions. Several supernumerary members, known as "Royal Knights and Ladies of the Garter", belong to the [[British Royal Family|royal family]]. These titles were introduced in 1786 by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] so that his many sons would not count towards the limit on the number of companions. He created the statute of supernumerary members in 1805 so that any descendant of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] could be installed as such a member. In 1831, this statute was extended again to include all descendants of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]].<ref name="ne" />

With the installation of [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] of [[Russia]] in 1813, supernumerary membership was extended to foreign monarchs, who are known as "Stranger Knights and Ladies of the Garter".<ref name="RH4">{{Cite web |date=June 2004 |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page3210.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222251/http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page3210.asp |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Royal Insight: June 2004: Focus: The Order of the Garter |publisher=The Royal Household}}</ref> Each such installation originally required the enactment of a statute; however, a 1954 statute authorises the regular admission of Stranger Knights or Ladies without further special enactments.<ref name="RH4"/>

===Degradation of members===
{{see also|List of Degraded Extra Knights Companion of the Garter}}
[[File:Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle|Henry Pelham-Clinton KG, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Portrait by [[William Hoare]] in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]
The Sovereign may "degrade" members who have taken up arms against the Sovereign. From the late 15th century, there was a formal ceremony of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied by the rest of the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the [[Garter King of Arms]] read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]]. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|James, Duke of Ormonde]] in 1716.<ref>Peter J Begent, ''The Most Noble Order of the Garter, its History and Ceremonial''</ref>

During the First World War, two Royal Knights and six Stranger Knights, all monarchs or princes of enemy nations and including [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], and [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria]], were struck off the roll of the Order or had their appointments annulled in 1915.<ref name="RH4" /> The banner of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] was removed from the chapel after Italy entered World War II against the United Kingdom and her Allies.<ref>David Kemp "[https://books.google.com/books?id=8jYdEyVnQn4C&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=Victor+Emmanuel+III+of+Italy+Order+of+the+Garter&source=bl&ots=esuI7OIwwH&sig=YUHjRhlvcAc6cl1rdRlGsn7p2nQ&hl=ja&sa=X&ei=A21KVOLnBdTr8AWan4KgCQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy%20Order%20of%20the%20Garter&f=false The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain: A Discerning Traveller's Companion]" p.141</ref> The banner of Emperor [[Hirohito]] of Japan was removed from St George's Chapel when Japan entered World War II in 1941, but that banner and his knighthood were restored by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1971, when Hirohito made a [[state visit]] to the United Kingdom. The Emperor was particularly pleased by the restoration of his banner as a Knight of the Garter.<ref>Kingston, Jeff.

[[William of Edington]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], was the first [[Prelate]] of the Order, and that office has since been held by his successors at Winchester, traditionally a senior bishopric of the [[Church of England]].<ref name="begent-chesshyre"/>{{rp|105}}

The office of Chancellor is now held by one of the companions of the order. For most of its existence, the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] has held the office, although [[laymen]] held it from 1553 to 1671. In 1837, after boundary changes made [[Windsor Castle]] fall in the [[diocese]] of Oxford, the Chancellorship was transferred to the [[Bishop of Oxford]]. A century later, the Bishop of Salisbury challenged this transfer, on the grounds that the Chancellorship had been attached to his office regardless of the diocese in which the chapel of the order lay; and that, in any event, [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]], as a [[Royal Peculiar]], was not under diocesan jurisdiction. The office of Chancellor was removed from the Bishop of Oxford (the outgoing bishop, [[Thomas Strong (bishop)|Thomas Strong]], had been outspoken in the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis of Edward VIII]]), and so it was withheld from his successor, [[Kenneth Kirk]], and has since been held by one of the Knights Companion.<ref name="begent-chesshyre"/>{{rp|109–112}}

==Military Knights of Windsor==
{{Main|Military Knights of Windsor}}
[[File:Military Knights of Windsor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Military Knights of Windsor]] in the procession to the Garter Service]]
At the founding of the Order of the Garter, 26 "poor knights" were appointed and attached to the Order and its chapel. This number was not always maintained, and by the 17th century, there were only thirteen such knights. [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] increased the number to 18 (in large part because of funds allocated from Sir Francis Crane's will) after his coronation in 1660. After the knights objected to being termed "poor", [[King William IV]] redesignated them in the 19th century as the [[Military Knights of Windsor]].<ref name="SGC3">{{cite web |url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/whos-who/military-knights.html |title=College of St George – Windsor Castle – Military Knights |publisher=College of St George – Windsor Castle |accessdate=4 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510013842/http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/whos-who/military-knights.html |archivedate=10 May 2010  }}</ref>

The poor knights were impoverished military veterans, required to pray daily for the Knights Companion. In return, they received a salary and lodging in Windsor Castle. The knights are no longer necessarily poor, but are still military pensioners. They participate in the Order's processions, escorting the members, and in the chapel services. However, they are not considered members of the Order.<ref name="SGC3" />

The poor knights originally wore red [[mantle (clothing)|mantles]], each of which bore St George's Cross, but did not depict the Garter. [[Queen Elizabeth I]] replaced the mantles in the 16th and 17th centuries with blue and purple gowns, but the red mantles returned in the 17th century under [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. When the knights were renamed, the mantles were abandoned. The military knights now wear the old military uniform of an "army officer on the unattached list": black trousers with red stripe, a red [[double-breasted]] [[Tailcoat|swallow-tailed coat]], gold [[epaulet]]s and brushes, a [[cocked hat]] with a [[hackle|plume]], and a sword on a white baldric.<ref name="HN" />

====Order's ceremonial occasions====
[[File:Order of the Garter of Franz Joseph I of Austria.jpg|thumb|The garter of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]]]]

For the Order's ceremonial occasions, such as the annual Garter Day, the members wear elaborate [[vestment]]s and accoutrements, which include:

*The ''mantle'' is a vestment or robe worn by members since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century it was made of [[velvet]]. The mantle was originally purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, pale blue, royal blue, dark blue, violet, and [[ultramarine]]. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white [[taffeta]]. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldic shield]] of [[St. George's Cross]] encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and [[surcoat]], which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.<ref name="HN">{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=Noel |year=1999 |journal=Heraldry News, the Journal of Heraldry |title=The ceremonial dress and accoutrements of the Most Noble Order of the Garter |issue=22 |pages=6–12 |publisher=Journal of Heraldry Australia Inc. |url=http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Garter_Dress.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030420201952/http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Garter_Dress.htm |archivedate=20 April 2003}}</ref>
*The ''hat'' is a [[Tudor bonnet]] of black velvet with a plume of white ostrich and black heron feathers.<ref name="HN" />
[[File:Hosenbandorden.jpg|thumb|right|The insignia of a knight of the Order of the Garter]]
*The ''[[Livery collar|collar]]'' is worn around the neck, over the mantle and is secured with white ribbons tied in bows on the shoulders. Like the mantle, it was introduced in the 15th and 16th centuries. Made of pure gold, it weighs 30 [[troy ounce]]s (0.933&nbsp;kg). The collar is composed of gold [[heraldic knot]]s alternating with enamelled medallions, each showing a rose encircled by the Garter. During the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (1485–1509), commencing at the termination of the [[Wars of the Roses]], each garter surrounded two roses – one red for the [[House of Lancaster]] and one white for the [[House of York]] – but he changed the design to encircle the Tudor rose<ref name="HN" /> alone, a combination of both forms.<ref>See for example the single roses on the collar of the effigy of [[Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke]], KG (died 1502) in Callington Church, Cornwall (see image [[:File:RobertWilloughbyCallington.jpg]])</ref> Today one of the most visible representations of the collar forms part of the monarch's [[heraldic achievement]] on the gates of [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>See image[[:File:Buckingham Palace - 02.jpg]]</ref> 
*The ''Great George'', which is worn suspended from the collar, is a colourfully enamelled (sometimes jewelled) three-dimensional figure of [[Saint George|St. George the Martyr]] on horseback slaying a dragon.<ref name="HN" />
*The ''[[Garter (clothing)|Garter]]'' is worn on ceremonial occasions around the left calf<ref>The Garter is worn over and above the left strap of the dress breeches of men but nowadays it is anachronistically worn over the trousers because the wearing of court dress for by most Garter Knights has fallen into disuse.</ref> by knights and around the left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a buckled dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels.<ref name="HN" /> Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the buckled and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.

Up until the middle part of the 20th century, it was customary to wear [[Tudor period|Tudor style]] under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a lounge suit is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.<ref>Una Campbell (1989), ''Robes of the Realm: 300 Years of Ceremonial Dress''. Michael O'Mara Books. p.21.</ref>

====Other occasions====
[[File:GarterInsigniaBurkes.JPG|thumb|upright|Top: A Garter "Star"; middle: A "Great George" (St George on horseback slaying the dragon) pendant from the Collar; bottom: the Garter]]
[[File:Karl XIs ordensstjärna för riddare av Strumpebandsorden, 1668 - Livrustkammaren - 108770.tif|thumb|upright|The Garter "Star" worn by king Charles XI of Sweden, late 17th century.]]
On other occasions when decorations are worn, the members wear simpler insignia:
[[File:William in uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] wearing Garter Riband and Star]]
*The '''collar''' is worn on designated [[collar day]]s over military uniform or [[morning dress]] by members attending formal events. The collar is fastened to the shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since the collar signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong.<ref name="HN" />
*The '''star''', which is worn pinned to the left breast, was introduced in the 17th century by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and is a colourfully enamelled depiction of the heraldic shield of St. George's Cross, encircled by the Garter, which is itself encircled by an eight-point silver badge. Each point is depicted as a cluster of rays, with the four points of the cardinal directions longer than the intermediate ones. The stars of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Since the Order of the Garter is the senior order of the United Kingdom, a member will wear its star above the others (up to three) that they hold.<ref name="HN" /> There are examples in the Royal Collection of the stars of foreign orders given George V surrounded with the Garter, e.g. the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle given to George V when Prince of Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/441498/order-of-the-black-eagle-prussia-george-vs-star-with-garter|title=- Order of the Black Eagle (Prussia). George Vs star with garter|website=www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>
*The '''riband''' is a four-inch (10.16&nbsp;cm)-wide [[sash]] worn over the left shoulder, or pinned beneath it, to the right hip, and was introduced in the 17th century by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The riband's colour has varied over the years: it was originally light blue, but was a dark shade under the Hanoverian monarchs. In 1950, the colour was fixed as "kingfisher blue". A member will wear only one riband, even if they belong to several orders.<ref name="HN" />
*The '''badge''' is worn suspended from a small gold link from the riband at the right hip, and is sometimes known as "[[Saint George|the Lesser George]]". Like the Great George, the badge shows St. George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon, but it is flatter and gold. In earlier times, the badge was worn from a ribbon tied around the neck.<ref name="HN" />

On the death of a member, the Lesser George and breast star are returned personally to the Sovereign by the former member's nearest male relative, and the other insignia to the [[Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood]], save the riband, mantle and hat.<ref name="HN" />

===Officers===
For ceremonial occasions of the Order, the officers wear the following garments and accessories:

*The mantles for the prelate and chancellor are dark blue like those of the members (as a member, the chancellor wears a member's mantle), but the mantles for the other officers are dark red. All mantles are embroidered with a heraldic shield of St George's Cross. For Garter ceremonies, [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] wears this red mantle rather than the [[tabard]] of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms]] worn for other State ceremonial occasions.<ref name="HN" />
*Officers wear badges of office suspended from a chain worn around the neck. The badge for the prelate shows the Lesser George encircled by the Garter, which is surmounted by a bishop's [[mitre]]. The badge for the chancellor is a rose encircled by the Garter. The badge for the register is two crossed quills over a book encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown. The badge for Garter Principal King of Arms is the royal arms impaled with St George's Cross encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the usher is a knot (like those on the collars of the companions of the order) encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the secretary shows two crossed quills in front of a rose and encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown.<ref name="HN" />

The chancellor carries a purse, which is embroidered with the royal arms impaled by the Cross of St. George. The purse contains the seal of the Order. Garter Principal King of Arms carries his baton of office. The usher carries their staff of office, the [[Black Rod]].<ref name="HN" />

==Chapel==
[[File:Castell de Windsor - Capella de Sant Jordi.JPG|thumb|Banners in St. George's Chapel of members of the Order of the Garter]]
[[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] is the [[mother church]] of the Order of the Garter and the location of special services in relation to the Order.<ref name="RH2"/>

During their lifetime, all members of the Order of the Garter are entitled to display their heraldic crests and banners in St. George's Chapel. While the Garter stall plates (see below) stay in the chapel permanently, the crests and banners of deceased knights are, following presentation at the High Altar, removed from the chapel. Sometimes they are then given to institutions that were connected with the late knight, or kept privately depending on family wishes.<ref>

</ref> Originally after a knight's death, the crests became the property of Garter King of Arms, and these crests have been the subject of occasional exhibitions in the Earl Marshal's Court at the [[College of Arms]].

[[Garter stall plate]]s are small enamelled and engraved brass plates located in St George's Chapel as memorials to Knights of the Garter.<ref name="RH2"/>

==Investiture and installation==
[[File:Order of the Garter investiture of King Haakon VII of Norway, by Sydney Prior Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Edward VII]] invests [[Haakon VII of Norway]] with the insignia of the Order of the Garter in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle, November 1906. Painting by [[Sydney Prior Hall]].]]

Each June, on Garter Day, the members of the Order, wearing their habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an investiture ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day.<ref name="RH2"/> This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their spouses. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.<ref>''Encyclopaedia Heraldica Or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry'', Volume 1, William Berry, Google eBook</ref><ref>[https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ResearchGuide1-The-Order-of-the-Garter.pdf Research guides No.1: The Order of the Garter, "Oath"], St George's Chapel Archives and Chapter Library</ref>

At the investiture ceremony, two senior knights of the order assist the Sovereign by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar.<ref>''The British Herald, or Cabinet of armorial bearings of the nobility and gentry of Great Britain & Ireland'', Thomas Robson, Google eBook, 1830 p. 96.</ref> After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.<ref>''The Queen's Orders of Chivalry'', Brigadier Sir Ivan De la Bere, Spring Books, London, 1964, p. 85.</ref>

While knights continued to be invested with their ensigns, the formal installation of knights at St George's Chapel ceased in 1805. Installation, along with the annual Garter service, returned in 1948;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/history/the-order-of-the-garter/garter-banner-list.html |title=Garter Banner List |accessdate=23 April 2019|publisher=Dean & Canons of Windsor}}</ref> on the occasion of the order's 600th anniversary.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/assets/files/Companion/Companion21-web.pdf |title=Order of the Garter Timeline|journal=The Companion: The magazine for the College of St George | issue=21 | page=3 | date= 2015 |accessdate=10 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922113457/http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/assets/files/Companion/Companion21-web.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015  }}</ref>
