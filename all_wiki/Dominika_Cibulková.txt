==Playing style==
In 2014, Steve Tignor of ''[[Tennis.com]]'' called Cibulková "a threat to everyone".<ref name=tc>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Tignor |title=Little Goes a Long Way |work=tennis.com |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=19 April 2014 |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/01/little-goes-long-way/50381/}}</ref> In describing her style, he later suggested that "any player, from top pros to rank amateurs, can learn a thing or two from how Cibulková approaches the game," citing aggression, enthusiasm, and a quick pace between points.<ref name=tctwo>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Tignor |title=The Tao of Domi: What Every Player Can Learn From Dominika Cibulkova |work=tennis.com |date=27 October 2016 |accessdate=28 October 2016 |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2016/10/dominika-cibulkova-wta-tennis-singapore-wta-finals/62108/}}</ref>

Self-described as a player with "a lot of energy",<ref name=Profile/> Cibulková employed an aggressive style that was largely founded on speed and power.<ref name=Gear>{{cite news |first=Justin |last=diFeliciantonio |title=Gear Talk: Q&A with Dominika Cibulkova |work=tennis.com |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |url=http://www.tennis.com/gear/2011/03/gear-talk-qa-dominika-cibulkova/38726/}}</ref> She was known for her remarkable racquet-head speed,<ref name=tc/> which enabled her to produce deep groundstrokes with her forehand and powerful shots with her backhand. She was also known for approaching the net and finishing points with swing volleys.<ref name=tc/><ref name=LC>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=John |title=Dominika Cibulkova wins La Costa tennis title |work=latimes.com |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/23/sports/la-sp-mercury-tennis-20120723}}</ref> Her aggressive shots have been noted for their ability to force errors or produce winners during extended rallies.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ajay |last=Tyagi |title=LIVE Victoria Azarenka vs Dominika Cibulkova French Open 2012 R16 |work=tennisearth.com |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |url=http://www.tennisearth.com/news/tennisNews/LIVE-Victoria-Azarenka-vs-Dominika-Cibulkova-French-Open-2012-R16-902481.htm.}}</ref>

When a point ended, Cibulková "refocused right away," using the pace to pressure opponents or avoid negativity.<ref name=tctwo/> She typically employed a high ball toss and a hard serve.<ref name=tctwo/>

On defense, she often attacked second serves with quick forehands, and hit prompt returns while taking the ball on the rise. Occasionally, she did break a prolonged rally by mixing in a drop shot. Her lower-body strength created quickness around the court, enabling her to reach and return shots.<ref name=tc/><ref name=Gear/>
