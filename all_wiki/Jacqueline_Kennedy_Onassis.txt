The marriage of Bouvier's parents was strained by her father's [[alcoholism]] and [[extramarital affair]]s; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref name=NYTobituary/><ref>Flaherty, Ch. 1, "School Days"; Pottker, p. 99; Leaming, p. 7</ref> They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split.<ref>Leaming (2001), p. 5; Flaherty, Ch. 1, "School Days"</ref> According to her cousin [[John H. Davis (author)|John H. Davis]], Bouvier was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."<ref name=NYTobituary/> When her mother married [[Standard Oil]] heir [[Hugh D. Auchincloss|Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr.]], Bouvier and her sister did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to [[World War II]].<ref name="Tracy17"/> Bouvier gained three step-siblings from Auchincloss' two previous marriages, Hugh "Yusha" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and [[Nina Gore Auchincloss]]; she formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants.<ref name=Tracy17>Tracy, p. 17</ref> The marriage later produced two more children, [[Janet Auchincloss Rutherfurd|Janet Jennings Auchincloss]] in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

After the remarriage, Auchincloss' [[Merrywood]] estate in [[McLean, Virginia]], became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, [[Hammersmith Farm]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island.<ref name=NYTobituary/><ref>Pottker, p. 114</ref> Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure.<ref name=NYTobituary/> He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise.<ref>Pottker, p. 8</ref> While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.<ref>Pottker, pp. 100–101</ref>

After seven years at Chapin, Bouvier attended the [[Holton-Arms School]] in Northwest [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1942 to 1944, and [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]], from 1944 to 1947.<ref name=Pottker7>Pottker, p. 7</ref> She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes.<ref>Spoto, p. 57</ref> In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for "her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife".

=== College and early career ===
In the fall of 1947, Bouvier entered [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], at that time a women's institution.<ref>Pottker, pp. 113–114</ref> She had wanted to attend [[Sarah Lawrence College]], closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more isolated Vassar.<ref>Pottker, pp. 113–114; Leaming, pp. 10–11</ref> Bouvier was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper.<ref name=NYTobituary/><ref name=Spoto67>Spoto, pp. 67–68</ref> Due to her dislike of Vassar's location in Poughkeepsie, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan for the weekends.<ref>Pottker, p. 116; Leaming, pp. 14–15</ref> She had made her debut to [[High society (group)|high society]] in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions.

While attending George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide.<ref name=prixdeparis>Leaming (2014), pp. 19–21</ref> The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris.<ref name=prixdeparis/> Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer.<ref name=prixdeparis/> The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, ''One Special Summer'', co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings.<ref>{{cite book|title=One Special Summer|location=New York City|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|year=1974 | isbn = 978-0-440-06037-6 |last1=Onassis |first1=Jacqueline Kennedy |last2=Radziwill |first2=Lee Bouvier |author-link2=Lee Radziwill}}</ref> On her first day at ''Vogue'', the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer [[Barbara Leaming]], the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. Bouvier followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.<ref name="prixdeparis"/>

Bouvier moved back to Merrywood and was referred by a family friend to the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]'', where editor Frank Waldrop hired her as a part-time receptionist.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spoto |first1=Donald |title=Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life |date=2000 |publisher=Macmillan |via=Google Books |isbn=978-0312246501 |pages=88–89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_dm1DTx6SMC&q=Frank+Waldrop+Bouvier&pg=PA89}}</ref> A week later she requested more challenging work, and Waldrop sent her to city editor Sidney Epstein, who hired her as an "Inquiring Camera Girl" despite her inexperience, paying her $25 a week.<ref>Tracy, pp. 72–73</ref> He recalled, "I remember her as this very attractive, cute-as-hell girl, and all the guys in the newsroom giving her a good look."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernstein |first1=Adam |title=Washington Star Editor Sidney Epstein Dies |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/09/18/washington-star-editor-sidney-epstein-dies/6f06a76f-c654-4d31-97a3-c3aef657360b/ |website=The Washington Post |access-date=February 21, 2020 |date=September 18, 2002}}</ref> The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses.<ref name=NYTobituary/> In addition to the random "[[man on the street]]" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old [[Tricia Nixon]]. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father [[Richard Nixon]] was elected to the vice presidency in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]].<ref>Beasley, p. 79; Adler, pp. 20–21</ref> During this time, Bouvier was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named [[John G. W. Husted, Jr.|John Husted]]. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 1952.<ref>Leaming (2014), p. 25</ref> After three months, Bouvier called off the engagement because she had found him "immature and boring" once she got to know him better.<ref name=Spoto89>Spoto, pp. 89–91</ref><ref>Tracy, p. 70</ref>

Jacqueline gave birth to daughter [[Caroline Kennedy|Caroline]] on November 27, 1957.<ref name="Reference1A" /> At the time, she and John were campaigning for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.<ref>Leaming (2014), p. 90</ref>{{efn|At first she had opposed the magazine's offer of the cover, not wanting the baby to be used to benefit her husband's political career, but changed her mind in exchange for a promise from her father-in-law that Jack would stop campaigning during the summer to go to Paris with her.<ref>Heymann, p. 61</ref>}}{{which|date=July 2018}} They traveled together during the campaign, trying to narrow the geographical gap between them that had persisted for the first five years of the marriage. Soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value that his wife added to his congressional campaign. [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] remembered that "the size of the crowd was twice as big" when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as "always cheerful and obliging". John's mother Rose observed Jacqueline as not being "a natural-born campaigner" due to her shyness and being uncomfortable with too much attention.<ref>Spoto, pp. 142–144</ref> In November 1958, John Kennedy was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline's visibility in both ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory, and he called her "simply invaluable".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iagreetosee.com/portfolio/jackie-kennedys-campaign-ad-appearance-1960-presidential-election/ |title=Jackie Kennedy's Campaign Ad Appearance, before the 1960 Presidential Election|publisher=iagreetosee.com}}</ref><ref>Hunt and Batcher, p. 167</ref>

In July 1959, historian [[Arthur M.

=== Campaign for presidency ===
[[File:Jfk-appleton.jpg|thumb|left|Jacqueline with her husband as he campaigns for the presidency in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], March 1960]]
On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy was a United States Senator from Massachusetts when he announced his candidacy for the presidency and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners.<ref>Spoto, p. 152</ref> Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. Due to her previous high-risk pregnancies, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown.<ref>Beasley, p. 72</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Molly Meijer|last=Wertheime|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|year=2004}}</ref> Jacqueline subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, ''Campaign Wife'', answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.<ref name=jfklibrary/>

Despite her non-participation in the campaign, Jacqueline became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|last1=Mulvagh|first1=Jane|work=The Independent|date=May 20, 1994|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-1437396.html}}</ref> On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women in the world.<ref name=Beasleyfashion>Beasley, pp. 72–76</ref> On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press.<ref name=Beasleyfashion/> In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.<ref name=Beasleyfashion/>

On July 13 at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles, the party nominated John F. Kennedy for President of the United States. Jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier.<ref name=Spoto155>Spoto, pp. 155–157</ref> She was in Hyannis Port when she watched the September 26, 1960 debate—which was the nation's first televised presidential debate—between her husband and Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]], who was the incumbent vice president. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches.<ref>Schlesinger, p. 69</ref> On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on ''[[Person to Person]]'', interviewed by [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]].<ref name=Spoto155/>

On November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]].<ref name=jfklibrary/> A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline gave birth to the couple's first son, [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]]<ref name=jfklibrary/> She spent two weeks recuperating in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son's conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the Kennedy family.<ref>Spoto, p. 164</ref>

Her husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961.<ref name=jfklibrary/> As a presidential couple, the Kennedys differed from the Eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. Historian [[Gil Troy]] has noted that in particular, they "emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments" and therefore fit in well in the early 1960s' "cool, TV-oriented culture".<ref name="Beasley, p. 76">Beasley, p. 76</ref> The discussion about Jacqueline's fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer [[Oleg Cassini]] to design her wardrobe.<ref>Beasley, pp. 73– 74</ref> She was the first presidential wife to hire a [[press secretary]], [[Pamela Turnure]], and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed.<ref name="firstladies1">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/facinatingfacts.aspx |title=Little-known facts about our First Ladies |publisher=Firstladies.org |access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref><ref name=bimage>Beasley, pp. 78–83</ref> The media portrayed Kennedy as the ideal woman, which led academic Maurine Beasley to observe that she "created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors".<ref name=bimage/> Nevertheless, the First Lady attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its [[Cold War]] policies.<ref>Schwalbe, pp. 111–127</ref>

Although Jacqueline stated that her priority as a First Lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Jacqueline-Kennedy-in-the-White-House.aspx|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|publisher= The John F.

[[File:Charles Collingwood murrow27s boys.jpg|thumb|left|Kennedy with [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] during [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy|their televised tour]] of the restored [[White House]] in 1962]]

Jacqueline had visited the White House on two occasions before she became First Lady: the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of outgoing First Lady [[Mamie Eisenhower]] shortly before her husband's inauguration.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> and made it her first major project as First Lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator [[Sister Parish]]. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert [[Henry Francis du Pont|Henry du Pont]].<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> Working with [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]], Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] and the East Garden, which was renamed the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]] after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in [[President's Park|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history.<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/>

Prior to Kennedy's years as First Lady, presidents and their families had taken furnishings and other items from the White House when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. She personally wrote to possible donors in order to track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428919/Jacqueline-Kennedy-Onassis|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=August 10, 2012}}</ref> Kennedy initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own. She also founded the [[White House Historical Association]], the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]], the position of a permanent [[Curator of the White House]], the [[White House Endowment Trust]], and the [[White House Acquisition Trust]].<ref name="DesigningCamelot" /> She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator.<ref name="firstladies1"/>

On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline, accompanied by Charles Collingwood of [[CBS News]], took American television viewers [[A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy|on a tour of the White House]]. In the tour, she stated that "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best."<ref name="DesigningCamelot">{{cite book|author1=Abbott, James |author2=Rice, Elaine |title=Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration|publisher= Thomson |year=1997 | isbn = 978-0-442-02532-8 }}</ref> The film was watched by 56&nbsp;million television viewers in the United States,<ref name=jfklibrarytwo/> and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] Trustees Award for it at the [[Emmy Awards]] in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by [[Lady Bird Johnson]]. Kennedy was the only First Lady to win an Emmy.<ref name="firstladies1"/>

Throughout her husband's presidency and more than any of the preceding First Ladies, Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President.<ref name="FirstLadies"/> Despite the initial worry that she might not have "political appeal", she proved popular among international dignitaries.<ref name="Beasley, p. 76"/> Before the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn.

At the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962. The tour was amply documented in photojournalism as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. The President of Pakistan, [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]], had given her a horse named Sardar as a gift.

In early 1963, Jacqueline was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties.

On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]], via emergency Caesarean section at nearby [[Otis Air Force Base]]. The infant's lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to [[Boston Children's Hospital]], where he died of [[hyaline membrane disease]] two days after birth.<ref>{{cite book | author = Beschloss, Michael. | title = Historical Conversations on Life with John F.

On November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President embarked on a political trip to Texas with several goals in mind; this was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S.<ref>Leaming (2014), p. 123</ref> After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on [[VC-137C SAM 26000|Air Force One]] from Fort Worth's [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|Carswell Air Force Base]] to Dallas' [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]], accompanied by Texas Governor [[John Connally]] and his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]].<ref name="Bugliosi">Bugliosi, pp. 30, 34</ref> The First Lady was wearing a [[Kennedy pink Chanel suit|bright pink Chanel suit]] and a [[pillbox hat]],<ref name="Craughwell-Varda1999" /><ref name="FordMitchell2004" /> which had been personally selected by President Kennedy.<ref>Alam, p. 36</ref> A {{convert|9.5|mi|km|adj=on}} [[motorcade]] was to take them to the [[Dallas Market Center|Trade Mart]], where the president was scheduled to speak at a lunch.

On November 29, 1963—a week after her husband's assassination—Jacqueline was interviewed in [[Hyannis Port]] by [[Theodore H.

Kennedy and her children remained in the White House for two weeks following the assassination.<ref name="nyt12071963">{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/12/07/89986491.pdf|title=Mrs. Kennedy is in new home; declines 3-acre Arlington plot|last=Hunter|first=Marjorie|date=December 7, 1963|work=The New York Times|pages=1, 13|access-date=April 13, 2015|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Wanting to "do something nice for Jackie," President Johnson offered an [[U.S. Ambassador to France|ambassadorship to France]] to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country's culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow-up offers of ambassadorships to [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain|United Kingdom]]. At her request, Johnson renamed the [[Florida]] space center the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] a week after the assassination. Kennedy later publicly praised Johnson for his kindness to her.<ref>Andersen, pp. 55–56</ref>

Despite having commissioned [[William Manchester|William Manchester's]] authorized account of President Kennedy's death, ''[[The Death of a President]]'', Jacqueline was subject to significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block the publication.<ref>Mills, p. 363</ref><ref>Schlesinger, Vol 2., p. 762</ref><ref>White, pp. 98–99</ref> They sued publishers [[Harper & Row]] in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy's private life.

=== Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy ===
After her husband's assassination, Jacqueline relied heavily on her brother-in-law [[Robert F. Kennedy]]; she observed him to be the "least like his father" of the Kennedy brothers.<ref>Thomas, p. 91</ref> He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital.<ref>Hersh, p. 85</ref> In the aftermath of the assassination, Bobby became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as Attorney General required him to reduce attention.<ref name=Spoto239>Spoto, pp. 239–240</ref> He credited Jackie with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States Senator from New York.<ref>Tracy, p. 194</ref>

The January 1968 [[Tet offensive]] in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When [[Art Buchwald]] asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, "That depends on what Jackie wants me to do".<ref name="FlyntEisenbach"/><ref>Heymann, p. 141</ref> She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him to not follow Jack, but to "be yourself". Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was "so much hatred" in the United States.<ref>Thomas, p. 361</ref> She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was "fatalistic" like her.<ref name=FlyntEisenbach>Flynt and Eisenbach, p. 216</ref> Despite her concerns, Jacqueline campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him,<ref>Ford, p. 273</ref> and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.<ref name=FlyntEisenbach/>

=== Marriage to Aristotle Onassis ===
After Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Jacqueline reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior.<ref>Pottker, p. 257</ref> She came to fear for her life and those of her two children, saying: "If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country".<ref name="jfkjr">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/us/john-f-kennedy-jr-heir-to-a-formidable-dynasty.html|title=John F.

On October 20, 1968, Kennedy married her long-time friend [[Aristotle Onassis]], a wealthy Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children.<ref name="jfkjr" /> The wedding took place on [[Skorpios]], Onassis' private Greek island in the [[Ionian Sea]].<ref>Spoto, p. 266</ref> After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife [[Tina Onassis Niarchos|Athina Livanos]] was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by [[Archbishop of Boston|Boston's Archbishop]], Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]] as "nonsense".<ref>{{cite news|title=Cardinal Claims Excommunication Idea 'Nonsense,' in Talk about Jackie Kennedy |date=October 23, 1968 |work=The Southeast Missourian |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19681023&id=MM5QAAAAIBAJ&pg=4712,2143422 |via=Google News}}</ref> She was condemned by some as a "public sinner",<ref>{{cite web|title=Roman Catholics: The Cardinal and Jackie| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839610,00.html| work=Time|access-date=May 12, 2014|date=November 1, 1968}}</ref> and became the target of [[paparazzi]] who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her "Jackie O".<ref>Tracy, p. 211</ref>

In 1968, billionaire heiress [[Doris Duke]], whom Onassis was friends with, appointed her as the vice president of the [[Newport Restoration Foundation]]. Onassis publicly championed the foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Colacello|first=Bob|date=March 1994|title=Doris Duke's Final Mystery|url=https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/share/8e9a9c8a-592e-413c-b470-46346122c32a|access-date=2020-09-05|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Duke, Doris {{!}} Learning to Give|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/duke-doris|access-date=2020-09-05|website=Learning to Give}}</ref>

During their marriage, the couple inhabited six different residences: her 15-room [[1040 Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue apartment]] in Manhattan, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht ''[[Christina O]]''. Kennedy ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often.<ref>Heymann, p. 90</ref>{{which|date=July 2018}} She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.<ref>Hersh, p. 512</ref>

Aristotle Onassis' health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]] in a plane crash in 1973.<ref>Spoto, p. 282</ref> He died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $26&nbsp;million from [[Christina Onassis]]—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir—and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.<ref>Tracy, p. 232</ref>

After the death of her second husband, Onassis returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, [[Martha's Vineyard]], and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at [[Viking Press]], a position that she held for two years.{{efn|Prior to her publishing employment, she had gained experience by being involved with several posthumous biographies of President Kennedy. The first of these was ''John F. Kennedy, President,'' by [[Hugh Sidey]], which was published the year after his death in 1964. Simon Michael Bessie, Sidey's editor at Atheneum, recalled her as having read galleys and submitted detailed notes on them. Despite this recollection, Sidey did not acknowledge her contribution in the book. The following year, she helped [[Ted Sorensen]] with his book ''Kennedy''. Sorensen told Greg Lawrence that after finishing the "first draft" of his "first big book", he gave Onassis the manuscript since he thought she would be helpful, and Onassis provided him with several comments on the book. Sorensen lauded her assistance in his memoir ''Counselor'', as he wrote that she had "proved to be a superb editor, correcting typographical errors, challenging mistaken assumptions, defending some of her husband's personnel decisions, suggesting useful clarifications, and repeatedly setting the record straight on matters not known to me".<ref>Lawrence, pp. 13–14</ref>}}

After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, Onassis attended the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]] and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery.<ref>Sabato, p. 324</ref><ref>Reeves, pp. 124–127</ref> She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 after [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] of ''The New York Times'' stated that Onassis held some responsibility for Viking's publication of the [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]'', set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and describing an assassination plot against him.<ref name="carmody19771015">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/15/archives/mrs-onassis-resigns-editing-post-mrs-onassis-resigns-editing-post.html |title=Mrs. Onassis Resigns Editing Post |last=Carmody |first=Deirdre |date=October 15, 1977 |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 28, 2019 |page=1 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>Silverman, pp. 71–72</ref> Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at [[Faneuil Hall]] in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president [[Jimmy Carter]] for the Democratic nomination for president.<ref>Leaming (2014), p. 292</ref> She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.<ref>Lawrence, p. 95</ref>

Following her resignation from Viking Press, Kennedy was hired by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, [[John Turner Sargent, Sr.]] Among the books she edited for the company are [[Larry Gonick]]'s ''[[The Cartoon History of the Universe]]'',<ref>Spoto, p. 319</ref> the English translation of the three volumes of [[Naghib Mahfuz]]'s ''[[Cairo Trilogy]]'' (with Martha Levin),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/findingaids/lilly/InU-Li-VAA1274|title=Hutchins mss., 1972–1999|publisher=Indiana University}}</ref> and autobiographies of ballerina [[Gelsey Kirkland]],<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/fashion/02JACKIE.html|title=Once an Editor, Now the Subject|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Jackie O.: A Life in Books|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Jacqueline-Kennedys-Literary-Life|publisher=oprah.com|access-date=January 11, 2015}}</ref> and fashion icon [[Diana Vreeland]].<ref name="nytimes.com"/> She also encouraged [[Dorothy West]], her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], to complete the novel ''The Wedding'' (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.

In addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save [[Grand Central Terminal]] from demolition and renovate the structure in Manhattan.<ref name="Adler" /> A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation.

Jacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend [[Oleg Cassini]] to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.<ref name="fashion"/>

Kennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of [[Coco Chanel|Chanel]], [[Cristóbal Balenciaga|Balenciaga]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy|Givenchy]], but was aware that in her role as First Lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work.<ref name=bowles>{{cite book |last1=Bowles |first1=Hamish |last2=John F.

She also suggested [[Ben Zuckerman]], another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies.<ref name=bowles/> Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a [[Pierre Cardin]] design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the [[White House]] with Mamie Eisenhower.<ref name=bowles/>

In her role as First Lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless [[A-line (clothing)|A-line]] dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and [[pillbox hat]]s.<ref name="fashion">{{cite web|title=Return of the Jackie Look&nbsp;– Sort of Fashion from A-Line Dresses to Fitted Jackets |work = [[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1994/08/28/return-of-the-jackie-look-sort-of-fashion-from-a-line-dresses-to-fitted-jackets.html |date=August 28, 1994}}</ref> Dubbed the "Jackie" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world.
