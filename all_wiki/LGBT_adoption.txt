{{LGBT sidebar}}
'''LGBT adoption''' is the [[adoption]] of children by [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] ([[LGBT+]]) people. This may be in the form of a joint adoption by a [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couple]], adoption by one partner of a same-sex couple of the other's biological child ([[Stepchild|step-child]] adoption), or adoption by a single LGBT+ person. Joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in twenty-seven countries as well as several subnational jurisdictions and dependent territories. Furthermore, some form of step-child adoption is legal for same-sex couples in five countries. Given that constitutions and statutes usually do not address the adoption rights of LGBT persons, judicial decisions often determine whether they can serve as parents either individually or as couples.

Opponents of LGBT adoption have argued that [[LGBT parenting]] adversely affects children. However, scientific research consistently shows that gay and lesbian parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as those reared by heterosexual parents.<ref name="cpa2006">{{Cite web|year=2006|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archive-date=2009-04-19}}</ref><ref name="apsp">{{cite web|title=Elizabeth Short, Damien W.

{{Main|LGBT parenting}}

The existing body of research on outcomes for children with LGBT parents includes limited studies that consider the specific case of adoption. Moreover, where studies do mention adoption they often fail to distinguish between outcomes for unrelated children versus those in their original family or step-families, causing research on the more general case of LGBT parenting to be used to counter the claims of LGBT-adoption opponents.<ref name="Charlotte Patterson 2007, pg. 2">Charlotte Patterson, et. al, "Adolescents with Same-Sex Parents: Findings from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, 7 November 2007, pg. 2</ref> One study has addressed the question directly, evaluating the outcomes of adoptees less than 3-years old who had been placed in one of 56 lesbian and gay households since infancy. Despite the small sample, and the fact that the children have yet to become aware of their adoption status or the dynamics of gender development, the study found no significant associations between parental sexual orientation and child adjustment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~cjp/articles/ffp10b.pdf|title=Parenting and Child Development in Adoptive Families: Does Parental Sexual Orientation Matter?|journal=[[Applied Developmental Science (journal)|Applied Developmental Science]]|department=[[Psychology Press]]|volume=14|issue=3|year=2010|pages=164–178|doi=10.1080/10888691.2010.500958|issn=1088-8691|last1=Farr|first1=Rachel H|last2=Forssell|first2=Stephen L|last3=Patterson|first3=Charlotte J|access-date=27 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821173751/http://people.virginia.edu/~cjp/articles/ffp10b.pdf|archive-date=21 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Debate==

===Arguments===
The adoption of children by LGBT people is an issue of active debate. In the United States, for example, legislation to prevent adoption by LGBT people has been introduced in many jurisdictions; such efforts have largely been defeated. Prior to 1973, state courts commonly barred gay and lesbian individuals from holding a parenting role, especially through adoption.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Karla|title=Adoption by Homosexuals: A Look at Differing State Court Opinions|volume=40 |journal=Ariz. L. Rev. |page=1497 |date=Winter 1998}}</ref>

Major professional organizations have made statements in defense of adoption by same-sex couples. The [[American Psychological Association]] has supported adoption by same-sex couples, citing social prejudice as harming the psychological health of lesbians and gays while noting there is no evidence that their parenting causes harm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paige|first=R.

====South Africa====
[[South Africa]] is the only African country to allow joint adoption by same-sex couples. The 2002 decision of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] in the case of ''[[Du Toit v Minister of Welfare and Population Development]]'' amended the Child Care Act, 1983 to allow both joint adoption and stepparent adoption by "permanent same-sex life partners".<ref>{{cite news |title=Lesbians, gays can adopt children|newspaper=news24|date=10 September 2002|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Lesbians-gays-can-adopt-children-20020910|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> The Child Care Act has since been replaced by the [[Children's Act, 2005]], which allows joint adoption by "partners in a permanent domestic life-partnership", whether same- or opposite-sex, and stepparent adoption by a person who is the "permanent domestic life-partner" of the child's current parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centreforchildlaw.co.za/images/files/mediaguides/childrens_act_media_guide.pdf|title=A Media Guide to the Children's Act 38 of 2005|publisher=Centre for Child Law; Media Monitoring Project|year=2008|author=Lynley Donelly|access-date=8 October 2017|page=40|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019171622/http://www.centreforchildlaw.co.za/images/files/mediaguides/childrens_act_media_guide.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|Same-sex marriage]] has been legal since 2006, and is equivalent to opposite-sex marriage for all purposes, including adoption.

Same-sex couples are able to legally adopt. However, they can only adopt the biological child of their same-sex partner (so-called stepchild adoptions). Taiwan law only allows for married people to adopt, but also allows single individuals to adopt, depending on the circumstances, including individual LGBT people. The same-sex marriage law (that passed the Legislative Yuan in May 2019) grants same-sex couples the right to adopt children genetically related to one of the partners.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taiwan |title=Taiwan's Cabinet passes same-sex marriage bill |url=https://www.taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=150370 |website=Taiwan Today |publisher=Taiwan Today |access-date=8 February 2020}}</ref>

In February 2006, [[France]]'s [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] ruled that both partners in a same-sex relationship can have parental rights over one partner's biological child.

In July 2014 through [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia|Life Partnership Act]] [[Croatia]] recognized an institution similar to step-child adoption called partner-guardian. A partner who is not a biological parent of a child can share parental responsibilities with a biological parent or parents if they agree to it, or if the court decides it is in the best interest of a child. Additionally, a biological parent or parents can temporarily give a partner who is not a biological parent full parental responsibilities. A partner who is not a biological parent can also gain permanent parental responsibilities through an institution of partner-guardian if both biological parents of a child have died, or exceptionally if a second biological parent of a child is unknown, and if the court decides it is in the best interest of a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zakon.hr/z/732/Zakon-o-%C5%BEivotnom-partnerstvu-osoba-istog-spola|title=Zakon o životnom partnerstvu osoba istog spola|language=hr|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>

The [[Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013]], which came into force on 19 August 2013, allowed [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand|same-sex marriage]] and permitted married same-sex couples to jointly adopt children. Previously, an LGBT individual was able to adopt children, but same-sex couples could not adopt jointly.<ref>{{cite news|author=Isaac Davidson|title=Marriage bill leaves a few inequalities to sort out|date=20 April 2013|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10878614|access-date=20 April 2013}}</ref>

Currently, there are no specific barriers preventing an LGBT individual from adopting children, except that a male individual cannot adopt a female child. Same-sex marriage law became effective from 19 August 2013, and since then married same-sex couples were able to adopt children jointly. Unmarried couples of any sex and couples in a civil union can now jointly adopt children, under a [[New Zealand High Court]] ruling in December 2015. The ban breached the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]].<ref name="gaynz.com">{{cite news|url=https://vawnet.org/news/same-sex-defacto-couples-secure-right-adopt-gaynzcom-12212015|title=Same-sex defacto couples secure the right to adopt from GayNZ.com, 12/21/2015|publisher=VAW|date=6 January 2016|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> The minimum age to adopt in New Zealand is 20 years for a related child, and 25 years or the child's age plus 20 years (whichever is greater) for an unrelated child.
