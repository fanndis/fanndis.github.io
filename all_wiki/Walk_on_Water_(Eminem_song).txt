==Production==
[[File:BeyonceFWT15.jpg|alt=A woman stands with a microphone|thumb|[[Beyoncé]] served as the vocalist for the song.]]
The song started as a hook written by [[Skylar Grey]], who also wrote Eminem's 2010 hit single "[[Love the Way You Lie]]".<ref name=Brokenrecord/> Eminem came across the hook when he was working with [[Rick Rubin]] and became enamored of the lyrics.<ref name=Brokenrecord/> Previously Rubin and Eminem had been discussing the phenomenon of [[mumble rap]], specifically Eminem's frustration with its mainstream popularity, and the hook served as a vehicle for him to vent them.<ref name=Brokenrecord/> Rubin subsequently played the song for [[Jay-Z]], who was then able to get his wife, [[Beyoncé]], to sing the chorus.<ref name=Brokenrecord>{{cite podcast |url=https://art19.com/shows/broken-record/episodes/1777c7ba-d9a4-449d-8201-8d2c9d4d1586 |title=Broken Record|website= Art19|publisher=Art19|host=Gladwell, Malcom|access-date=November 11, 2017 }}</ref> Upon the release of the single, Grey tweeted, "This is the song I've been trying to write since age 6. Every time I wrote a song I hoped it would be this good. I am truly proud of everything I've created, but this is the one."<ref>{{cite tweet |user=SkylarGrey |number= 929045652184629249|url=https://twitter.com/SkylarGrey/status/929045652184629249|date=November 10, 2017|title="This is the song I’ve been trying to write since age 6.Every time I wrote a song I hoped it would be this good. I am truly proud of everything I’ve created, but this is the one."}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
"Walk on Water" received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' described the song as a "joyless trudge of a power ballad that pairs a softly crooned hook with fuming, escalating verses of rage-spittle."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/eminem-walk-on-water-ft-beyonce/|title="Walk on Water" [ft. Beyoncé] by Eminem Review|publisher=Pitchfork|date=November 10, 2017|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Release and promotion==
On November 8, 2017, Eminem tweeted a picture of a doctor's prescription note with the words "'Walk on Water', take as needed" written on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Eminem/status/928346592347873280|title=pic.twitter.com/VXgVGHK5TN|last=Mathers|first=Marshall|date=November 8, 2017|website=@Eminem|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> This has caused speculation that the first single will be titled "Walk on Water".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8030237/eminem-teases-walk-on-water-song-revival-instagram|title=Eminem Teases Possible New Single Called 'Walk On Water'|work=Billboard|access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> The fake doctor's note was labeled with the logo for ''Revival''. On November 9, [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]] shared a video on [[Instagram]] which showcased Trevor the spokesperson for the Revival campaign stating that "you will be able to Walk on Water with Revival at noon EST", confirming the song. An audio and a lyric video was uploaded to Eminem's YouTube channel. As of December 25, 2017, the video has over 50 million views and 1 million likes.

==Music video==
On December 23, 2017, the music video for the song was released exclusively on [[Apple Music]] and Eminem's official [[Vevo]] channel. It was directed by American director [[Rich Lee|Richard "Rich" Lee]], who previously directed Eminem's videos for "[[Not Afraid]]", "[[Rap God]]", "[[The Monster (song)|The Monster]]" and "[[Phenomenal (song)|Phenomenal]]". [[Beyonce]] does not appear in the video. As of 18 April, 2020, the video has over 66 million views and 1.1 million likes. The video starts with a beam of light that turns out to be a special on a microphone. Eminem is sitting next to it lamenting when he finally decides to come up to the mic. The lights slowly come up to reveal an auditorium during the second chorus. Many disciples and clones of Eminem are seen typing gibberish into a typewriter. There is then a montage of set pieces being placed on stage to resemble concerts he has performed. During the third chorus, there is a time lapse of fans in the auditorium seats. The fans leave during the third verse when Eminem glitches between different personas and it starts to snow. Eminem is seen in a barren wasteland of ice. He finds a huge statue covered, then, with deliberation, pulls it off. Back to the typewriter room, Eminem starts to write the lyrics to "Stan" and then pulls it out of the typewriter and delivers the closing line, "Bitch, I wrote 'Stan'".<ref>{{Citation|last=EminemVEVO|title=Eminem - Walk On Water (Official Video) ft.
