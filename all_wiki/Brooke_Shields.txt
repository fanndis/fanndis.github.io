'''Brooke Christa Shields''' (born May 31, 1965) is an American actress and model. She was initially a [[child model]] and gained critical acclaim at age 12 for her leading role in [[Louis Malle]]'s film ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]'' (1978), in which she played a [[child prostitute]] in [[New Orleans]] at the beginning of the 20th century. Shields garnered widespread notoriety in the role, and she continued to model into her late teenage years and starred in several dramas in the 1980s, including ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1980), and [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'' (1981).

Shortly after Shields graduated from college, her four-year transcript was published in the July 1987 edition of ''[[Life Magazine]]''. Based on that transcript, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a light-hearted [[op-ed page|op-ed piece]] intended to tweak the claim that Princeton produced superior, well-rounded graduates. Noting that Shields "got all As and Bs, and obviously paid attention to her school work", it claimed she "got cheated" because Princeton did not require her to take any classical studies, medieval, modern or American history, nor any course in mathematics, philosophy, economics, political science, world literature, or science with laboratory experience. "[I]f that adds up to a liberal arts education from a place like Princeton, there is no longer any danger that our society will ever suffer from elitism in any form."<ref>{{cite book |last=Koppett |first=Leonard |title=At Princeton, They Call it an Education |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/15/opinion/at-princeton-they-call-it-an-education.html |date=August 15, 1987 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
[[File:Brooke Shields in 1986.JPEG|thumb|Shields in 1986]]
Shields began her career as a model when she was 11 months old in 1966. Her first job was for [[Ivory Soap]], when she was shot by [[Francesco Scavullo]].<ref name=actors /> She continued as a successful child model with model agent [[Eileen Ford]], who, in her Lifetime Network biography, stated that she started her children's division just for Shields. Shields worked with director [[Woody Allen]] in his 1977 film ''[[Annie Hall]]'', but her role was cut out of the final edit of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11279436/Brooke-Shields-I-stuck-up-for-mum-but-now-I-want-a-say.html|title=Brooke Shields: 'I stuck up for mum, but now I want a say'|last1=Walden|first1=Celia|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=December 8, 2014|accessdate=June 10, 2019}}</ref> In 1978, when she was 12 years old, Shields played a child [[prostitute]] in the controversial film ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]''. Eileen Ford, founder of the [[Ford Modeling Agency]], said of Brooke Shields: "She is a professional child and unique. She looks like an adult and thinks like one."<ref>{{cite book |last=Handel |first=Gerald |title=Childhood socialization|page=37|year=2006|publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=0-202-30641-0}}</ref>

In 1980, 14-year-old Shields was the youngest fashion model ever to appear on the cover of [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']]. Later that same year, Shields appeared in controversial print and TV ads for [[Calvin Klein]] jeans. The TV ad included her saying the famous tagline, "You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing."<ref name=actors /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/04/calvin200804?currentPage=7|title=Calvin to the Core|first=Ingrid|last=Sischy}}</ref><ref>[http://www.style.com/beauty/icon/121407 Style.com ''Brooke Shields'']</ref> Brooke Shields ads would help catapult Klein's career to super-designer status.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Ann C.|title=Delights, desires and dilemmas: essays on women and the media|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MD2mUa5dxYsC&pg=PR12|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-96156-7}}</ref>

From 1981 to 1983, Shields, her mother, photographer [[Garry Gross]], and [[Playboy Press]] were involved in litigation in the [[New York City Courts]] over the rights to photographs her mother had signed away to Gross (when dealing with models who are minors, a parent or legal guardian must sign such a release form while other agreements are subject to negotiation). Gross was the photographer of a controversial set of nude images taken in 1975 of a then ten-year-old Brooke Shields with the consent of her mother, Teri Shields, for the Playboy Press publication Sugar 'n' Spice. The images portray Shields nude, standing and sitting in a bathtub, wearing makeup and covered in oil.  The courts ruled in favor of the photographer due to a strange twist in New York law. It would have been otherwise had Brooke Shields been considered a child "performer" rather than a model.<ref>{{cite book|last=Siegel|first=Paul|title=Communication Law in America|pages=193–194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hhqXPqqjOsC&pg=PA193|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7425-5387-3}}</ref>

By the age of 16, Shields had become one of the most recognizable faces in the United States, because of her dual career as a provocative fashion model and child actress.<ref name=actors /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported in its February 9, 1981 cover story that her day rate as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Shields appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', the October and November issues of American ''Vogue'' and the December edition of Italian ''Vogue''.<ref name=nymag>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/fashion/models/bshields/brookeshields/|title=Brooke Shields – Fashion Model – Profile on New York Magazine|work=New York Magazine}}</ref> During that period Shields became a regular at New York City's nightclub [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{cite interview|last=Shields|first= Brooke|subject-link= Brooke Shields |interviewer=Jimmy Fallon|work=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon|publisher=[[NBC]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate= July 21, 2011|url=http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/brooke-shields-part-1-2711/1287260/|title=Brooke Shields – Part 1}}</ref> In 2009, a picture of a naked Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 and included in a work by [[Richard Prince]], ''Spiritual America'', created a row.

=== Film ===
[[File:Brooke Shields Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|Shields at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Shields' first major film role was as a lead actress in [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]'' (1978), a movie in which she played a child named Violet who lived in a brothel (in which there were numerous nude scenes).<ref name=actors /> She was only 12 years old when the film was released, and controversy regarding child pornography arose.<ref>McMurran, Kristen.

After two decades of movies, her best known films are still arguably ''[[The Blue Lagoon (1980 film)|The Blue Lagoon]]'' (1980), which included nude scenes between teenage lovers on a tropical island (Shields later testified before a U.S. Congressional inquiry that older [[body double]]s were used in some of them), and ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'' (1981). The [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] initially rated ''Endless Love'' with an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X rating]]. The film was re-edited to earn an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]]. She won the [[People's Choice Award]] in the category of Favorite Young Performer in four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. In 1998, she played a lesbian, Lily, in ''[[The Misadventures of Margaret]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Advocate|date=December 23, 1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT11|publisher=Here}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] aired the film ''[[What Makes a Family]]'', starring Shields and [[Cherry Jones]] in a true story of a [[lesbian]] couple who fought the adoption laws of [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Advocate|pages=28–30|date=January 31, 2001|quote='I really believe that if you are against gays and lesbians adopting and you watch this movie,' you will never feel that way again, promises executive producer [[Craig Zadan]].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28 |publisher=Here}}</ref>

=== Television appearances ===
Shields began her television career at an early age. In 1980, she was the youngest guest star to ever appear on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', in which she and the Muppets put on their own version of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. She was also the youngest person to host [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''-like sketch comedy show, in 1981. In one episode of the popular comedy sitcom ''[[Friends]]'', Shields played [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]]'s stalker. This role led directly to her being cast in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'', in which she starred from 1996 until 2000, and which earned a [[People's Choice Award]] in the category of Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series for her, in 1997, and two [[Golden Globe]] nominations.<ref name=actors />

Shields made a couple of guest appearances on ''[[That '70s Show]]''. She played Pam Burkhart, [[Jackie Burkhart|Jackie's]] ([[Mila Kunis]]) mother, who later was briefly involved with [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna's]] ([[Laura Prepon]]) father (played by [[Don Stark]]). Shields left ''That '70s Show'' when her character was written out. Shields recorded the narration for the Sony/BMG recording of ''[[The Runaway Bunny (musical composition)|The Runaway Bunny]]'', a concerto for violin, orchestra, and reader, by [[Glen Roven]].

In the 1990s, Shields promoted physical fitness as an extension of femininity, maintaining that femininity and athletics are compatible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeynes|first=William|title=American educational history: school, society and the common good |page=270|year=2007|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-1421-5|quote=Several female athletes demonstrated that femininity and athleticism were consistent.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=American Educational History: School, Society, and the Common Good|year=2007|page=270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FL2WYw0ve-0C&pg=PA270|isbn=9781412914215|last1=Jeynes|first1=William}}</ref>

=== Postpartum depression ===
Between April and May 2005, Shields spoke to magazines (such as ''[[Guideposts (magazine)|Guideposts]]'') and appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to publicize her battle with [[postpartum depression]], an experience that included depression, thoughts of suicide, an inability to respond to her baby's needs and delayed maternal bonding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Postpartum-Depression |title=Postpartum Depression |date=May 4, 2005 |publisher=The Oprah Winfrey Show |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Denise|title=Out of the Blue: Brooke Shields discusses her painful struggle with postpartum depression|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/features/brooke-shields-depression-struggle|work=WebMD|accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref> The illness may have been triggered by a traumatic childbirth, the death of her father three weeks earlier, stress from [[in vitro fertilization]], a miscarriage and a family history of depression, as well as the hormones and life changes which were brought on by childbirth. Her book, ''Down Came the Rain'', discusses her experience,<ref>Shields, Brooke (2005). Down Came the Rain: My Journey Through Postpartum Depression. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0189-4}}</ref> contributing to a greater public awareness of postpartum depression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenfield |first= Adrian I.|title=New Research on Postpartum Depression|page=64|year=2006 |publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=1-60021-284-0|quote=Several popular books have been published in recent years... These include personal accounts... by... Brooke Shields.}}</ref>

In May 2005, [[Tom Cruise]], an actor and [[Scientology|Scientologist]] whose beliefs frown upon [[psychiatry]], condemned Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking in favor of the [[antidepressant]] drug [[Paroxetine|Paxil]]. As Cruise said, "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at [and think], where has her career gone?" Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were "irresponsible" and "dangerous." She said that he should "stick to fighting aliens" (a reference to Cruise's starring role in ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' as well as some of the more esoteric aspects of [[Xenu|Scientology doctrine and teachings]]), "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay "War of Words" published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, "In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician told me that my feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/01/opinion/01shields.html|work=The New York Times|title=War of Words|first=Brooke|last=Shields|date=July 1, 2005|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-02-shields-cruise_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Shields: Cruise apology was 'heartfelt'|date=September 2, 2006|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was "heartfelt." Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and [[Katie Holmes]].

=== Relationship with Michael Jackson ===
On July 7, 2009, Shields spoke at the memorial service for [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/50269,news,billion-global-viewers-watch-michael-jackson-memorial-service-on-tv Billion watch Jackson send-off on TV] Jack Bremer, ''The First Post'', July 8, 2009</ref> She stated in that speech that she first met Jackson when she was 13 years old, and the two instantly became friends.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/07/06/ap6623221.html Brooke Shields talks about `asexual' Jackson] Associated Press, 07.06.09</ref> Shields said:

{{quote|Thinking back to when we met and the many times that we spent together and whenever we were out together, there would be a caption of some kind, and the caption usually said something like 'an odd couple' or 'an unlikely pair,' but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships... Michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were. We had a bond... Both of us needed to be adults very early, but when we were together, we were two little kids having fun.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1615431/20090707/jackson_michael.jhtml "Brooke Shields Remembers Her Friend At Michael Jackson Memorial"] Jul 7 2009, MTV.com</ref>}}

In her [[eulogy]], she shared anecdotes, including an occasion in which she was his date for one of [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s weddings, and the pair sneaked into Taylor's room to get the first look at her dress, only to discover Taylor asleep in the bed. Shields gave a tearful speech, referring to the many memories she and Jackson shared and briefly joked about his famous sequin glove. She also mentioned Jackson's favorite song "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]" by [[Charlie Chaplin]], which was later sung in the memorial service by [[Jermaine Jackson]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/07/michael-jackson-memorial-moments Michael Jackson memorial: moments to remember] Helen Pidd, ''The Guardian'', Tuesday July 7, 2009</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Gail Collins]] wrote that "it was a little peculiar hearing Brooke Shields's weepy testimony about her deep friendship with Jackson given the fact that she told reporters that the last time she saw him was at Elizabeth Taylor's eighth wedding in 1991."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/opinion/09collins.html|work=The New York Times|title=Michael, a Foreign Affair|first=Gail|last=Collins|date=July 9, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> Jackson stated in his 1993 interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] that he was dating Shields at the time.<ref>[http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/interviews/oprahinterview.html "Michael Jackson Interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]]" All Michael Jackson web site</ref> Shields has stated that Jackson asked her to marry him numerous times and to adopt a child together.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/29126877/michael_jackson_remembered_brooke_shields_on_king_of_pops_pure_soul "Michael Jackson Remembered: Brooke Shields on King of Pop's Pure Soul"] Rolling Stone  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722014547/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/29126877/michael_jackson_remembered_brooke_shields_on_king_of_pops_pure_soul |date=July 22, 2009 }}</ref>

In a conversation with [[Rabbi]] [[Shmuley Boteach]] in 2001, Jackson said of Shields:

{{quote|That was one of the loves of my life. I think she loved me as much as I loved her, you know? We dated a lot. We, we went out a lot. Her pictures were all over my wall, my mirror, everything. And I went to the Academy Awards with Diana Ross and this girl walks up to me and says 'Hi, I'm Brooke Shields.' Then she goes, 'Are you going to the after-party?' I go, 'Yeah.' 'Good, I'll see you at the party.' I'm going, 'Oh my God, does she know she's all over my room?' So we go to the after-party. She comes up to me she goes, 'Will you dance with me?' I went, 'Yes. I will dance with you.' Man, we exchanged numbers and I was up all night, singing, spinning around my room, just so happy. It was great.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32987303 "Children 'saved me,' Michael Jackson said – Taped talks between King of Pop, spiritual adviser released for first time"], ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', September 25, 2008 (transcript)</ref>}}
