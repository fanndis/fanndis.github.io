===== Removal from office =====
{{Main|Quo warranto petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno}}
[[File:Former CJ Sereno.jpg|thumb|250px|Sereno addressing supporters after a decision was made on the ''quo warranto'' petition filed against her on May 11, 2018.]]
On August 30, 2017, at least 25 members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] began the impeachment process against then-Chief Justice Sereno. In addition [[Office of the Solicitor General of the Philippines|Solicitor General]] [[Jose Calida]] filed a ''[[quo warranto]]'' petition to invalidate her appointment as chief justice over alleged lack of integrity. Both the impeachment proceedings and ''quo warranto'' petition cites Sereno's alleged failure to properly declare her [[Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth]] (SALN) and was also responsible for tax misdeclarations and unauthorized expenses. Sereno has questioned the quo warranto petition saying that she could only be legally removed through impeachment

After an impeachment process against her began, Sereno took an indefinite leave on March 1, 2018, but maintained she will not resign. She returned from leave shortly after the rest of the Supreme Court made a decision on the quo warranto petition. Deciding on the ''quo warranto'' petition ''[[en banc]]'' the Supreme Court justices voted to remove Sereno from the court on May 11, 2018, by a vote of 8–6.<ref name=QuoWarranto />

Sereno filed a motion for consideration but the high court denied with finality Sereno's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit on June 19, 2018 voting 8–6, upholding the ''quo warranto'' decision. The ruling also states that no further pleading will be entertained as well as order for immediate entry of judgement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2018/june2018/237428.pdf|title=G.R. No. 237428.

Supporters of the decision hailed the ruling which they viewed maintained the integrity of the high court while critics view it as an attack on the high court's [[judicial independence]].

Senior Justice Antonio Carpio assumed the post of Chief Justice in an acting capacity starting May 14, 2018, following Sereno's removal from office.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panaligan|first1=Rey|title=Carpio assumes SC Chief Justice position|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/05/13/carpio-assumes-sc-chief-justice-position/|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=Manila Bulletin|date=13 May 2018}}</ref> On the evening of August 25, [[Teresita de Castro]], who only had two months left to serve in office, was appointed by president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as the new Chief Justice. The appointment sparked outrage from the opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/210284-teresita-de-castro-supreme-court-chief-justice|title=Teresita de Castro is new Supreme Court Chief Justice|first1=Lian|last1=Buan|first2=Pia|last2=Ranada|website=Rappler|accessdate=December 27, 2018}}</ref>
