==Career==

=== IBM 1973-2012 ===

Palmisano joined IBM in 1973 as a salesman.

From 1989-1990, he served a one-year stint as executive assistant to then-chairman and CEO [[John F. Akers]].[http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/ibms-sam-palmisano-a-super-second-act/] During that time Palmisano was seen as a rising star and he had lunch with former chairman [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] once per month. Palmisano afterwards ran the company's Japanese office.[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/business/how-samuel-palmisano-of-ibm-stayed-a-step-ahead-unboxed.html?_r=0&pagewanted=print]

He was appointed [[senior vice president]] and group executive of the Personal Systems Group in 1997. He was then promoted to senior vice president and group executive of [[IBM Global Services]] in 1998, during the period when IBM shifted its focus from pure technology to embrace [[outsourcing]] and other services. He became senior vice president and group executive of Enterprise Systems in 1999 when the systems group drove IBM's move to adopt the [[Linux]] [[operating system]].

Before leading IBM Global Services, Palmisano led the IBM strategic outsourcing business and before that he was president of an IBM subsidiary—[[Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation]]—which ultimately became IBM Global Services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/chairmen/chairmen_10.html |title=Samuel J. Palmisano |publisher=IBM Archives}}</ref>

Palmisano was elected president and [[chief operating officer]] (COO) effective in October 2000.<ref name="urlIBM-News-2000-07-24-Palmisano"/>

====Chief Executive Officer====
Palmisano was promoted to CEO in March 2002 and named chairman effective January 1, 2003, succeeding the retiring [[Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.]] after the [[Dot-com bubble]] bust. While his predecessor had saved the company from bankruptcy by downsizing the workforce and cutting costs and then leading IBM's resurgence with systems integration and services consulting (such as e-commerce), Palmisano's goal was to reestablish IBM as a standard-setting company. He was influenced by the [[Thomas J. Watson|Watsons]], the company founders who "always defined I.B.M. as a company that did more than sell computers; they believed that it had an important role to play in solving societal challenges".[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/business/how-samuel-palmisano-of-ibm-stayed-a-step-ahead-unboxed.html?_r=0&pagewanted=print] [http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/ibms-sam-palmisano-a-super-second-act/]

Palmisano's mandate was to move into new businesses with high-profit margins and potential for innovation. This included purchasing PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting in 2002 so that IBM could go beyond selling computers and software and help customers use technology to solve business challenges (marketing, procurement, and manufacturing). During his tenure, the company also acquired 25 software companies that specialized in data mining and analytics so that IBM could help companies and governments to find patterns in web and internal data. Palmisano also prepared the company for [[cloud computing]], originally known inside IBM as on-demand computing, where the center of innovation would be services and software, delivered over the Internet from data centers and connecting to PCs and other devices.[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/business/how-samuel-palmisano-of-ibm-stayed-a-step-ahead-unboxed.html?_r=0&pagewanted=print] [http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/ibms-sam-palmisano-a-super-second-act/]

In 2008, despite the financial crisis and economic recession [http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/ibms-sam-palmisano-a-super-second-act/], he launched I.B.M.’s Smarter Planet initiative which applies computer intelligence to create more efficient systems for numerous applications including utility grids and traffic management.[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/business/how-samuel-palmisano-of-ibm-stayed-a-step-ahead-unboxed.html?_r=0&pagewanted=print] Although the services and consulting businesses, which then-CEO Gerstner had championed, provided most of IBM's revenue, software analytics had higher margins, contributed more profits and had more growth.<ref name="tech.fortune.cnn.com">{{cite news| url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/ibms-sam-palmisano-a-super-second-act/ | work=CNN | title=Senior Writer}}</ref>

Palmisano also led the sale of the PC group to [[Lenovo]] which closed in 2005. The move was controversial inside IBM, as it had invented the personal computer in the 1980s, and the PC was one of the company's few products widely used by the masses and created strong brand recognition for IBM. Although it fell behind rivals during the 1990s, that division helped drive sales of other I.B.M. products in corporate accounts, and its purchasing power helped lower the cost of components for larger IBM offerings like mainframes and servers.

As IBM's PC group was profitable and generated around US$20 billion in yearly revenue, the divestiture resulted in IBM ceding the title of the world's largest information technology firm (by revenue) to [[Hewlett-Packard]], the latter whose revenue had increased due to the acquisition of [[Compaq]] in 2002. However to Palmisano, moving to new high-margin businesses meant exiting low-margin businesses like PC manufacturing, plus PC manufacturing was becoming commoditized and offered few opportunities for innovation. It took five years but Palmisano was vindicated from 2010 onward as the [[Post-PC era]] of technology took hold, with smartphones and tablet computers supplanting PCs as the primary computing devices of choice.[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/business/how-samuel-palmisano-of-ibm-stayed-a-step-ahead-unboxed.html?_r=0&pagewanted=print] [http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/08/500-hp-apotheker/]<ref name="tech.fortune.cnn.com"/> Also recognizing that drives were becoming a commodity, he sold off IBM's disk drive business to Hitachi and then signed a five-year deal to buy Hitachi drives.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130821110452/http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/11/18/sam-palmisano-ibm/]

As CEO of IBM, Palmisano has shifted many development and support positions to emerging markets.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/ibms-palmisano-visits-india-431 |title=IBMs Palmisano visits India |publisher=Infoworld |first=John |last=Ribeiro |date=May 5, 2003}}</ref>

He was elected to the board of [[ExxonMobil]] in 2006. He is also the Honorary Chairman of [[National Engineers Week (U.S.)|National Engineers Week]] 2008.

In November 2008, Palmisano, during a speech at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], outlined IBM's [[Smarter Planet]] initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/32790.wss |title=The W. Edwards Deming Center for Quality, Productivity and Competitiveness Awards Samuel Palmisano, President, Chairman and CEO of the IBM Corporation, The Deming Cup |publisher=IBM News room |date=October 19, 2010}}</ref>

While CEO of IBM in 2009, Palmisano earned a total compensation of $21,159,289, which included a base salary of $1,800,000, a cash bonus of $4,750,000, stocks granted of $13,517,401, no options, and other compensation of $1,091,888.<ref>[http://www.equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/I.B.M._Samuel_J._Palmisano.php 2009 CEO Compensation for Samuel J.

In 2010 Palmisano was awarded [[The Deming Cup]], an excellence award presented by the W. Edwards Deming Center for Quality, Productivity, and Competitiveness at [[Columbia Business School]], for his ability to drive IBM to new levels of operational excellence and for his role in creating and leading IBM's Global Services business unit.

Palmisano announced on October 25, 2011, that he was stepping aside as president and CEO, being succeeded by [[Ginni Rometty]] effective on January 1, 2012.<ref name="urlNYT-IBM-Rometty"/> Palmisano continued to serve as Chairman of the Board until October 1, 2012.<ref name=IBMbio/>

=== After IBM ===
Samuel J. Palmisano is the Chairman of the Center for Global Enterprise, a private, nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of the contemporary corporation, the management science in a globally interconnected world.  The CGE was established in 2013 to help educate societal stakeholders – as well as leaders from the private sector, public sector, and academia – on the globally integrated economy and its promise for a better future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecge.net/bio/samuel-j-palmisano/|title=Samuel J.
