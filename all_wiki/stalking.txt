'''Stalking''' is unwanted and/or repeated surveillance by an individual or group toward another person.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|first1=Brian H.|last1=Spitzberg|first2=William R.|last2=Cupach|title=The state of the art of stalking: Taking stock of the emerging literature|journal=[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=London, England|volume=12|issue=1|pages=64–86|date=January–February 2007|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2006.05.001|issn=1359-1789}}</ref> Stalking behaviors are interrelated to [[harassment]] and [[intimidation]] and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them.

According to a 2002 report by the U.S. [[Victims' rights#National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC)|National Center for Victims of Crime]], "virtually any unwanted contact between two people that directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can be considered stalking",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/reports/help_series/pdftxt/stalkingvictimization.txt|title=Stalking Victimization|author=National Center for Victims of Crime|author-link=Victims' rights#National Center for Victims of Crime (NCVC)|publisher=[[Office for Victims of Crime]]|date=Feb 2002}}</ref> although in practice the legal standard is usually somewhat stricter.

==Definitions==
The difficulties associated with defining this term exactly (or defining it at all) are well documented.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sheridan|first1=L.

Having been used since at least the 16th century to refer to a prowler or a poacher (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''), the term ''stalker'' was initially used by media in the 20th century to describe people who pester and harass others, initially with specific reference to the harassment of celebrities by strangers who were described as being "obsessed".<ref name=StalkersTheirVictims>{{cite book|first1=Michele|last1=Pathé|first2=Paul E.|last2=Mullen|first3=Rosemary|last3=Purcell|title=Stalkers and Their Victims|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England |date=2000|isbn=978-0-521-66950-4  }}</ref> This use of the word appears to have been coined by the [[tabloid press]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Tim|last=Lawson-Cruttenden|author-link=Tim Lawson-Cruttendon|title=Is there a law against stalking?|magazine=[[New Law Journal]]|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|location=London, England|issue=6736|date=1996|pages=418–420|doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(02)00068-X}}</ref> With time, the meaning of stalking changed and incorporated individuals being harassed by their former partners.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|first1=Paul E.|last1=Mullen|first2=Michele|last2=Pathé|date=January 1, 2002|title=Stalking|jstor=1147710|journal=[[Crime and Justice]]|publisher=	[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|volume=29|pages=273–318|doi=10.1086/652222}}</ref> Pathé and Mullen describe stalking as "a constellation of behaviours in which an individual inflicts upon another repeated unwanted intrusions and communications".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pathe | first1 = M. | last2 = Mullen | first2 = P.

Although stalking is illegal in most areas of the world, some of the actions that contribute to stalking may be legal, such as gathering information, calling someone on the phone, texting, sending gifts, emailing, or [[instant messaging]]. They become illegal when they breach the legal definition of harassment (e.g., an action such as sending a text is not usually illegal, but is illegal when frequently repeated to an unwilling recipient). In fact, [[United Kingdom]] law states the incident only has to happen twice when the harasser should be aware their behavior is unacceptable (e.g., two phone calls to a stranger, two gifts, following the victim then phoning them, etc).<ref name="harass_1">{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Stalking.html |title=Stalking |publisher=sexualharassmentsupport.org |access-date=20 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819170018/http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/Stalking.html |archive-date=August 19, 2010 }}</ref>

[[Social norm|Cultural norms]] and meaning affect the way stalking is defined. Scholars note that the majority of men and women admit engaging in various stalking-like behaviors following a breakup, but stop such behaviors over time, suggesting that "engagement in low levels of unwanted pursuit behaviors for a relatively short amount of time, particularly in the context of a relationship break-up, may be normative for heterosexual dating relationships occurring within U.S. culture."<ref name="gender">{{Cite journal|last=Langhinrichsen-Rohling|first=Jennifer|date=March 1, 2011|title=Gender and Stalking: Current Intersections and Future Directions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226915692|journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]]|publisher=[[Springer US]]|location=New York City|volume=66|issue=5–6|pages=418–426|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0093-3|s2cid=143722863}}</ref>

==Psychology and behaviors==
People characterized as stalkers may be accused of having a mistaken belief that another person loves them ([[erotomania]]), or that they need rescuing.<ref name="harass_1"/> Stalking can consist of an accumulation of a series of actions which, by themselves, can be legal, such as calling on the phone, sending gifts, or sending emails.<ref name="menace">{{cite web|title=CyberStalking: menaced on the Internet|url=http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192921/http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php|archive-date=May 3, 2006|access-date=14 May 2013|publisher=sociosite.org}}</ref>

Stalkers may use overt and covert intimidation, threats and violence to frighten their victims. They may engage in [[vandalism]] and property damage or make physical attacks that are meant to frighten. Less common are [[sexual assault]]s.<ref name="harass_1"/>

[[Intimate partner]] stalkers are the most dangerous type.<ref name=":1" /> In the UK, for example, most stalkers are former partners and evidence indicates that mental illness-facilitated stalking propagated in the media accounts for only a minority of cases of alleged stalking.<ref name="harass_3"/> A [[UK Home Office]] research study on the use of the Protection from Harassment Act stated: "The study found that the Protection from Harassment Act is being used to deal with a variety of behaviour such as domestic and inter-neighbour disputes. It is rarely used for stalking as portrayed by the media since only a small minority of cases in the survey involved such behaviour."<ref name="harass_3">{{citation|url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r130.pdf|title=The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 – An Evaluation of its Use and Effectiveness|first=Jessica|last=Harris|journal=Research Findings|publisher=Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate|year=2000|issn=1364-6540|access-date=20 October 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016182707/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/r130.pdf|archive-date=16 October 2010}}

===Psychological effects on victims===
Disruptions in daily life necessary to escape the stalker, including changes in [[employment]], residence and phone numbers, take a toll on the victim's well-being and may lead to a sense of isolation.<ref name="Abrams">{{cite journal|last1=Abrams|first1=Karen M.|last2=Robinson|first2=Gail Erlick|date=1 September 2008|title=Comprehensive Treatment of Stalking Victims: Practical Steps That Help Ensure Safety|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/paranoia/article/10168/1278421|url-status=dead|journal=[[Psychiatric Times]]|location=London, England|publisher=[[UBM Medica]]|volume=25|issue=10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120204632/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/paranoia/article/10168/1278421|archive-date=November 20, 2008}}</ref>

According to Lamber Royakkers:<ref name="menace" />

{{quote|Stalking is a form of mental assault, in which the perpetrator repeatedly, unwantedly, and disruptively breaks into the life-world of the victim, with whom they have no relationship (or no longer have). Moreover, the separated acts that make up the intrusion cannot by themselves cause the mental abuse, but do taken together (cumulative effect).}}

===Stalking as a close relationship===
Stalking has also been described as a form of close relationship between the parties, albeit a disjunctive one where the two participants have opposing goals rather than cooperative goals. One participant, often a woman, likely wishes to end the relationship entirely, but may find herself unable to easily do so. The other participant, often but not always a man, wishes to escalate the relationship. It has been described as a close relationship because the duration, frequency, and intensity of contact may rival that of a more traditional conjunctive dating relationship.<ref name="Spitzberg">{{cite book

===Types of victims===
Based on work with stalking victims for eight years in Australia, Mullen and Pathé identified different types of stalking victims dependent on their previous relationship to the stalker. These are:<ref name=":0" />
* '''Prior intimates:''' Victims who had been in a previous intimate relationship with their stalker. In the article, Mullen and Pathé describe this as being "the largest category, the most common victim profile being a woman who has previously shared an intimate relationship with her (usually) male stalker." These victims are more likely to be exposed to violence being enacted by their stalker especially if the stalker had a criminal past. In addition, victims who have "date stalkers" are less likely to experience violence by their stalkers. A "date stalker" is considered an individual who had an intimate relationship with the victim but it was short-lived.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Casual acquaintances and friends:''' Among male stalking victims, most are part of this category. This category of victims also includes neighbor stalking. This may result in the victims' change of residence.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Professional contacts:''' These are victims who have been stalked by patients, clients, or students who they have had a professional relationship with. Certain professions such as health care providers, teachers, and lawyers are at a higher risk for stalking.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Workplace contacts:''' The stalkers of these victims tend to visit them in their workplace which means that they are either an employer, employee, or a customer. When victims have stalkers coming to their workplace, this poses a threat not only to the victims' safety but to the safety of other individuals as well.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Strangers:''' These victims are typically unaware of how their stalkers began stalking because typically these stalkers form a sense of admiration for their victims from a distance.<ref name=":0" />
* '''The famous:''' Most of these victims are individuals who are portrayed heavily on media outlets but can also include individuals such as politicians and athletes.<ref name=":0" />

===Gender===
According to one study, women often target other women, whereas men primarily stalk women.<ref name="Women Who Stalk">{{cite journal|last=Purcell|first=R.|title=A Study of Women Who Stalk|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|volume=158|issue=12|pages=2056–2060|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2056|pmid=11729025|date=2001}}</ref><ref name="Types of Stalkers">{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyright_violationsharassmentsupport.org/TypesofStalkers.html |title=Types of stalkers |publisher=sexualharassmentsupport.org |access-date=20 October 2010}}</ref> A January 2009 report from the [[United States Department of Justice]] reports that "Males were as likely to report being stalked by a male as a female offender. 43% of male stalking victims stated that the offender was female, while 41% of male victims stated that the offender was another male. Female victims of stalking were significantly more likely to be stalked by a male (67%) rather than a female (24%) offender."

In an article in the journal ''Sex Roles'', Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rohling discusses how gender plays a role in the difference between stalkers and victims. She says, "gender is associated with the types of emotional reactions that are experienced by recipients of stalking related events, including the degree of fear experienced by the victim." In addition, she hypothesizes that gender may also affect how police handle a case of stalking, how the victim copes with the situation, and how the stalker might view their behavior. She discusses how victims might view certain forms of stalking as normal because of gender socialization influences on the acceptability of certain behaviors. She emphasizes that in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States, strangers are considered more dangerous when it comes to stalking than a former partner. Media also plays an important role due to portrayals of male stalking behavior as acceptable, influencing men into thinking it is normal. Since gender roles are socially constructed, sometimes men don't report stalking. She also mentions [[coercive control]] theory; "future research will be needed to determine if this theory can predict how changes in social structures and gender-specific norms will result in variations in rates of stalking for men versus women over time in the United States and across the world."<ref name="gender"/>

===Types of stalkers===
Psychologists often group individuals who stalk into two categories: [[psychotic]] and nonpsychotic.<ref name=StalkersTheirVictims/> Some stalkers may have pre-existing psychotic disorders such as [[delusional disorder]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], or [[schizophrenia]]. However, most stalkers are nonpsychotic and may exhibit disorders or [[neuroses]] such as [[clinical depression|major depression]], [[adjustment disorder]], or [[Chemical dependency|substance dependence]], as well as a variety of [[personality disorder]]s (such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]], or [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]]). The nonpsychotic stalkers' pursuit of victims is primarily angry, vindictive, focused, often including [[Psychological projection|projection]] of [[blame]], [[wikt:obsession|obsession]], [[behavioral addiction|dependency]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]], [[denial]], and [[jealousy]]. Conversely, only 10% of stalkers had an erotomanic delusional disorder.<ref name="A comparative study of psychotic and nonpsychotic stalking">{{cite journal|first1=K. K.|last1=Kienlen|first2=D. L.|last2=Birmingham|first3=K. B.|last3=Solberg|first4=J. T.|last4=O'Regan|first5=J. R.|last5=Meloy|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/abstract/25/3/317|title=A comparative study of psychotic and nonpsychotic stalking|journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]]|publisher=[[American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]]|location=Bloomfield, Connecticut|date=December 1997|volume=25|number=3|pages=317–334|pmid=9323658}}</ref>

In "A Study of Stalkers" Mullen ''et al. (2000)<ref name="Study of Stalkers">{{cite journal|first1=Paul E.|last1=Mullen|first2=Michele|last2=Pathé|first3=Rosemary|last3=Purcell|first4=Geoffrey W.|last4=Stuart|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/156/8/1244|title=A Study of Stalkers|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|issue=156|pages=1244–1249|date=August 1999|volume=156|doi=10.1176/ajp.156.8.1244|doi-broken-date=2020-10-06|pmid=10450267}}</ref> identified five types of stalkers:
* '''Rejected stalkers''' follow their victims in order to reverse, correct, or avenge a rejection (e.g. divorce, separation, termination).
* '''Resentful stalkers''' make a vendetta because of a sense of grievance against the victims – motivated mainly by the desire to frighten and distress the victim.
* '''[[Obsessive love|Intimacy seekers]]''' seek to establish an intimate, loving relationship with their victim. Such stalkers often believe that the victim is a long-sought-after soul mate, and they were 'meant' to be together.
* '''Incompetent suitors''', despite poor social or courting skills, have a [[fixation (psychology)|fixation]], or in some cases, a sense of [[entitlement]] to an intimate relationship with those who have attracted their amorous interest. Their victims are most often already in a dating relationship with someone else.
* '''Predatory stalkers''' spy on the victim in order to prepare and plan an attack – often sexual – on the victim.
In addition to Mullen et al., Joseph A. Davis, Ph.D., an American researcher, crime analyst, and university psychology professor at [[San Diego State University]] investigated, as a member of the Stalking Case Assessment Team (SCAT), special unit within the San Diego District Attorney's Office, hundreds of cases involving what he called and typed "terrestrial" and "[[cyberstalking]]" between 1995 and 2002. This research culminated in one of the most comprehensive books written to date on the subject. Published by [[CRC Press, Inc.]] in August 2001, it is considered the "gold standard" as a reference to stalking crimes, victim protection, safety planning, security and threat assessment.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9780849308116|title=Stalking Crimes and Victim Protection: Prevention, Intervention, Threat Assessment, and Case Management|date=2001|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Joseph A.|location=Boca Raton, Florida|access-date=January 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129205849/https://www.routledge.com/products/9780849308116|archive-date=January 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The 2002 National Victim Association Academy defines an additional form of stalking: The '''vengeance/terrorist stalker'''. Both the vengeance stalker and terrorist stalker (the latter sometimes called the political stalker) do not, in contrast with some of the aforementioned types of stalkers, seek a personal relationship with their victims but rather force them to emit a certain response. While the vengeance stalker's motive is "to get even" with the other person whom he/she perceives has done some wrong to them (e.g., an employee who believes is fired without justification from a job by a superior), the political stalker intends to accomplish a political agenda, also using [[threats]] and [[intimidation]] to force the target to refrain or become involved in some particular activity regardless of the victim's consent. For example, most prosecutions in this stalking category have been against anti-abortionists who stalk doctors in an attempt to discourage the performance of abortions.<ref name="National Victim Association Agency 2002 Chapter 22: Special topics">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/nvaa2002/chapter22_4.html|title=National Victim Assistance Academy Textbook – Chapter 22 Special Topics – Section 4, Campus Crime and Victimization|date=June 2002|access-date=28 August 2011|publisher=[[Office for Victims of Crime]]}}</ref>

Stalkers may fit categories with [[paranoia disorder]]s. '''Intimacy-seeking stalkers''' often have delusional disorders involving [[erotomanic]] delusions. With rejected stalkers, the continual clinging to a relationship of an inadequate or dependent person couples with the entitlement of the narcissistic personality, and the persistent jealousy of the paranoid personality. In contrast, '''resentful stalkers''' demonstrate an almost "pure culture of [[persecution]]", with delusional disorders of the paranoid type, paranoid personalities, and [[paranoid schizophrenia]].<ref name="Study of Stalkers" />

One of the uncertainties in understanding the origins of stalking is that the concept is now widely understood in terms of specific behaviors<ref>as a US example, see January 2009 Special Report from the [[United States Department of Justice]] titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200830/http://www.ncvc.org/src/AGP.Net/Components/DocumentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=45862 "Stalking Victimization in the United States"], NCJ 224527</ref> which are found to be offensive or illegal. As discussed above, these specific (apparently stalking) behaviors may have multiple motivations.

In addition, the personality characteristics that are often discussed as antecedent to stalking may also produce behavior that is not stalking as conventionally defined. Some research suggests there is a spectrum of what might be called "obsessed following behavior." People who complain obsessively and for years, about a perceived wrong or wrong-doer, when no one else can perceive the injury—and people who cannot or will not "let go" of a person or a place or an idea—comprise a wider group of persons that may be problematic in ways that seem similar to stalking. Some of these people get extruded from their organizations—they may get hospitalized or fired or let go if their behavior is defined in terms of illegal stalking, but many others do good or even excellent work in their organizations and appear to have just one focus of tenacious obsession.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Mary|last=Rowe|title=People With Delusions or Quasi-Delusions Who 'Won't Let Go'|journal=Journal of the University and College Ombuds Association|publisher=International of the International Ombudsman|location=Seattle, Washington|issue=1|date=Fall 1994}}</ref>

===Cyberstalking===
{{main|Cyberstalking|Cyberstalking legislation}}
{{commons category|Cyberstalking}}
[[Cyberstalking]] is the use of computers or other electronic technology to facilitate stalking. In Davis (2001), Lucks identified a separate category of stalkers who instead of a terrestrial means, prefer to perpetrate crimes against their targeted victims through electronic and online means.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph A.|last=Davis|title=Stalking Crimes and Victim Protection|url=https://archive.org/details/stalkingcrimesvi00davi|url-access=limited|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton, Florida|pages=[https://archive.org/details/stalkingcrimesvi00davi/page/n25 3]–19|isbn=978-1420041743|date=2001-06-26}}</ref> Amongst college students, Ménard and Pincus found that men who had a high score of [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse as children]] and [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] vulnerability were more likely to become stalkers. Out of the women who participated in their study, 9% were cyberstalkers meanwhile only 4% were overt stalkers. In addition, the male participants revealed the opposite, 16% were overt stalkers while 11% were cyberstalkers. Alcohol and physical abuse both played a role in predicting women's cyberstalking and in men, "preoccupied attachment significantly predicted cyber stalking".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ménard|first1=Kim S.|last2=Pincus|first2=Aaron L.|date=July 1, 2012|title=Predicting Overt and Cyber Stalking Perpetration by Male and Female College Students|journal=[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Seattle, Washington|language=en|volume=27|issue=11|pages=2183–2207|doi=10.1177/0886260511432144|issn=0886-2605|pmid=22203630|s2cid=206562459}}</ref>

===Stalking by groups===
{{See also|Flying monkeys (popular psychology)|Mobbing}}
According to a [[U.S. Department of Justice]] special report<ref name="StalkingVictimizationintheUnitedStates"/> a significant number of people reporting stalking incidents claim that they had been stalked by more than one person, with 18.2% reporting that they were stalked by two people, 13.1% reporting that they had been stalked by three or more. The report did not break down these cases into numbers of victims who claimed to have been stalked by several people individually, and by people acting in concert. A question asked of respondents reporting three or more stalkers by polling personnel about whether the stalking was related to co-workers, members of a gang, fraternities, sororities, etc., did not have its responses indicated in the survey results as released by the DOJ. The data for this report was obtained via the 2006 Supplemental Victimization Survey (SVS), conducted by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] for the Department of Justice.<ref name="SUPPLEMENTALVICTIMIZATIONSURVEY"/>

According to a United Kingdom study by Sheridan and Boon,<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Lauren|last1=Sheridan|first2=Graham M.|last2=Davies|first3=Julian|last3=Boon|title=The Course and Nature of Stalking: A Victim Perspective|journal=[[Howard Journal of Criminal Justice]]|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|volume=40|issue=3|date=August 2001|pages=215–234|doi=10.1111/1468-2311.00204}}</ref> in 5% of the cases they studied there was more than one stalker, and 40% of the victims said that friends or family of their stalker had also been involved. In 15% of cases, the victim was unaware of any reason for the harassment.

Over a quarter of all stalking and harassment victims do not know their stalkers in any capacity. About a tenth responding to the SVS did not know the identities of their stalkers.  11% of victims said they had been stalked for five years or more.<ref name="StalkingVictimizationintheUnitedStates"/>

===False claims of stalking, "gang stalking" and delusions of persecution===

==Epidemiology and prevalence==

===Australia===
According to a study conducted by Purcell, Pathé and Mullen (2002), 23% of the Australian population reported having been stalked.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Rosemary|author2=Pathé, Michele|author3=Mullen, Paul E.|title=The prevalence and nature of stalking in the Australian community|journal=[[Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Sydney, Australia|date=1 January 2002|volume=36|issue=1|pages=114–120|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.2002.00985.x|pmid=11929447|hdl=1959.3/374333|s2cid=23411422|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

===Austria===
Stieger, Burger and Schild conducted a survey in Austria, revealing a lifetime prevalence of 11% (women: 17%, men: 3%).<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Stefan|last1=Stieger|first2=Christoph|last2=Burger|first3=Anne|last3=Schild|title=Lifetime prevalence and impact of stalking: Epidemiological data from Eastern Austria|journal=The European Journal of Psychiatry|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=London, England|date=October–December 2008|volume=22|issue=4|doi=10.4321/S0213-61632008000400006|pages=235–241|doi-access=free}}</ref> Further results include: 86% of stalking victims were female, 81% of the stalkers were male. Women were mainly stalked by men (88%) while men were almost equally stalked by men and women (60% male stalkers). 19% of the stalking victims reported that they were still being stalked at the time of study participation ([[point prevalence]] rate: 2%). To 70% of the victims, the stalker was known, being a prior intimate partner in 40%, a friend or acquaintance in 23% and a colleague at work in 13% of cases. As a consequence, 72% of the victims reported having changed their lifestyle. 52% of former and ongoing stalking victims reported suffering from a currently impaired ([[pathological]]) [[Mental health#Mental wellbeing|psychological well-being]]. There was no [[statistical significance|significant]] difference between the incidence of stalking in rural and urban areas.

==Laws on harassment and stalking==

===Australia===
Every Australian state enacted laws prohibiting stalking during the 1990s, with Queensland being the first state to do so in 1994. The laws vary slightly from state to state, with Queensland's laws having the broadest scope, and South Australian laws the most restrictive. Punishments vary from a maximum of 10 years imprisonment in some states, to a fine for the lowest severity of stalking in others. Australian anti-stalking laws have some notable features. Unlike many US jurisdictions they do not require the victim to have felt fear or distress as a result of the behaviour, only that a reasonable person would have felt this way. In some states, the anti-stalking laws operate extra-territorially, meaning that an individual can be charged with stalking if either they or the victim are in the relevant state. Most Australian states provide the option of a [[restraining order]] in cases of stalking, breach of which is punishable as a criminal offence. There has been relatively little research into Australian court outcomes in stalking cases, although Freckelton (2001) found that in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], most stalkers received fines or community based dispositions.

===Canada===
Section 264 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], titled "''criminal harassment''",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-122.html#s-264|title=Section 264 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46|publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> addresses acts which are termed "stalking" in many other jurisdictions.

Article 285b:

:2. The prosecution will only take place after a complaint of the person who is the victim of the crime.

# Criminal action is initiated by prior complaint of the victim.}}

===United Kingdom===
Before the enactment of the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]], the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]] criminalised indecent, offensive or threatening phone calls and the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]] criminalised the sending of an indecent, offensive or threatening letter, electronic communication or other article to another person.

Before 1997 no specific offence of stalking existed in England and Wales, but in Scotland incidents could be dealt with under pre-existing law with life imprisonment available for the worst offences

====England and Wales====

In [[England and Wales]], "[[Harassment in the United Kingdom|harassment]]" was criminalised by the enactment of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which came into force on 16 June 1997. It makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to six months' imprisonment, to make a course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another on two or more occasions. The court can also issue a restraining order, which carries a maximum punishment of five years' imprisonment if breached. In [[England and Wales]], liability may arise in the event that the victim suffers either mental or physical harm as a result of being harassed (or slang term stalked) (see ''[[R. v. Constanza]]'').

In 2012, the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], stated that the government intended to make another attempt to create a law aimed specifically at stalking behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|date=8 March 2012|title=Stalking to be made specific criminal offence – Cameron|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17294314|access-date=14 May 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

In May 2012, the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] created the offence of stalking for the first time in England/Wales by inserting these offences into the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]]. The act of stalking under this section is exemplified by contacting, or attempting to contact, a person by any means, publishing any statement or other material relating or purporting to relate to a person, monitoring the use by a person of the Internet, email or any other form of electronic communication, loitering in any place (whether public or private), interfering with any property in the possession of a person or watching or spying on a person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/section/111/enacted|title=Protection of Freedoms Act 2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/stalking-and-harassment|title=Stalking and Harassment|website=www.cps.gov.uk|access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 also added Section 4(a) into the Protection From Harassment Act 1997 which covered 'Stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress'. This created the offence of where a person's conduct amounts to stalking and either causes another to fear (on at least two occasions) that violence will be used against them or conduct that causes another person serious alarm or distress which has a substantial effect on their usual day to day activities.

====Scotland====

In [[Scotland]], behaviour commonly described as stalking was already prosecuted as the common law offence of [[breach of the peace#Scotland|breach of the peace]] (not to be confused with the minor English offence of the same description) before the introduction of the statutory offence against s.39 of the [[Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010]];{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} either course can still be taken<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/crimes/harassment/stalkinglaw|title=Stalking & Harassment – Criminal Law|publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|access-date=14 May 2013|date=2009-09-14}}</ref> depending on the circumstances of each case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/crimes/harassment/stalkingoffence|title=Offence of Stalking|publisher=[[Scottish Government]]|access-date=14 May 2013|date=2010-07-08}}</ref> The statutory offence incurs a penalty of twelve months imprisonment or a fine upon summary conviction or a maximum of five years' imprisonment or a fine upon conviction on indictment; penalties for conviction for breach of the peace are limited only by the sentencing powers of the court, thus a case remitted to the [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court]] can carry a sentence of imprisonment for life.

Provision is made under the Protection from Harassment Act against stalking to deal with the civil offence (i.e. the interference with the victim's personal rights), falling under the law of [[delict (Scots law)|delict]].

California was the first state to criminalize stalking in the United States in 1990<ref>{{cite web|date=6 June 2011|title=Are You Being Stalked?|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14-stk.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980505092632/http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14-stk.htm|archive-date=May 5, 1998|access-date=7 July 2012|publisher=Privacyrights.org}}</ref> as a result of numerous high-profile stalking cases in California, including the 1982 attempted murder of actress [[Theresa Saldana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stalkingalert.com/articlesofinterest.htm|title=Stalking Stalking From A Legal Perspective|first=Rhonda|last=Saunders|publisher=Stalkingalert.com|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> the 1988 massacre by [[Richard Farley]],<ref name="bill analysis">{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1178_cfa_930426_112027_sen_comm|title=Bill Analysis by Bill Lockyer|access-date=7 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113003034/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/93-94/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1178_cfa_930426_112027_sen_comm|archive-date=13 January 2009}}</ref> the 1989 murder of actress [[Rebecca Schaeffer]],<ref>{{cite web|date=11 December 2004|title=Culture of Patriarchy in Law: Violence From Antiquity to Modernity|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/110415/culture_of_patriarchy_in_law_violence_from_antiquity_to_modernity/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003011941/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/110415/culture_of_patriarchy_in_law_violence_from_antiquity_to_modernity/index.html#|archive-date=2011-10-03|access-date=7 July 2012|publisher=Redorbit.com}}</ref> and five [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] stalking murders, also in 1989.<ref name="bill analysis" /><ref name="watson">{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/1998jun/ca/or/vote/watson_j/paper1.html|title=Judge John Watson profile|publisher=Smartvoter.org|date=2 June 1998|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> The first anti-stalking law in the United States, California Penal Code Section 646.9, was developed and proposed by Municipal Court Judge John Watson of Orange County.

Within three years<ref name="watson" /> thereafter, every state in the [[United States]] followed suit to create the crime of stalking, under different names such as ''criminal harassment'' or ''criminal menace''. The [[Driver's Privacy Protection Act]] (DPPA) was enacted in 1994 in response to numerous cases of a driver's information being abused for criminal activity, with prominent examples including the [[Theresa Saldana|Saldana]] and [[Rebecca Schaeffer|Schaeffer]] stalking cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/drivers/|title=DPPA and the Privacy of Your State Motor Vehicle Record|publisher=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1437&wit_id=4146 U.S. Senate Committee: Robert Douglas Testimony] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114072135/http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1437&wit_id=4146 |date=November 14, 2006 }}</ref> The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver's personal information without permission by State [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV).

The [[Violence Against Women Act]] of 2005, amending a United States statute, 108 Stat. 1902 et seq, defined stalking as:<ref name = "VAW2005(3)(a)(24)" >{{cite act |title=Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005|number=H.

As of 2011, stalking is an offense under section 120a of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/920a-|title=United States Code: Title 10,920a. Art. 120a. Stalking – LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=28 August 2011}}</ref> The law took effect on 1 October 2007.

In 2014 new amendments were made to the [[Clery Act]] to require reporting on stalking, domestic violence, and dating violence.<ref name="2014 Changes to Clery Act">{{cite news|last1=New|first1=Jake|title=Final Changes to Clery Act|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/20/education-department-publishes-final-rules-campus-crime-reporting|access-date=23 February 2015|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|date=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

In 2018 the PAWS Act became law in the United States, and it expanded the definition of stalking to include "conduct that causes a person to experience a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to his or her pet”.<ref name="bustle1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-paws-act-protecting-domestic-violence-survivors-their-pets-finally-became-law-15558219 |title=The PAWS Act Protecting Domestic Violence Survivors & Their Pets Finally Became Law |publisher=Bustle.com |access-date=2018-12-25}}</ref>

Stalking is a [[controversial]] crime because a conviction does not require any physical harm.<ref>{{cite book|first=Laurie L.|last=Levenson|title=The Glannon Guide to Criminal Law|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law & Business|location=Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands|date=2009|isbn=978-0-7355-7955-2|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knJHAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The anti-stalking statute of Illinois is particularly controversial.
