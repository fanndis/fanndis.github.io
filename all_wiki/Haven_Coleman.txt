==Activism==

Coleman first felt the pull towards environmentalism when she was ten years old; after learning that her favorite animal, [[sloths]], are diminishing due to deforestation. She then made significant lifestyle changes inspired by sustainable living.<ref name="Elle These Girls">{{cite news |last1=Minutaglio |first1=Rose |title=The World Is Burning.

After seeing the bold environmental activism of [[Greta Thunberg]] and youth climate strikes in Europe, she was inspired to do the same. Thus, since January 2019,<ref name="The Climate Reality Project" /> at 13 years old, she began protesting in front of businesses or government buildings,<ref name="Grist">{{cite news |last1=Kutz |first1=Jessica |title=Meet the 12-year-old activist taking politicians to task over climate change |url=https://grist.org/article/meet-the-12-year-old-activist-taking-politicians-to-task-over-climate-change/ |accessdate=10 September 2020 |work=Grist |publisher=Grist Magazine, Inc. |date=23 February 2019}}</ref> such as the Colorado State Capitol.<ref name="Elemental Meet the">{{cite news |last1=Budner |first1=Ali |title=Meet the Mountain West Teens Organizing the U.S. Youth Climate Strike |url=https://elementalreports.com/climate-change/2019/03/13/meet-the-mountain-west-teens-organizing-the-u-s-youth-climate-strike/ |accessdate=10 September 2020 |work=Elemental |date=13 March 2019}}</ref> Every Friday she goes on strike to demand political action regarding air quality, [[coal plant]] retirement, [[renewable energy]], etc. She also e-mailed elected officials concerning the issue. She was massively bullied by peers in school who thought her stark activism was strange.<ref name="Elle These Girls" />

Coleman would protest alone until she was able to establish the US Youth Climate Strike together with [[Isra Hirsi]] and [[Alexandria Villasenor]].<ref name="Time Meet the kids">{{cite news |last1=Li |first1=Ang |title='It Will Be Too Late for My Generation.'

Coleman went viral after speaking to state Senator [[Cory Gardner]] about carbon polluters on a public forum at the town hall. She implored him to take action and offered to organize a grassroots movement to facilitate, however, Gardner refused.<ref name="Grist" />

As she made headlines, she caught the attention of [[Al Gore]], and he invited her presence on his project, 24 Hours of Reality. It is a TV program that deals with climate change.<ref name="Grist" />

Coleman is presently working on Arid Agency, which is geared towards accelerating environmental and social justice campaigns.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Haven Coleman|url=https://schedule.sxswedu.com/2020/speakers/259051|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-10|website=SXSW EDU 2020 Schedule|publisher=SXSW, LLC.|language=en|ref=SSS}}</ref>
