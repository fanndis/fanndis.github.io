==Signs and symptoms==
[[Edema|Oedema]] (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because oedema is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.

In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.

==Causes==
There is no definitive known cause of pre-eclampsia, though it is likely related to a number of factors. Some of these factors include:<ref name=Al2014/><ref name=Lancet2010/> 
* Abnormal [[placentation]] (formation and development of the placenta) 
* Immunologic factors
* Prior or existing maternal pathology—pre-eclampsia is seen more at a higher incidence in individuals with pre-existing [[hypertension]], obesity, or [[antiphospholipid antibody syndrome]] or those with a history of pre-eclampsia
* Dietary factors, e.g. calcium supplementation in areas where dietary calcium intake is low has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia<ref name=WHO2011/> 
* Environmental factors, e.g. air pollution<ref name=EHP>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu J, Ren C, Delfino RJ, Chung J, Wilhelm M, Ritz B | title = Association between local traffic-generated air pollution and preeclampsia and preterm delivery in the south coast air basin of California | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 117 | issue = 11 | pages = 1773–9 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 20049131 | pmc = 2801174 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.0800334 | url = http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf | access-date = 2009-07-05 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090719065531/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf | archive-date = 2009-07-19 }}</ref>

Those with long term [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] have a risk 7 to 8 times higher than those without.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bramham K, Parnell B, Nelson-Piercy C, Seed PT, Poston L, Chappell LC | title = Chronic hypertension and pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 348 | pages = g2301 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24735917 | pmc = 3988319 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g2301 }}</ref>

Physiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, [[endothelial]] cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among [[vasoactive]] substances, decreased intravascular volume, and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mustafa R, Ahmed S, Gupta A, Venuto RC | title = A comprehensive review of hypertension in pregnancy | journal = Journal of Pregnancy | volume = 2012 | pages = 105918 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22685661 | pmc = 3366228 | doi = 10.1155/2012/105918 }}</ref>

While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta.<ref name=Al2014/><ref name=Lancet2010/> This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma.<ref name=Lancet2010/> A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized [[endothelial]] dysfunction.<ref name=Ei2012/> The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal [[immune system]]'s response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established [[immunological tolerance in pregnancy]]. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia.<ref name=Al2014/> Those with pre-eclampsia may have a lower risk of breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Innes KE, Byers TE | title = Preeclampsia and breast cancer risk | journal = Epidemiology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 722–32 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10535787 | doi = 10.1097/00001648-199911000-00013 | jstor = 3703514 }}</ref>

* Placental abnormalities such as placental ischemia

==Pathogenesis==
Although much research into mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Pre-eclampsia is thought to result from an abnormal placenta, the removal of which ends the disease in most cases.<ref name=Al2014 /> During normal pregnancy, the placenta vascularizes to allow for the exchange of water, gases, and solutes, including nutrients and wastes, between maternal and fetal circulations.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /> Abnormal development of the placenta leads to poor placental perfusion. The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /> It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.<ref name=Ei2012/><ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /><ref name=DrifeMagowan>{{Cite book | last1 = Drife | first1 = James O. | last2 = Magowan | first2 = Brian | name-list-style = vanc | title = Clinical obstetrics and gynecology | year = 2004 | publisher = Saunders | location = Edinburgh, New York | isbn = 978-0-7020-1775-9 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/clinicalobstetri0000unse/page/367 367–70] | url = https://archive.org/details/clinicalobstetri0000unse/page/367 }}</ref>

The clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ [[ischemia]].<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /> Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of [[angiogenic]] and [[anti-angiogenic]] factors.<ref name=Al2014 /> Both circulating and placental levels of [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /> sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Soluble [[endoglin]] (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" />

Both sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.

Oxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]] (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McMaster-Fay RA | title = Pre-eclampsia: a disease of oxidative stress resulting from the catabolism of DNA (primarily fetal) to uric acid by xanthine oxidase in the maternal liver; a hypothesis. | journal = Bioscience Hypotheses | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | pages = 35–43 | doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.01.002}}</ref>

Abnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[T helper cell|Th<sub>1</sub> responses]] and the production of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-γ]]. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.<ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje">{{cite journal | vauthors = Laresgoiti-Servitje E, Gómez-López N, Olson DM | title = An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 510–24 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20388637 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq007 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc | doi-access = free | access-date = 2010-08-10 | archive-date = 2020-10-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201004005233/https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/16/5/510/664236 | url-status = live }}</ref> Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.<ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje" /> It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[Nucleated red blood cell|erythroblasts]] as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an [[immune response]] and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

In normal early embryonic development, the outer epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type found in the trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.<ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/>

In pre-eclampsia, abnormal expression of chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) in placental cell lines reduces extravillus trophoblast migration.<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref name="C19MC MicroRNAs Regulate the Migrat"/> Specific microRNAs in this cluster which might cause abnormal spiral artery invasion include miR-520h, miR-520b, and 520c-3p.

Testing for pre-eclampsia is recommended throughout [[pregnancy]] via measuring a woman's blood pressure.<ref name=USPSTF2017/>

===Diagnostic criteria===
Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops:<ref name="Harrison's">{{Cite book | last1 = Longo | first1 = Dan L. | name-list-style = vanc | title = Harrison's principles of internal medicine | year = 2012 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6 | pages = 55–61 }}</ref>
* Blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic on two separate readings taken at least four to six hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure.
* In a woman with essential hypertension beginning before 20 weeks' gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15 mmHg.
* [[Proteinuria]] ≥ {{convert|0.3|g|mg}} or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to creatinine ratio ≥0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).<ref name=ACOG2013/>

Suspicion for pre-eclampsia should be maintained in any pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure, even in the absence of proteinuria. Ten percent of individuals with other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and 20% of individuals diagnosed with eclampsia show no evidence of proteinuria.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/> In the absence of proteinuria, the presence of new-onset [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure) and the new onset of one or more of the following is suggestive of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia:<ref name=ACOG2013/><ref name=Aru2013/> 
* Evidence of kidney dysfunction ([[oliguria]], elevated [[creatinine]] levels)
* Impaired liver function (noted by [[liver function tests]])
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (platelet count <100,000/microliter)
* [[Pulmonary edema]]
*[[Peripheral edema|Ankle edema]] (pitting type)
* Cerebral or visual disturbances

Pre-eclampsia is a progressive disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction are indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or proteinuria >5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe pre-eclampsia.<ref name=Aru2013/> Clinically, individuals with severe pre-eclampsia may also present [[Epigastrium|epigastric]]/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting.<ref name=Aru2013/> Severe pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.

A rise in baseline blood pressure (BP) of 30 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, is important to note but is not considered diagnostic.

===Predictive tests===
There have been many assessments of tests aimed at predicting pre-eclampsia, though no single biomarker is likely to be sufficiently predictive of the disorder.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Predictive tests that have been assessed include those related to placental perfusion, vascular resistance, kidney dysfunction, [[endothelial]] dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Examples of notable tests include:
* Doppler [[ultrasonography]] of the uterine arteries to investigate for signs of inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals with a history of prior pre-eclampsia.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/>

* Elevations in serum uric acid ([[hyperuricemia]]) is used by some to "define" pre-eclampsia,<ref name="Cunningham_2010"/> though it has been found to be a poor predictor of the disorder.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/> Elevated levels in the blood ([[hyperuricemia]]) are likely due to reduced uric acid clearance secondary to impaired kidney function.
* [[Angiogenic]] proteins such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF) and anti-angiogenic proteins such as [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) have shown promise for potential clinical use in diagnosing pre-eclampsia, though evidence is sufficient to recommend a clinical use for these markers.<ref name="Cunningham_2010"/>.
A recent study, '''ASPRE''', known to be the largest multi-country prospective trial, has reported a significant performance in identifying pregnant women at high risk of pre-eclampsia yet during the first trimester of pregnancy. Utilizing a combination of maternal history, mean arterial blood pressure, intra-uterine Doppler and PlGF measurment, the study has shown a capacity to identify more than '''75% of the women''' that will develop pre-eclampsia, allowing early intervention to prevent development of later symptoms.<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28741785/</ref>. This approach is now officially recommended by the International Federation of Gynecologists & Obstetricians (FIGO) <ref>https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijgo.12802</ref>

* Recent studies have shown that looking for [[podocyte]]s (specialized cells of the kidney) in the urine has the potential to aid in the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Studies have demonstrated that finding podocytes in the urine may serve as an early marker of and diagnostic test for pre-eclampsia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Craici IM, Wagner SJ, Bailey KR, Fitz-Gibbon PD, Wood-Wentz CM, Turner ST, Hayman SR, White WM, Brost BC, Rose CH, Grande JP, Garovic VD | display-authors = 6 | title = Podocyturia predates proteinuria and clinical features of preeclampsia: longitudinal prospective study | journal = Hypertension | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 1289–96 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23529165 | pmc = 3713793 | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01115 }}</ref><ref name="BBC News - Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021| work = BBC News | title = Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy |access-date=2011-11-22 |date=2011-11-12 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118120704/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|archive-date=2011-11-18}}</ref><ref name="Brown_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown CM, Garovic VD | title = Mechanisms and management of hypertension in pregnant women | journal = Current Hypertension Reports | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 338–46 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21656283 | pmc = 3746761 | doi = 10.1007/s11906-011-0214-y }}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===

Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be confused with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and [[pancreatic disease]], immune or [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when pre-existing conditions such as [[hypertension]] are present.<ref name=AMN1>{{cite web | title =Pre-eclampsia-Eclampsia | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia | url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/pre-eclampsia_eclampsia/ | year = 2003 | access-date=2005-11-23}}</ref> Women with [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage.

==Prevention==
Preventive measures against pre-eclampsia have been heavily studied. Because the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is not completely understood, prevention remains a complex issue. Below are some of the currently accepted recommendations.

===Diet===
Supplementation with a balanced protein and energy diet does not appear to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ota E, Hori H, Mori R, Tobe-Gai R, Farrar D | title = Antenatal dietary education and supplementation to increase energy and protein intake | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD000032 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26031211 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub3 }}</ref> Further, there is no evidence that changing [[salt]] intake has an effect.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Duley L, Henderson-Smart D, Meher S | title = Altered dietary salt for preventing pre-eclampsia, and its complications | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD005548 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16235411 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005548 }}</ref>

Supplementation with [[antioxidant]]s such as vitamin C, D and E has no effect on pre-eclampsia incidence;<ref name="NEJM2006-Rumbold">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rumbold AR, Crowther CA, Haslam RR, Dekker GA, Robinson JS | title = Vitamins C and E and the risks of preeclampsia and perinatal complications | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 17 | pages = 1796–806 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16641396 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa054186 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:387263/UQ387263_OA.pdf | hdl = 2440/23161 }}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|title=WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|date=2011|isbn=978-92-4-154833-5}}</ref> therefore, supplementation with vitamins C, E, and D is not recommended for reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[Calcium]] supplementation of at least 1 gram per day is recommended during pregnancy as it prevents pre-eclampsia where dietary calcium intake is low, especially for those at high risk.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofmeyr GJ, Lawrie TA, Atallah ÁN, Torloni MR | title = Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing hypertensive disorders and related problems | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | pages = CD001059 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30277579 | pmc = 6517256 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub5 }}</ref> Higher [[selenium]] level is associated with lower incidence of pre-eclampsia.<ref name="pmid14634566">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rayman MP, Bode P, Redman CW | title = Low selenium status is associated with the occurrence of the pregnancy disease preeclampsia in women from the United Kingdom | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 189 | issue = 5 | pages = 1343–9 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14634566 | doi = 10.1067/S0002-9378(03)00723-3 | url = http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/186025/1/Se_toenailsAJOGFinal.pdf | access-date = 2019-06-30 | archive-date = 2018-07-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180720090845/http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/186025/1/Se_toenailsAJOGFinal.pdf | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu T, Zhang M, Guallar E, Wang G, Hong X, Wang X, Mueller NT | title = Trace Minerals, Heavy Metals, and Preeclampsia: Findings from the Boston Birth Cohort | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 8 | issue = 16 | pages = e012436 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31426704 | pmc = 6759885 | doi = 10.1161/JAHA.119.012436 }}</ref> Higher [[cadmium]] level is associated with higher incidence of pre-eclampsia.<ref name=":0" /> 

===Aspirin===
Taking [[aspirin]] is associated with a 1 to 5% reduction in pre-eclampsia and a 1 to 5% reduction in premature births in women at high risk.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duley |first1=L |last2=Meher |first2=S |last3=Hunter |first3=KE |last4=Seidler |first4=AL |last5=Askie |first5=LM |title=Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=30 October 2019 |volume=2019 |issue=10 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004659.pub3 |pmid=31684684|pmc=6820858 }}</ref> The [[World Health Organization]] recommends low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women at high risk and recommends it be started before 20 weeks of pregnancy.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends a low-dose regimen for women at high risk beginning in the 12th week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaspg.htm |title=Low-Dose Aspirin Use for the Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality From Preeclampsia |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=Sep 2014 |publisher=United States Preventive Services Task Force |access-date=17 Sep 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917203610/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaspg.htm |archive-date=17 September 2014 }}</ref> Benefits are less if started after 16 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberge S, Nicolaides K, Demers S, Hyett J, Chaillet N, Bujold E | title = The role of aspirin dose on the prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 216 | issue = 2 | pages = 110–120.e6 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27640943 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2016.09.076 | s2cid = 3079979 }}</ref>.

The more recent study ASPRE, beside its performance in identifying suspected women to develop pre-eclampsia, has also been able to demonstrate a strong drop in the rate of early pre-eclampsia (-82%) and preterm pre-eclampsia (-62%). Such efficacy of aspirin has been reached due to high performing screening to identify at high risk women, adjusted profilaxis dosage (150mg/day), timing of the intake (bedtime) and must start before week 16 of pregnancy.<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28741785/</ref>

===Physical activity===
There is insufficient evidence to recommend either exercise<ref name="Cochrane2006-Meher-exercise">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meher S, Duley L | title = Exercise or other physical activity for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD005942 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16625645 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005942 | editor1-last = Meher | editor1-first = Shireen }}</ref> or strict bedrest<ref name="Cochrane2006-Meher-rest">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meher S, Duley L | title = Rest during pregnancy for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD005939 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16625644 | pmc = 6823233 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005939 | editor1-last = Meher | editor1-first = Shireen }}</ref> as preventive measures of pre-eclampsia.

===Smoking cessation===
In low-risk pregnancies, the association between cigarette [[smoking]] and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology increases the risk of pre-eclampsia to such a degree that any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked.<ref name="pmid18566591">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeyabalan A, Powers RW, Durica AR, Harger GF, Roberts JM, Ness RB | title = Cigarette smoke exposure and angiogenic factors in pregnancy and preeclampsia | journal = American Journal of Hypertension | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 943–7 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18566591 | pmc = 2613772 | doi = 10.1038/ajh.2008.219 }}</ref> However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of pre-eclampsia.<ref name=Lancet2010/> It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitworth M, Dowswell T | title = Routine pre-pregnancy health promotion for improving pregnancy outcomes | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD007536 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19821424 | pmc = 4164828 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007536.pub2 }}</ref>

===Immune modulation===
{{anchor|paternal tolerance}} 
Some studies have suggested the importance of a woman's [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|gestational immunological tolerance]] to her baby's father, as the baby and father share genetics. There is tentative evidence that ongoing exposure either by vaginal or oral sex to the same semen that resulted in the pregnancy decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia.<ref name=SeminalPriming>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP | title = Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–65 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12896827 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4 }}</ref> As one early study described, "although pre-eclampsia is a disease of first pregnancies, the protective effect of multiparity is lost with change of partner".<ref name=Dekk9618714>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dekker GA, Robillard PY, Hulsey TC | title = Immune maladaptation in the etiology of preeclampsia: a review of corroborative epidemiologic studies | journal = Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–82 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618714 | doi = 10.1097/00006254-199806000-00023 }}</ref> The study also concluded that although women with changing partners are strongly advised to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, "a certain period of sperm exposure within a stable relation, when pregnancy is aimed for, is associated with protection against pre-eclampsia".<ref name="Dekk9618714"/>

Several other studies have since investigated the decreased incidence of pre-eclampsia in women who had received blood transfusions from their partner, those with long preceding histories of sex without barrier contraceptives, and in women who had been regularly performing [[oral sex]].<ref name=Elizabeth_Bonney>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonney EA | title = Preeclampsia: a view through the danger model | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 76 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 68–74 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17482268 | pmc = 2246056 | doi = 10.1016/j.jri.2007.03.006 }}</ref>

Having already noted the importance of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen.<ref name="Elizabeth_Bonney"/><ref name = mattar_sexual_behavior>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattar R, Soares RV, Daher S | title = Sexual behavior and recurrent spontaneous abortion | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–5 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15694097 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.11.006 }}</ref> A team from the [[University of Adelaide]] has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in [[miscarriage]] or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-beta]].

As the theory of immune intolerance as a cause of pre-eclampsia has become accepted, women who with repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as TGF-beta along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.<ref name="SeminalPriming"/>

==Treatment==
The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother.<ref name=Lancet2010/> The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations.<ref>{{cite book | veditors = Beckmann CR, Ling FW, Smith RP, Barzansky BM, Herbert WN, Laube DW, ((American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)) |title=Obstetrics and gynecology.|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0781788076|edition=6th}}</ref> These considerations are situation-specific and management will vary with situation, location, and institution. Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by [[Labor induction|induction of labor]] or [[Caesarean section]], in addition to medications. Important in management is the assessment of the mother's organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCall CA, Grimes DA, Lyerly AD | title = "Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 121 | issue = 6 | pages = 1305–8 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23812466 | doi = 10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f | s2cid = 9069311 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e3179c9cd536cb0f81ba853513d7ac6c0b39637d }}</ref>

===Blood pressure===
The World Health Organization recommends that women with severe [[hypertension]] during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents.<ref name=WHO2011/> Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110.<ref name=ACOG2013/> Evidence does not support the use of one anti-hypertensive over another.<ref name=Lancet2010/> The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability.<ref name=WHO2011/> Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.<ref name=WHO2011/> [[Labetalol]], [[hydralazine]] and [[nifedipine]] are commonly used antihypertensive agents for [[Hypertensive disease of pregnancy|hypertension in pregnancy]].<ref name=Aru2013/> [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[Angiotensin II receptor blocker|angiotensin receptor blockers]] are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.<ref name="Harrison's" />

The goal of treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is to prevent cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications.<ref name=ACOG2013/> The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.<ref>[http://www.nvog-documenten.nl/uploaded/docs/Hypertensieve%20aandoeningen/Hypertensive_disorders_in_pregnancy%5B1%5D.pdf Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy.

===Prevention of eclampsia===
The intrapartum and postpartum administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended in severe pre-eclampsia for the prevention of [[eclampsia]].<ref name=WHO2011/><ref name=Lancet2010/> Further, magnesium sulfate is recommended for the treatment of eclampsia over other anticonvulsants.<ref name=WHO2011/> Magnesium sulfate acts by interacting with [[NMDA receptor]]s.<ref name="Harrison's" />

==Epidemiology==
Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide,<ref name=Ei2012/><ref name=Al2014/><ref>World Health Organization (WHO). World health report 2005: make every mother and child count. Geneva: WHO; 2005, p. 63</ref> The incidence of pre-eclampsia has risen in the U.S. since the 1990s, possibly as a result of increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.<ref name=Lancet2010/>

Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.<ref name=Ei2012/> Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.<ref name=WHO2011/>

Pre-eclampsia is much more common in women who are pregnant for the first time.<ref>Robbins and Cotran, ''Pathological Basis of Disease, 7th ed.''</ref> Women who have previously been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.<ref name=Aru2013/> Pre-eclampsia is also more common in women who have pre-existing [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], [[autoimmune]] diseases such as [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], various inherited thrombophilias such as [[Factor V Leiden]], [[chronic renal failure|renal disease]], multiple gestation ([[twin]]s or [[multiple birth]]), and advanced maternal age.<ref name=Aru2013/> Women who live at high altitude are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes LE, Armaza JF, Niermeyer S, Vargas E, Young DA, Moore LG | title = Intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and intrauterine mortality at high altitude in Bolivia | journal = Pediatric Research | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–5 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12700368 | doi = 10.1203/01.PDR.0000069846.64389.DC | s2cid = 25586771 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore LG, Shriver M, Bemis L, Hickler B, Wilson M, Brutsaert T, Parra E, Vargas E | display-authors = 6 | title = Maternal adaptation to high-altitude pregnancy: an experiment of nature--a review | journal = Placenta | volume = 25 Suppl A | pages = S60-71 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15033310 | doi = 10.1016/j.placenta.2004.01.008 | url = http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Moore%20et%20al.,%202004.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817104315/http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Moore%20et%20al.%2C%202004.pdf | archive-date = 2016-08-17 | access-date = 2016-06-14 }}</ref> Pre-eclampsia is also more common in some ethnic groups (e.g. African-Americans, Sub-Saharan Africans, Latin Americans, African Caribbeans, and Filipinos).<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Urquia ML, Glazier RH, Gagnon AJ, Mortensen LH, Nybo Andersen AM, Janevic T, Guendelman S, Thornton D, Bolumar F, Río Sánchez I, Small R, Davey MA, Hjern A | display-authors = 6 | title = Disparities in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among immigrant women giving birth in six industrialised countries | journal = BJOG | volume = 121 | issue = 12 | pages = 1492–500 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24758368 | pmc = 4232918 | doi = 10.1111/1471-0528.12758 }}</ref> Change of paternity in a subsequent pregnancy has been implicated as affecting risk, except in those with a family history of hypertensive pregnancy<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hjartardottir S, Leifsson BG, Geirsson RT, Steinthorsdottir V | title = Paternity change and the recurrence risk in familial hypertensive disorder in pregnancy | journal = Hypertension in Pregnancy | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 219–25 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15369654 | doi = 10.1081/PRG-120037889 | s2cid = 8936562 }}</ref>

[[Eclampsia]] is a major complication of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1,000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10 to 30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.<ref name=Aru2013/>

==Complications==
Complications of pre-eclampsia can affect both the mother and the fetus. Acutely, pre-eclampsia can be complicated by [[eclampsia]], the development of [[HELLP syndrome]], hemorrhagic or ischemic [[stroke]], liver damage and dysfunction, [[acute kidney injury]], and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).<ref name=Aru2013/><ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/>

Pre-eclampsia is also associated with increased frequency of [[Caesarean section]], [[Preterm birth|preterm delivery]], and [[placental abruption]]. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals in the first week postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/> Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or perinatal death.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/>

Long-term, an individual with pre-eclampsia is at increased risk for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.

===Eclampsia===
[[Eclampsia]] is the development of new [[convulsion]]s in a pre-eclamptic patient that may not be attributed to other cause. It is a sign that the underlying pre-eclamptic condition is severe and is associated with high rates of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.<ref name=WHO2011/> Warning symptoms for eclampsia in an individual with current pre-eclampsia may include headaches, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain, with a headache being the most consistent symptom.<ref name=Lancet2010/><ref name="Cunningham_2010" /> [[Magnesium sulfate]] is used to prevent convulsions in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.

===HELLP Syndrome===
[[HELLP syndrome]] is defined as [[hemolysis]] (microangiopathic), elevated liver enzymes (liver dysfunction), and low platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]). This condition may occur in 10–20% of patients with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia<ref name=Lancet2010/> and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In 50% of instances, HELLP syndrome develops preterm, while 20% of cases develop in late gestation and 30% during the post-partum period.<ref name=Aru2013/>

===Long term===
There is also an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease.<ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/> Other risks include [[stroke]] and [[Venous thrombosis|venous thromboembolism]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellamy L, Casas JP, Hingorani AD, Williams DJ | title = Pre-eclampsia and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in later life: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 335 | issue = 7627 | pages = 974 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17975258 | pmc = 2072042 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39335.385301.BE }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonald SD, Malinowski A, Zhou Q, Yusuf S, Devereaux PJ | title = Cardiovascular sequelae of preeclampsia/eclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analyses | journal = American Heart Journal | volume = 156 | issue = 5 | pages = 918–30 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19061708 | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2008.06.042 }}</ref> It seems pre-eclampsia does not increase the risk of [[cancer]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Lowered blood supply to the fetus in pre-eclampsia causes lowered nutrient supply, which could result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight.<ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/> The fetal origins hypothesis states that fetal undernutrition is linked with coronary heart disease later in adult life due to disproportionate growth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker DJ | title = Fetal origins of coronary heart disease | journal = BMJ | volume = 311 | issue = 6998 | pages = 171–4 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7613432 | pmc = 2550226 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.311.6998.171 }}</ref>

Because pre-eclampsia leads to a mismatch between the maternal energy supply and fetal energy demands, pre-eclampsia can lead to IUGR in the developing fetus.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma D, Shastri S, Sharma P | title = Intrauterine Growth Restriction: Antenatal and Postnatal Aspects | journal = Clinical Medicine Insights. Pediatrics | volume = 10 | pages = 67–83 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27441006 | pmc = 4946587 | doi = 10.4137/CMPed.S40070 }}</ref> Infants suffering from IUGR are prone to suffer from poor neuronal development and in increased risk for adult disease according to the Barker hypothesis. Associated adult diseases of the fetus due to IUGR include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer, osteoporosis, and various psychiatric illnesses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Calkins K, Devaskar SU | title = Fetal origins of adult disease | journal = Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 158–76 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21684471 | pmc = 4608552 | doi = 10.1016/j.cppeds.2011.01.001 }}</ref>

The risk of pre-eclampsia and development of placental dysfunction has also been shown to be recurrent cross-generationally on the maternal side and most likely on the paternal side. Fetuses born to mothers who were born small for gestational age (SGA) were 50% more likely to develop pre-eclampsia while fetuses born to both SGA parents were three-fold more likely to develop pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wikström AK, Svensson T, Kieler H, Cnattingius S | title = Recurrence of placental dysfunction disorders across generations | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 205 | issue = 5 | pages = 454.e1–8 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21722870 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2011.05.009 }}</ref>

==History==
The word "eclampsia" is from the Greek term for [[lightning]].<ref name=Em2006/> The first known description of the condition was by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BC.<ref name=Em2006/>

An outdated medical term for pre-eclampsia is [[wikt:toxemia|toxemia]] of pregnancy, a term that originated in the mistaken belief that the condition was caused by [[toxins]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |title=Toxemia of pregnancy &#124; medical disorder | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2013-06-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328201744/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |archive-date=2014-03-28 }}</ref>
