The '''Donald J. Trump Foundation''' was a New York-based [[private foundation]] founded and chaired by [[Donald Trump]] which was in operation from 1988 until its court-ordered dissolution in 2019.

Trump created the foundation to help donate proceeds from his book ''[[Trump: The Art of the Deal]]'' to charitable causes''.'' He stopped contributing personal funds to the foundation in 2008, though he continued to solicit donations from outsiders.<ref name="Promised millions" /><ref name="A mixed bag" /><ref name="Hasn't Contributed" />

The foundation's activities were scrutinized during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election campaign]], initially by ''[[The Washington Post]]'s'' [[David Fahrenthold]], who was later awarded the 2017 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for his investigation. Law-enforcement investigations subsequently discovered various ethical and legal violations, including failure to register in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[self-dealing]], and illegal campaign contributions.<ref>{{cite newspaper|author=David A.

In September 2016 the New York attorney general's office, which administers the state's Charities Bureau, announced it was investigating the Trump Foundation based on its failure to file required forms with the bureau.

== Investigations by ''The Washington Post'' and others ==

During the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]], [[David Fahrenthold]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' initiated an investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving after Trump had held a fundraiser for veterans in January 2016 in lieu of appearing at a televised Republican debate. Trump claimed that the event raised $6 million for veteran's causes, including purportedly one million of his own money.<ref name="WaPoVets" /><ref name="Skipping debate headlines">{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-01-28/skipping-gop-debate-trump-headlines-event-for-veterans|title=Skipping GOP Debate-Trump Headlines Event For Veterans|date=January 28, 2016|publisher=USA Today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106050926/https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-01-28/skipping-gop-debate-trump-headlines-event-for-veterans|archive-date=November 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-ever-happened-to-all-that-money-trump-raised-for-the-veterans/2016/03/03/fbafd9a0-e0b2-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html|title=What ever happened to all that money Trump raised for the veterans?|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=November 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215947/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-ever-happened-to-all-that-money-trump-raised-for-the-veterans/2016/03/03/fbafd9a0-e0b2-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html|archive-date=November 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Fahrenthold began his investigation by attempting to verify the receipt and disbursal of the $6 million.

Accusations against Trump and his foundation include the following:

=== Failure to maintain proper governance ===

In a June 2018 petition filed by the office of the New York attorney general, it was explained that:
{{quote|"...{{nbsp}}none of the Foundation's expenditures or activities were approved by its Board of Directors. The investigation found that the Board existed in name only: it did not meet after 1999; it did not set policy or criteria for choosing grant recipients, and it did not approve of any grants. Mr. Trump alone made all decisions related to the Foundation.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-underwood-announces-lawsuit-against-donald-j-trump-foundation-and-its |title=Attorney General Underwood Announces Lawsuit Against Donald J.

In an exhibit attached to the filing, Trump Foundation treasurer Allen Weisselberg claimed he had not been aware that he was the treasurer or on the board of the foundation until he was approached by investigators.<ref name=exhibit6 />

=== Solicitation of donations without a license ===

Under New York State law, a not-for-profit foundation must register as a "7A Charitable Organization" if it plans to solicit outside donations over $25,000 in any year.<ref name="licensing">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Donald J.

=== Grants to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library ===

In each of 1995 and 1999, the Trump Foundation granted $50,000 to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library. A 2001 report by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' stated, after visiting the museum in [[East Harlem]], that the facility had "next to no art" and no official connection to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]], despite a ten year record of having solicited large-scale donations for its collection. The ''Voice'' and, later, ''The Washington Post'', concluded that Trump may have directed the grants to the museum to curry favor with the museum's then-chairman, Eddie Malloy, who was also head of the [[Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York]]. The Council had worked on behalf of one of the unions of workers who worked on Trump construction projects.<ref name="Boasts Falls Short">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html|title=Trump boasts about his philanthropy.

=== Failure to make pledged 9/11 grants ===

An investigation by the [[New York City Comptroller]]'s office in October 2016 showed that Trump and/or the Donald Trump Foundation may have failed to honor at least one pledge to charities established to provide relief for victims of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]]. Trump had made a pledge of $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in late September 2001.<ref name="NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation">{{cite news|first=Cameron|last=Joseph|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-lied-donating-9-11-charities-article-1.2829908|title=NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation reveals Donald Trump may have lied about donating to 9/11 charities|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=October 13, 2016|access-date=October 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014002406/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-lied-donating-9-11-charities-article-1.2829908|archive-date=October 14, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Twin Towers Fund, later administered as part of the New York City Public and Private Initiative, was created by then-[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] "to benefit the families of firefighters and police officers who died in the attacks."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/nyregion/costs-of-twin-towers-fund-draws-criticism.html|title=Costs of Twin Towers Fund Draws Criticism|last=Herszenhorn|first=David M.|date=February 9, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826213304/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/nyregion/costs-of-twin-towers-fund-draws-criticism.html|archive-date=August 26, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], Giuliani announced that Trump had made unspecified "anonymous" donations after the September 11 attacks, although such donations have not been identified.<ref name="NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation" /> Giuliani also said, in support of Trump's candidacy, "Every time New York City suffered a tragedy Donald Trump was there to help{{nbsp}}... He's not going to like my telling you this but he did it anonymously."<ref name="NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation" />

The New York City Comptroller's office told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' it had manually reviewed "approximately 1,500 pages of donor records of the Twin Towers Fund and the related entity NYC Public/Private Initiatives Inc., containing the names of more than 110,000 individuals and entities that were collected as part of the audits" through August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nyc-audit-finds-donald-trump-donations-911-months/story?id=42801444|title=Despite 2001 Vow, Trump Made No 9/11 Donations in Year After Attack, Audit Finds|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=October 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014130525/https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nyc-audit-finds-donald-trump-donations-911-months/story?id=42801444|archive-date=October 14, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> According to the ''News'', Comptroller [[Scott Stringer]] "found that Trump and [the Trump Foundation] hadn't donated a dime in the months after 9/11"; however, because the reviewed period covered only one year after the attacks, the Comptroller's office was "unable to conclude definitively" that Trump never gave to the fund after August 2002.<ref name="NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation" /> According to its [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[Form 990]] tax filings, the Trump Foundation made no grants to the Twin Towers Fund or to NYC Public/Private Initiatives, Inc. from 2002 through 2014, although Trump may have made personal donations after August 2002 that would not have shown up in these filings.<ref name="NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation" />

In 2016, after the convention, Trump's campaign suggested that the Trump Foundation made a grant to the [[American Red Cross]] after the attacks; however, no record of it exists in the foundation's tax filings from 2001 through 2014. As with the Twin Towers Fund, if Trump instead had made a personal donation, it would not have shown up in the foundation's records.<ref name="NYC Controller Scott Stringer investigation" />

=== Using Trump Foundation money to settle Trump Organization legal disputes ===

Trump may have used foundation money to settle his personal or business legal disputes on at least two occasions.

In 2007, Trump used Trump Foundation funds to settle a 2006 legal dispute between the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Town of Palm Beach]], [[Florida]], and Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] country club. The town said the club's flagpole violated town height limit rules and levied a daily accruing fine against the club. The club's flagpole was 80 feet tall, 38 feet above limits imposed by the town. Palm Beach began fining Trump $1,250 per day for the violation. Trump countersued Palm Beach for $25 million on US constitutional grounds for restricting his 1st amendment rights of free speech and his 14th amendment rights of equal protection. The suit alleged that at least twenty other properties had violated the height restrictions but were not similarly fined.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-04-24/news/0704240036_1_mar-a-lago-american-flag-flagpole |date=April 24, 2007 |first=Sally |last=Apgar |title=Trump settles dispute over flag |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel |access-date=November 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110164948/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-04-24/news/0704240036_1_mar-a-lago-american-flag-flagpole |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> It also alleged that a shorter flagpole "would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J.

However, Trump then made the grant using foundation money, not his own.<ref name="WaPo258000" /><ref name="Hackney" />

Trump's foundation paid $158,000 to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation as settlement of a suit brought by Greenberg against the [[Trump National Golf Club Westchester]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. Greenberg alleged that he had rightfully won a $1 million prize for scoring a [[hole-in-one]] in a 2010 charity golf tournament at the club but the club had denied the award on technical grounds, arguing the hole was shorter than the required 150 yards.<ref name="WaPoMissing" /> Martin Greenberg sued and a settlement was reached at a significantly reduced amount. ''The Washington Post'' reported that "on the day that Trump and the other parties told the court that they had settled the case, the Donald J. Trump Foundation made its first and only grant to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation, for $158,000."<ref name="WaPoMissing" /> In September 2016, the ''Post'' reported that the grant was directly linked to the legal settlement, likely violating IRS self-dealing rules by using charitable funds to pay Trump's personal or business obligations.<ref name="WaPo258000">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html|title=Trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems|last=Farenthold|first=David A.|date=September 20, 2016|work=The Washington Post|access-date=September 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920191416/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html|archive-date=September 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> To raise the money needed to make the settlement, the Trump Foundation auctioned a prize of lifetime golf membership at Trump-owned golf courses, with the winning bid bringing a $157,000 donation to the Trump Foundation to the foundation to offset the payment to the Greenberg Foundation.<ref name="Self-Dealing">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/28/495782978/journalist-says-trump-foundation-may-have-engaged-in-self-dealing|title=Journalist Says Trump Foundation May Have Engaged In 'Self-Dealing'|website=Npr.org|access-date=September 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929000019/http://www.npr.org/2016/09/28/495782978/journalist-says-trump-foundation-may-have-engaged-in-self-dealing|archive-date=September 29, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The winner of the auction may have believed he was donating to Trump Foundation charitable causes.<ref name="Self-Dealing" />

=== Donation to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi ===

According to a Trump Foundation attorney, "the [$25,000] contribution was made in error due to a case of mistaken identity of organizations with the same name." Trump later personally reimbursed his foundation for the $25,000. The foundation paid a $2,500 fine for violating IRS rules against political contributions by charitable organizations.<ref name="WaPoPenalty" /> In 2016 New York attorney general [[Eric Schneiderman]] said publicly that the Trump Foundation was the subject of an ongoing investigation by his office.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html|title=State Attorney General Orders Trump Foundation to Cease Raising Money in New York|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=October 3, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225013459/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html|archive-date=December 25, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), a not-for-profit watchdog group, filed a complaint with the IRS (see below). It also cast doubt on Trump's story after obtaining a letter from the Trump Foundation's attorney to the New York attorney general's office. "We're past the point where a reasonable person could believe this is just a never-ending series of once in a lifetime errors," said CREW Communications Director Jordan Libowitz. "This may not be anything nefarious, but if it isn't, that would mean that the Trump operation is completely inept when it comes to running the Trump Foundation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/trump-foundations-got-problems-taxes/|title=The Trump Foundation's Got Problems with Its Taxes.

On October 5, 2016, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported details of how Trump had on several other occasions since as early as the 1980s made campaign donations to various US state attorneys general while they had been reviewing cases involving the Trump Organization or Trump personally, although the Bondi case is the only one it cited as having involved Trump Foundation money.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-often-made-donations-to-state-attorneys-general-reviewing-his-business-1475689963|title=Donald Trump Often Made Donations to State Attorneys General Reviewing His Business|last=Rothfeld|first=Michael|date=October 5, 2016|last2=Berzon|first2=Alexandra|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=October 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005183050/http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-often-made-donations-to-state-attorneys-general-reviewing-his-business-1475689963|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Grants allegedly made for political purposes ===

Trump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation funds in 2012 to [[Franklin Graham|Reverend Franklin Graham]]'s [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|Billy Graham Evangelical Association]].

The ''Observer'' has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of [[Mitt Romney]]'s campaign.<ref name="Praises McCrory">{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/religion/article108054712.html|title=Franklin Graham praises McCrory, blames Charlotte for HB2-related disruption|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|access-date=October 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016182144/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/religion/article108054712.html|archive-date=October 16, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Graham also heads [[Boone, North Carolina]]-based [[Samaritan's Purse]], a Christian relief agency that received $25,000 from the Trump Foundation in 2012. Graham credits then-[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] anchor [[Greta Van Susteren]] for having solicited that donation. Van Susteren and her TV crew had accompanied Graham on Samaritan's Purse trips to Haiti and North Korea. The ''Charlotte Observer'' quoted Graham saying, "[Trump] was on her show, and [Van Susteren] said, 'I was just in Haiti and Samaritan's Purse is doing this down there, and Donald, you need to help.' He sent a check out."<ref name="Praises McCrory" /> In 2016, several media outlets alleged that Van Susteren had been producing overtly pro-Trump reports on her Fox News show [[On the Record (Fox News TV series)|''On the Record'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mediamatters.org/research/2016/05/26/media-figures-mock-greta-van-susterens-hour-long-trump-infomercial/210608|title=Media Figures Mock Greta Van Susteren's Hour-Long Trump Infomercial|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=Media Matters for America|access-date=October 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012232547/http://www.mediamatters.org/research/2016/05/26/media-figures-mock-greta-van-susterens-hour-long-trump-infomercial/210608|archive-date=October 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

* The Trump Foundation's grant of $10,000 in 2013 to [[The Family Leader]] may have led to a speaking engagement for Trump.

=== Partial payment of an assessment owed by the Plaza Hotel ===

In 1989, the Trump Foundation paid more than half a "voluntary assessment" imposed on the [[Plaza Hotel]] by the [[Central Park Conservancy]]. The hotel was owned by the Trump Organization at the time and the assessment was for the renovation of the severely dilapidated [[Pulitzer Fountain]] at [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]], which directly faced the hotel. Toward the $500,000 assessment, the foundation granted $264,631 to the Conservancy while the Trump Organization paid between $100,000 and $250,000. The grant to the Conservancy was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation from inception through at least 2015.<ref name="Boasts Falls Short" />

=== Diversion of taxable income to the foundation as donations ===

''The Washington Post'' reported in September 2016 that Donald Trump had directed that $2.3 million owed to him and his organization by various people and organizations should be paid instead to his foundation as donations, possibly evading personal income taxes.<ref name=WaPoDirected>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-directed-23-million-owed-to-him-to-his-charity-instead/2016/09/26/7a9e9fac-8352-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Trump directed $2.3 million owed to him to his tax-exempt foundation instead|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=September 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926221601/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-directed-23-million-owed-to-him-to-his-charity-instead/2016/09/26/7a9e9fac-8352-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|archive-date=September 26, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''Post'' found old ''[[Associated Press]]'' coverage showing that Trump may have started directing income to the Trump Foundation as early as 1989. IRS rules prohibit individuals from diverting taxable income owed to them toward charities if they benefit directly from those charities unless the individual declares the income on his tax forms.<ref name="WaPoDirected" /> Since Trump had yet to release his income taxes at that time, the ''Post'' was unable to confirm if the income was declared for any of the donations received.<ref name="WaPoDirected" />

The Trump Foundation received at least $1.9 million from ticket broker Richard Ebers. Richard Ebers had bought goods and services, including tickets, from "Trump or his businesses"; he was allegedly instructed to make payment for them to the Trump Foundation in the form of charitable contributions instead of as income for the Trump organization.<ref name="WaPoDirected" />

The Trump Foundation received a total of $5 million in donations from [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] owner [[Vince McMahon]] and his wife [[Linda McMahon]] from 2007 to 2009.<ref name="WaPoDirected" /> Trump appeared twice in [[WrestleMania]] events, in 2007 and again in 2009. One donation to the foundation was $4 million in 2007; the second was $1 million in 2009. The WWE later told [[The Huffington Post]] that "during this period, WWE paid Donald Trump appearance fees separately," and "separately, [WWE chief executives] Vince and Linda McMahon made personal donations to Donald Trump's foundation."<ref name="His Record Suggests" />

In 2007, the Celebrity Fight Night Foundation hosted a fundraiser to benefit the [[Muhammad Ali Center|Muhammad Ali Parkinson's Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. According to a Celebrity Fight Night Foundation spokesperson, in return for Trump's appearance and his offering a New York-based dinner with himself at auction, Trump stipulated that the Parkinson's charity share the total auction proceeds with the Trump Foundation. The Trump Foundation subsequently received $150,000 of auction proceeds that would otherwise have gone to the center benefitting [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's Disease]] research.<ref name="His Record Suggests" />

Other donations made to the Trump Foundation that may have been in return for Trump's personal work include:

=== Trump taking personal credit for donations made using foundation money ===

Both ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Fox News]] reported that Trump repeatedly claimed in public, beginning in 2015, to have made over "$102 million" in charitable donations "in the past five years". The Trump Organization provided journalists with a 93-page list of the donations. None of the cash donations were confirmed to come from Trump himself; many were actually grants from the Trump Foundation.<ref name="WaPoMissing" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/a-94-page-list-of-donald-trumps-charitable-contributions-from-the-last-five-years/2013/|title=A 93-page list of Donald Trump's charitable contributions from the last five years|work=The Washington Post|access-date=September 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923050659/https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/a-94-page-list-of-donald-trumps-charitable-contributions-from-the-last-five-years/2013/|archive-date=September 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2016/06/29/have-you-given-more-cash-to-charity-than-donald-trump/|title=Have you given more to charity than Donald Trump?|date=June 29, 2016|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815131440/https://fox6now.com/2016/06/29/have-you-given-more-cash-to-charity-than-donald-trump/|archive-date=August 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

For example, Trump took personal credit and was honored for a Trump Foundation grant to the Palm Beach Police Foundation that was actually from an outside source (see above). He had pledged the money personally, and then the Trump Foundation solicited the $150,000 earmarked for the police foundation from an unrelated philanthropic organization, the Charles Evans Foundation. The Trump Foundation then paid the Palm Beach charity.<ref name="Retooled" /> The police then honored Trump personally with its annual Palm Tree Award at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] hotel at its annual fundraiser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpolicefoundation.org/palm-tree-award|title=Palm Tree Award|publisher=Palm Beach Police Foundation|access-date=September 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923032036/http://www.palmbeachpolicefoundation.org/palm-tree-award|archive-date=September 23, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' wrote that "Trump had effectively turned the Evans Foundation's gifts into his gifts, without adding any money of his own."<ref name="End NY Fundraising">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37547094 |title=End NY fundraising, Trump foundation told |date=October 4, 2016 |work=BBC News |access-date=December 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227165747/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37547094 |archive-date=December 27, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] has honored Trump variously as "Grand Benefactor" and "Grand Honorary Chair" at its annual fundraisers held at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate. Trump may have also earned more money on the event fees it received from the institute than the Trump Foundation paid to the institute in grants. Trump has directed at least $300,000 of grants of the Trump Foundation money to Dana-Farber since 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/dana-farber-trump/|title=How Trump was named 'Grand Benefactor' for a Dana-Farber gala without donating a penny|date=September 29, 2016|website=Statnews.com|access-date=September 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929125152/https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/dana-farber-trump/|archive-date=September 29, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Trump received highly visible praise for his generosity on his prime-time television show ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. He frequently offered to make generous donations to his contestants' charities, but records show that he ultimately either directed the Trump Foundation to make a grant or had the show's network, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]], make the donation.<ref name="WaPoMissing" /> Examples include:
* A 2008 episode where Trump told contestant and mixed-martial arts star [[Tito Ortiz]]: "I think you're so incredible that—personally, out of my account—I'm going to give you $50,000 for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude's]] [children's hospital]," Ortiz's chosen charity and also a favorite named a charity of Trump's son, [[Eric Trump|Eric]].

* In 2012 Trump promised at least six personal donations of $10,000 each to contestants' chosen charities during one episode of ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]''. In another episode of the same season, he pledged $10,000 to contestant [[Aubrey O'Day]]'s chosen charity, a gift "that moved [contestant and comedienne Lisa] [[Lisa Lampanelli|Lampanelli]] to tears."<ref name="Promised Personal Gifts" /> According to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s review of tax filings, Trump directed all this money to be granted to the charities out of Trump Foundation funds.<ref name="Promised Personal Gifts" />
* In 2013 Trump promised personal donations of $20,000 each to the charities of basketball star [[Dennis Rodman]], singer [[La Toya Jackson]], former [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Brande Roderick]], and actor [[Gary Busey]] during episodes of the ''Celebrity Apprentice.'' Trump then used Trump Foundation money to make the payments.<ref name="Promised Personal Gifts" /> "Remember, Donald Trump is a very nice person, okay?" he told them. According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter, who reviewed transcripts of the show, by 2013 "contestants had come to expect these gifts—and even to demand them when Trump didn't offer money on his own."<ref name="Promised Personal Gifts" />
* A gift to Starkey Hearing Foundation, a charity chosen by an actress [[Marlee Matlin]]. Trump was credited with a personal donation of at least $14,000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hearingreview.com/2011/04/marlee-matlin-raises-986000-for-the-starkey-hearing-foundation/|title=Marlee Matlin Raises $986,000 for the Starkey Hearing Foundation—Hearing Review|newspaper=Hearing Review|language=en-US|access-date=October 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204111552/http://www.hearingreview.com/2011/04/marlee-matlin-raises-986000-for-the-starkey-hearing-foundation/|archive-date=February 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> but the donation came from the Trump Foundation.<ref name="Promised Personal Gifts" />

Other alleged examples include:
* Trump using foundation money to pay the personal bills of a viewer of the TV show [[Extra (U.S. TV program)|'' Extra'']]. In 2009 he appeared on the show and promised he would pay a struggling viewer's domestic bills. "This is a bad time for a lot of people," Trump said as the contest was announced. Trump eventually paid the winner with Trump Foundation money.<ref name="WaPoMissing" /> A Trump representative later explained that the grant was legal because the winner qualified as an "indigent" individual under [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 4945(d)(3), a contention at least one tax expert has disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/05/01/donald-trump-turns-extra-contest-winner-into-charitable-contribution|title=Donald Trump Gave Himself Tax Break for Helping Contest Winner|date=May 1, 2011|website=Showbiz411.com|access-date=November 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104075226/http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/05/01/donald-trump-turns-extra-contest-winner-into-charitable-contribution|archive-date=November 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Making grants to other private foundations without fulfilling IRS "expenditure responsibility" rules ===

The Trump Foundation is responsible by law for ensuring that any grant it makes to another private foundation is used strictly for charitable purposes. To fulfill this [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] "expenditure responsibility" the foundation is required to attach "full and detailed" reports describing the use of the grant money to its IRS 990 tax return for each year a grant to a private foundation is made.<ref name="Greenblatt IRS rules">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbc26.com/news/national/democracy-2016/exclusive-trumps-private-foundation-violates-irs-rules-experts-say|title=Exclusive: Trump's private foundation violates IRS rules, experts say|last=Greenblatt|first=Mark|date=October 20, 2016|newspaper=WGBA|language=en-US|access-date=October 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021135952/http://www.nbc26.com/news/national/democracy-2016/exclusive-trumps-private-foundation-violates-irs-rules-experts-say|archive-date=October 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Trump Foundation tax returns show that it failed to do this for all twenty of the grants it made to private foundations during the period of 2005 through 2014.

In 2015 Ukrainian [[Victor Pinchuk]] made a $150,000 donation to the Trump Foundation in return for Trump's appearance by video conference link at the Yalta European Strategy Conference.

Pinchuk is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kuchma|Lionid Kuchma]]. In 2018 the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that the office of [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel]] Robert Mueller was investigating the donation as a possible illegal in-kind campaign contribution from a foreign national intended to curry favor with then-candidate Trump.<ref name="Investigating Ukrainian">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-mueller-ukraine-victor-pinchuk.html|title=Mueller Investigating Ukrainian's $150,000 Payment for a Trump Appearance|date=April 9, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410002905/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-mueller-ukraine-victor-pinchuk.html|archive-date=April 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Hannon Slate">{{cite news|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/mueller-reportedly-investigating-usd150-000-trump-foundation-payment-by-ukrainian-billionaire-during-campaign.html|title=Mueller Reportedly Investigating $150,000 Payment to Trump Foundation by Ukrainian Billionaire During Campaign|last=Hannon|first=Elliot|work=Slate|access-date=April 10, 2018|date=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410085854/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/mueller-reportedly-investigating-usd150-000-trump-foundation-payment-by-ukrainian-billionaire-during-campaign.html|archive-date=April 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Legal actions and closure ==
=== Intended dissolution of the Trump Foundation ===

In September and October 2016 there were several legal actions and complaints filed against the Trump Foundation. The former head of the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service's]] Office of Exempt Organizations Division Marc Owens told ''The Washington Post'' regarding the various allegations against the foundation: "This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues{{nbsp}}... It's the first time I've ever seen this, and I've been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total."<ref name="WaPoDirected" />

In late December 2016, one month before his inauguration, Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President".<ref name="Ben Jacobs shut down" /> However, a spokesperson from the New York State attorney general's office told the ''New York Times'', the same month, that the foundation "cannot legally dissolve" until its current investigation is completed.<ref name="Denying Conflict" />

=== Investigation by New York State attorney general's office ===
==== Initial investigations and notice of violation ====

On June 14, 2018, the new New York attorney general [[Barbara Underwood]] filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's adult children—[[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], [[Eric Trump|Eric]] and [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr.]]—alleging they had engaged in "extensive unlawful political conduct" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation "as his personal checkbook" to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.<ref name="New York Files Suit">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-york-files-suit-against-president-trump-alleging-his-charity-engaged-in-illegal-conduct/2018/06/14/c3cbf71e-6fc9-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html |title=New York files suit against President Trump, alleging his charity engaged in 'illegal conduct' |last=Fahrenthold |first=David A. |date=June 14, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=June 14, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614145903/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-york-files-suit-against-president-trump-alleging-his-charity-engaged-in-illegal-conduct/2018/06/14/c3cbf71e-6fc9-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html |archive-date=June 14, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Cuomo opens door" /> The suit sought $2.8 million in restitution and the dissolution of the foundation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/nyregion/trump-foundation-lawsuit-attorney-general.html |title=N.Y.

On August 30, 2018, Trump attorney [[Alan Futerfas]] filed a [[motion to dismiss]] Underwood's suit, claiming it was without merit and was a result of "pervasive bias" by former New York attorney general [[Eric Schneiderman]], who had supervised the investigation before resigning that May. On October 4, 2018, Attorney General Underwood filed a memorandum opposing the motion, instead of strengthening the charges against the Trump Foundation and now alleging, among other claims, that the full $2.8 million of distributions resulting from the January 2016 Iowa fundraiser represented illegal campaign contributions that needed to be repaid.<ref name="Opposition to motion to dismiss" /> The memorandum also stated that the foundation had engaged in "persistent illegality", adding "Trump used his control over the{{nbsp}}...

On October 25, 2018, Justice Saliann Scarpulla heard a hearing on the motion. Justice Scarpulla suggested that she would wait to issue a ruling on the motion until the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]] issued a decision in a separate case (a [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|defamation suit brought by Summer Zervos against Trump]]) on the issue of whether a sitting U.S. president may be sued in state court at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-in-trump-charity-lawsuit-appears-skeptical-of-presidents-arguments-for-dismissal/2018/10/25/8b11eee0-d871-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html|title=Judge in Trump charity lawsuit appears skeptical of president's arguments for dismissal|first=David A.|last=Fahrenthold|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=October 25, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102063040/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-in-trump-charity-lawsuit-appears-skeptical-of-presidents-arguments-for-dismissal/2018/10/25/8b11eee0-d871-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html|archive-date=November 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/politics/trump-foundation-lawsuit-wait/index.html|title=Judge waits to hear if sitting president can be sued before ruling on Trump Foundation|last=Orden|first=Erica|publisher=CNN|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102152829/https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/politics/trump-foundation-lawsuit-wait/index.html|archive-date=November 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On November 23, 2018, Scarpulla denied Trump's motion to dismiss, affirming that a sitting U.S. president can face "a civil lawsuit in state court for actions not taken in his official capacity" and citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/23/politics/trump-foundation-new-york-state-lawsuit/index.html|title=NY AG's lawsuit against Trump Foundation can proceed, judge says|date=November 24, 2018|first=Erica|last=Orden|publisher=CNN|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325202120/https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/23/politics/trump-foundation-new-york-state-lawsuit/index.html|archive-date=March 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 7, 2019, Scarpulla ordered Trump to pay a $2 million settlement for misusing the Foundation for his business and political purposes, directing the settlement money to be given to a handful of charities. The Foundation characterized the payment to the charities as a "contribution," stating it was "pleased to donate an additional $2 million" to "worthy organizations."<ref name="auto" /><ref name="auto1" /> The attorney general had asked the court for an order dissolving the charity and imposing $2.8 million in restitution and penalties. She had also made referrals to the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).<ref name="Alleging engaged illegal"/> On June 18, [[Governor of New York|New York governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]]'s office announced that the governor would refer the civil case to [[New York State Department of Taxation and Finance|New York's Department of Taxation and Finance]] if it is requested to do so by the attorney general's office.<ref name="Cuomo opens door" /> Given the violations alleged in the civil case, some experts believe a tax investigation could lead to state criminal charges.<ref name="Cuomo opens door" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/07/19/state-reportedly-opens-tax-law-probe-into-trump-foundation/|title=State reportedly opens tax law probe into Trump Foundation|date=July 19, 2018|work=New York Post|access-date=July 19, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719145206/https://nypost.com/2018/07/19/state-reportedly-opens-tax-law-probe-into-trump-foundation/|archive-date=July 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Dissolution of foundation ====

=== US House Judiciary Committee investigations ===

On September 13, 2016, all fifteen Democrats on the [[House Judiciary Committee]], then in the minority, sent a letter to [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Loretta Lynch]] requesting that the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation's $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign.

On March 4, 2019, new House Judiciary Committee Chairman [[Jerrold Nadler]] issued a [[subpoena]] to the Trump Foundation for copies of a broad range of documents it had previously delivered to Robert Mueller's office or any other domestic law enforcement agency on or after November 8, 2016, the day of Trump's election.
