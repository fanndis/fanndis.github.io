[[File:GeorgeLopez.jpg|thumb|Lopez at his Walk of Fame star dedication ceremony, March 29, 2006]]
In 2000, after several years of performing stand-up comedy, Lopez was approached by actress [[Sandra Bullock]] for Lopez to produce and star in a comedy. Bullock was concerned about the lack of [[Hispanic]]-oriented sitcoms on American television and pushed to get a sitcom on television that starred Hispanics without being exclusively about the Hispanic American community. Long criticized by Hispanic American groups for lack of Latinos on their television shows, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] quickly picked up the television series. In 2002, Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Freddie Prinze]], and [[John Leguizamo]]. ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'' is an American situation comedy that originally aired on ABC from 2002 to 2007. Lopez is the co-creator, writer, producer, and star of the show.

On March 8, 2007, it was announced that ''George Lopez'' would join the [[Nick at Nite]] lineup. It first aired on Nick at Nite on September 10, 2007. On May 15, 2007, ABC announced that the series would be canceled after its sixth season. The show last aired on ABC September 7, 2007. The show also entered [[television syndication|syndication]] in the fall of 2007. Never a big [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] hit in prime-time, the show became a surprise success in syndication.

After receiving the news that his show was canceled in 2007, Lopez criticized president of [[ABC Entertainment]] Steve McPherson for using racially motivated reasons for his decision. The actor told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that "TV just became really, really white again," and lashed out against ABC by saying, "So a [[chicano]] can't be on TV, but a caveman can?" in reference to the short-lived sitcom ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', which was replacing ''George Lopez'' on the schedule. ''Cavemen'' garnered a sharply negative reception from critics and viewers, and was canceled after 13 episodes. Lopez blamed ABC for causing over a hundred of his show's staff to become jobless.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15| last = Fernandez| first = Marie| title = George Lopez lashes out at ABC|work=Los Angeles Times| date = May 15, 2007| accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2007/05/post_1.html| last = Fernandez| first = Marie| title = TV just got a lot 'whiter,' says a canceled George Lopez|work=Los Angeles Times| date = May 14, 2007| accessdate =June 3, 2008}}</ref>

Lopez was a cast member and commentator for [[HBO]]'s hit sports show ''[[Inside the NFL]]'' for the 2003–04 football season.<ref>https://www.nfl.info/nflmedia/Kickoff%20Weekend/2004/04lopezhost.htm</ref>

Lopez guest-starred as the mayor of [[Reno, Nevada]] in season five of ''[[Reno 911!]]'' in 2008.<ref>[http://ew.com/article/2014/07/08/reno-911-thomas-lennon-ben-garant/2/ 'Reno 911!' creators remember the show 5 years later, talk reunion]</ref>

On March 28, 2009, it was announced that Lopez would be hosting his own late-night talk show on [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]].<ref>Kate Ward, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''</ref> Lopez hosted a late-night talk show entitled ''[[Lopez Tonight]]'' on TBS Monday through Thursday at midnight [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The show debuted in November 2009. In November 2010, the show moved back to midnight ET to accommodate a new show with former ''[[Tonight Show]]'' host [[Conan O'Brien]]. Although O'Brien had reservations about the move and initially refused TBS's offer, Lopez supported and even advocated for it, making it different from the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|2010 ''Tonight Show'' conflict]] that saw O'Brien depart NBC after a proposal to push ''Tonight'' back 30 minutes for [[Jay Leno]] to return to the 11:35&nbsp;p.m. slot.<ref name="conantbs">{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/how-the-conan-obrien-tbs-deal-happened|author=Bill Carter|title=How the Conan O'Brien-TBS Deal Happened|date=April 12, 2010|accessdate=April 12, 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref> On August 10, 2011 Lopez received a cancellation notice from TBS. The network decided not to renew ''Lopez Tonight'' for a third season. Lopez would later regret his decision to assent to the time slot change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/tbs-canceling-comic-george-lopezs-talk-show-174820070.html/ |title=TBS Canceling Comic George Lopez's Talk Show|publisher=News.yahoo.com|accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Bill|title=TBS Cancels "Lopez Tonight"|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/tbs-cancels-lopez-tonight/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 10, 2011|date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>
