==History==

=== Department of Commerce and Police===
On September 6, 1901, the [[Philippine Commission]] established the Department of Commerce (and Police) of the [[Insular Government]].  [[William Cameron Forbes]] future [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] served as its commissioner from 1904 through 1908.

===Department of Commerce and Industry (DCI)===
After [[World War II]], President [[Manuel Roxas]] issued ''Executive Order (EO) No. 94'' on October 4, 1947 creating the Department of Commerce and Industry (DCI).<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Order No. 94, s. 1947 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947/ |website=Official Gazette of the  Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=25 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190514060238/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947/ |archivedate=14 May 2019 |date=4 October 1947}}</ref> Cornelio Balmaceda, a much sought-after [[professor]] of [[economics]] and director of the Bureau of Commerce (BOC), was appointed acting secretary of the newly created Department of Commerce and Industry.

Prior to ''EO 94'', the Bureau of Commerce was tasked to develop and promote the country's trade and industry, under the overall supervision of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, as stipulated by ''Act 4007'' by the Philippine Legislature, enacted on December 5, 1932.

By 1972, the DCI had grown into a big organization with 10 regular bureaus and 22 agencies under its direct supervision. The DCI was mandated to promote, develop, expand, regulate and control of foreign and domestic trade and industry, as well as tourism.

To have closer supervision and to ensure more effective delivery of services, President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] issued ''Presidential Decree (PD) 189'' on May 11, 1973 creating the Department of Tourism to handle all tourism-related matters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 189, s. 1973 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1973/05/11/presidential-decree-no-189-s-1973/ |website=Official Gazette of the  Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=25 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903194721/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1973/05/11/presidential-decree-no-189-s-1973/ |archivedate=3 September 2017 |date=11 May 1973}}</ref> A year later on June 21, 1974, Marcos issued ''PD 488'' creating the Department of Industry whose principal function was to promote and enhance the growth of the country's existing and thriving industries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 488, s. 1974 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1974/06/21/presidential-decree-no-488-s-1974/ |website=Official Gazette of the  Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=25 August 2020 |date=21 June 1974}}</ref>

On June 2, 1975, the Department of Trade was created under ''PD 721'' to pursue efforts of the government toward strengthening the country's socio-economic development, particularly in the area of commercial activities. <ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree No. 721, s. 1975 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1975/06/02/presidential-decree-no-721-s-1975/ |website=Official Gazette of the  Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=25 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825170925/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1975/06/02/presidential-decree-no-721-s-1975/ |archivedate=25 August 2020 |date=2 June 1975}}</ref>A key strategy of the new department was vigorous export promotion to generate much needed foreign exchange. A Bureau of Foreign Trade was also particularly established to push for domestic trade and marketing programs.

In the early 1980s, this goal of national economic development required the need to hew industrial promotion efforts with the expansion of Philippine trade overseas. This resulted in the creation of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MOTI) on July 27, 1981, which took over the functions of the subsequently abolished Departments of Trade and of Industry.

Drastic changes followed after the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]]. President [[Corazon Aquino]] signed ''Executive Order No. 133'' on February 27, 1987 effectively reorganizing the Ministry of Trade and Industry and renaming it the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Order No. 133, s. 1987 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1987/02/27/executive-order-no-133-s-1987/ |website=Official Gazette of the  Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=25 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825170227/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1987/02/27/executive-order-no-133-s-1987/ |archivedate=25 August 2020 |date=27 February 1987}}</ref> This was further strengthened by the issuance of ''Executive Order 292'' (Administrative Code of 1987).<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Order No. 292, s. 1987 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1987/07/25/executive-order-no-292-s-1987/ |website=Official Gazette of the  Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=25 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805140451/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1987/07/25/executive-order-no-292-s-1987/ |archivedate=5 August 2019 |date=25 July 1987}}</ref> Other latter legislations have also amended its functions and structures.
