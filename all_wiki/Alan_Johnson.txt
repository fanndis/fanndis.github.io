A member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Johnson served as the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle]] from [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] to [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].<ref name="Mortimer">{{cite news|last=Mortimer|first=Caroline|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-mp-general-election-tom-blenkinsop-not-stand-theresa-may-middlesborough-south-a7688501.html|title=Labour MPs announce they are standing down as Theresa May calls for a snap general election|work=The Independent|date=18 April 2017|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

Johnson served in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] in both the [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Blair]] and [[Brown ministry|Brown]] [[Government of the United Kingdom|governments]]. He served under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] as [[Minister of State for Universities]] from 2003 to 2004 and [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] from 2004 to 2005, [[President of the Board of Trade]] from 2005 to 2006 and [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]] from 2006 to 2007.

== Early life ==
Born in London on 17 May 1950, the son of Stephen and Lillian Johnson,<ref name =Debretts-2005>{{cite book|title=Debrett's People of Today 2005|edition=18th|isbn=1-870520-10-6|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|page=866}}</ref> he was [[orphan]]ed at the age of 13 when his mother died, his father having previously abandoned the family. Following this, Johnson and his older sister Linda moved to a [[council flat]] in 1964 in Pitt House, [[Battersea]], immediately adjacent to the [[Winstanley_Estate|Winstanley and York Estates]], a traumatic change from their previous address in [[Notting Hill]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Alan |title=This Boy- A Memoir of a Childhood |date=2013 |publisher=Bantam Press |page=245 |isbn=9780593069646 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AN8DwLMbbUIC&q=york+road+battersea+gin+distillery&pg=PA245}}</ref> Johnson describes how he and his sister faced hostility from other tenants unhappy because others were unable to obtain council housing at this time, which forced Linda to become the primary care-giver and meant that their flat was often broken into and targeted for vandalism.<ref name="economist">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=7909132 |title=The charming Mr Johnson|work=The Economist|date= 14 September 2006|accessdate=18 September 2006}}</ref><!--

Before entering [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] Johnson was a member of Labour's [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RT HON Alan Johnson MP|url=http://www.nhshistory.net/cvjohnson.htm|website=NHS history|accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref> During this time he was the only major union leader to support the abolition of [[Clause IV]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brady|first1=Brian|title=How Johnson became the model Labour candidate for the top job|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/how-johnson-became-the-model-labour-candidate-for-the-top-job-1678115.html|accessdate=2 June 2016|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=2 May 2009}}</ref>

== Parliamentary career ==
Just three weeks before the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Johnson was selected to stand for parliament in the safe Labour seat of [[Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (UK Parliament constituency)|Hull West and Hessle]] when the previous incumbent, [[Stuart Randall, Baron Randall of St Budeaux|Stuart Randall]], stood down suddenly. Randall subsequently became a member of the [[House of Lords]].

=== In government ===
He was appointed [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Dawn Primarolo]] in 1997 and achieved his first ministerial post at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) in 1999. He was moved to the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] in 2003 as [[Minister of State for Universities|Minister for Higher Education]] although he had left school at 15.

Johnson, along with other ministers in [[Tony Blair]]'s government, and many other MPs, attracted much criticism for voting on 18 March 2003 for the Iraq war: "to use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction" leading to the UK joining the US invasion of Iraq two days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10314/alan_johnson/kingston_upon_hull_west_and_hessle/divisions?policy=1049|title=TheyWorkForYou|author=|date=|work=theyworkforyou.com|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref> He responded to such criticism on 21 February 2007 by saying "The whole cabinet believed the intelligence we were presented [with] and we made our case to the British people based on it in good faith. As we all now know, that intelligence was wholly wrong. We will be judged historically as to whether getting rid of [[Saddam Hussein]], despite all the consequences, was a positive thing or that the consequences outweigh the positives of getting rid of a brutal tyrant."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/feb/21/iraq.labour|title=How Labour's contenders see the war|author=|date=21 February 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref>

In September 2004, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] appointed Johnson to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]  as [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] after the resignation of [[Andrew Smith (British politician)|Andrew Smith]]. Following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], Johnson was initially announced on 6 May 2005 as being "Secretary of State for Productivity, Energy and Industry", but after just a week, on 13 May, it was declared that the new title would not be used, after widespread derision of the new name, because the abbreviation for Johnson's title, Productivity, Energy and Industry Secretary, would have been "PENIS".<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Alan Johnson|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1492289/Profile-Alan-Johnson.html|newspaper=The Telegraph |date=18 June 2005|location=London|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> The department's old name was kept and Johnson served as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]. On 5 May 2006, one day after the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]], his brief was changed to that of [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]], replacing [[Ruth Kelly]].

=== Education Secretary ===
During his time as education secretary, Johnson brought in new ideas and proposals, including encouraging parents to spend more time with their children in a bid to help them progress with their literacy and numeracy skills.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6453495.stm | title = Parents urged to read to children | work = BBC News | accessdate =28 June 2007 | date=15 March 2007 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070703152549/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6453495.stm| archivedate= 3 July 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Johnson has also previously expressed some concerns over diplomas,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6435563.stm | title = Diplomas 'may go horribly wrong' | work = BBC News | accessdate =28 June 2007 | date=9 March 2007 | location=London | first=Angela | last=Harrison| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070602055759/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6435563.stm| archivedate= 2 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> and has opened up debate in parliament on the subject of what parental situation is best.

=== Health Secretary ===
Johnson became [[Secretary of State for Health]] on 28 June 2007, succeeding [[Patricia Hewitt]] in Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]'s first [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. He later criticised breast cancer patient Debbie Hirst because she attempted to buy the cancer drug [[Avastin]], which the NHS had denied her.  Johnson told Parliament, patients "cannot, in one episode of treatment, be treated on the NHS and then allowed, as part of the same episode and the same treatment, to pay money for more drugs. That way lies the end of the founding principles of the NHS".<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Jacob |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/02/21/uk-wrestles-over-private-payment-for-health-care/ |title=U.K. Wrestles Over Private Payment for Health Care |publisher=Health Blog – WSJ |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref>

When there was a problem with ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|C.difficile]]'' at hospitals managed by the Maidstone & Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, they dismissed their "blameless" chief executive "both unlawfully ... and unfairly" and agreed to pay her £250,000, much less than the sum that they were told that defending a case for unfair dismissal would cost.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|title=[2010] EWCA Civ 678|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/678.html|publisher=BAILII|accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref> When the proposed payment became known, Johnson intervened and the Department of Health ordered the trust to withhold more than two-thirds of the severance payment, although its director general of finance, performance and operations said that "it was 'not unfair'" that she should receive the money.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/28/rose-gibb-nhs-appeal-superbug/ |title='Scapegoat' former NHS boss loses bid for £250,000 pay-off |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}</ref> When the case came to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the payment was restored in a judgement that was highly critical of the Department, including quoting her complaint that Johnson had made "personal comments made about me ... without any reference to the Trust, or informing me, ... regarding my severance value and its non-payment".<ref name="auto"/>

=== Home Secretary ===
On 5 June 2009, Johnson was appointed to the position of [[Home Secretary]] during a reshuffle, replacing the first female holder of the post, [[Jacqui Smith]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8085783.stm|title=I won't walk away, insists Brown |date=5 June 2009|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 June 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090606162625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8085783.stm| archivedate=6 June 2009| url-status= live}}</ref>

In October 2009, Alan Johnson sacked the Chairman of the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD), Professor [[David Nutt]]. Nutt had accused the government of "distorting" and "devaluing" research evidence in the debate over illicit drugs,<ref>{{cite news|last=Tran|first= Mark |date=30 October 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/30/drugs-adviser-david-nutt-sacked |title=Government drug adviser David Nutt sacked|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> criticising it for making political decisions with regard to drug classifications in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy) from a class A drug,<ref>{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Alan|date=February 2009|title=Government criticised over refusal to downgrade ecstasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/11/ecstasy-downgrade-drugs-class|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref> and rejecting the scientific advice not to reclassify cannabis from class C to class B drug. Alan Johnson wrote to the professor: "It is important that the government's messages on drugs are clear and as an advisor you do nothing to undermine public understanding of them. I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy and have therefore lost confidence in your ability to advise me as Chair of the ACMD".<ref>{{cite news|last=Easton|first= Mark |date=30 October 2009|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2009/10/nutt_gets_the_sack.html |title=Nutt gets the sack|work= BBC News|accessdate=31 October 2009}}</ref>
In January 2010, Professor Nutt established the [[Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs]], with the aim of publishing honest drug information.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8342454.stm|title=Nutt vows to set up new drug body |date=4 November 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091107190136/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8342454.stm| archivedate= 7 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> By 2 April 2010, seven members of the ACMD had resigned.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8601315.stm |title=Government adviser Eric Carlin quits over mephedrone |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=2 April 2010 | work=BBC News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100405230507/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8601315.stm| archivedate= 5 April 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In February 2010, it came out in court that [[MI5]] had known that [[Binyam Mohamed]], a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, had been tortured or mistreated by the American services, despite earlier statements to the contrary. In response, Johnson insisted that the media coverage of the torture had been "baseless, groundless accusations".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/johnson-rails-against-media-and-tories-over-baseless-torture-claims-dl7gnt2lbnb|title=Johnson rails against media and Tories over 'baseless' torture claims|date=12 February 2010|last1=Naughton|first1=Philippe|last2=O’Neill|first2=Sean|work=The Times|accessdate=12 February 2010}}</ref> He also claimed that Government lawyers had not forced the judiciary to water down criticism of MI5, despite an earlier, draft ruling by Lord Neuberger, the [[Master of the Rolls]] that the Security Service had failed to respect human rights, deliberately misled parliament, and had a "culture of suppression" that undermined government assurances about its conduct.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Richard |last1=Norton-Taylor |first2=Ian |last2=Cobain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/10/binyam-mohamed-torture-mi5 |title=Top judge: Binyam Mohamed case shows MI5 to be devious, dishonest and complicit in torture |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 10 February 2010 |accessdate=20 January 2011 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110126055352/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/10/binyam-mohamed-torture-mi5| archivedate= 26 January 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

=== Deputy leadership candidate and potential leader ===
Johnson publicly stated in May 2006 he expected to stand for the post of Leader of the Labour Party when [[Tony Blair]] stepped down. Johnson told the BBC in an interview on 9 November 2006<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6133276.stm | work = BBC News | title = Johnson backing Brown for leader | accessdate =28 June 2007 | date=9 November 2006 | location=London}}</ref> that he would in fact be supporting Brown and standing as deputy leader. He was [[2007 Labour Party deputy leadership election|successfully nominated]] onto the ballot paper for Labour Deputy leader with most number of nominations. On 24 June 2007,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6234692.stm | title = Harman wins deputy leader contest | work = BBC News | accessdate =28 June 2007 | date=24 June 2007 | location=London}}</ref> Johnson was narrowly beaten for the deputy leadership by [[Harriet Harman]].  He led in rounds 2 to 4 of the voting, until he was overtaken by Harman in the last round, eventually finishing with 49.56% of the vote.

Having been touted in the media as a possible successor to outgoing Labour leader [[Gordon Brown]], Johnson officially announced to the BBC on 12 May 2010 that he would not be standing in the forthcoming leadership contest, and would instead be backing [[David Miliband]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676752.stm |title=Labour leadership: David Miliband enters contest |work=BBC News |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=20 January 2011}}</ref>

In November 2014, amid criticism within the party of its leader [[Ed Miliband]], Johnson again denied speculation that he was a potential leadership candidate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-30002270 |title=Tony Blair gives Ed Miliband his 'full support'|work= BBC News|date= 11 November 2014|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Potential London Mayoral candidate ===
[[File:THE Rt Hon. ALAN JOHNSON MP.jpg|thumb|left|Johnson in Hull, 2011]]
In 2010, there was much speculation that Johnson was going to stand as a candidate for the London Mayoral election after announcing that he was not going to contest the leadership. Many of Johnson's close allies encouraged him to stand for the Mayoralty and he was thought to have been considering it.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Waugh|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/alan-johnson-v-boris-johnson-for-london-mayor-6470634.html |title=Alan Johnson v Boris Johnson for London Mayor |work= Evening Standard |accessdate= 6 May 2012|date=18 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/05/former-labour-johnson-london |title=Will it be Boris Johnson v Alan Johnson in 2012? |work=New Statesman |date=18 May 2010|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> However, Johnson decided not to stand for the Labour Party selection for Mayor and instead backed [[Oona King]] for the candidacy, but she lost to [[Ken Livingstone]]. In 2011, there was speculation that Livingstone could be deselected as the Labour candidate in favour of Johnson but that did not happen.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/livingstone-alan-johnson-lacks-the-drive-a-mayor-needs-2362079.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Andy | last=McSmith | title=Livingstone: Alan Johnson lacks the drive a mayor needs | date=28 September 2011|accessdate= 6 May 2012}}</ref> In 2012, after Livingstone's defeat by [[Boris Johnson]], many Labour members said that Johnson should have been the Labour candidate. Johnson then revealed that he did consider standing for [[Mayor of London]] but he felt that his allegiance was to Hull. However, he said that he would not stand for [[Mayor of London]] in the 2016 elections as he wants to stay on as an MP.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Alan-Johnson-challenge-Boris-London-Mayor/story-17434111-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505080324/http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Alan-Johnson-challenge-Boris-London-Mayor/story-17434111-detail/story.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=5 May 2013|title=Alan Johnson 'will not challenge Boris in London Mayor election'|date=27 November 2012|work=This is Hull and East Riding|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref>
