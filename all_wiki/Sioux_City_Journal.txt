The '''''Sioux City Journal''''' is the daily [[newspaper]] and [[website]] of [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. Founded in 1864, the publication now covers northwestern Iowa and portions of Nebraska and South Dakota.

The Journal has won numerous state, regional and national awards. It was named one of the "10 that do it right" by the publishing trade journal ''Editor and Publisher'' in 2009 and 2013.<ref name="Linck 2009"/>

The Journal is owned by [[Lee Enterprises]] Inc.

==History==

The ''Sioux City Journal'' was founded as a weekly newspaper on August 20, 1864 by Samuel Tait Davis (1828–1900) and others who wanted a strong local voice for the [[Unionist Party (United States)|Union Party]] and the re-election of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Serving as the first editor, Davis continued until after the election, ensuring a pro-Lincoln perspective. With the end of the Union Party after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], this shifted to a pro-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] stance.<ref name="Sorensen and Chicoine p47"/><ref name="Library of Congress: SC Journal 1864–1870"/>

George and Henry Perkins bought the Sioux City Weekly Journal in 1869, and within a year converted it to a daily newspaper. Continuing the Republican editorial line, [[George D. Perkins|George Perkins]] (1840–1914) served as editor in between terms as a Republican officeholder. Among other offices, he served in the Iowa Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and "lost a highly contested bid for Iowa's governorship in 1906."<ref name="Sorensen and Chicoine p50"/><ref name="Library of Congress: SC Journal 1870–1887"/>

Noted political cartoonist [[Jay Norwood Darling]], better known as "Ding," worked for the ''Journal'' between 1900 and 1906. He later won two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for the ''Des Moines Register and Leader''.

After George Perkins died early in 1914, the paper was left to his son, William R. Perkins, and son-in-law, William Sammons. They hired noted architect [[William L. Steele]] to design a new four-story building at the southwest corner of Douglas Street and 5th Street. Housing the paper's editorial, reporting, circulation, advertising sales, and printing operations, the building was ready for occupancy in 1915.<ref name="KTIV 2008"/><ref name="Sorensen and Chicoine p147"/><ref name="Sioux City Public Museum Douglas 7"/>

Sammons ran the ''Journal'' until his death in 1944. One of his accomplishments was purchasing in 1941 the ''Journal'''s primary competitor, the erstwhile pro-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ''[[Sioux City Tribune]]''. Since the ''Journal'' was a morning paper and the ''Tribune'' an evening paper, for over 30 years they continued both papers with a merged staff.<ref name="KTIV 2008"/>

Upon Sammons' death in 1944, William R. Perkins took over publication of the ''Journal'' until 1962, and Elizabeth Sammons (daughter of Clara Perkins Sammons) assumed that role in 1962.<ref name="KTIV 2008"/>

By 1972, the elegant building designed by William L. Steele was no longer meeting the paper's needs, and a new plant was built east of downtown at Sixth and Pavonia Streets. The ''Journal'' moved there in November of that year, and the Steele building was demolished soon afterwards.<ref name="Sorensen and Chicoine p147"/><ref name="Sioux City Public Museum Douglas 7"/>

On December 14, 1972, the Journal-Tribune Publishing Co. was purchased by Hagadone Corp. of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and [[Howard Publications]] of Oceanside, California. Shortly after the ownership change, the ''Journal'' dropped its afternoon editions and became a seven-day morning paper. [[Lee Enterprises]] Inc. of Davenport, Iowa, bought Howard Publications in February 2002, giving it half-ownership of the paper; in June 2002, Lee purchased the remaining half from Hagadone.<ref name=Lee>{{cite news |url=https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/sioux-city-journal-sold-to-lee-enterprises/article_15c34945-1b5d-5d41-abce-0265bc6298a1.html |title=Sioux City Journal sold to Lee Enterprises |newspaper=Sioux City Journal |date=June 6, 2002 |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |first=Dave|last=Yoder}}</ref>

The newspaper founded radio station [[KSCJ]] in 1927 and co-founded television station [[KTIV]] in 1953. Both have been sold off.<ref name="Associated Press 2003"/>
