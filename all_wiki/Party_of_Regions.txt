==History==

===Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine===
The founding congress of the Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine was held on 26 October 1997 in [[Kyiv]].<ref name=DEN/> The first leader of the party was the mayor of [[Donetsk]], [[Volodymyr Vasylyovych Rybak|Volodymyr Rybak]].<ref name=DEN/> On 6 November 1997, the Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine was registered at the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice.<ref name=DATA>{{in lang|uk}} [http://da-ta.com.ua/mon_mainnews/840.htm Партія регіонів], Database DATA</ref> On 27 November 1997 there took place the 1st Party Congress, which adopted the electoral party list and platform for the next elections. Already on 13 January 1998 a parliamentary faction was created in the [[parliament of Ukraine]], the Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine (head of coordination council – [[Gennadiy Samofalov]]).

During the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998 parliamentary elections]] the Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine won 0.90% of the votes.<ref name=DATA/> A single party representative was elected to the [[Ukrainian Parliament]] by winning one constituency at the regular elections.<ref name=DEN>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.day.kiev.ua/uk/article/podrobici/ilyuzorna-idiliya Ілюзорна ідилія], ''[[Den (newspaper)|Den]]'' (7 February 2007)</ref> The party was among the top 10 in [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] and [[Donetsk Oblast]]s.

During the 2nd Party Congress that took place in two stages during the spring of 1999 it was decided to support the presidential candidate [[Leonid Kuchma]] for the next presidential elections. It was recommended that the candidate include in his election campaign propositions of the Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine, including one on granting the [[Russian language]] official status. In the summer of 1999, the party entered the electoral bloc "Our choice – Leonid Kuchma", consisting of 23 parties and led by [[Yevhen Kushnaryov]], who endorsed incumbent [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] in the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential election of 1999]].<ref name=DEN/>

===Creation of the Party of Regions===
On 17 November 2000, the 3rd Extraordinary Party Congress adopted the merger of five political parties, [[For Beautiful Ukraine]] ([[Leonid Chernovetsky]]), [[All-Ukrainian Party of Pensioners]] (A. Kapusta), [[Party of Labor (Ukraine)|Party of Labor]] (Valentyn Landyk), [[Solidarity (Ukraine)|Party of Solidarity of Ukraine]] ([[Petro Poroshenko]]), and Party of Regional Revival of Ukraine ([[Volodymyr Vasylyovych Rybak|Volodymyr Rybak]]), into a new one under the name of Party of Regional Revival "Labor Solidarity of Ukraine". The co-leaders of the new political polity became [[Valentyn Landyk]], [[Petro Poroshenko]], and [[Volodymyr Vasylyovych Rybak|Volodymyr Rybak]]. Also, prior to the merger the [[Solidarity (Ukraine)|Party of Solidarity of Ukraine]] was completely abandoned by its base party of [[Serhiy Dovhan]], the [[Peasant Party of Ukraine]], which dissolved its union with Solidarity. On February 21, 2001, the [[Ministry of Justice (Ukraine)|Ministry of Justice]] registered the newly established Party of Regional Revival "Labour Solidarity of Ukraine".

On March 3, 2001, at the 3rd Party Congress, the party changed its name to Party of Regions. At the congress [[Mykola Azarov]], who at that time was chairman of the [[State Tax Administration of Ukraine]], was elected the party leader, but soon resigned in December 2001,<ref name="glob">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/parties.htm Ukraine Political Parties], GlobalSecurity.org</ref> being replaced by his deputy and at that time Vice Prime Minister [[Volodymyr Semynozhenko]].<ref name=CEU2/> In an interview with the newspaper ''Den'' ({{lang-uk|День}}) on 6 March 2001, Azarov said that he agreed to become the chairman for a brief period "until the party nominated a leader who will claim the office of the President of Ukraine in 2004".<ref name=CEU1/> In December 2001 the Party of Regions member Ihor Yushchko was appointed Minister of Finance of Ukraine.<ref name=CEU2/> On 21 March 2001, the [[Ministry of Justice (Ukraine)|Ministry of Justice]] re-registered the party under the number 939 with the older date of registration.

On 23 May 2001, the party signed an agreement of partnership and cooperation with the party [[Labour Ukraine]] ([[Serhiy Tihipko]]), and on 7 June 2001, with the [[People's Party (Ukraine)|Agrarian Party of Ukraine]].

'''Regions of Ukraine''' was the parliamentary wing of the Party of Regions; it was created at the end of March 2001<ref name=CEU2>[http://pdc.ceu.hu/archive/00001231/01/6.pdf 2001 Political sketches: too early for summing up], [[Central European University]] (January 4, 2002)</ref> after several deputies defected from their original faction. Critics claimed the deputies were "lured away" from those other factions by pressure and analysts claimed most of them had nothing to do with the new party.<ref name=CEU1>[http://pdc.ceu.hu/archive/00001265/01/1.pdf New «region» formed in Ukrainian Parliament], [[Central European University]] (26 March 2001)</ref> Nine out of seventeen members of the faction had their political and business roots in the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk region]].<ref name=CEU2/> In July 2002 the party had a faction of 24 people (one deputy left the faction later).<ref name=UUPAnie>[http://www.ditext.com/danieri/politics.html Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], [[M.E. Sharpe]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1811-5}}</ref>

On 20 March 2001, Solidarity announced it would "be as a single bloc".<ref name=CEU1/> (Eventually the (Solidarity) party became part of the [[Viktor Yushchenko Bloc Our Ukraine]] during the 2002 parliamentary elections.)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H23Pv4Ik3vMC&pg=PA391 Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe], [[Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht]], 2008, {{ISBN|3-525-36912-3}}  (page 391)</ref>

During the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|Ukrainian parliamentary election]] the party was a member of the [[For United Ukraine]] [[electoral alliance|electoral bloc]].<ref name=DATA/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaedu.org.ua/index.phtml?razd=party |title=parties of the "Za Yedynu Ukrayinu" bloc |accessdate=2008-02-25 |date=2002-11-24 |work=Za Yediny Ukrayinu! |language=uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041106203745/http://www.zaedu.org.ua/index.phtml?razd=party |archive-date=2004-11-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was then led by [[Volodymyr Semynozhenko]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaedu.org.ua/index.phtml?razd=leaders |title=Leaders of the "Za Yedynu Ukrayinu" bloc |accessdate=2008-02-25 |date=2002-11-24 |work=Za Yediny Ukrayinu! |language=uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041208203028/http://www.zaedu.org.ua/index.phtml?razd=leaders |archive-date=2004-12-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From 21 November 2002 until 7 December 2004, [[Viktor Yanukovych]] was [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]].

At a congress held on 19 April 2003 [[Viktor Yanukovych]] was elected party leader, succeeding [[Volodymyr Semynozhenko]].<ref name=Azarovleader>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110122154153/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/60929/ Yanukovych suspends his membership in Party of Regions, hands over party leadership to Azarov], ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' (3 March 2010)</ref> At that time the party had 20 seats in parliament.<ref>[http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1329_1200471485_ukraine-april-2003.pdf UKRAINE COUNTRY ASSESSMENT April 2003], [[ecoi.net]] (April 2003)</ref>

===Electoral breakthrough===
The party shifted its political ideology to the [[left-wing politics|left]] and became much more [[populism|populist]] in nature before the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and, as a result, Yanukovych won over a large part of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist party's]] electorate in eastern Ukraine. The party announced support for making [[Russian language|Russian]] a second [[official language]] in Ukraine, a pro-Russian foreign policy, and increased social spending. It also advocates the regionalist ideology, and many members support making Ukraine a [[federation]].

The Party of Regions moved to opposition after its candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, lost the 2004 presidential election. The party leader first claimed an electoral victory, but strong allegations of [[electoral fraud]] triggered a series of events commonly known as the [[Orange Revolution]]. In the re-run of the presidential election ordered by the country's [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]], Viktor Yanukovych lost the election to [[Viktor Yushchenko]].

The Party claimed to be a victim of a political persecution campaign organised by the new government, also because [[Borys Kolesnykov]], the head of the regional party branch and of the Donetsk regional council, was arrested in April 2005 and charged with criminal extortion.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110209072810/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/36646/ Lutsenko suggests Regions Party to deal with Piskun, who sanctioned proceedings against Kolesnykov], [[Kyiv Post]] (3 March 2009)</ref> The Party of Regions claimed this was an act of political repression, while the authorities believed that Kolesnykov had links to [[organized crime|organised crime]] and his arrest was a purely criminal matter. The [[Council of Europe]] called the investigation "in full compliance with European standards".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ebjEVjJ-DcAC&pg=PA580 Countries at the crossroads: a survey of democratic governance] by Sanja Tatic & Christopher Walker, [[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]], 2006, {{ISBN|0742558010}}/{{ISBN|978-0742558014}} (page 580)</ref> Kolesnykov has since been cleared of charges and released from pre-trial detention.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100125161608/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/57719 Yanukovych’s inner circle], [[Kyiv Post]] (24 January 2010)</ref>

{{main|2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election}}
At the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on 26 March 2006, the party gained 32.14%<ref name=DATA/> of votes and 186 (out of 450) seats in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian Parliament), forming the largest parliamentary group. On 6 July 2006, the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] abandoned the "[[Orange Revolution|Orange Coalition]]" between [[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]] and the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] following the failure of each bloc to reach agreement on the formation of a governing coalition.

On 10 July 2006 a new parliamentary majority titled the "anti-crisis coalition", led by the Party of Regions and including the Socialist Party and the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist Party]], was formed, nominating [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to the post of prime minister.

The coalition remained in office until the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|special parliamentary elections]] held in September 2007.

At the [[2006 Crimean parliamentary election]] the party was part of the ''[[For Yanukovych!]]'' [[election bloc]].<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.rosbalt.ru/ukraina/2009/10/06/677872.html], Росбалт.RU (06/10/2009)</ref>

On 19 January 2007, [[Yevhen Kushnaryov]], a member of the Party of Regions, died in [[Izium]] as a result of an accidental gunshot wound received while hunting.

In mid-2007, the [[Ukrainian Republican Party]] and [[Labour Ukraine]] merged into the Party of Regions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11768533&PageNum=0|title=Party merger|work=[[ITAR-TASS]]}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Recent issue stances==
{{Update section|date=March 2020}}
The party asserts it has a pragmatic approach to [[Ukrainian EU membership]] with respect to the country's foreign economic interests; it supports "to walk the path of European integration and the implementation of respective standards in the social and economic spheres". Yet, given the European financial crisis, the party sees the issue of Ukraine's accession to the EU as "purely theoretical."<ref name="purely theoretical">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/119031 Regions Party: Question of Ukraine's EU membership now 'purely theoretical'], [[Kyiv Post]] (15 December 2011) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216014907/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/119031 |date=December 16, 2011 }}</ref>

The party accepts [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as the only [[state language]] in Ukraine, but also claims to promote "both the development of the state Ukrainian language and languages of other nationalities residing on the territory of Ukraine".<ref>[http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/en/deputy_faction/activities/show/1767 Yuriy Miroshnychenko: Viktor Yanukovych promotes the comprehensive development and use of the official language], Official Information Server of the party (21 February 2011) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527051214/http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/en/deputy_faction/activities/show/1767 |date=May 27, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/en/deputy_faction/activities/show/1763 Volodymyr Zubanov: The current government promotes the development of the languages of all people in Ukraine], Official Information Server of the party (21 February 2011) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527051232/http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/en/deputy_faction/activities/show/1763 |date=May 27, 2012 }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=December 2011}}

In November 2013 Party of Regions [[Verkhovna Rada|MP]] [[Oleh Tsariov]] demanded a criminal investigation into the activities of [[United States Department of State]] lead [[Office of eDiplomacy#Major Programs of the Office of eDiplomacy|TechCamp]] in [[Ukraine]] because he believed it was engaged in "preparations for inciting a [[civil war]]" because during training "instructors share their experience of Internet technologies, which are aimed at shaping public opinion and enhancing the protest potential and which were used to organize street protests in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia and Syria".<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/175839.html Party of Regions MP Tsariov accuses US Embassy in Ukraine of training revolutionaries for street protests], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (20 November 2013)</ref>

The Party of Regions has lost much of its influence amid the ongoing [[Ukrainian Revolution of 2014|crisis]] in Ukraine. 72 deputies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.ua/ru/articles/politics/_esche-troe-deputatov-vyshli-iz-partii-regionov-v-summe-uzhe-72/543739|title=Еще трое депутатов вышли из Партии регионов, в сумме уже 72|work=Gazeta.ua|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> have left the party, and remaining deputies either supported key opposition demands like impeaching Yanukovich, firing Zakharchenko and the General Prosecutor or did not vote.
