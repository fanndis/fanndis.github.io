<!-- Definition and symptoms -->

[[File:Symptoms of multiple sclerosis.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Main symptoms of multiple sclerosis]]

A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign, with [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], visual, motor, and sensory problems being the most common.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include [[hypoesthesia|loss of sensitivity]] or [[paresthesia|changes in sensation]] such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, [[blurred vision]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/|title=MS Signs |website=[[Webmd]]|access-date=7 October 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930181511/http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/|archive-date=30 September 2016}}</ref> [[clonus|very pronounced reflexes]], [[muscle spasms]], or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance ([[ataxia]]); [[dysarthria|problems with speech]] or [[dysphagia|swallowing]], visual problems ([[nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]] or [[diplopia|double vision]]), [[fatigue (physical)|feeling tired]], [[acute pain|acute]] or [[chronic pain]], and bladder and bowel difficulties (such as [[Neurogenic bladder dysfunction|neurogenic bladder]]), among others.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as [[clinical depression|depression]] or [[labile affect|unstable mood]] are also common.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> [[Uhthoff's phenomenon]], a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and [[Lhermitte's sign]], an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The main measure of disability and severity is the [[expanded disability status scale]] (EDSS), with other measures such as the [[multiple sclerosis functional composite]] being increasingly used in research.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurtzke JF | author-link=John F.

The condition begins in 85% of cases as a [[clinically isolated syndrome]] (CIS) over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having [[optic neuritis]], and 10% having symptoms related to [[brainstem]] dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties.<ref name=Tsang2011/> The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called [[relapse]]s, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases).<ref name=Milo2010/> A combination of these two patterns may also occur<ref name="pmid8780061"/> or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on.<ref name=Milo2010/>

Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer.<ref name="pmid16804331">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tataru N, Vidal C, Decavel P, Berger E, Rumbach L | title = Limited impact of the summer heat wave in France (2003) on hospital admissions and relapses for multiple sclerosis | journal = Neuroepidemiology | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16804331 | doi = 10.1159/000094233 | s2cid = 20870484 }}</ref> Similarly, viral infections such as the [[common cold]], [[influenza]], or [[gastroenteritis]] increase their risk.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> [[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] may also trigger an attack.<ref name="pmid17439878">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heesen C, Mohr DC, Huitinga I, Bergh FT, Gaab J, Otte C, Gold SM | title = Stress regulation in multiple sclerosis: current issues and concepts | journal = Multiple Sclerosis | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17439878 | doi = 10.1177/1352458506070772 | s2cid = 8262595 }}</ref> Women with MS [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy|who become pregnant]] experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including [[vaccination]], [[breast feeding]],<ref name="pmid18970977"/> physical trauma,<ref name="pmid11205361">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinelli V | title = Trauma, stress and multiple sclerosis | journal = Neurological Sciences | volume = 21 | issue = 4 Suppl 2 | pages = S849-52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11205361 | doi = 10.1007/s100720070024| s2cid = 2376078 }}</ref> and [[Uhthoff's phenomenon]].<ref name="pmid16804331"/>

==Causes==
The cause of MS is unknown; however, it is believed to occur as a result of some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While there are a number of environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, further research is needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.<ref name="pmid15556803"/>

===Geography===
MS is more common in people who live farther from the [[equator]], although exceptions exist.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid18606967"/> These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the equator such as the [[Sami people|Samis]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]], Canadian [[Hutterite]]s, New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]],<ref name="pmid12127652">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pugliatti M, Sotgiu S, Rosati G | title = The worldwide prevalence of multiple sclerosis | journal = Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery | volume = 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 182–91 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12127652 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-8467(02)00036-7 | s2cid = 862001 }}</ref> and Canada's [[Inuit]],<ref name=Milo2010/> as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as [[Sardinians]],<ref name=Milo2010/> inland [[Sicily|Sicilians]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grimaldi LM, Salemi G, Grimaldi G, Rizzo A, Marziolo R, Lo Presti C, Maimone D, Savettieri G | title = High incidence and increasing prevalence of MS in Enna (Sicily), southern Italy | journal = Neurology | volume = 57 | issue = 10 | pages = 1891–3 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11723283 | doi = 10.1212/wnl.57.10.1891 | s2cid = 34895995 }}</ref> [[Palestinians]], and [[Parsi]].<ref name="pmid12127652"/> The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear.<ref name=Milo2010/> While the north–south gradient of incidence is decreasing,<ref name="pmid18606967"/> as of 2010 it is still present.<ref name=Milo2010/>

MS is more common in regions with northern European populations<ref name="pmid18970977"/> and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations.<ref name=Milo2010/> Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased [[vitamin D]] production has also been put forward as an explanation.<ref name="pmid17492755"/><ref name="pmid20494325">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ascherio A, Munger KL, Simon KC | title = Vitamin D and multiple sclerosis | journal = The Lancet.

A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support to this idea, with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life.<ref name="pmid19897699">{{cite journal|vauthors= Kulie T, Groff A, Redmer J, Hounshell J, Schrager S|title= Vitamin D: an evidence-based review|journal= Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine|volume= 22|issue= 6|pages= 698–706|year= 2009|pmid= 19897699|doi= 10.3122/jabfm.2009.06.090037|doi-access= free}}</ref>

Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of their home country.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid15556803"/> There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Genetics===
[[File:HLA.svg|thumb|HLA region of Chromosome&nbsp;6. Changes in this area increase the probability of getting MS.]]

===Infectious agents===
Many [[microbes]] have been proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> Moving at an early age from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS.<ref name="pmid17444504"/> An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease.<ref name="pmid17444504"/> Proposed mechanisms include the [[hygiene hypothesis]] and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease is a response to a late encounter with such agents.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where, in most individuals, it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination.<ref name="pmid17444504"/><ref name="pmid8269393"/> The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.<ref name="pmid17444504"/>

Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of [[oligoclonal bands]] in the brain and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination [[encephalomyelitis]], and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections.<ref name="pmid15721830">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilden DH | title = Infectious causes of multiple sclerosis | journal = The Lancet.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis}}
[[File:Multiple Sclerosis.png|thumb|Multiple sclerosis]]
The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the [[central nervous system]] (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of [[myelin sheath]]s of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>
[[Cholesterol crystal]]s are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation.<ref name="pmid29439228">{{cite journal | vauthors=Chen Y, Popko B | title=Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=359 | issue=6376 | pages=635–636 | year=2018 | doi= 10.1126/science.aar7369 | pmid = 29439228 | bibcode=2018Sci...359..635C | s2cid=3257111 }}</ref><ref name="pmid29301957">{{cite journal | vauthors=Cantuti-Castelvetri L, Fitzner D, Bosch-Queralt M, Weil MT, Su M, Sen P, Ruhwedel T, Mitkovski M, Trendelenburg G, Lütjohann D, Möbius W, Simons M | title=Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system | journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=359 | issue=6376 | pages=684–688 | year=2018 | doi= 10.1126/science.aan4183 | pmid = 29301957 | bibcode=2018Sci...359..684C | doi-access=free }}</ref>  MS is believed to be an [[Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases|immune-mediated]] disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Lesions===
[[Image:MS Demyelinisation KB 10x.jpg|thumb|Demyelination in MS. On [[Klüver-Barrera]] myelin staining, decoloration in the area of the lesion can be appreciated ]]
The name ''multiple sclerosis'' refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the [[white matter]] in the [[optic nerve]], [[brain stem]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[spinal cord]], or white matter tracts close to the lateral [[Ventricular system|ventricles]].<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between [[grey matter]] areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body. The [[peripheral nervous system]] is rarely involved.<ref name="pmid11955556"/>

To be specific, MS involves the loss of [[oligodendrocyte]]s, the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer—known as the [[myelin]] sheath—which helps the neurons carry [[Action potential|electrical signals]] (action potentials).<ref name="pmid18970977"/> This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and, as the disease advances, the breakdown of the [[axons]] of neurons. When the myelin is lost, a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> A repair process, called [[remyelination]], takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath.<ref name="pmid17531860">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chari DM | title = Remyelination in multiple sclerosis | journal = International Review of Neurobiology | volume = 79 | pages = 589–620 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17531860 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7742(07)79026-8 | pmc = 7112255 | isbn = 9780123737366 }}</ref> Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons.<ref name="pmid17531860"/> These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) often shows more than ten new plaques.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> This could indicate that there are a number of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal [[astrocytosis|increase in the number of astrocytes]] due to the destruction of nearby neurons.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> A number of [[pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis#Demyelination patterns|lesion patterns]] have been described.<ref name="pmid17351524">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pittock SJ, Lucchinetti CF | title = The pathology of MS: new insights and potential clinical applications | journal = The Neurologist | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–56 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17351524 | doi = 10.1097/01.nrl.0000253065.31662.37 | s2cid = 2993523 }}</ref>

===Inflammation===
Apart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is [[inflammation]]. Fitting with an [[immunological]] explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by [[T cell]]s, a kind of [[lymphocyte]] that plays an important role in the body's defenses.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> T cells gain entry into the brain via disruptions in the [[blood–brain barrier]]. The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called "autoreactive lymphocytes".<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

The attack of myelin starts inflammatory processes, which triggers other immune cells and the release of soluble factors like [[cytokine]]s and [[antibodies]]. A further breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, in turn, causes a number of other damaging effects such as [[oedema|swelling]], activation of [[macrophages]], and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Blood–brain barrier===
The [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) is a part of the [[capillary]] system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system.<!-- <ref name="pmid11955556"/> --> It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria.<!-- <ref name="pmid11955556"/> --> After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain.<ref name="pmid11955556"/> [[Gadolinium]] cannot cross a normal BBB and, therefore, gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns.<ref name="pmid23088946">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré JC, Shiroishi MS, Law M | title = Advanced techniques using contrast media in neuroimaging | journal = Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 699–713 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23088946 | pmc = 3479680 | doi = 10.1016/j.mric.2012.07.007 }}</ref>

Multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting [[medical imaging]] and laboratory testing.<ref name=Tsang2011/> It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid11794488">{{cite journal | vauthors = Trojano M, Paolicelli D | title = The differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: classification and clinical features of relapsing and progressive neurological syndromes | journal = Neurological Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = S98-102 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11794488 | doi = 10.1007/s100720100044| s2cid = 3057096 }}</ref> The [[McDonald criteria]], which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis<ref name=Atlas2008/> with the [[Schumacher criteria|Schumacher]] and [[Poser criteria]] being of mostly historical significance.<ref name="pmid15177763">{{cite journal | vauthors = Poser CM, Brinar VV | title = Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: an historical review | journal = Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–58 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15177763 | doi = 10.1016/j.clineuro.2004.02.004 | s2cid = 23452341 }}</ref>

==Types and variants==
Several [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotypes]] (commonly termed ''types''), or patterns of progression, have been described. Phenotypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course. They are important not only for prognosis but also for treatment decisions.

# Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)
# Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)
# Primary progressive MS (PPMS)
# Secondary progressive MS (SPMS)

Relapsing-remitting MS is characterized by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet ([[remission (medicine)|remission]]) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave [[sequelae|problems]], the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name=Tsang2011/> This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for multiple sclerosis.<ref name="pmid18970977"/><ref name="pmid15847841">{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M | title = Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis | journal = The Lancet.

Multiple sclerosis behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.<ref name="pmid18970977"/>

===Special courses===

Independently of the types published by the MS associations, regulatory agencies like the FDA often consider special courses, trying to reflect some clinical trials results on their approval documents. Some examples could be  "Highly Active MS" (HAMS),<ref name="sorensen">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen PS, Centonze D, Giovannoni G, et al. |title=Expert opinion on the use of cladribine tablets in clinical practice |journal=Ther Adv Neurol Disord |volume=13 |pages=1756286420935019 |date=2020 |pmid=32636933 |pmc=7318823 |doi=10.1177/1756286420935019 |type= Review}}</ref> "Active Secondary MS" (similar to the old Progressive-Relapsing)<ref name="novartis.com">[https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-receives-fda-approval-mayzent-siponimod-first-oral-drug-treat-secondary-progressive-ms-active-disease Novartis press release about the approval]</ref> and "Rapidly progressing PPMS".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Saida T |title=[Multiple sclerosis: treatment and prevention of relapses and progression in multiple sclerosis] |language=ja |journal=Rinsho Shinkeigaku |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=796–8 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15651294 |type= Review}}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Management of multiple sclerosis}}

Although there is no known cure for multiple sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. Starting medications is generally recommended in people after the first attack when more than two lesions are seen on MRI.<ref name=Neurology2018>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rae-Grant A, Day GS, Marrie RA, Rabinstein A, Cree BA, Gronseth GS, Haboubi M, Halper J, Hosey JP, Jones DE, Lisak R, Pelletier D, Potrebic S, Sitcov C, Sommers R, Stachowiak J, Getchius TS, Merillat SA, Pringsheim T | display-authors = 6 | title = Practice guideline recommendations summary: Disease-modifying therapies for adults with multiple sclerosis: Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | journal = Neurology | volume = 90 | issue = 17 | pages = 777–788 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29686116 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005347 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. [[Alternative medicine|Alternative treatments]] are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.

===Acute attacks===
During symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]], is the usual therapy,<ref name="pmid18970977"/> with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton JM, O'Connor PW, Hohol M, Beyene J | title = Oral versus intravenous steroids for treatment of relapses in multiple sclerosis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD006921 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23235634 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006921.pub3 }}</ref> Although effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Filippini G, Brusaferri F, Sibley WA, et al. |title=Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD001331 |date=2000 |pmid=11034713 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001331 }}</ref><ref name="RCOP_acute">{{cite book|author=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions|title=Multiple sclerosis : national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care|year=2004|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|isbn=1-86016-182-0|pages=54–57|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK48919/pdf/TOC.pdf|access-date=6 February 2013|pmid=21290636}}</ref> The long term benefit is unclear in optic neuritis as of 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Petzold A, Braithwaite T, van Oosten BW  |title=Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence |journal=J.

[[Image:Carswell-Multiple Sclerosis2.jpg|thumb|Detail of Carswell's drawing of MS lesions in the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]] (1838)]]
[[Robert Carswell (pathologist)|Robert Carswell]] (1793–1857), a British professor of [[pathology]], and [[Jean Cruveilhier]] (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease.<ref name="pmid3066846">{{cite journal | vauthors = Compston A | title = The 150th anniversary of the first depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 10 | pages = 1249–52 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 3066846 | pmc = 1032909 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.51.10.1249 }}</ref> Specifically, Carswell described the injuries he found as "a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy".<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist [[Georg Eduard Rindfleisch]] (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels.<ref name="pmid10603616">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lassmann H | title = The pathology of multiple sclerosis and its evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The French [[neurologist]] [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825–1893) was the first person to recognize multiple sclerosis as a distinct disease in 1868.<ref name="pmid3066846"/> Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease ''sclerose en plaques''.

===Diagnosis history===

The first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868. He published what now is known as the "Charcot Triad", consisting in [[nystagmus]], [[intention tremor]], and [[telegraphic speech]] (scanning speech)<ref name="Milo">R. Milo, A. Miller, Revised diagnostic criteria of multiple sclerosis, Autoimmunity Reviews 13 (2014), 12 January 2014, 518–524</ref> Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a "marked enfeeblement of the memory" and "conceptions that formed slowly".<ref name="Charcot1"/>

Diagnosis was based on Charcot triad and clinical observation until [[Schumacher criteria|Schumacher]] made the first attempt to standardize criteria in 1965 by introducing some fundamental requirements: Dissemination of the lesions in time (DIT) and space (DIS), and that "signs and symptoms cannot be explained better by another disease process".<ref name="Milo"/> Both requirements were later inherited by [[Poser criteria]] and [[McDonald criteria]], whose 2010 version is currently in use.

During the 20th century, theories about the cause and pathogenesis were developed and effective treatments began to appear in the 1990s.<ref name="pmid18970977"/> Since the beginning of the 21st century, refinements of the concepts have taken place.  The 2010 revision of the McDonald criteria allowed for the diagnosis of MS with only one proved lesion (CIS).<ref name=mcdonald2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Polman CH, Reingold SC, Banwell B, Clanet M, Cohen JA, Filippi M, Fujihara K, Havrdova E, Hutchinson M, Kappos L, Lublin FD, Montalban X, O'Connor P, Sandberg-Wollheim M, Thompson AJ, Waubant E, Weinshenker B, Wolinsky JS | title = Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–302 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21387374 | pmc = 3084507 | doi = 10.1002/ana.22366 }}</ref>

In 1996, the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) (Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials) defined the first version of the clinical phenotypes that is currently in use. In this first version they provided standardized definitions for 4 MS clinical courses: relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP), primary progressive (PP), and progressive relapsing (PR). In 2010, PR was dropped and CIS was incorporated.<ref name=mcdonald2010/> Subsequently, three years later, the 2013 revision of the "phenotypes for the disease course" were forced to consider CIS as one of the phenotypes of MS, making obsolete some expressions like "conversion from CIS to MS".<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lublin FD, Reingold SC, Cohen JA, Cutter GR, Sørensen PS, Thompson AJ, Wolinsky JS, Balcer LJ, Banwell B, Barkhof F, Bebo B, Calabresi PA, Clanet M, Comi G, Fox RJ, Freedman MS, Goodman AD, Inglese M, Kappos L, Kieseier BC, Lincoln JA, Lubetzki C, Miller AE, Montalban X, O'Connor PW, Petkau J, Pozzilli C, Rudick RA, Sormani MP, Stüve O, Waubant E, Polman CH | title = Defining the clinical course of multiple sclerosis: the 2013 revisions | journal = Neurology | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 278–86 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24871874 | pmc = 4117366 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000560 }}</ref> Other organizations have proposed later new clinical phenotypes, like HAMS (Highly Active MS) as result of the work in DMT approval processes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sørensen PS, Centonze D, Giovannoni G, Montalban X, Selchen D, Vermersch P, Wiendl H, Yamout B, Salloukh H, Rieckmann P | display-authors = 6 | title = Expert opinion on the use of cladribine tablets in clinical practice | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders | volume = 13 | pages = 1756286420935019 | date = 24 June 2020 | pmid = 32636933 | doi = 10.1177/1756286420935019 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Historical cases===
[[File:Animal locomotion. Plate 541 (Boston Public Library).jpg|thumb|left|Photographic study of locomotion of a female with MS with walking difficulties created in 1887 by [[Muybridge]]]]
There are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS and lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot.

A young woman called Halldora who lived in [[Iceland]] around 1200 suddenly lost her vision and mobility but, after praying to the saints, recovered them seven days after. [[Saint Lidwina]] of [[Schiedam]] (1380–1433), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[nun]], may be one of the first clearly identifiable people with MS.

[[Augustus d'Este|Augustus Frederick d'Este]] (1794–1848), son of [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]] and [[Lady Augusta Murray]] and the grandson of [[George&nbsp;III of the United Kingdom]], almost certainly had MS. D'Este left a detailed diary describing his 22 years living with the disease. His diary began in 1822 and ended in 1846, although it remained unknown until 1948. His symptoms began at age 28 with a sudden transient visual loss ([[amaurosis fugax]]) after the funeral of a friend. During his disease, he developed weakness of the legs, clumsiness of the hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder disturbances, and [[erectile dysfunction]]. In 1844, he began to use a wheelchair. Despite his illness, he kept an optimistic view of life.<ref>{{cite book|author= Firth D|title= The Case of August D'Esté |year=1948|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref><ref name="pmid16103678">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce JM | title = Historical descriptions of multiple sclerosis | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16103678 | doi = 10.1159/000087387 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Another early account of MS was kept by the British diarist [[W.

Preliminary data suggests that [[mycophenolate mofetil]], an anti-[[Transplant rejection|rejection]] [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressant medication]], might have benefits in multiple sclerosis.

===Pathogenesis===

MS is a clinically defined entity with several atypical presentations. Some auto-antibodies have been found in atypical MS cases, giving birth to separate disease families and restricting the previously wider concept of MS.

First of all, [[Aquaporin 4|anti-AQP4 autoantibodies]] were found in [[neuromyelitis optica]] (NMO), which was previously considered a MS variant. After that, a whole spectrum of diseases named NMOSD (NMO spectrum diseases) or anti-AQP4 diseases has been accepted.<ref name="Misu">{{cite journal | vauthors = Misu T, Fujihara K | title = Neuromyelitis optica spectrum and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody‐related disseminated encephalomyelitis. | journal = Clinical and Experimental Neuroimmunology | date = February 2019 | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages= 9–17 | doi = 10.1111/cen3.12491 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Later, it was found that some cases of MS were presenting [[myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein|anti-MOG autoantibodies]], mainly overlapping with the [[Marburg multiple sclerosis|Marburg variant]]. Anti-MOG autoantibodies were found to be also present in ADEM, and now a second spectrum of separated diseases is being considered. At this moment, it is named inconsistently across different authors, but it is normally something similar to [[Anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis|anti-MOG demyelinating disease]]s.<ref name="Misu"/>

Finally, a third kind of auto-antibodies is accepted. They are several [[neurofascin|anti-neurofascin]] auto-antibodies which damage the Ranvier nodes of the neurones. These antibodies are more related to the peripheral nervous demyelination, but they were also found in chronic progressive PPMS and [[combined central and peripheral demyelination]] (CCPD, which is considered another atypical MS presentation).<ref name="Kira">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kira JI, Yamasaki R, Ogata H | title = Anti-neurofascin autoantibody and demyelination | journal = Neurochemistry International | volume = 130| pages = 104360| pmid = 30582947 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuint.2018.12.011 | year = 2019 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Besides all this autoantibodies found, four different patterns of demyelination have been reported in MS, opening the door to consider MS as an [[heterogeneous disease]].<ref name="pmid23917093">{{cite journal | vauthors = Popescu BF, Pirko I, Lucchinetti CF | title = Pathology of multiple sclerosis: where do we stand? | journal = Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.) | volume = 19 | issue = 4 Multiple Sclerosis | pages = 901–21 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23917093 | pmc = 3915566 | doi = 10.1212/01.CON.0000433291.23091.65 }}</ref>

While diagnostic criteria are not expected to change in the near future, work to develop [[biomarker]]s that help with diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is ongoing.<ref name="pmid21425270"/> New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti-myelin antibodies, and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but none of them has yielded reliably positive results.<ref name="pmid19712003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris VK, Sadiq SA | title = Disease biomarkers in multiple sclerosis: potential for use in therapeutic decision making | journal = Molecular Diagnosis & Therapy | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 225–44 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19712003 | doi = 10.1007/BF03256329 | s2cid = 43227562 }}</ref>

At the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis. Several promising approaches have been proposed including: [[interleukin-6]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[nitric oxide synthase]], [[osteopontin]], and [[fetuin]]-A.<ref name="pmid19712003"/> Since disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as [[neurofilament]]s, [[Tau protein|tau]], and [[N-acetylaspartate]] are under investigation.<ref name="pmid19712003"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalil M, Teunissen CE, Otto M, Piehl F, Sormani MP, Gattringer T, Barro C, Kappos L, Comabella M, Fazekas F, Petzold A, Blennow K, Zetterberg H, Kuhle J | display-authors = 6 | title = Neurofilaments as biomarkers in neurological disorders | journal = Nature Reviews.

Improvement in neuroimaging techniques such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) carry a promise for better diagnosis and prognosis predictions, although the effect of such improvements in daily medical practice may take several decades.<ref name="pmid21425270"/> Regarding MRI, there are several techniques that have already shown some usefulness in research settings and could be introduced into clinical practice, such as double-inversion recovery sequences, [[magnetization transfer]], [[Diffusion MRI#Diffusion tensor imaging|diffusion tensor]], and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]].<ref name="pmid22159052">{{cite journal | vauthors = Filippi M, Rocca MA, De Stefano N, Enzinger C, Fisher E, Horsfield MA, Inglese M, Pelletier D, Comi G | title = Magnetic resonance techniques in multiple sclerosis: the present and the future | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 68 | issue = 12 | pages = 1514–20 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22159052 | doi = 10.1001/archneurol.2011.914 | doi-access = free }}</ref> These techniques are more specific for the disease than existing ones, but still lack some standardization of acquisition protocols and the creation of normative values.<ref name="pmid22159052"/> There are other techniques under development that include contrast agents capable of measuring levels of peripheral [[macrophage]]s, inflammation, or neuronal dysfunction,<ref name="pmid22159052"/> and techniques that measure iron deposition that could serve to determine the role of this feature in MS, or that of cerebral perfusion.<ref name="pmid22159052"/> Similarly, new PET [[radiotracer]]s might serve as markers of altered processes such as brain inflammation, cortical pathology, [[apoptosis]], or remyelination.<ref name="pmid20636368">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kiferle L, Politis M, Muraro PA, Piccini P | title = Positron emission tomography imaging in multiple sclerosis-current status and future applications | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–31 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20636368 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03154.x | s2cid = 23472882 }}</ref> Antibiodies against the [[Kir4.1]] potassium channel may be related to MS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Methner A, Zipp F | title = Multiple sclerosis in 2012: Novel therapeutic options and drug targets in MS | journal = Nature Reviews.

===Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency===
{{Main|Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency}}
In 2008, vascular surgeon [[Paolo Zamboni]] suggested that MS involves narrowing of the veins draining the brain, which he referred to as [[chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] (CCSVI). He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study, performed a surgical procedure, later called in the media the "liberation procedure" to correct it, and claimed that 73% of participants improved.<ref name="pmid19060024">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zamboni P, Galeotti R, Menegatti E, Malagoni AM, Tacconi G, Dall'Ara S, Bartolomei I, Salvi F | title = Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in patients with multiple sclerosis | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 392–9 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19060024 | pmc = 2647682 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2008.157164 }}</ref> This theory received significant attention in the media and among those with MS, especially in Canada.<ref name="pmid23402260">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pullman D, Zarzeczny A, Picard A | title = Media, politics and science policy: MS and evidence from the CCSVI Trenches | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 14 | pages = 6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23402260 | pmc = 3575396 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6939-14-6 }}</ref> Concerns have been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and its assumptions about the underlying cause of the disease are not backed by known data.<ref name="pmid20398855">{{cite journal | vauthors = Qiu J | title = Venous abnormalities and multiple sclerosis: another breakthrough claim? | journal = The Lancet.
