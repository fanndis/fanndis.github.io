==History==
[[File:JAC Chandler.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[J. A. C. Chandler]]]]
The foundations of Old Dominion University began in the minds of administrators and officials at the College of William and Mary in the first decades of the twentieth century. Notable among these men were Robert M. Hughes, a member of the Board of Visitors of William and Mary  from 1893 to 1917, and [[J. A. C. Chandler]], the eighteenth president of that school.<ref name=RUTYNA>Rutyna, Richard A.; Kuehl, John W. ''Old Dominion University: Heritage and Horizons''. Norfolk, Virginia: Donning Company. 1987.</ref><ref name="Healy">{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/exhibits/odu75thanniversary/norfolkdivision.htm |title=ODU Libraries Exhibit - ODU 75th Anniversary - 2005 |work=Old Dominion University |access-date=May 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313134227/http://www.lib.odu.edu/exhibits/odu75thanniversary/norfolkdivision.htm |archive-date=March 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1924 after becoming the director of the William and Mary extension in Norfolk, Joseph Healy began organizing classes and finding locations for faculty and staff. He along with the collective efforts of Robert M. Hughes, Dr. J. A. C. Chandler, and A. H. Foreman, a two-year branch division was established on March 13, 1930.<ref name=RUTYNA/><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/85/moments/history |title=University History |work= Old Dominion University |access-date= February 1, 2016 }}</ref> On September 12, 1930, the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary held its first class with 206 students (125 men and 81 women) in the old Larchmont School building which was an abandoned elementary school on Hampton Boulevard. On September 3, 1930, H. Edgar Timmerman became the Division's first director.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/units/85/sept-moments/annals-odufirstdecade.pdf |format=Ppdf |title=Annals of the College of William and Mary in Norfolk : The First Decade : 1930-1940 |edition=Revised |work= Old Dominion University  |access-date= May 6, 2016 }}</ref> 
[[File:Original sign from Old Dominion University.jpg|thumb|right|Original sign from the Norfolk Division]]

"The Division", as it was often called, started out in the old Larchmont School building and allowed people with less financial assets to attend a school of higher education for two years.<ref name=RUTYNA/>  Tuition for the first year was 50 USD.<ref name=RUTYNA/> The following September, [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], more commonly known as Virginia Tech, began offering classes at "The Division", expanding the number of courses taught.<ref name=RUTYNA/> Old Dominion began educating teachers and engineers. Created in the first year of the [[Great Depression]], the college benefited from federal funding as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].<ref name=RUTYNA/> The [[Public Works Administration]] provided funds for the Administration Building, now Rollins Hall, and [[Foreman Field]], named after A. H. Foreman, an early proponent of the college.<ref name=RUTYNA/>

In 1932, Lewis Warrington Webb joined the faculty as an instructor of engineering; he would later be called "the Father of Old Dominion". After serving ten years as an instructor at the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary, Webb was appointed assistant director in 1942. Webb also served as director of the Defense and War Training Program at the college from 1940 to 1944. Through its defense and training classes, the Norfolk Division contributed to the war effort. The program also allowed the school to remain open during a period when most young men were serving their country. The program attracted many women, who learn aircraft repair, drafting and other war-related subjects. In 1946, Webb was appointed Director of the Norfolk Division. Webb's dream was to see the Norfolk Division become an independent institution.

The two-year Norfolk Division rapidly evolved into a four-year institution, and Webb saw his dream fulfilled in 1962 when the Norfolk Division gained its independence from William and Mary. On February 16, 1962, the William and Mary system was dissolved under General Assembly legislation that was signed by [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Albertis S. Harrison]]. Later that year the Norfolk Division was renamed Old Dominion College.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Dr. Webb served as the first president of Old Dominion College from 1962 to 1969.

Frank Batten, who was the publisher of ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' and ''[[The Ledger-Star]]'' and member of the Norfolk Division's advisory board, was chosen as the first rector of Old Dominion College on May 27, 1962. He held the position of rector until 1970 and the College of Engineering was named in his honor in 2004. In 1964, the first students lived on campus in the first dormitories, Rodgers and Gresham hall which were names after members of the advisory board.

In 1969, Old Dominion College transitioned to Old Dominion University under the leadership of President James L. Bugg, Jr. During Bugg's tenure the first doctoral programs were established along with a university-wide governance structure in which faculty, administrators and students were represented. Bugg also reestablished the [[Army ROTC]] program that had been originally created in 1948 but had been abandoned because of the outbreak of the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/about/president/past-presidents/james-bugg |title=James L.

In the 1970s, during the tenure of President Alfred B. Rollins, Jr., Old Dominion began mutual partnerships between regional organizations such as [[NASA]], the [[U.S. Navy]], [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]], and [[Norfolk State University]]. This was a result of Dr. Rollins goal of becoming the leading educational institution in the [[Hampton Roads]] area. Under Rollins, the university expanded its state and private funding, improved student services and introduced an honors program along with many other improvements to the university. In 1971 the university established its own campus police force and hired several police officers to patrol the campus. In 1977, the Virginia Campus Police Act was made into a law, the university helped train local and campus police officers and the campus police officers were given full police authority on and around the campus grounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/about/president/past-presidents/alfred-rollins |title=Alfred B. Rollins, Jr. |work= Old Dominion University |access-date=February 1, 2016 }}</ref>

The college grew southward along Hampton Boulevard, turning an empty field into a sprawling campus. After completion at the Norfolk Division, students would move on to schools offering degrees or would seek careers locally. "The Division" began by educating teachers and engineers.

In 1962, it became an autonomous four-year college under the name Old Dominion College.

Following growth in enrollment, the expansion of research facilities, and preparation for the addition of graduate programs, the board to seek and receive university status in 1969.<ref name=RUTYNA/>

Since this time, the university has continued to grow and now has an enrollment of over 24,000 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://admissions.odu.edu/undergraduate.php?page=stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215104839/http://admissions.odu.edu/undergraduate.php?page=stats |url-status=dead |archive-date= December 15, 2008 |title=Undergraduate Statistics |work= Old Dominion University |access-date=February 18, 2012  }}</ref>

==Campus==

===The Norfolk Campus===

Old Dominion University has undergone extensive growth. The swell of new construction was kicked off in 2001 with the building of the [[Ted Constant Convocation Center]]. This 8,600 seat arena has become the home of both men's and women's basketball, as well as a premiere venue for concerts and other performances. The "Ted" as it is affectionately called by students and alumni is part of a $55 million {{convert|75|acre|ha|adj=on}} development known as The University Village.

[[File:Monarch Fountain during Homecoming.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Monarch Fountain during Homecoming]]

Student housing has grown at ODU. The Quad, a collection of six new residential buildings—Ireland House (2006), Virginia House (2007), Scotland House (2008), France House (2009), England House (2009), Dominion House (2009)—and offices brings Old Dominion University closer to its goal of becoming a more residential university. Constructed alongside the Quad is the new student Recreation and Wellness Center. The center offers intramural and extramurals for the students and staff. ODU has expanded its sports facilities, recently completing the Folkes-Stevens Indoor Tennis Center and the Powhatan Sports Complex,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/305111 |title=Ground broken on ODU's $17 million Powhatan Sports Center &#124; Sports &#124; pilotonline.com |website=Hamptonroads.com |date=2007-08-03 |access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> a {{convert|48000|sqft|adj=on}} facility that houses the intercollegiate athletic programs of field hockey, women's lacrosse, and football. Another football-related project was the renovation of Old Dominion University's historic [[Foreman Field]] for the sport's reintroduction in 2009.

Among the facilities are the fully automated Perry Library, laboratories in the sciences and engineering, the E.V. Williams Engineering and Computational Sciences Building, and the new Systems Research Building. The campus is also home to Pretlow Planetarium, the Lions Child Study Center, facilities for clinical work in the health sciences, a modern Oceanography and Physics Building, the Gornto TELETECHNET Center and the Diehn Fine and Performing Arts Center. Recent additions include the Student Success Center and Learning Commons, an orchid conservatory and research building, as well as renovation to the Technology Building and the Batten Arts and Letters Building.

In 2015, Old Dominion University started construction on the New Education Building and a new 45,000 sf student dining facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/life/buildings/buildings/projects |title=Capital Projects - Old Dominion University |publisher=Odu.edu |date=2015-08-31 |access-date=2016-02-01}}</ref>

===The University Libraries===
[[File:Patricia W. and J. Douglas Perry Library.JPG|250px|thumb|Patricia W. and J. Douglas Perry Library]]

The Old Dominion University Libraries are the Patricia W. and J. Douglas Perry Library, the F. Ludwig Diehn Composers Room, and the Elise N. Hofheimer Art Library. The libraries contain over 3 million items—books, government publications, journals and serials, microform, musical scores, recordings, and maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 29, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530004513/http://www.lib.odu.edu/index.htm |archive-date=May 30, 2015 }}</ref> After months of renovation, the Perry Library first floor was transformed into The Learning Commons which opened in 2011.

===University Village===
Established in 1995, the Real Estate Foundation has taken the lead in the development of the University Village, a mixed use development including retail, residential and office buildings. The results of its work are visible to all in the form of the University Village Apartments, restaurants, shops, the North Village Parking Garage, the Innovation Research Park, Marriott SpringHill Suites Hotel, and Campus Bookstore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/development/re.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803084259/http://www.odu.edu/ao/development/re.html |archive-date=August 3, 2009 }}</ref>

"The University Village is a 75-acre mixed use development initiative by Old Dominion University. With the University, and its 24,000 students and 2,400 staff and faculty, in addition to the Ted Constant Convocation Center as anchors, The University Village is a destination all its own. Two parking decks are conveniently located adjacent to the retail area. The South Parking Deck "C" is located on 43rd Street containing metered parking spaces located on the first floor. Parking Deck "D" is located on 45th Street containing metered parking spaces located on the second floor."<ref>{{cite web |title=About The Village |url=http://www.oduvillage.com/about.shtml |website=Old Dominion University Real Estate}}</ref>

===Campus ministries===
ODU students can join campus ministries which are coordinated by the University Chaplain's Association (UCA). Ministries include the [[United Methodist]], [[Baptist]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterian]] and [[Lutheran]] denominationally sponsored ministries. [[InterVarsity Christian Fellowship]] has a presence at ODU and are members of the UCA. Each of these churches has a campus ministry presence at ODU, as does [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life]], and the [[Islam|Tidewater Islamic Center]], which serves the [[Muslim]] community at ODU.

===Maglev===
In 1999, ODU agreed to work with American Maglev Technogies of Atlanta to construct an on-campus student transportation link of less than one mile using a ''smart train / dumb track'' design in which most sensors, magnets, and computation were located on the train rather than the track.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NJ&p_theme=nj&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F420E16183164ED&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title = Maglev train makes tracks to Va |publisher=news-journalonline.org |first = Michael |last = Giusti |date =12 June 2002}}</ref> With cost and safety concern, several other institutes of higher learning rejected the project. While projected to cost less to build per mile than existing systems, the ODU maglev was never operational. After depleting its $14 million budget, a groundbreaking was held in 2001, the project was completed in 2002; and the technology failed: the vehicle lost its "float" and come to a full friction stop on top of the rail, damaging much of the system. American Maglev and ODU dissolved their relationship and the project became an internal university research project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eng.odu.edu/maglev/ |title=Maglev Development Project |publisher=Eng.odu.edu |access-date=2012-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316085226/http://eng.odu.edu/maglev/ |archive-date=2012-03-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://orgs.odu.edu/studentvoice/secondmeeting.html |title=The Student Voice: Will the Maglev Ever Run? |publisher=Dominion University |access-date=5 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117053205/http://orgs.odu.edu/studentvoice/secondmeeting.html |archive-date=17 November 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://sci.odu.edu/sci/scire/20Edition/college/maglev.htm |title = President Runte Comments On Status Of Maglev |publisher = Dominion College of Sciences Newsletter |access-date = 5 February 2007 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901145445/http://sci.odu.edu/sci/scire/20Edition/college/maglev.htm |archive-date = 1 September 2006 }}</ref> In October 2006, the research team performed an unscheduled test of the car that went smoothly.

===Student traditions===
[[File:Old Dominion University Seal.JPG|thumb|Old Dominion University Seal]]
Walking across the Old Dominion University seal is a rite of passage for graduating students on graduation day. Legend has it that undergraduates should never walk across the University Seal located on Kaufman Mall. Whoever does so will not graduate from Old Dominion in four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odu.edu/life/gettinginvolved/spirit/campus-traditions |title=Campus Traditions - Old Dominion University |publisher=Odu.edu |access-date=2016-02-01}}</ref>

Following the inaugural season of football, a new tradition of dying the fountain blue for homecoming was started.

==Athletics==
{{main|Old Dominion Monarchs and Lady Monarchs}}
Old Dominion's 18 athletic teams are known as the [[Old Dominion Monarchs|Monarchs]] (men's teams, plus field hockey, women's lacrosse, and coed sailing) and [[Old Dominion Lady Monarchs|Lady Monarchs]] (all other women's teams) and mostly compete in the NCAA Division I [[Conference USA]] (C-USA). Old Dominion University athletic teams have captured 28 team national championships and four individual titles. The school's best-known sports team is the Lady Monarchs [[basketball]] team, which has won three national championships in 1979 (AIAW), 1980 (AIAW) and 1985 (NCAA). The Lady Monarchs also made it to the 1997 Women's NCAA Championship Game, losing to Tennessee. ODU athletic teams have won a further 28 national championships including 15 in men's and women's sailing and 9 in women's field hockey. The Lady Monarchs' nine national titles in field hockey are in NCAA record books for most titles in that sport by the same school.

In addition, Old Dominion's athletic teams have captured 49 championships in the Colonial Athletic Association.

In March 2010, Dr. Wood Selig became the new athletic director. Previously, Dr. Selig was the athletic director at [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers|Western Kentucky]].<ref>Jon Gold, [http://www.insidesocal.com/ucla/2010/03/ross-bjork-named-western-kentu.html Ross Bjork named Western Kentucky University A.D.], ''Los Angeles Daily News'', March 12, 2010</ref>

On May 17, 2012 Old Dominion announced it would move to C-USA on July 1, 2013. Four ODU sports which are not sponsored by C-USA have outside affiliations.

===ODU-VCU rivalry===

{{main|VCU-ODU basketball rivalry}}
[[Virginia Commonwealth University]] is ODU's archrival, mainly because of the similarities between the two schools. Both schools were once part of the [[College of William and Mary]] and both are urban research universities located just 90 miles apart.<ref>{{cite web |author=21 Jan |url=http://www.caahoops.com/2011/01/vcuodu-the-rivalry-is-just-different/ |title=VCU/ODU: The Rivalry Is Just Different… |publisher=Caahoops.com |access-date=2012-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119120344/http://www.caahoops.com/2011/01/vcuodu-the-rivalry-is-just-different/ |archive-date=2012-01-19 }}</ref>

===Men's basketball===
{{Main|Old Dominion Monarchs basketball}}
[[File:Ted Constant Center retouched.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old Dominion's [[Chartway Arena]]]]

The Old Dominion University Monarchs (men's) basketball team have captured six CAA championship titles (1992, 1995, 1997, 2005, 2010, and 2011) since their conference admission in 1992, which is the most among all CAA schools. In 2007, they received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, when the team went 24-8 and finished 37th in RPI. That season included a notable 13-point win at 8th ranked Georgetown. Their most recent trip to the NCAA tournament was with an automatic bid after capturing the 2010 CAA title. During the NCAA tournament, the 11th seeded Monarchs managed a 1-point first-round upset over the 6th seeded Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.

In 2002 ODU opened the [[Chartway Arena]] for the 2002-2003 basketball season.  "The Ted" has 8,600 fully cushioned seats, 16 luxury suites, and a state-of-the-art scoreboard. In addition to being used for home basketball games, the Constant Center hosts family-oriented events as well as concerts, lectures, and commencement ceremonies.

===Women's basketball===
{{Main|Old Dominion Lady Monarchs basketball}}
Old Dominion also holds an important place in the history of women's collegiate athletics, having awarded the first athletic scholarship to any woman in the state of Virginia for a varsity sport when [[Nancy Lieberman]] was awarded a scholarship to play women's basketball.

The Old Dominion Lady Monarchs basketball team has won three national championships. In 1979 and 1980, the Lady Monarchs were AIAW Champions. In 1985, they captured the NCAA Division I National Championship with a 70-65 win over the University of Georgia. In addition, the Lady Monarchs have captured five Sun Belt conference championship titles (1983, 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1990), and captured 17 CAA championship titles, winning every year from 1991-92 to 2007–08.

===Monarch football===
{{Main|Old Dominion Monarchs football}}

The history of football at ODU began with the Norfolk Division, which had a football team until 1941 known as the Norfolk Division Braves. The program dissolved due to a rule against freshman players and a $10,000 debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/alumni_magazine/fall05/75greatmoments.html |title=Special Section-75 Great Moments in ODU History |website=Odu.edu |access-date=2016-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717062852/http://www.odu.edu/ao/alumni_magazine/Fall05/75GreatMoments.html |archive-date=2012-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On June 14, 2005, its [[Board of Visitors]] approved by a 14-0 vote the creation of an [[NCAA Division I]] team, which began play on September 5, 2009.

On February 9, 2007, ODU's Athletic Director Jim Jarrett announced that [[Bobby Wilder]], the associate head football coach at the [[University of Maine]], would be the head football coach at Old Dominion University. The team signed its first class in 2008. As is the case with many new football programs, all players on the 2008 Monarchs football team were redshirted, and when added with the 2009 signing class and transfers from I-A schools, formed the nucleus of the school's first football team. Initially, ODU competed as an FCS program (formerly I-AA), and was independent for two years before joining the Colonial Athletic Association for the 2011 season.

The final record for Old Dominion's 2009 football program was 9-2, at the time the best winning record ever for a first-year collegiate football program. This record is now held by [[Mercer University]] who finished 10-2 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpb.org/news/2013/11/25/mercer-football-has-winningest-debut-season-in-ncaa-division-i-history |title=Mercer Football Has Winningest Debut Season In NCAA Division I History |publisher=Gpb.org |date=2013-11-25 |access-date=2014-08-15}}</ref> Old Dominion's football program had continued success in 2010 finishing 8-3. In the following years, Old Dominion's football program finished their 2011-2012 season with a 10-3 record, and an 11-2 record for their 2012-2013 season which gained national attention. As the school's football program began to grow along with the university itself, Old Dominion's potential was realized by several commissioners for college football, particularly by Conference USA. Old Dominion officially joined Conference USA (C-USA) on July 1, 2013 leaving behind their former conference affiliation with the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA).<ref>Fairbank, Dave.

[[Foreman Field]], formerly the [[field hockey]] and women's lacrosse teams' home venue, has been renovated to accommodate the new football program. Field Hockey and women's lacrosse teams have been relocated to the Powhatan Sports Complex.

As of the 2015 season the ODU football program has sold out every home game that has ever been played at [[Foreman Field]], 48 consecutive sellouts.

===Wrestling===

Old Dominion University Monarch Wrestling team was established in 1957. The school's departure from the CAA forced the [[College wrestling|Wrestling]] team to become an associate member of the [[Mid-American Conference]], as Conference USA does not sponsor wrestling. Old Dominion's most recent head wrestling coach was Steve Martin, who served for ten seasons with the program.<ref>{{cite web |title=ODU Athletics: Wrestling Team|url=http://www.odusports.com/fls/31100/old_site/pdf/m-wrestl/m-wrestl-07-08-media-guide.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=31100|publisher=Old Dominion University Athletics |access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref>

On April 2, 2020, Old Dominion Athletics Director [[Camden Wood Selig]] announced that the wrestling program would be cut "immediately" based on the conclusion of a six month study by outside consultant Richard Sander, staff member of East Tennessee State Athletics Department. According to the study, discontinuing varsity wrestling at Old Dominion would save the department $1 million and help offset recent budget cutbacks due to declining enrollment at the university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Old Dominion cuts wrestling, citing financial impact of coronavirus|url=https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/28988850/old-dominion-cuts-wrestling-citing-financial-impact-coronavirus|publisher=ESPN|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>

===Rowing===
The ODU Rowing Club (ODURC) has been under the Recreational Sports department since 1985. The club is fully student-run and is funded largely by the student members of the club. ODURC has been very successful in recent years, as it has increased its membership. Adding outstanding volunteer coaches in recent years has raised the competitiveness of the team greatly, and the men's club won a national championship in May, 2008.
Today, male and female rowers continue to compete as a club; in 2008 rowing also became a varsity sport for female students, and a full-time coach was hired for the new women's team. Within their first year at varsity level, the women's team placed at a national competition. The decision to elevate only the women's team to varsity status was made to keep ODU compliant with [[Title IX]] regulations, providing balance to the increased spending on men's athletics that a football program brought.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/news/media.php?todo=details&todo=details&id=10312 |title=Odu Rowing Club Team Captures National Championship |publisher=Odu.edu |date=2008-06-04 |access-date=2012-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307115848/http://www.odu.edu/ao/news/media.php?todo=details&todo=details&id=10312 |archive-date=2012-03-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Cheerleading (co-ed)===
Led by head coach Carmen Harris, the Old Dominion University cheer squad is a safe, professional and athletic program. Its energetic team consists of athletes who are also students. The cheer squad, along with the Old Dominion Dynasty Dance Team, performs at all football home games as well as most football away games. They also perform at all Men and Women's Basketball home games, and occasionally a home soccer or baseball game. Along with their practices, games, competitions, and other events, ODU cheerleaders are required to actively participate in all fundraising efforts and volunteer work under their Spirit Squad Program.
The ODU cheer team began competing at the NCA College Nationals in Daytona, FL in 2016. Old Dominion cheerleaders placed first in the Division 1A Intermediate All-Girl Division in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odusports.com/trads/oldd-cheerleading.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325060453/http://www.odusports.com/trads/oldd-cheerleading.html |archive-date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref>
