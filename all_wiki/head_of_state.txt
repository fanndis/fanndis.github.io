A '''head of state''' (or '''chief of state''') is the public [[persona]] who officially embodies a [[state (polity)|state]]<ref name="Foakes2014">[[#Foakes|Foakes]], pp. 110–11 "[The head of state] being an embodiment of the State itself or representatitve of its international persona."</ref> in its unity and legitimacy. Depending on the country's [[form of government]] and [[separation of powers]], the head of state may be a ceremonial [[figurehead]] (such as the [[British Monarch]]) or concurrently the [[head of government]] and more (such as the [[President of the United States]], who is also [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[US Armed Forces]]).

In a [[parliamentary system]], such as [[Politics of India|India]] and [[Politics of Pakistan|Pakistan]], the head of state usually has mostly ceremonial powers, with a separate head of government.<ref>[[#Foakes|Foakes]], p. 62</ref> However, in some parliamentary systems, like [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]], there is an executive president that is both head of state and head of government. Likewise, in some parliamentary systems the head of state is not the head of government, but still has significant powers, for example [[Politics of Morocco|Morocco]]. In contrast, a [[semi-presidential system]], such as [[Politics of France|France]], has both heads of state and government as the ''de facto'' leaders of the nation (in practice they divide the leadership of the nation among themselves). Meanwhile, in [[presidential systems]], the head of state is also the head of government.<ref name="Foakes2014"/>

Former French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], while developing the current [[Constitution of France]] (1958), said that the head of state should embody ''{{lang|fr|l'esprit de la nation}}'' ("the spirit of the nation").<ref name="Kubicek2015">{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Kubicek|title=European Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9uoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34853-5|pages=154–56, 163}}</ref>

An independent [[nation state]] normally has a head of state, and determines the extent of its head's executive powers of government or formal representational functions.<ref name=Watts:0>[[#Watts2010|Watts]].</ref> In terms of [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]]: the head of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], independent state is usually identified as the person who, according to that state's constitution, is the reigning [[monarch]], in the case of a [[monarchy]]; or the president, in the case of a [[republic]].

Among the state [[constitution]]s (fundamental laws) that establish different political systems, four major types of heads of state can be distinguished:

# The [[parliamentary system]], with two subset models;
## The ''standard model'', in which the head of state, in theory, possesses key executive powers, but such power is exercised on the binding advice of a [[head of government]] (e.g. [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], [[Germany]]).
## The ''non-executive model'', in which the head of state has either none or very limited executive powers, and mainly has a ceremonial and symbolic role (e.g. [[Sweden]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]]).
# The [[semi-presidential system]], in which the head of state shares key executive powers with a head of government or cabinet (e.g. [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Sri Lanka]]); and
# The [[presidential system]], in which the head of state is also the head of government and has all executive powers (e.g. [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]]).

In a federal constituent or a dependent territory, the same role is fulfilled by the holder of an office corresponding to that of a head of state. For example, in each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] the role is fulfilled by the [[lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]], whereas in most [[British Overseas Territories]] the powers and duties are performed by the [[British Overseas Territories#Head of State|governor]]. The same applies to [[Governors of the Australian states|Australian states]], [[Governors of states of India|Indian states]], etc. [[Hong Kong]]'s constitutional document, the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], for example, specifies the [[Chief Executive (Hong Kong)|chief executive]] as the head of the special administrative region, in addition to their role as the head of government. These non-sovereign-state heads, nevertheless, have limited or no role in diplomatic affairs, depending on the status and the norms and practices of the territories concerned.

===Parliamentary system===<!-- This section is linked from [[Austria]] -->
[[File:Forms of government parliamentary.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|World's parliamentary states (as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}):<br/>{{small|{{color box|#6EBA6B}} Republics with an executive president elected by a parliament<br/>{{color box|#FF9631}} Parliamentary republics<br/>{{color box|#E45453}} Parliamentary constitutional monarchies in which the monarch usually does not personally exercise power<br/>{{color box|#E0E0E0}} Presidential republics, one-party states, and other forms of government}}]]

====Standard model====
In [[parliamentary system]]s the head of state may be merely the nominal [[chief executive officer]], heading the [[executive branch]] of the state, and possessing limited executive power. In reality, however, following a process of constitutional evolution, powers are usually only exercised by direction of a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]], presided over by a [[head of government]] who is answerable to the legislature. This accountability and legitimacy requires that someone be chosen who has a majority support in the [[legislature]] (or, at least, not a majority opposition – a subtle but important difference). It also gives the legislature the right to vote down the head of [[Forms of government|government]] and their cabinet, forcing it either to resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution. The [[Responsible government|executive branch is thus said to be responsible]] (or answerable) to the legislature, with the head of government and cabinet in turn accepting constitutional responsibility for offering constitutional [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] to the head of state.

In parliamentary [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the legitimacy of the unelected head of state typically derives from the tacit approval of the people via the elected representatives. Accordingly, at the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]], the [[Parliament of England|English parliament]] acted of its own authority to name a new king and queen (the joint monarchs [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]]); likewise, [[Edward VIII]]'s abdication required the approval of each of the six independent realms of which he was monarch. In monarchies with a written constitution, the position of monarch is a creature of the constitution and could quite properly be abolished through a democratic procedure of constitutional amendment, although there are often significant procedural hurdles imposed on such a procedure (as in the [[Constitution of Spain]]).

In republics with a parliamentary system (such as India, Germany, Austria, Italy and Israel), the head of state is usually titled ''[[President (government title)|president]]'' and the principal functions of such presidents are mainly ceremonial and symbolic, as opposed to the presidents in a presidential or semi-presidential system.

In reality, numerous variants exist to the position of a head of state within a parliamentary system. The older the constitution, the more constitutional leeway tends to exist for a head of state to exercise greater powers over government, as many older parliamentary system constitutions in fact give heads of state powers and functions akin to presidential or semi-presidential systems, in some cases without containing reference to modern democratic principles of accountability to parliament or even to modern governmental offices. Usually, the king had the power of declaring war without previous consent of the parliament.

For example, under the 1848 constitution of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]], the ''[[Statuto Albertino]]''—the parliamentary approval to the government appointed by the king—was customary, but not required by law. So, Italy had a {{Lang|lat|[[de facto]]}} parliamentarian system, but a {{Lang|lat|[[de jure]]}} "presidential" system.

Examples of heads of state in parliamentary systems using greater powers than usual, either because of ambiguous constitutions or unprecedented national emergencies, include the decision by King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III of the Belgians]] to surrender on behalf of his state to the invading German army in 1940, against the will of his government. Judging that his responsibility to the nation by virtue of his coronation oath required him to act, he believed that his government's decision to fight rather than surrender was mistaken and would damage Belgium. (Leopold's decision proved highly controversial. After [[World War II]], Belgium voted in a referendum to allow him to resume his monarchical powers and duties, but because of the ongoing controversy he ultimately abdicated.) The Belgian constitutional crisis in 1990, when the [[Baudouin of Belgium|head of state]] refused to sign into law a bill permitting abortion, was resolved by the cabinet assuming the power to promulgate the law while he was treated as "unable to reign" for twenty-four hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/world/belgian-king-unable-to-sign-abortion-law-takes-day-off.html|title=Belgian King, Unable to Sign Abortion Law, Takes Day Off|date=5 April 1990|work=The New York Times|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321121749/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/05/world/belgian-king-unable-to-sign-abortion-law-takes-day-off.html|archive-date=21 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Art. 93.

These officials are excluded completely from the executive: they do not possess even theoretical executive powers or any role, even formal, within the government. Hence their states' governments are not referred to by the traditional parliamentary model head of state [[Style (manner of address)|styles]] of ''His/Her Majesty's Government'' or ''His/Her Excellency's Government''. Within this general category, variants in terms of powers and functions may exist.

The {{nihongo|[[Constitution of Japan]]|日本国憲法|Nihonkoku-Kenpō}} was drawn up under the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] that followed [[World War II]] and was intended to replace the previous [[Militarism|militaristic]] and quasi-[[absolute monarchy]] system with a form of liberal democracy [[parliamentary system]]. The constitution explicitly vests all executive power in the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]], who is chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]] (articles 65 and 66) and responsible to the [[National Diet|Diet]] (articles 67 and 69). The [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] is defined in the constitution as "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people" (article 1), and is generally recognised throughout the world as the Japanese head of state. Although the emperor formally [[Imperial Investiture|appoints]] the prime minister to office, article 6 of the constitution requires him to appoint the candidate "as designated by the Diet", without any right to decline appointment. He is a ceremonial [[figurehead]] with no independent discretionary powers related to the governance of Japan.<ref name=unprotocol>[https://www.un.int/protocol/sites/www.un.int/files/Protocol%20and%20Liaison%20Service/hspmfm.pdf HEADS OF STATE, HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, MINISTERS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825170600/https://www.un.int/protocol/sites/www.un.int/files/Protocol%20and%20Liaison%20Service/hspmfm.pdf |date=25 August 2016 }}, Protocol and Liaison Service, United Nations (8 April 2016).

Since the passage in [[Sweden]] of the [[Instrument of Government (1974)|1974 Instrument of Government]], the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish monarch]] no longer has many of the standard parliamentary system head of state functions that had previously belonged to him or her, as was the case in the preceding [[Instrument of Government (1809)|1809 Instrument of Government]]. Today, the [[speaker of the Riksdag]] appoints (following a vote in the [[Riksdag]]) the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|prime minister]] and terminates his or her commission following a [[vote of no confidence]] or voluntary resignation. Cabinet members are appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the prime minister. Laws and ordinances are promulgated by two Cabinet members in unison signing "On Behalf of the Government" and the government—not the monarch—is the [[high contracting party]] with respect to international treaties. The remaining official functions of the sovereign, by constitutional mandate or by unwritten convention, are to open the annual session of the Riksdag, receive foreign ambassadors and sign the [[Letter of credence|letters of credence]] for Swedish ambassadors, chair the foreign advisory committee, preside at the special Cabinet council when a new prime minister takes office, and to be kept informed by the prime minister on matters of state.<ref name="sweden ig"/><ref>[http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/monarchy/themonarchyinsweden/dutiesofthemonarch.4.396160511584257f2180003302.html Duties of the Monarch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316041821/http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/monarchy/themonarchyinsweden/dutiesofthemonarch.4.396160511584257f2180003302.html |date=16 March 2015 }}, [[Royal Court of Sweden]].

In contrast, the only contact the [[president of Ireland]] has with the Irish government is through a formal briefing session given by the [[taoiseach]] (head of government) to the president. However, he or she has no access to documentation and all access to ministers goes through the [[Department of the Taoiseach]]. The president does, however, hold limited [[reserve powers]], such as referring a bill to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] to test its constitutionality, which are used under the president's discretion.<ref name=ireland/>

The most extreme non-executive republican head of state is the [[president of Israel]], which holds no reserve powers whatsoever{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. The least ceremonial powers held by the president are to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]], to approve the dissolution of the [[Knesset]] made by the prime minister, and to pardon criminals or to commute their sentence.

====Executive model====

Some parliamentary republics (like [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and [[Myanmar]]) have fused the roles of the head of state with the head of government (like in a presidential system), while having the sole executive officer, often called a president, being dependent on the Parliament's confidence to rule (like in a parliamentary system). While also being the leading symbol of the nation, the president in this system acts mostly as a prime minister since the incumbent must be a member of the legislature at the time of the election, answer [[question time|question sessions]] in Parliament, avoid motions of no confidence, etc.

===Semi-presidential systems===
[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles de Gaulle]], President and head of state of the [[French Fifth Republic]] (1959–1969)]]
{{Main|Semi-presidential system}}
Semi-presidential systems combine features of presidential and parliamentary systems, notably (in the president-parliamentary subtype) a requirement that the government be answerable to both the president and the legislature. The [[Constitution of France|constitution]] of the [[Fifth French Republic]] provides for a [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] who is chosen by the president, but who nevertheless must be able to gain support in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]]. Should a president be of one side of the political spectrum and the opposition be in control of the legislature, the president is usually obliged to select someone from the opposition to become prime minister, a process known as [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]. President [[François Mitterrand]], a Socialist, for example, was forced to cohabit with the [[Gaullism|neo-Gaullist]] (right wing) [[Jacques Chirac]], who became his prime minister from 1986 to 1988. In the French system, in the event of cohabitation, the president is often allowed to set the policy agenda in security and foreign affairs and the prime minister runs the domestic and economic agenda.

Other countries evolve into something akin to a semi-presidential system or indeed a full presidential system. [[Weimar Germany]], for example, in its constitution provided for a popularly elected president with theoretically dominant executive powers that were intended to be exercised only in emergencies, and a cabinet appointed by him from the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], which was expected, in normal circumstances, to be answerable to the Reichstag. Initially, the president was merely a symbolic figure with the Reichstag dominant; however, persistent political instability, in which governments often lasted only a few months, led to a change in the power structure of the republic, with the president's emergency powers called increasingly into use to prop up governments challenged by critical or even hostile Reichstag votes. By 1932, power had shifted to such an extent that the German president, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], was able to dismiss a [[chancellor]] and select his own person for the job, even though the outgoing chancellor possessed the confidence of the Reichstag while the new chancellor did not. Subsequently, President von Hindenburg used his power to appoint [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor without consulting the Reichstag.

===Presidential system===
[[File:Washington (3).jpg|thumb|[[George Washington]], the first [[president of the United States]], set the precedent for an executive head of state in republican systems of government<ref>Lifetime portrait (1796), known as the "[[Lansdowne portrait]]", includes spines of two books titled "American Revolution" and "Constitution and Laws of the United States".</ref>]]
{{Main|Presidential system}}

''Note: The head of state in a "presidential" system may not actually hold the title of "[[President (government title)|president]]" - the name of the system refers to any head of state who actually governs and is not directly dependent on the [[legislature]] to remain in office.''

Some constitutions or fundamental laws provide for a head of state who is not only in theory but in practice chief executive, operating separately from, and independent from, the legislature. This system is known as a "presidential system" and sometimes called the "imperial model", because the executive officials of the government are answerable solely and exclusively to a presiding, acting head of state, and is selected by and on occasion dismissed by the head of state without reference to the legislature. It is notable that some presidential systems, while not providing for collective executive accountability to the legislature, may require legislative approval for individuals prior to their assumption of cabinet office and empower the legislature to remove a president from office (for example, in the [[United States|United States of America]]). In this case the debate centers on confirming them into office, not removing them from office, and does not involve the power to reject or approve proposed cabinet members ''en bloc'', so it is not accountability in the sense understood in a parliamentary system.

[[Presidential system]]s are a notable feature of constitutions in the [[Americas]], including those of [[President of Argentina|Argentina]], [[President of Brazil|Brazil]], [[President of Colombia|Colombia]], [[President of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[President of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[President of Venezuela|Venezuela]]; this is generally attributed to the strong influence of the [[United States]] in the region, and as the [[United States Constitution]] served as an inspiration and model for the [[Latin American wars of independence]] of the early 19th century. Most presidents in such countries are selected by democratic means (popular direct or indirect election); however, like all other systems, the presidential model also encompasses people who become head of state by other means, notably through military dictatorship or ''[[coup d'état]]'', as often seen in [[Latin America]]n, [[Middle East]]ern and other presidential regimes. Some of the characteristics of a presidential system (i.e., a strong dominant political figure with an executive answerable to them, not the legislature) can also be found among [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], [[constitutional monarchy|parliamentary monarchies]] and [[single party]] (e.g., [[Communism|Communist]]) regimes, but in most cases of dictatorship, their stated constitutional models are applied in name only and not in political theory or practice.

In the 1870s in the United States, in the aftermath of the [[impeachment]] of President [[Andrew Johnson]] and his near-removal from office, it was speculated that the United States, too, would move from a presidential system to a semi-presidential or even parliamentary one, with the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]] becoming the [[De facto|real]] center of government as a quasi-prime minister.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations ([[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[James Garfield|Garfield]] and [[William McKinley|McKinley]]) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]].

===Single-party states===
In certain states under [[Marxism|Marxist]] constitutions of the [[Socialist state|constitutionally socialist state]] type inspired by the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and its constitutive [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]], real political power belonged to the sole legal party.  In these states, there was no formal office of head of state, but rather the leader of the legislative branch was considered to be the closest common equivalent of a head of state as a [[natural person]]. In the Soviet Union this position carried such titles as ''Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR''; ''Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet''; and in the case of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] ''Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets'' (pre-1922), and ''Chairman of the [[Bureau of the Central Committee]] of the Russian SFSR'' (1956–1966). This position may or may not have been held by the [[de facto]] Soviet leader at the moment. For example, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never headed the Supreme Soviet but was [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party]] (party leader) and [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] ([[head of government]]).

This may even lead to an institutional variability, as in [[North Korea]], where, after the presidency of party leader [[Kim Il-sung]], the office was vacant for years. The late president was granted the posthumous title (akin to some ancient Far Eastern traditions to give posthumous names and titles to royalty) of ''"[[Eternal President of the Republic|Eternal President]]"''. All substantive power, as party leader, itself not formally created for four years, was inherited by his son [[Kim Jong-il]]. The post of president was formally replaced on 5 September 1998, for ceremonial purposes, by the office of [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly]], while the party leader's post as [[chairman of the National Defense Commission]] was simultaneously declared "the highest post of the state", not unlike [[Deng Xiaoping]] earlier in the [[People's Republic of China]].

In [[China]], under the current [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|country's constitution]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power.<ref>{{cite news |title = Ending Term Limits for China's Xi Is a Big Deal.

===Complications with categorisation===
[[File:Delhi durbar 1911 2.jpg|thumb|[[George V]], Emperor of India, and Empress Mary at the [[Delhi Durbar]], 1911.]]

While clear categories do exist, it is sometimes difficult to choose which category some individual heads of state belong to. In reality, the category to which each head of state belongs is assessed not by theory but by practice.

Constitutional change in [[Liechtenstein]] in 2003 gave its head of state, the [[Prince of Liechtenstein|Reigning Prince]], constitutional powers that included a veto over legislation and power to dismiss the [[List of heads of government of Liechtenstein|head of government]] and cabinet.<ref name=liechtenstein>[http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/un/use-of-force/western-europe-others/Liechtenstein/Constitution%20Liechtenstein%202009.pdf Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein (LR 101)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053816/http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/un/use-of-force/western-europe-others/Liechtenstein/Constitution%20Liechtenstein%202009.pdf |date=8 August 2014 }} (2009).

Similarly the original powers given to the [[List of Presidents of Greece|Greek President]] under the [[Constitution of Greece|1974 Hellenic Republic constitution]] moved [[Greece]] closer to the French semi-presidential model.

Another complication exists with [[South Africa]], in which the [[President of South Africa|president]] is in fact elected by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] ([[legislature]]) and is thus similar, in principle, to a [[head of government]] in a [[parliamentary system]] but is also, in addition, recognised as the head of state.<ref name="south africa">[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/SAConstitution-web-eng.pdf Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425031318/http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/SAConstitution-web-eng.pdf |date=25 April 2014 }}, [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development]] (2009).

However, the [[List of heads of state of Panama|elected civilian presidents]] were effectively figureheads with real political power being exercised by the chief of the [[Panamanian Public Forces|Panamanian Defense Forces]].

Historically, at the time of the [[League of Nations]] (1920–1946) and the founding of the [[United Nations]] (1945), [[British India|India's]] head of state was the monarch of the United Kingdom, ruling directly or indirectly as [[Emperor of India]] through the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy and Governor-General of India]].

Head of state is the highest-ranking constitutional position in a sovereign state.  A head of state has some or all of the roles listed below, often depending on the constitutional category (above), and does not necessarily regularly exercise the most power or influence of governance.  There is usually a formal public ceremony when a person becomes head of state, or some time after. This may be the swearing in at the [[inauguration]] of a president of a republic, or the [[coronation]] of a monarch.

===Symbolic role===
One of the most important roles of the modern head of state is being a living [[national symbol]] of the state; in hereditary monarchies this extends to the monarch being a symbol of the unbroken continuity of the state. For instance, the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]] is described by the government as being the [[Monarchy of Canada#Personification of the Canadian state|personification of the Canadian state]] and is described by the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] as the "personal symbol of allegiance, unity and authority for all Canadians".<ref name=Heritage>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1363187221658|title=The Crown in Canada|access-date=31 August 2014|publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]]|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051404/http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1363187221658|archive-date=8 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/TheQueensroleinCanada.aspx The Queen's role in Canada] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220102227/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/TheQueensroleinCanada.aspx |date=20 February 2009 }}, [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]. Retrieved on 2 November 2012.</ref>

In many countries, official [[portrait]]s of the head of state can be found in government offices, courts of law, or other public buildings. The idea, sometimes regulated by law, is to use these portraits to make the public aware of the symbolic connection to the government, a practice that dates back to medieval times. Sometimes this practice is taken to excess, and the head of state becomes the principal symbol of the nation, resulting in the emergence of a [[personality cult]] where the image of the head of state is the only visual representation of the country, surpassing other symbols such as the [[flag]].

Other common representations are on [[coin]]s, [[Postage stamp|postage and other stamps]] and [[banknote]]s, sometimes by no more than a mention or signature; and public places, streets, monuments and institutions such as schools are named for current or previous heads of state. In monarchies (e.g., Belgium) there can even be a practice to attribute the adjective "royal" on demand based on existence for a given number of years. However, such political techniques can also be used by leaders without the formal rank of head of state, even party - and other revolutionary leaders without formal state mandate.

Heads of state often greet important foreign visitors, particularly visiting heads of state. They assume a host role during a [[state visit]], and the programme may feature playing of the [[national anthem]]s by a [[military band]], inspection of [[Guard of honour|military troops]], official exchange of gifts, and attending a [[state dinner]] at the [[official residence]] of the host.

At home, heads of state are expected to render lustre to various occasions by their presence, such as by attending artistic or sports performances or competitions (often in a theatrical honour box, on a platform, on the front row, at the honours table), expositions, [[National Day|national day celebrations]], dedication events, military parades and war remembrances, prominent funerals, visiting different parts of the country and people from different walks of life, and at times performing symbolic acts such as [[Ribbon-cutting ceremony|cutting a ribbon]], [[groundbreaking]], [[Ship naming and launching|ship christening]], laying the first stone. Some parts of national life receive their regular attention, often on an annual basis, or even in the form of official patronage.

The [[Olympic Charter]] (rule 55.3) of the [[International Olympic Committee]] states that the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|winter games]] shall be [[List of people who have opened the Olympic Games|opened by]] the head of state of the host nation, by uttering a single formulaic phrase as determined by the charter.<ref>[https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/General/EN-Olympic-Charter.pdf Olympic Charter: in force as of 2 August 2016] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919080933/https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/General/EN-Olympic-Charter.pdf |date=19 September 2016 }}, [[International Olympic Committee]] (August 2016).

As such invitations may be very numerous, such duties are often in part [[delegation|delegated]] to such persons as a spouse, a [[head of government]] or a [[cabinet minister]] or in other cases (possibly as a message, for instance, to distance themselves without rendering offence) just a military officer or civil servant.

For non-executive heads of state there is often a degree of censorship by the politically responsible government (such as the [[head of government]]). This means that the government discreetly approves agenda and speeches, especially where the constitution (or customary law) assumes all political responsibility by granting the crown inviolability (in fact also imposing political emasculation) as in the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] from its very beginning; in a monarchy this may even be extended to some degree to other members of the dynasty, especially the heir to the throne.

Below follows a list of examples from different countries of general provisions in law, which either designate an office as head of state or define its general purpose.

===Executive role===
In the majority of states, whether republics or monarchies, [[executive branch|executive authority]] is vested, at least notionally, in the head of state. In presidential systems the head of state is the actual, [[de facto]] chief executive officer. Under parliamentary systems the executive authority is exercised by the head of state, but in practice is done so on the advice of the cabinet of ministers. This produces such terms as "Her Majesty's Government" and "His Excellency's Government." Examples of parliamentary systems in which the head of state is notional chief executive include [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

====Appointment of senior officials====
The head of state usually appoints most or all the key officials in the government, including the [[head of government]] and other cabinet ministers, key judicial figures; and all major office holders in the [[civil service]], [[foreign service]] and [[commissioned officer|commissioned officers in the military]]. In many parliamentary systems, the head of government is appointed with the consent (in practice often decisive) of the legislature, and other figures are appointed on the head of government's advice.

In practice, these decisions are often a formality. The last time the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] was unilaterally selected by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] was in 1963, when Queen [[Elizabeth II]] appointed [[Alec Douglas-Home]] on the advice of outgoing Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]].

In presidential systems, such as that of the United States, appointments are nominated by the president's sole discretion, but this nomination is often subject to confirmation by the legislature; and specifically in the US, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] has to approve senior executive branch and judicial appointments by a simple majority vote.<ref name="us constitution"/>

The head of state may also dismiss office-holders. There are many variants on how this can be done. For example, members of the Irish Cabinet are dismissed by the [[President of Ireland|president]] on the advice of the [[taoiseach]]; in other instances, the head of state may be able to dismiss an office holder unilaterally; other heads of state, or their representatives, have the theoretical power to dismiss any office-holder, while it is exceptionally rarely used.<ref name=ireland>[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html Constitution of Ireland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820000112/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/en/constitution/index.html |date=20 August 2015 }}, Office of the Attorney General (December 2013).

====Military role====

[[File:21 juli 2011 Defilé Koning Albert II.png|thumb|[[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]], [[Monarchy of Belgium|King of the Belgians]] inspecting [[Belgian Armed Forces|troops]] on Belgium's [[national day]] in 2011]]

A head of state is often, by virtue of holding the highest executive powers, explicitly designated as the [[commander-in-chief]] of that nation's [[armed forces]], holding the highest office in all military [[chain of command|chains of command]].

In a constitutional monarchy or non-executive presidency, the head of state may [[de jure]] hold ultimate authority over the armed forces but will only normally, as per either written law or unwritten convention, exercise their authority on the advice of their responsible ministers: meaning that the [[de facto]] ultimate decision making on military manoeuvres is made elsewhere. The head of state will, regardless of actual authority, perform ceremonial duties related to the country's armed forces, and will sometimes appear in military uniform for these purposes; particularly in monarchies where also the monarch's consort and other members of a [[royal family]] may also appear in military garb. This is generally the only time a head of state of a stable, democratic country will appear dressed in such a manner, as statesmen and public are eager to assert the [[civilian control of the military|primacy of (civilian, elected) politics over the armed forces]].

In [[military dictatorship]]s, or governments which have arisen from [[coups d'état]], the position of commander-in-chief is obvious, as all authority in such a government derives from the application of military force; occasionally a power vacuum created by war is filled by a head of state stepping beyond his or her normal constitutional role, as King [[Albert I of Belgium]] did during [[World War I]]. In these and in revolutionary regimes, the head of state, and often [[executive minister]]s whose offices are legally civilian, will frequently appear in military uniform.

===Legislative roles===
It is usual that the head of state, particularly in parliamentary systems as part of the symbolic role, is the one who opens the annual sessions of the legislature, e.g. the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]] with the [[Speech from the Throne]] in Britain. Even in presidential systems the head of state often formally reports to the legislature on the present national status, e.g. the [[State of the Union address]] in the United States of America, or the State of the Nation Address in South Africa.

Most countries require that all [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s passed by the house or houses of the legislature be signed into law by the head of state. In some states, such as the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland, the head of state is, in fact, formally considered a tier of the legislature. However, in most parliamentary systems, the head of state cannot refuse to sign a bill, and, in granting a bill their assent, indicate that it was passed in accordance with the correct procedures. The signing of a bill into law is formally known as ''[[promulgation]]''. Some monarchical states call this procedure ''[[royal assent]]''.

::''Example 1 (non-executive parliamentary monarchy):'' Chapter 1, Article 4 of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish ''Riksdag Act'']] provides that:

They may have authority to veto a bill until the houses of the legislature have reconsidered it, and approved it a second time; reserve a bill to be signed later, or suspend it indefinitely (generally in states with [[royal prerogative]]; this power is rarely used); refer a bill to the courts to test its constitutionality; refer a bill to the people in a [[referendum]].

If he or she is also chief executive, he or she can thus politically control the necessary executive measures without which a proclaimed law can remain dead letter, sometimes for years or even forever.

===Summoning and dissolving the legislature===
A head of state is often empowered to summon and dissolve the country's [[legislature]]. In most [[parliamentary system]]s, this is often done on the advice of the [[head of government]]. In some parliamentary systems, and in some presidential systems, however, the head of state may do so on their own initiative. Some states have fixed term legislatures, with no option of bringing forward elections (e.g., Article II, Section 3, of the [[U.S. Constitution]]<ref name="us constitution"/>). In other systems there are usually fixed terms, but the head of state retains authority to dissolve the legislature in certain circumstances. Where a head of government has lost support in the legislature, some heads of state may refuse a dissolution, where one is requested, thereby forcing the head of government's resignation.

==Official title==
In a [[republic]], the head of state nowadays usually bears the title of [[President (government title)|President]], but some have or had had other titles.<ref name=unprotocol/><ref name=Robertson:221/> Titles commonly used by monarchs are [[King]]/[[Queen Regnant|Queen]] or [[Emperor]]/[[Empress]], but also many other; e.g., [[Grand Duke]], [[Prince]], [[Emir]] and [[Sultan]].

Though [[President (government title)|president]] and various monarchical titles are most commonly used for heads of state, in some nationalistic regimes, the leader adopts, formally or de facto, a unique style simply meaning "leader" in the national language, e.g., Germany's single [[NSDAP|national socialist party chief]] and combined head of state and government, [[Adolf Hitler]], as the ''[[Führer]]'' between 1934 and 1945.

In 1959, when former [[United Kingdom|British]] crown colony [[Singapore]] gained self-government, it adopted the Malay style ''[[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]]'' (literally means "head of state" in [[Malay language|Malay]]) for its governor (the actual head of state remained the British monarch). The second and last incumbent of the office, [[Yusof bin Ishak]], kept the style at 31 August 1963 unilateral declaration of independence and after 16 September 1963 accession to [[Malaysia]] as a state (so now as a constituent part of the federation, a non-sovereign level). After its expulsion from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, Singapore became a sovereign [[republic within the Commonwealth|Commonwealth republic]] and installed Yusof bin Ishak as its first president.

In 1959 after the resignation of [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]] [[Mohammad Hatta]], [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]] abolished the position and title of vice-president, assuming the positions of Prime Minister and Head of Cabinet. He also proclaimed himself [[president for life]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Presiden Seumur Hidup Panglima Tertinggi''; "''panglima''" meaning "commander or martial figurehead", "''tertinggi''" meaning "highest"; roughly translated to English as "Supreme Commander of the Revolution"). He was praised as "''Paduka Yang Mulia''", a [[Malay titles|Malay honorific]] originally given to kings; Sukarno awarded himself titles in that fashion due to his noble ancestry.

There are also a few nations in which the exact title and definition of the office of head of state have been vague. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], following the downfall of [[Liu Shaoqi]], who was [[President of the People's Republic of China|State Chairman]] (Chinese President), no successor was named, so the duties of the head of state were transferred collectively to the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. This situation was later changed: the Head of State of the PRC is now the [[President of the People's Republic of China]]. Although the presidency is a largely [[Figurehead|ceremonial office]] with limited power, the symbolic role of a Head of State is now generally performed by [[Xi Jinping]], who is also [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] ([[Leader of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party leader]]) and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] ([[Supreme Military Command of the People's Republic of China|Supreme Military Command]]), making him the [[Paramount leader|most powerful person]] in China.

In North Korea, the late [[Kim Il-sung]] was named "[[Eternal President]]" 4 years after his death and the [[President of North Korea|presidency]] was abolished. As a result, some of the duties previously held by the president are constitutionally delegated to the [[President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly]], who performs some of the roles of a head of state, such as accrediting foreign ambassadors and undertaking overseas visits. However, the symbolic role of a Head of State is generally performed by [[Kim Jong-un]], who as the [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|leader of the party]] and [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|military]], is the [[Supreme Leader of North Korea|most powerful person]] in North Korea.

There is debate as to whether [[Samoa]] was an [[elective monarchy]] or an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic republic]], given the comparative ambiguity of the title ''[[O le Ao o le Malo]]'' and the nature of the head of state's office.

In some states the office of head of state is not expressed in a specific title reflecting that role, but constitutionally awarded to a post of another formal nature. Thus in March 1979 Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who kept absolute power (until [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|his overthrow]] in 2011 referred to as  "Guide of the Revolution"), after ten years as combined Head of State and Head of government of the Libyan ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' ("state of the masses"), styled Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally transferred both qualities to the General secretaries of the General People's Congress (comparable to a Speaker) respectively to a Prime Minister, in political reality both were his creatures.

Sometimes a head of state assumes office as a state becomes legal and political reality, before a formal title for the highest office is determined; thus in the since 1 January 1960 independent republic [[Cameroon]] (''Cameroun'', a former French colony), the first president, [[Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo]], was at first not styled ''président'' but 'merely' known as ''chef d'état'' - (French 'head of state') until 5 May 1960. In [[Uganda]], [[Idi Amin]] the military leader after the coup of 25 January 1971 was formally styled ''military head of state'' till 21 February 1971, only from then on regular (but unconstitutional, not elected) president.

In certain cases a special style is needed to accommodate imperfect statehood, e.g., the title ''[[Sardar-i-Riyasat]]'' was used in Kashmir after its accession to India, and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader, [[Yasser Arafat]], was styled the first "President of the [[Palestinian National Authority]]" in 1994. In 2008, the same office was restyled as "[[President of the State of Palestine]]".<ref>{{citation|title=PLO body elects Abbas 'President of Palestine'|newspaper=Khaleej Times Online|date=24 November 2008|archive-date=8 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608080641/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2008%2FNovember%2Fmiddleeast_November480.xml&section=middleeast|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2008/November/middleeast_November480.xml&section=middleeast|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Historical European perspectives==
* The [[polis]] in Greek Antiquity and the equivalent city states in the feudal era and later, (many in Italy, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the Moorish ''taifa'' in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], essentially tribal-type but urbanised regions throughout the world in the [[Maya civilisation]], etc.) offer a wide spectrum of styles, either monarchic (mostly identical to homonyms in larger states) or republican, see [[Chief magistrate]].
* [[Doge]]s were elected by their Italian aristocratic republics from a patrician nobility, but "reigned" as sovereign dukes.
* The paradoxical term [[crowned republic]] refers to various state arrangements that combine "republican" and "monarchic" characteristics.
* The [[Netherlands]] historically had officials called [[stadholder]]s and [[stadholder-general|stadholders-general]], titles meaning "lieutenant" or "governor", originally for the [[Habsburg]] monarchs.

In medieval Europe, it was universally accepted that the [[Pope]] ranked first among all rulers and was followed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name=Roberts:39>[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: p. 39.</ref> The Pope also had the sole right to determine the precedence of all others.<ref name=Roberts:39/><ref name=Roberts:37-38>[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 37-38.</ref> This principle was first challenged by a Protestant ruler, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] and was later maintained by his country at the [[Congress of Westphalia]].<ref name=Roberts:39/>  Great Britain would later claim a break of the old principle for the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] in 1718.<ref name=Roberts:39/>{{refn|group=note|On the occasion of a royal marriage in 1760, the [[premier of Portugal]], the [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], tried to maintain that the host, the [[King of Portugal]], should as a crowned head have the sovereign right to determine the precedence of how ambassadors (apart from the papal nuncio and the imperial ambassador) would rank, based on the date of their credentials. The pragmatic suggestions of Pombal was not successful, and as the pretensions among the great powers were so deep-rooted, it would take the [[Napoleonic Wars]] for the great powers to have a fresh look at the issue.<ref name=Roberts:41-42>[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 41-42.</ref>}} However, it was not until the [[1815 Congress of Vienna]], when it was decided (due to the abolition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 and the weak position of France and other catholic states to assert themselves) and remains so to this day, that all sovereign states are treated as equals, whether monarchies or republics.<ref name=Roberts:42-43>[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: pp. 42-43.</ref> On occasions when multiple heads of state or their representatives meet, precedence is by the host usually determined in alphabetical order (in whatever language the host determines, although [[French language|French]] has for much of the 19th and 20th centuries been the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of diplomacy) or by date of accession.<ref name=Roberts:42-43/> Contemporary international law on precedence, built upon the universally admitted principles since 1815, derives from the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (in particular, articles 13, 16.1 and Appendix iii).<ref name=Roberts:43>[[#Roberts|Roberts]]: p. 43.</ref>

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] used ''[[Prince]]'' ({{lang-it|Principe}}) as a generic term for the ruler, similar to contemporary usage of ''head of state'', in his classical [[treatise]] ''[[The Prince]]'', originally published in 1532: in fact that particular literary [[genre]] it belongs to is known as [[Mirrors for princes]]. [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) used the term ''Sovereign''. In [[Europe]] the role of a monarchs has gradually transitioned from that of a sovereign ruler{{mdash}}in the sense of [[Divine Right of Kings]] as articulated by [[Jean Bodin]], [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] and the "[[L'etat c'est moi]]"{{mdash}}to that of a constitutional monarch; parallel with the conceptual evolution of [[sovereignty]] from merely the personal rule of a single person, to [[Westphalian sovereignty]] ([[Peace of Westphalia]] ending both the [[Thirty Years' War]] & [[Eighty Years' War]]) and [[popular sovereignty]] as in [[consent of the governed]]; as shown in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in [[England]] & [[Scotland]], the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]]. The monarchies who survived through this era were the ones who were willing to subject themselves to constitutional limitations.

==Interim and exceptional cases==
Whenever a head of state is not available for any reason, constitutional provisions may allow the role to fall temporarily to an assigned person or collective body. In a republic, this is - depending on provisions outlined by the constitution or improvised - a [[vice-president]], the chief of government, the legislature or its presiding officer. In a monarchy, this is usually a [[regent]] or collegial regency (council). For example, in the United States the vice-president acts when the president is incapacitated, and in the United Kingdom the queen's powers may be delegated to [[Counsellor of State|counselors of state]] when she is abroad or unavailable. Neither of the two [[co-princes of Andorra]] is resident in Andorra; each is represented in Andorra by a delegate, though these persons hold no formal title.

There are also several methods of [[head of state succession]] in the event of the removal, disability or death of an incumbent head of state.

In exceptional situations, such as war, occupation, revolution or a [[coup d'état]], constitutional institutions, including the symbolically crucial head of state, may be reduced to a figurehead or be suspended in favour of an emergency office (such as the original Roman [[dictator]]) or eliminated by a new "provisionary" regime, such as a collective of the [[Military dictatorship|junta]] type, or removed by an occupying force, such as a [[Military occupation|military governor]] (an early example being the [[Sparta]]n [[Harmost]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

=={{anchor|SharedSovereign}}<!-- [[Shared sovereign]] redirects here-->Shared head of multiple states==
In early modern Europe, a single person was often monarch simultaneously of separate states. A [[composite monarchy]] is a retrospective label for those cases where the states were governed entirely separately. Of contemporary terms, a [[personal union]] had less government co-ordination than a [[real union]].  One of the two [[co-princes of Andorra]] is the [[president of France]].

The [[Commonwealth realm]]s share a monarch, currently [[Elizabeth II]]. In the realms other than the United Kingdom, a governor-general (''governor general'' in Canada) is appointed by the sovereign, usually on the advice of the relevant prime minister (although sometimes it is based on the result of a vote in the relevant parliament, which is the case for [[Politics of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Politics of Solomon Islands|Solomon Islands]]), as a representative and to exercise almost all the [[Royal Prerogative]] according to established constitutional authority. In Australia the present queen is generally assumed to be head of state, since the governor-general and the state governors are defined as her "representatives".<ref>Constitution, s 2;  Australia Act 1986 (Cth and UK), s 7.</ref> However, since the governor-general performs almost all national regal functions, the governor-general has occasionally [[Australian head of state dispute|been referred to as head of state]] in political and media discussion. To a lesser extent, uncertainty has been expressed [[Monarchy of Canada#Head of state|in Canada]] as to which officeholder—the monarch, the governor general, or both—can be considered the head of state.

Governors-general are frequently treated as heads of state on state and official visits; at the [[United Nations]], they are accorded the status of head of state in addition to the sovereign.<ref name=unprotocol/>

An example of a governor-general departing from [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] by acting unilaterally (that is, without direction from ministers, parliament, or the monarch) occurred in 1926, when [[Governor General of Canada|Canada's governor general]] [[King–Byng Affair|refused the head of government's formal advice]] requesting a dissolution of parliament and a general election. In a letter informing the monarch after the event, the Governor General said: "I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision."

Another example occurred when, in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], the governor-general unexpectedly dismissed the prime minister in order to break a stalemate between the House of Representatives and Senate over money bills. The governor-general issued a public statement saying he felt it was the only solution consistent with the constitution, his oath of office, and his responsibilities, authority, and duty as governor-general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/1975/11/11/kerr-statement-of-reasons.html|title=Kerr's Statement Of Reasons|access-date=17 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416042105/http://whitlamdismissal.com/1975/11/11/kerr-statement-of-reasons.html|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A letter from the queen's [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|private secretary]] at the time, [[Martin Charteris, Baron Charteris of Amisfield|Martin Charteris]], confirmed that the only person competent to commission an Australian prime minister was the governor-general and it would not be proper for the monarch to personally intervene in matters that the Constitution Act so clearly places within the governor-general's jurisdiction.<ref>Kerr, John (1978), Matters for Judgment, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-0-333-25212-3}}</ref>

Other Commonwealth realms that are now constituted with a governor-general as the [[List of viceregal representatives of Elizabeth II|viceregal representative of Elizabeth II]] are: [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Governor-General of the Bahamas|the Bahamas]], [[Governor-General of Barbados|Barbados]], [[Governor-General of Belize|Belize]], [[Governor-General of Grenada|Grenada]], [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Governor-General of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Governor-General of Saint Lucia|Saint Lucia]], and [[List of Governors-General of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].

==Religious heads of state==
[[File:Pope Francis in March 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Francis|Francis]], from March 2013 the [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign of the Vatican City State]], an ''ex officio'' role of the [[Pope]]]]

Since [[ancient history|antiquity]], various [[dynasty|dynasties]] or individual rulers have claimed the right to rule by divine authority, such as the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and the [[divine right of kings]]. Some monarchs even claimed divine ancestry, such as Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s and [[Sapa Inca]]s, who claimed descent from their respective sun gods and often sought to maintain this bloodline by practising [[incest|incestuous marriage]]. In [[Ancient Rome]], during the [[Principate]], the title {{lang|la|divus}} ('divine') was conferred (notably posthumously) on the [[Roman emperor|emperor]], a symbolic, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimating]] element in establishing a [[de facto]] dynasty.

===Christianity===
In [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[pope]] was once sovereign pontiff and head of state, first, of the politically important [[Papal States]]. After [[Italian unification]], the pope remains head of state of [[Vatican City]]. Furthermore, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|bishop of Urgell]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' one of the two [[Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]]. In the [[Church of England]], the reigning monarch holds the title [[Fidei defensor#English usage|Defender of the Faith]] and acts as supreme governor of the Church of England, although this is purely a symbolic role.

===Islam===
[[File:Portrait Caliph Abdulmecid II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdulmecid II]] is the [[List of Caliphs|150th]] and last [[Caliph of Islam]] from [[Ottoman dynasty]]]]
During the [[History of Islam|early period of Islam]], [[caliph]]s were spiritual and temporal absolute successors of the prophet [[Mohammed]]. Various political Muslim leaders since have styled themselves ''Caliph'' and served as dynastic heads of state, sometimes in addition to another title, such as the [[Ottoman Sultan]]. Historically, some [[Theocracy|theocratic]] Islamic states known as ''[[imamates]]'' have been led by [[imam]]s as head of state, such as in what is now [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].

In the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], at present [[Ali Khamenei]] serves as [[List of heads of state of Iran|head of state]]. The [[Aga Khan]]s, a unique dynasty of temporal/religious leadership, leading the [[Nizari]] offshoot of [[Shia Islam]] in Central and South Asia, once ranking among British India's [[princely state]]s, continue to the present day.

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], certain dynasties adopted a title expressing their positions as "servant" of a patron deity of the state, but in the sense of a [[viceroy]] under an absentee [[god-king]], ruling "in the name of" the patron god(ess), such as [[Patmanabha Dasa]] (servant of Vishnu) in the case of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Travancore]].

===Buddhism===
From the time of the [[5th Dalai Lama]] until the political retirement of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2011, Dalai Lamas were both political and spiritual leaders ("god-king") of [[Tibet]].

[[Outer Mongolia]], the former homeland of the imperial dynasty of [[Genghis Khan]], was another [[Tibetan Buddhist|lamaist]] theocracy from 1585, using various styles, such as [[tulku]]. The establishment of the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Mongolian People's Republic]] replaced this [[regime]] in 1924.

=={{anchor|CollectiveHead}}<!-- [[Collective heads of state]] redirects here-->Multiple or collective heads of state==

A collective head of state can exist in republics (internal complexity), e.g., nominal [[triumvirate]]s, the [[Directoire]], the seven-member [[Swiss Federal Council]] (where each member acts in turn as president for one year), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] with a [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|three-member presidency from three nations]], [[San Marino]] with two "captains-regent" which maintains the tradition of Italian medieval republics that had always had an even number of consuls. A [[diarchy]], in two rulers was the constitutional norm, may be distinguished from a [[coregency]], in which a monarchy experiences an exceptional period of multiple rulers.

In the [[Roman Republic]] there were two heads of state, styled [[Roman consul|consul]], both of whom alternated months of authority during their year in office, similarly there was an even number of supreme magistrates in the Italic republics of Ancient Age. In the [[History of Athens|Athenian Republic]] there were nine supreme magistrates, styled [[archons]]. In [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] there were two supreme magistrates, styled kings or [[Shofet|suffetes]] (judges). In ancient [[Sparta]] there were two hereditary kings, belonging to two dynasties. In the [[Soviet Union]] the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] of the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]] (between 1922 and 1938) and later the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] (between 1938 and 1989) served as the [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|collective head of state]].<ref>{{cite book|author=John Alexander Armstrong|title=Ideology, Politics, and Government in the Soviet Union: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH9nkBOxrZQC&pg=PA165|year=1978|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-5405-7|page=165}}</ref> After World War II the Soviet model was subsequently adopted by almost all countries belonged to its [[Soviet sphere of influence|sphere of influence]]. [[Czechoslovakia]] remained the only country among them that retained an office of president as a form of a single head of state throughout this period, followed by [[Romania]] through the creation of that country's presidency by dictator [[Nicolae Ceausescu]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|author=F. J. Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge|title=The distinctiveness of Soviet law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7OJPKABUXwC&pg=PA23|year=1987|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-247-3576-9|page=23|access-date=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222173645/https://books.google.sk/books?id=E7OJPKABUXwC&pg=PA23|archive-date=22 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A modern example of a collective head of state is the [[Sovereignty Council of Sudan]], the interim ruling council of [[Sudan]]. The Sovereignty Council comprises 11 ministers, who together have exercised all governmental functions for Sudan since the fall of President [[Omar Al-Bashir]]. Decisions are made either by consensus or by a super majority vote (8 members). 

Such arrangements are not to be confused with supranational entities which are not states and are not defined by a common monarchy but may (or not) have a symbolic, essentially protocollary, titled highest office, e.g., [[Head of the Commonwealth]] (held by the British crown, but not legally reserved for it) or 'Head of the Arab Union' (14 February - 14 July 1958, held by the Hashemite [[King of Iraq]], during its short-lived [[Arab Federation|Federation with Jordan]], its Hashemite sister-realm).

The [[National Government of the Republic of China]], established in 1928, had a panel of about 40 people as collective head of state.  Though beginning that year, a provisional constitution made the [[Kuomintang]] the [[One-party system|sole government party]] and the National Government bound to the instructions of the Central Executive Committee of that party.

==Legitimacy==
The position of head of state can be established in different ways, and with different sources of legitimacy.

===By fiction or fiat===
Power can come from force, but formal [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is often established, even if only by fictitious claims of continuity (e.g., a forged claim of descent from a previous [[dynasty]]). There have been cases of sovereignty granted by deliberate act, even when accompanied by [[order of succession|orders of succession]] (as may be the case in a dynastic split). Such grants of sovereignty are usually forced, as is common with [[self-determination]] granted after [[Nationalism|nationalist]] revolts. This occurred with the last [[Attalid]] king of Hellenistic [[Pergamon]], who by testament left his realm to Rome to avoid a disastrous conquest.

===By divine appointment===
Under a theocracy, perceived divine status translated into earthly authority under [[divine law]]. This can take the form of supreme divine authority above the state's, granting a tool for political influence to a [[priest]]hood. In this way, the [[Amun]] priesthood reversed the reforms of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] after his death. The division of theocratic power can be disputed, as happened between the Pope and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[investiture]] conflict when the temporal power sought to control key clergy nominations in order to guarantee popular support, and thereby his own legitimacy, by incorporating the formal ceremony of [[unction]] during [[coronation]].

===By social contract===
The notion of a [[social contract]] holds that the nation—either the whole people or the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]]—gives a mandate, through acclamation or [[election]].

===By constitution===
Individual heads of state may acquire their position by virtue of a [[Constitution#Distribution of sovereignty|constitution]]. An example is the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], as the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]], article 333, stated that Federal Assembly can appoint namely [[Josip Broz Tito]] as the president of Republic without time limitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Ustav_Socijalisti%C4%8Dke_Federativne_Republike_Jugoslavije_(1974.)#Glava_III_PREDSJEDNIK_REPUBLIKE|title=Ustav Socijalističke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije (1974.) – Wikizvor|website=hr.wikisource.org|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013205/https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Ustav_Socijalisti%C4%8Dke_Federativne_Republike_Jugoslavije_(1974.)#Glava_III_PREDSJEDNIK_REPUBLIKE|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===By hereditary succession===
[[File:Firekonger.jpg|thumb|Four generations of [[List of Danish Monarchs|Danish kings]] in 1903: [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] (left), [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian (X)]] (back), [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Frederick (VIII)]] (right), and [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick (IX)]] (front)]]

The position of a monarch is usually [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], but in [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], there are usually restrictions on the incumbent's exercise of powers and prohibitions on the possibility of choosing a successor by other means than by birth. In a hereditary monarchy, the position of monarch is inherited according to a statutory or customary [[order of succession]], usually within one [[royal family]] tracing its origin through a historical [[dynasty]] or bloodline. This usually means that the heir to the throne is known well in advance of becoming monarch to ensure a smooth succession. However, many cases of uncertain succession in European history have often led to [[War of succession|wars of succession]].

[[Primogeniture]], in which the eldest child of the monarch is first in line to become monarch, is the most common system in hereditary monarchy. The order of succession is usually affected by rules on gender. Historically "agnatic primogeniture" or "patrilineal primogeniture" was favoured, that is inheritance according to seniority of birth among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male issue inheriting before brothers and their issue, and [[patrilineality|male-line]] males inheriting before females of the male line.<ref name=Murphy>{{cite web| last = Murphy| first = Michael Dean| title = A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts| url = http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm| access-date = 5 October 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005104114/http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm| archive-date = 5 October 2006| url-status = live}}</ref> This is the same as semi-Salic primogeniture. Complete exclusion of females from [[dynasty|dynastic]] succession is commonly referred to as application of the [[Salic law]] (see ''[[Terra salica]]'').

Before primogeniture was enshrined in European law and tradition, kings would often secure the succession by having their successor (usually their eldest son) crowned during their own lifetime, so for a time there would be two kings in [[coregency]] – a senior king and a junior king.  Examples include [[Henry the Young King]] of England and the early [[House of Capet|Direct Capetians]] in France.

Sometimes, however, primogeniture can operate through the female line. In some systems a female may rule as monarch only when the male line dating back to a common ancestor is exhausted.  In 1980, [[Sweden]], by rewriting its [[Swedish Act of Succession|1810 Act of Succession]], became the first European monarchy to declare equal (full cognatic) primogeniture, meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.<ref name="sweden as">[http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-act-of-succession-2012.pdf Swedish Act of Succession (English Translation as of 2012)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208040154/http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-act-of-succession-2012.pdf |date=8 February 2014 }}, The [[Riksdag]]. Retrieved on 28 August 2013.</ref> Other European monarchies (such as the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990 and [[Belgium]] in 1991) have since followed suit. Similar reforms [[2011 proposals to change the rules of royal succession in the Commonwealth realms|were proposed in 2011]] for the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, which came into effect in 2015 after having been approved by all of the affected nations. Sometimes [[religion]] is affected; under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] all [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and all persons who have married Roman Catholics are ineligible to be the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and are skipped in the order of succession.

In some monarchies there may be liberty for the incumbent, or some body convening after his or her demise, to choose from eligible members of the [[Royal family|ruling house]], often limited to [[Legitimate child|legitimate]] descendants of the dynasty's founder. Rules of succession may be further limited by [[state religion]], residency, [[Royal intermarriage|equal marriage]] or even permission from the [[legislature]].

Other hereditary systems of succession included [[tanistry]], which is semi-elective and gives weight to merit and [[Agnatic seniority]].  In some monarchies, such as [[King of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother, and only after that to the monarch's children (agnatic seniority).

===By election===
Election usually is the constitutional way to choose the head of state of a republic, and some monarchies, either directly through popular election, indirectly by members of the legislature or of a special college of [[Indirect election|electors]] (such as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in the [[United States]]), or as an exclusive prerogative. Exclusive prerogative allows the heads of states of constituent monarchies of a federation to choose the head of state for the federation among themselves, as in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Malaysia]]. The Pope, head of state of Vatican City, is chosen by previously appointed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under 80 years of age from among themselves in a [[papal conclave]].

===By appointment===
A head of state can be empowered to designate his successor, such as [[Lord Protector of the Commonwealth]] [[Oliver Cromwell]], who was succeeded by his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]].

===By force or revolution===
A head of state may seize power by force or [[revolution]]. This is not the same as the use of force to ''maintain'' power, as is practised by [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rulers. Dictators often use democratic titles, though some proclaim themselves monarchs. Examples of the latter include Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] and King [[Zog of Albania]]. In Spain, general [[Francisco Franco]] adopted the formal title ''Jefe del Estado'', or Chief of State, and established himself as [[regent]] for a vacant monarchy. Uganda's [[Idi Amin]] was one of several who named themselves [[President for Life]].

===By foreign imposition===
A foreign power can establishing a branch of their own dynasty, or one friendly to their interests. This was the outcome of the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)|Russo-Swedish War from 1741 to 1743]] where the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Russian Empress]] made the imposition of her relative [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]] as the heir to the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish Throne]], to succeed [[Frederick I of Sweden|Frederick I]] who lacked [[Legitimate child|legitimate]] issue, as a peace condition.

===Loss===
Apart from violent overthrow, a head of state's position can be lost in several ways, including death, another by expiration of the constitutional term of office, [[abdication]], or resignation. In some cases, an abdication cannot occur unilaterally, but comes into effect only when approved by an act of parliament, as in the case of British King [[Edward VIII]]. The post can also be abolished by constitutional change; in such cases, an incumbent may be allowed to finish his or her term. Of course, a head of state position will cease to exist if the state itself does.

Heads of state generally enjoy widest inviolability, although some states allow [[impeachment]], or a similar constitutional procedure by which the highest legislative or judicial authorities are empowered to revoke the head of state's mandate on exceptional grounds. This may be a common crime, a political sin, or an act by which he or she violates such provisions as an established religion mandatory for the monarch. By similar procedure, an original mandate may be declared invalid.

[[Effigy|Effigies]], [[memorial]]s and [[monument]]s of former heads of state can be designed to represent the history or aspirations of a state or its people, such as the equestrian bronze sculpture of [[National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument|Kaiser Wilhelm I]], first Emperor of a unified Germany<ref name="BerlinHistory"/> erected in Berlin at the end of the nineteenth century; or the [[Victoria Memorial, London|Victoria Memorial]] erected in front of [[Buckingham Palace]] London, commemorating Queen Victoria and her reign (1837–1901), and unveiled in 1911 by her grandson, King [[George V]]; or the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|monument]], placed in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata (Calcutta) (1921), commemorating Queen Victoria's reign as [[Empress of India]] from 1876.<ref>''[[George Frampton|Frampton's]] Jubilee Monument for Queen Victoria'', image with dog to show scale.[http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/frampton/7.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195717/http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/frampton/7.html |date=9 May 2015 }}</ref> Another, twentieth century, example is the [[Mount Rushmore]] National Memorial, a group sculpture constructed (1927–1941) on a conspicuous skyline in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]] ([[List of states and territories of the United States|40th state of the Union, 1889]]), in the [[midwestern United States]], representing the territorial expansion of the United States in the first 130 years from its founding, which is promoted as the "Shrine of [[Democracy]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelsd.com/Attractions/Mount-Rushmore|title=Mount Rushmore National Memorial|work=TravelSouthDakota.com|access-date=7 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208035123/http://www.travelsd.com/Attractions/Mount-Rushmore|archive-date=8 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/mount-rushmore#|title=Mount Rushmore|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=7 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207130433/http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/mount-rushmore|archive-date=7 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Personal influence or privileges===
Former presidents of the United States, while holding no political powers [[List of Latin phrases (P)#per se|per se]], sometimes continue to exert influence in national and world affairs.

A monarch may retain his style and certain prerogatives after abdication, as did King [[Leopold III of Belgium]], who left the throne to his son after winning a referendum which allowed him to retain a full royal household deprived him of a constitutional or representative role. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] transformed the Italian principality of [[Elba]], where he was imprisoned, into a miniature version of his First Empire, with most trappings of a sovereign monarchy, until his ''[[Hundred Days|Cent Jours]]'' escape and reseizure of power in France convinced his opponents, reconvening the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] in 1815, to revoke his gratuitous privileges and send him to die in [[exile]] on barren [[Saint Helena]].

By tradition, deposed monarchs who have not freely abdicated continue to use their monarchical titles as a [[Courtesy title|courtesy]] for the rest of their lives. Hence, even after [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] ceased to be ''[[King of the Hellenes]]'', it is still common to refer to the deposed king and his family as if Constantine II were still on the throne, as many European royal courts and households do in guest lists at royal weddings, as in [[Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|Sweden in 2010]], [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|Britain in 2011]] and [[Wedding of Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy|Luxembourg in 2012]].<ref>[http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/wedding/theweddingday/stockholmcathedral/guestsattheweddingceremony.4.40e05eec12926f2630480001312.html Guests at the wedding ceremony: Wedding between Crown Princess Victoria and Mr Daniel Westling on Saturday 19 June 2010, 3.30 p.m., at Stockholm Cathedral] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729132452/http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/wedding/theweddingday/stockholmcathedral/guestsattheweddingceremony.4.40e05eec12926f2630480001312.html |date=29 July 2012 }}, [[Royal Court of Sweden]].

However, some other states have no problem with deposed monarchs being referred to by their former title, and even allow them to travel internationally on the state's [[Passport#Full passports|diplomatic passport]].

The Italian constitution provides that a former president of the Republic takes the title President Emeritus of the Italian Republic and he or she is also a senator for life, and enjoys immunity, flight status and official residences certain privileges.
