The '''Grammy Award for Album of the Year''' is presented by the [[The Recording Academy|National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales, chart position, or critical reception."<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref> Album of the Year is the most prestigious award category at the Grammys, and it is one of the general field awards alongside [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], presented annually since the [[1st Annual Grammy Awards]] in 1959. According to the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]] description guide, the award is presented:
{{quote| For albums containing at least 51% playing time of new vocal or instrumental recordings. Award to Artist(s) and to Featured Artist(s), Songwriter(s) of new material, Producer(s), Recording Engineer(s), Mixer(s) and Mastering Engineer(s) credited with at least 33% playing time of the album, if other than Artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-winners-list|title=2020 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Winners List|date=2020-01-26|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>
}}
(Featured) artists, songwriters, producers, recording engineers/mixers and mastering engineers who are credited with ''less'' than 33% of playing time do not receive a statuette, but a Winners Certificate.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/bluebook_awards_certs_and_grammy_tickets.pdf Grammy Blue Book]</ref>

Album of the Year is related to but is conceptually different from Record of the Year or Song of the Year:

* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, featured artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, "album" means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.
* Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, "record" means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.
* Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. "Song" in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.

==History and description==
Although it was originally presented to the artist alone, the award is now presented to the main artist, the featured artist(s), the producer, the engineer and/or mixer and the mastering engineer. In [[4th Annual Grammy Awards|1962]], the award name was extended to '''Album of the Year (other than classical)''' but, in [[Grammy Awards of 1965|1965]], the shorter name returned. It was not until [[10th Annual Grammy Awards|1968]], [[11th Annual Grammy Awards|1969]], [[41st Annual Grammy Awards|1999]], [[53rd Grammy Awards|2011]], and [[56th Annual Grammy Awards|2014]] that the award was won by a [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Independent music|indie]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] album respectively. As of [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|2012]], classical albums are eligible for this award, with the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Album|Best Classical Album]] being discontinued (although no classical album has been nominated in this category since).

The honorees through its history have been:
*1959–1965: Artist only.
*1966–1998: Artist and producer.
*1999–2002: Artist, producer, and recording engineer or mixer.
*2003–2017: Artist, producer, mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer.
*2018–present: Artist, producer, songwriter, mastering engineer, and recording engineer or mixer.
The category expanded to include eight nominees in [[61st Annual Grammy Awards|2019]].<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/recording-academy-announces-61st-grammy-awards-update Recording Academy Announces 61st GRAMMY Awards Update]</ref>

S.Y.S.T.E.M.]], [[Curtis Stigers]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Sass Jordan]], and the uncredited instrumental ensemble that performed [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme) shared in the award, nor did the producers of those tracks (other than Cole, Foster & Clivilles who also produced some of Houston's tracks).</small>
*C {{anchor|endnote_C}}'''[[#ref C|^]]'''<small>Award recipients include [[Mike Piersante]] & [[Peter Kurland]], as engineers/mixers; [[Gavin Lurssen]], as master engineer; [[T-Bone Burnett]], as producer; [[Alison Krauss]] & [[Union Station (band)|Union Station]], [[Chris Sharp]], [[Chris Thomas King]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gillian Welch]], [[Harley Allen]], [[John Hartford]], [[Mike Compton (musician)|Mike Compton]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], Pat Enright, [[The Peasall Sisters]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Sam Bush]], [[Stuart Duncan]], [[The Cox Family]], [[The Fairfield Four]], [[The Whites]] & [[Tim Blake Nelson]] (all from the U.S.) as featured artists.

The [[Soggy Bottom Boys]] aren't credited as a group, but [[Dan Tyminski]] (the singing voice of [[George Clooney]] in the film) is credited as a member of Union Station, while the other two members (Harley Allen & Pat Enright) are credited individually. Chris Sharp, Mike Compton, Sam Bush & Stuart Duncan are not listed as lead or featured artists on any track, but were included for their instrumental credits on the album.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=o+brother+where+art+thou&year=All&genre=13 Past Winners Search | GRAMMY.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></small>
