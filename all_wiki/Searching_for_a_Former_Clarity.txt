Robbins]] and released on September 6, 2005 by [[Fat Wreck Chords]]. Supported by [[single (music)|singles]] and [[music video]]s for the songs "[[Don't Lose Touch]]" and "[[From Her Lips to God's Ears (The Energizer)]]", it was their first album to chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching #114. It also reached #9 on ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Independent Albums chart. Singer/guitarist [[Laura Jane Grace]] has described ''Searching for a Former Clarity'' as a [[concept album]].<ref name="Dworken">{{cite web |last=Dworken |first=Arye |title=The Self-Titled Interview: Against Me! |website=Self-Titled Daily |date=2010-07-20 |url=http://www.self-titledmag.com/home/2010/07/20/the-self-titled-interview-against-me |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>

He told me that he hated J.'s production style, didn't like the mix or the track listing, and that the cover art (a black and white photo of a Florida palm tree) was terrible. "Make the band name bigger!" This took the wind out of our sails a bit and started making me consider our next move. The reason we had stayed indie, signed no contract, and taken less money was for artistic freedom. But now we found ourselves with no contract, in a punk rock handshake deal, but still compromising and fighting with our label over things like artwork and songs. |author=<small>Laura Jane Grace with Dan Ozzi</small>|source='''''<small>[[Tranny: Confessions of Punk Rock's Most Infamous Anarchist Sellout]]</small>'''''}}

Reaction to ''Searching for a Former Clarity'' was generally positive, with critics praising Grace's lyrics and the band's effective combination of different musical elements. Corey Apar of [[Allmusic]] gave the album four and a half stars out of five, calling it the band's "most introspective album to date. In both subject matter and song composition, they expand upon elements of previous releases without being afraid to veer away from expectations".<ref name="apar"/> Though describing the tone of the album as "more sober and resentful" in comparison to their previous efforts, he remarked that "the passion, energy, and urgency Against Me! is known for is no less present. Instead, ''Searching for a Former Clarity'' is a more developed effort that is not only one of the best punk releases of 2005, but further establishes the band's growing importance within the punk scene."<ref name="apar"/>

Aubin Paul of Punknews.org also praised the album, giving it four out of five stars and stating that "Unlike the simple shout-along melodies that adorned previous albums, ...''Clarity'' demands repeated listens far more than any previous album."<ref name="paul"/> He praised the band's ability to effectively combine [[punk rock]], [[country music|country]], and [[folk music]], noting that "with ''Clarity'' it seems the band has finally managed to fuse these elements seamlessly in a single track." He noted that the lyrics were more personal and "painfully confessional" than on the band's previous efforts, and that the political motifs were more individualistic, focusing on "the effects of politics on real people."<ref name="paul"/> He summarized the album as "ambitious, fully realized and truly special. It's also a conflicted record; it's filled with internal ruminations, raw emotions and a distancing wall of sound, but it is nevertheless their most thoughtful and accomplished piece of songwriting and a record that grows more rewarding with each listen."<ref name="paul"/>

One criticism which Apar and Paul shared was that both found the chorus of "Unprotected Sex with Multiple Partners" to be "somewhat annoying", though Paul noted that the song had "a great opening and confessional lyrics".<ref name="apar"/><ref name="paul"/> Christian Hoard of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was more critical of the album, giving it three out of five stars and describing it as "a bizarro combination of ''[[Who's Next]]'', an angry [[Oi!|oi-punk]] record and some dude's [[blog]]."<ref name="hoard"/> He complimented Grace's lyrics as "both wordier and funnier than most rant-based punk" but also said that "over fourteen cuts, [her] [[Roger Daltrey]] bellow can grow wearisome".<ref name="hoard"/> He did, however, praise "Holy Shit!" as "a detailed critique of a stagnating rock scene" and said that "How Low", a slower song in which Grace describes attempts to give up drugs, "prov[es] that you can't get this deep into other people's shit without getting a little on yourself."<ref name="hoard"/>
