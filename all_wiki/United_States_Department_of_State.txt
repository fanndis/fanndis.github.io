Equivalent to the [[ministry of foreign affairs]] of many countries, its duties include advising the [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], administering [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|diplomatic missions]], negotiating international treaties and agreements, and representing the U.S. at the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/short-history/framework|title=A New Framework for Foreign Affairs|date=March 14, 2015|website=A Short History of the Department of State|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref> The department is headquartered in the [[Harry S Truman Building]], a few blocks away from the [[White House]], in the [[Foggy Bottom, Washington, D.C.|Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]; "Foggy Bottom" is thus sometimes used as a [[metonym]].

Established in 1789 as the first administrative arm of the [[Executive branch of the U.S. Government|U.S. executive branch]], the State Department is considered one of the most powerful and prestigious executive agencies, owing to the importance of its work.<ref>"Cabinets and Counselors: The President and the Executive Branch" (1997). ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]''. p. 87.</ref> It is led by the [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], a member of the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] who is nominated by the president and [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Analogous to the [[foreign minister]] of other countries, the secretary of state serves as the nation's chief diplomat and representative abroad, and is the first Cabinet official in the [[United States order of precedence|order of precedence]] and in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]. The position is currently held by [[Mike Pompeo]].

As of 2019, the State Department maintains 273 diplomatic posts worldwide, second only to China's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Meredith|first=Sam|date=2019-11-27|title=China has overtaken the US to have the world's largest diplomatic network, think tank says|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/27/china-has-overtaken-the-us-to-have-the-worlds-largest-diplomatic-network.html|access-date=2020-11-26|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref> It also oversees the [[United States Foreign Service|U.S. Foreign Service]], provides [[Foreign Service Institute|diplomatic training]] to U.S. officials and military personnel, supervises [[Immigration policy in the United States|immigration policy]], and provides services to Americans, such as issuing [[Passport|passports]] and [[Travel visa|visas]] and advancing commercial ties abroad. The [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]], a member of the [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. Intelligence Community]] and the country's oldest civilian intelligence agency, is subordinate to the Department of State.

==History==
[[File:State Department Building, Washington, D. C., 1865.png|left|thumb|Old State Department building in [[Washington, D.C.]], {{circa|1865}}]]

=== Origin and early history ===
The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], drafted September 1787 and [[ratified]] the following year, gave the [[President of the United States|President]] responsibility for conducting the nation's foreign affairs.

To that end, on July 21, 1789, the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] approved legislation to establish a '''Department of Foreign Affairs''', which President [[George Washington]] signed into law on July 27, making the Department the first federal agency to be created under the new Constitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=151|title=1 United States Statutes at Large, Chapter 4, Section 1 }}</ref> This legislation remains the basic law of the Department of State.<ref>{{Cite web|title=22 U.S. Code § 2651 - Establishment of Department|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2651|access-date=2020-11-26|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en}}</ref>

In September 1789, additional legislation changed the name of the agency to the '''Department of State''' and assigned it a variety of domestic duties, including managing the [[United States Mint]], keeping the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and administering the [[United States Census Bureau|census]]. President [[George Washington|Washington]] signed the new legislation on September 15.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glin.gov/view.action?glinID=85633|title=United States Statutes at Large, First Congress, Session 1, Chapter 14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623022341/http://www.glin.gov/view.action?glinID=85633 |archive-date=June 23, 2012}}</ref> Most of these domestic duties were gradually transferred to various federal departments and agencies established during the 19th century. However, the Secretary of State still retains a few domestic responsibilities, such as serving as keeper of the Great Seal and being the officer to whom a President or Vice President wishing to resign must deliver an [[Letter of resignation|instrument in writing]] declaring the decision.

On September 29, 1789, Washington appointed [[Thomas Jefferson]] of [[Virginia]], then [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister to France]], as the first [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1784_timeline.html |author=Bureau of Public Affairs |publisher=United States Department of State |title=1784–1800: New Republic |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501010334/http://future.state.gov/when/timeline/1784_timeline.html |archive-date=May 1, 2013|author-link=Bureau of Public Affairs }}</ref> [[John Jay]] had been serving as Secretary of Foreign Affairs as a holdover from the [[Articles of Confederation|Confederation]] since before Washington took office; he would continue in that capacity until Jefferson returned from Europe many months later. Reflecting the fledgling status of the U.S. at the time, Jefferson's department comprised only six personnel, two diplomatic posts (in London and Paris), and 10 consular posts.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Department History - Office of the Historian|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory|access-date=2020-11-26|website=history.state.gov}}</ref>

=== Eighteenth to nineteenth centuries ===
For much of its history, the State Department was composed of two primary administrative units: the diplomatic service, which staffed U.S. [[Legation|legations]] and embassies, and the consular service, which was primarily responsible for promoting American commerce abroad and assisting distressed American sailors.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Department Of State. The Office of Electronic Information|first=Bureau of Public Affairs|date=2005-02-04|title=Frequently Asked Historical Questions|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/faq/index.htm|access-date=2020-11-26|website=2001-2009.state.gov|language=en}}</ref> Each service developed separately, but both lacked sufficient funding to provide for a career; consequently, appointments to either service fell on those with the financial means to sustain their work abroad. Combined with the common practice of appointing individuals based on politics or patronage, rather than merit, this led the Department to largely favor those with political networks and wealth, rather than skill and knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rogers Act|url=https://u-s-history.com/pages/h1471.html|access-date=2020-11-26|website=u-s-history.com}}</ref>

=== Twentieth century reforms and growth ===
The Department of State underwent its first major overhaul with the [[Rogers Act|Rogers Act of 1924]], which merged the diplomatic and consular services into the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]], a professionalized personnel system under which the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] is authorized to assign [[Diplomat|diplomats]] abroad. An extremely difficult Foreign Service examination was also implemented to ensure highly qualified recruits, along with a merit-based system of promotions. The Rogers Act also created the Board of the Foreign Service, which advises the Secretary of State on managing the Foreign Service, and the Board of Examiners of the Foreign Service, which administers the examination process.

The post-Second World War period saw an unprecedented increase in funding and staff commensurate with the U.S.' emergence as a superpower and its competition with the Soviet Union in the subsequent Cold War.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Department History - Office of the Historian|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory|access-date=2020-11-26|website=history.state.gov}}</ref> Consequently, the number of domestic and overseas employees grew from roughly 2,000 in 1940 to over 13,000 in 1960.<ref name=":0" />

In 1997, [[Madeleine Albright]] became the first woman appointed Secretary of State and the first foreign-born woman to serve in the Cabinet. 

=== Twenty-first century ===
The 21st century saw the Department reinvent itself in response to the rapid [[digitization]] of society and the global economy. In 2007, it launched an official blog, [[Dipnote]], as well as a [[Twitter]] account of the same name, to engage with a global audience. Internally, it launched a [[wiki]], [[Diplopedia]]; a suggestion forum called the [[State Department Sounding Board|Sounding Board]];<ref>{{cite web|date=February 10, 2009|title=Hillary Clinton Launches E-Suggestion Box..'The Secretary is Listening' – ABC News|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2009/02/hillary-clint-1.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429180846/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2009/02/hillary-clint-1.html|archive-date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=June 16, 2012|publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com}}</ref> and a professional networking software, "Corridor".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lipowicz|first=Alice|date=April 22, 2011|title=State Department to launch "Corridor" internal social network – Federal Computer Week|url=http://fcw.com/articles/2011/04/22/state-dept--preparing-to-launch-corridor-social-network-for-employees-only.aspx|accessdate=June 16, 2012|publisher=Fcw.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 5, 2011|title=Peering down the Corridor: The New Social Network's Features and Their Uses &#124; IBM Center for the Business of Government|url=http://www.businessofgovernment.org/blog/business-government/peering-down-corridor-new-social-networks-features-and-their-uses|accessdate=June 16, 2012|publisher=Businessofgovernment.org}}</ref> In May 2009, the [[Virtual Student Federal Service]] (VSFS) was created to provide remote internships to students.<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 13, 2009|title=Remarks at the New York University Commencement Ceremony, Hillary Rodham Clinton|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2009a/05/123431.htm|access-date=October 15, 2017|website=Office of Website Management, Bureau of Public Affairs|publisher=U.S. State Department}}</ref> The same year, the Department of State was the fourth most desired employer for undergraduates according to ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Most Desirable Employers|url=http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/most_desirable_employers.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011|work=BusinessWeek}}</ref>

From 2009 to 2017, the State Department launched ''21st Century Statecraft,'' with the official goal of "complementing traditional foreign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft that fully leverage the technologies of our interconnected world."<ref>{{cite web|title=21st Century Statecraft|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/statecraft/overview/index.htm|accessdate=July 23, 2014|publisher=The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs}}</ref> The initiative was designed to utilize digital technology and the Internet to promote foreign policy goals; examples include promoting an [[SMS]] campaign to provide disaster relief to Pakistan,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Talking 21st Century Statecraft|url=https://thediplomat.com/2011/04/talking-21st-century-statecraft/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=thediplomat.com|language=en-US}}</ref> and sending DOS personnel to Libya to assist in developining Internet infrastructure and e-government.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=DuPre|first1=Carrie|last2=Williams|first2=Kate|date=2011-05-01|title=Undergraduates' Perceptions of Employer Expectations|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21061/jcte.v26i1.490|journal=Journal of Career and Technical Education|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.21061/jcte.v26i1.490|issn=1533-1830}}</ref>

[[Colin Powell]], who led the department from 2001 to 2005, became the [[List of African-American United States Cabinet Secretaries|first African-American]] to hold the post; his immediate successor, [[Condoleezza Rice]], was the [[List of female United States Cabinet Secretaries|second female Secretary of State]] and the [[List of African-American United States Cabinet Secretaries|second African-American]]. [[Hillary Clinton]] became the third female Secretary of State when she was appointed in 2009.

In 2014, the State Department began expanding into the Navy Hill Complex across 23rd Street NW from the Truman Building.<ref>This complex is also known as the "Potomac Annex".</ref> A joint venture consisting of the architectural firms of [[Goody, Clancy & Associates, Inc|Goody, Clancy]] and the [[Louis Berger Group]] won a $2.5&nbsp;million contract in January 2014 to begin planning the renovation of the buildings on the {{convert|11.8|acre|ha}} Navy Hill campus, which housed the World War II headquarters of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and was the first headquarters of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2014/01/boston-firm-picked-for-state.html Sernovitz, Daniel J.

==Duties and responsibilities==
[[File:Armed Department of State security agents accompany U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton in El Salvador circa 1982.png|right|thumb|Armed Department of State security agents accompany U.S. Ambassador [[w:Deane R. Hinton|Deane Hinton]] in [[w:El Salvador|El Salvador]] in the early 1980s.]]
The Executive Branch and the Congress have constitutional responsibilities for U.S. foreign policy. Within the Executive Branch, the Department of State is the lead U.S. foreign affairs agency, and its head, the Secretary of State, is the President's principal foreign policy advisor. The Department advances U.S. objectives and interests in the world through its primary role in developing and implementing the President's foreign policy. It also provides an array of important services to U.S. citizens and to foreigners seeking to visit or immigrate to the United States. 

All foreign affairs activities—U.S. representation abroad, foreign assistance programs, countering international crime, foreign military training programs, the services the Department provides, and more—are paid for by the foreign affairs budget, which represents little more than 1% of the total federal budget.<ref>Kori N. Schake, ''State of disrepair: Fixing the culture and practices of the State Department''. (Hoover Press, 2013).</ref>

The Department's core activities and purpose include:
* Protecting and assisting U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad;
* Assisting American businesses in the international marketplace;
* Coordinating and providing support for international activities of other U.S. agencies (local, state, or federal government), official visits overseas and at home, and other diplomatic efforts.
* Keeping the public informed about U.S. foreign policy and relations with other countries and providing feedback from the public to administration officials.
* Providing [[diplomatic license plates in the United States|automobile registration]] for non-diplomatic staff vehicles and the vehicles of diplomats of foreign countries having [[diplomatic immunity]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/150546.pdf |page=15 |title=Diplomatic and Consular Immunity: Guidance for Law Enforcement and Judicial Authorities |date=July 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |author=United States Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security |publisher=United States Department of State}}</ref>

The Department of State conducts these activities with a civilian workforce, and normally uses the Foreign Service personnel system for positions that require service abroad. Employees may be assigned to diplomatic missions abroad to represent the United States, analyze and report on political, economic, and social trends; adjudicate visas; and respond to the needs of U.S. citizens abroad. 

The U.S. maintains diplomatic relations with about 180 countries and maintains relations with many international organizations, adding up to a total of more than 250 posts around the world. In the United States, about 5,000 professional, technical, and administrative employees work compiling and analyzing reports from overseas, providing logistical support to posts, communicating with the American public, formulating and overseeing the budget, issuing passports and [[warden message|travel warnings]], and more. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Department of State works in close coordination with other federal agencies, including the department of Defense, Treasury, and Commerce. The Department also consults with Congress about foreign policy initiatives and policies.<ref>William J. Burns, "The Lost Art of American Diplomacy: Can the State Department Be Saved." ''Foreign Affairs'' 98 (2019): 98+.</ref>

=== Fullbright Program ===
[[File:Mike Pompeo with Department of State Summer Interns - 2018 (43952374221).jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mike Pompeo]] with 2018 summer interns]]
The Fulbright Program, including the Fulbright–Hays Program, is a program of competitive, merit-based [[Grant (money)|grants]] for [[United States Cultural Exchange Programs|international educational exchange]] for students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists and artists, founded by [[United States Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]] in 1946. Under the Fulbright Program, competitively selected U.S. citizens may become eligible for scholarships to study, conduct research, or exercise their talents abroad; and citizens of other countries may qualify to do the same in the United States. The program was established to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries through the exchange of persons, knowledge, and skills.

The Fulbright Program provides 8,000 grants annually to undertake graduate study, advanced research, university lecturing, and classroom teaching. In the 2015–16 cycle, 17% and 24% of American applicants were successful in securing research and English Teaching Assistance grants, respectively. However, selectivity and application numbers vary substantially by country and by type of grant. For example, grants were awarded to 30% of Americans applying to teach English in Laos and 50% of applicants to do research in Laos. In contrast, 6% of applicants applying to teach English in Belgium were successful compared to 16% of applicants to do research in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web |title=ETA Grant Application Statistics |url=http://us.fulbrightonline.org/eta-grant-application-statistics |website=us.fulbrightonline.org |accessdate=December 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225170917/http://us.fulbrightonline.org/eta-grant-application-statistics |archive-date=December 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Study/Research Grant Application Statistics |url=http://us.fulbrightonline.org/studyresearch-grant-application-statistics |website=us.fulbrightonline.org |accessdate=December 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225182159/http://us.fulbrightonline.org/studyresearch-grant-application-statistics |archive-date=December 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The U.S. Department of State's [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] sponsors the Fulbright Program from an annual appropriation from the [[U.S. Congress]]. Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S.<ref name="Fulbright Program Fact Sheet">{{cite web |title=Fulbright Program Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Department of State |url=http://eca.state.gov/files/bureau/fulbright_fact_sheet_2.pdf}}</ref> The Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations like the [[Institute of International Education]].

In countries without a Fulbright Commission but that have an active program, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy oversees the Fulbright Program. More than 360,000 persons have participated in the program since it began.

===Jefferson Science Fellows Program===
The Jefferson Science Fellows Program was established in 2003 by the DoS to establish a new model for engaging the American academic science, technology, engineering and medical communities in the formulation and implementation of U.S. foreign policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/macarthur-supports-new-science-and-security-fellowship-program-at-us-department-of-state-october-8-2002/ |title=MacArthur Supports New Science and Security Fellowship Program at U.S. Department of State |publisher=MacArthur Foundation |date=October 8, 2002 |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://careers.state.gov/work/fellowships/jefferson-science |title=Jefferson Science Fellowship Program – U.S. Department of State |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref> The Fellows (as they are called, if chosen for this program) are paid around $50,000 during the program and can earn special bonuses of up to $10,000. The whole point of this program is so that these Fellows will know the ins and outs of the Department of State/USAID to help with the daily functioning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/jefferson/pga_048242 |title=About the Jefferson Science Fellowship |website=sites.nationalacademies.org |access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> There is no one winner every year rather it's a program that you apply for and follow a process that starts in August and takes a full year to learn the final results of your ranking. It isn't solely based on achievement alone but intelligence and writing skills that have to show that you encompass all of what the committee is looking for. First you start with the online application then you start to write your curriculum vitae which explains more about yourself and your education and job experience then you move onto your statement of interest and essay where you have your common essay and your briefing memo. Finally you wrap up with letters of recommendations and letters of nominations to show that you are not the only person who believes that they should be a part of this program.

===Franklin Fellows Program===
The Franklin Fellows Program was established in 2006 by the DoS to bring in mid-level executives from the [[private sector]] and [[non-profit organization]]s to advise the Department and to work on projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmdulye.com/oldp/october07/print/AlumniCorner1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302094944/http://www.lmdulye.com/oldp/october07/print/AlumniCorner1.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 2, 2012|date=March 2, 2012}}</ref> Fellows may also work with other government entities, including [[United States Congress|the Congress]], [[White House]], and [[United States Executive Branch|executive branch]] agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], and [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. The program is named in honor of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and aims to bring mid-career professionals to enrich and expand the Department's capabilities. Unlike the Jefferson Science Fellows Program this is based on volunteer work as you do not get paid to be a part of this. Rather you have sponsors or you contribute your own money in order to fulfill what it will take to do the year long program. The more seniority you have in this program determines what kind of topics you work on and the priority that the issues are to the country. Although the bottom line is that the other Fellows are the ones with the final say of where you are placed however they try to take into account where you would like to be placed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://careers.state.gov/work/fellowships/franklin-fellows/ |title=Franklin Fellows Program – Careers |website=careers.state.gov |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>

== Military components ==

===Department of State Air Wing===
[[File:State Air Wing.png|thumb|Logo of the "Air Wing" of The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)- Office of Aviation, U.S. Department of State]]
In 1978, the [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL) formed an office to use excess military and government aircraft for support of foreign nations' counter-narcotics operations. The first aircraft used was a crop duster used for eradication of illicit crops in Mexico in cooperation with the local authorities. The separate Air Wing was established in 1986 as use of aviation assets grew in the war on drugs.<ref name="USDoSMagazine">{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/161997.pdf|title=US Department of State Magazine, May 2011}}</ref>

The aircraft fleet grew from crop spraying aircraft to larger transports and helicopters used to support ground troops and transport personnel. As these operations became more involved in direct combat, a further need for search and rescue and armed escort helicopters was evident. Operations in the 1980s and 1990s were primarily carried out in [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Belize]]. Many aircraft have since been passed on to the governments involved, as they became capable of taking over the operations themselves.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[War on terror|War on Terror]], the Air Wing went on to expand its operations from mainly anti-narcotics operations to also support security of United States nationals and interests, primarily in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Safe transports for various diplomatic missions were undertaken, requiring the acquisition of larger aircraft types, such as [[Sikorsky S-61]], [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|Boeing Vertol CH-46]], [[Beechcraft King Air]] and [[Bombardier Dash 8|De Haviland DHC-8-300]]. In 2011, the Air Wing was operating more than 230 aircraft around the world, the main missions still being counter narcotics and transportation of state officials.<ref name="USDoSMagazine"/>

In the latest [[Center for Effective Government]] analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the State Department was the lowest performer, earning an F by scoring only 37 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. failed the grade, unchanged from 2013. The State Department's score was dismal due to its extremely low processing score of 23 percent, which was completely out of line with any other agency's performance.<ref>[http://www.foreffectivegov.org/access-to-information-scorecard-2015/ Making the Grade: Access to Information Scorecard 2015] March 2015, 80 pages, [[Center for Effective Government]], retrieved March 21, 2016</ref>
