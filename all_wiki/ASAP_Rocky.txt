Former US ambassador to Sweden [[Mark Brzezinski]] suggested that the government should intervene and speculated that racism may have been the cause of the brawl.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Björling |first1=Sanna Torén |title=USA:s tidigare ambassadör uppmanar regeringen att lägga sig i fallet ASAP Rocky |url=https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/usas-tidigare-ambassador-uppmanar-regeringen-att-lagga-sig-i-fallet-asap-rocky/ |access-date=July 12, 2019 |work=Dagens Nyheter |date=July 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711185036/https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/usas-tidigare-ambassador-uppmanar-regeringen-att-lagga-sig-i-fallet-asap-rocky/ |archive-date=July 11, 2019}}</ref> Foreign minister [[Margot Wallström]] said the government is not allowed to interfere citing Chapter 11 §3 of the Swedish constitutional [[Basic Laws of Sweden#Instrument of Government|Instrument of Government]] which explicitly forbids the interference of politicians, or unrelated government offices, in the work of the courts of law. Ove Bring, professor emeritus in international law and former international law adviser at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented that he found it strange that an ambassador does not understand the concept of [[separation of powers]].

He claimed they came back and hit his guard, which led to a fight. They kept following them and tried to hit him, which led to the brawl. The prosecutor Daniel Suneson stated he had evidence against Mayers in the form of witness statements, and videos available on the Internet and on CCTV. Suneson said he had procured SMSes of his crew: one from his bodyguard about different versions of events, and another from an assistant showing they had uploaded edited videos on Instagram and asking Mayers to destroy everything on his cellphone. The DNA on the bottle allegedly used in the assault was also analyzed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/OpmlK1/asap-rocky-to-face-trial-in-assault-case |title=ASAP Rocky to face trial in assault case |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=July 25, 2019|access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref>

Jafari told the police that he first approached Mayers' entourage to ask if they had seen his missing friend, not knowing who they were, but was told by the guard to go away, and then pushed. When he refused, the guard grabbed him by the neck and lifted him up, which is supported by a photo from a surveillance camera installed at a [[Max Hamburgers]] restaurant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Magnå |first1=Joakim |title=Attackerade mannen: Jag ville bara ha tillbaka mina hörlurar |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/0nbrwJ/attackerade-mannen-jag-ville-bara-ha-tillbaka-mina-horlurar |access-date=July 26, 2019 |work=Aftonbladet |issue=July 25, 2019}}</ref> Some people close to Mayers claimed Jafari himself had broken his headphones, though he claimed it was the bodyguard, explaining that was why he was after them.

The trial started on July 30. Present at the trial was [[Robert C. O'Brien (attorney)|Robert C. O'Brien]], the US president's Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs.
