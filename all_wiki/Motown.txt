'''Motown Records''' is an American [[record label]] owned by the [[Universal Music Group]]. It was founded by [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy Jr.]] as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959,<ref name="A Brief History of Motown">{{cite journal|last1=Cruz|first1=Gilbert|title=A Brief History of Motown|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1870975,00.html |journal=TIME |accessdate=15 October 2016|date=12 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History - Classic Motown|url=http://classic.motown.com/history/|publisher=Motown Records |accessdate=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111215256/http://classic.motown.com/history/|archive-date=January 11, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Woodford|first1=Arthur M.|title=This is Detroit, 1701 - 2001|date=2001|publisher=Wayne State Univ.

Motown played an important role in the [[racial integration]] of [[popular music]] as an [[African American]]-owned label that achieved  [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including '''Tamla Motown''', the brand used outside the US) were the most successful proponents of the [[Motown (music style)|Motown sound]], a style of [[soul music]] with a mainstream [[pop music|pop]] appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. During the 1960s, Motown achieved 79 records in the top-ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] between 1960 and 1969.

Following the events of the [[1967 Detroit riot|Detroit Riots of 1967]] and the loss of key songwriting/production team [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]] the same year over pay disputes, Gordy relocated Motown to [[Los Angeles, California]]. Motown expanded into film and television production, remaining an independent company until 1988, when it was sold to [[MCA Records]]. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group when it acquired PolyGram in 1999.<ref name="A Brief History of Motown" />

Motown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in [[New York City]] as a part of the UMG subsidiaries [[Universal Motown]] and [[Universal Motown Republic Group]]. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]] division of Universal Music.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/ethiopia-habtemariam-named-senior-vice-president-1005312132.story |title=Ethiopia Habtemariam Named Senior Vice President of Motown Records |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name="sisario1">{{Cite web|url=https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/a-young-music-executive-takes-over-at-motown/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117182932/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/a-young-music-executive-takes-over-at-motown/|url-status=dead|title=A Young Music Executive Takes Over at Motown|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=August 10, 2011|archivedate=January 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name="universalmusic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/universal-republic-and-island-def-jam-motown-expand-creative-teams-with-appointment-of-art |title=Brandon Creed Joins Universal Republic And Island Def Jam Motown |publisher=Universal Music |date=August 15, 2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref> In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the [[Capitol Music Group]], now operating out of the [[Capitol Tower]].<ref name="Capital">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-capitol-records-steve-barnett-sam-smith-5-seconds-summer-20150203-story.html#page=1 |title=A revitalized Capitol Records forges a new path forward |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2015-02-03 |accessdate=2015-10-30}}</ref> In 2018, Motown was inducted into [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony held at the [[Charles H.

==History==
===Beginnings of Motown===
[[Berry Gordy]]'s interest in the record business began when he opened a record store called the 3D Record Mart, a shop where he hoped to "educate customers about the beauty of jazz", in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. (The Gordys were an entrepreneurial family.) Although the shop did not last very long, Gordy's interest in the music business did not fade. He frequented Detroit's downtown nightclubs, and in the Flame Show Bar he met bar manager Al Green (not the famed singer), who owned a music publishing company called Pearl Music and represented Detroit-based musician [[Jackie Wilson]]. Gordy soon became part of a group of songwriters—with his sister [[Gwen Gordy Fuqua|Gwen Gordy]] and [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]]—who wrote songs for Wilson. "[[Reet Petite]]" was their first major hit which appeared in November 1957.<ref>Flory, p. 24.</ref> During the next eighteen months, Gordy helped to write six more Wilson A-sides, including "[[Lonely Teardrops]]", a peak-popular hit of 1958. Between 1957 and 1958, Gordy wrote or produced over a hundred sides for various artists, with his siblings Anna, Gwen and Robert, and other collaborators in varying combinations.<ref>Flory, p. 25.</ref>

[[File:Hitsville USA.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] Motown building, at 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Motown's headquarters from 1959 to 1968, which became the Motown Historical Museum in 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motownmuseum.com |title=Motown Museum |publisher=Motown Museum |date=August 24, 2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref>]]

In 1957, Gordy met [[Smokey Robinson]], who at the time was a local seventeen-year-old singer fronting a vocal harmony group called the Matadors. Gordy was interested in the [[doo-wop]] style that Robinson sang. In 1958, Gordy recorded the group's song "Got a Job" (an answer song to "[[Get a Job (song)|Get a Job]]" by [[the Silhouettes]]), and released it as a single by leasing the record to a larger company outside Detroit called [[End Records]], based in New York. The practice was common at the time for a small-time producer. "Got a Job" was the first single by Robinson's group, now called [[the Miracles]]. Gordy recorded a number of other records by forging a similar arrangement, most significantly with [[United Artists Records|United Artists]].<ref name="Flory 26">Flory, p. 26.</ref>

In 1958, Gordy wrote and produced "[[Come to Me (Marv Johnson song)|Come to Me]]" for [[Marv Johnson]]. Seeing that the song had great crossover potential, Gordy leased it to United Artists for national distribution but also released it locally on his own startup imprint.<ref name="Flory 26" /> Needing $800 to cover his end of the deal, Gordy asked his family to borrow money from a cooperative family savings account.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=879/80}}</ref> After some debate, his family agreed, and in January 1959 “Come to Me” was released regionally on Gordy's new Tamla label.<ref name="Flory 27">Flory, p. 27.</ref> Gordy originally wanted to name the label Tammy Records, after the hit [[Tammy (song)|song]] popularized by [[Debbie Reynolds]] from the 1957 film ''[[Tammy and the Bachelor]]'', in which Reynolds also starred. When he found the name was already in use, Berry decided on Tamla instead.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In April 1959, Gordy and his sister Gwen founded Anna Records which released about two dozen singles between 1959 and 1960. The most popular was Barrett Strong's "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]", written by Gordy and a secretary named [[Janie Bradford]], and produced by Gordy.<ref name="Flory 27" /> Many of the songs distributed locally by Anna and Tamla Records were nationally distributed by [[Chess Records]] (sometimes with Anna and Tamla imprints). Gordy's relationship with Chess fostered closer dealings with [[Harvey Fuqua]], nephew of Charlie Fuqua of [[the Ink Spots]]. Harvey Fuqua later married Gwen Gordy in 1961.<ref>Flory, p. 28.</ref>

Gordy looked toward creative self-sufficiency and established publishing firm Jobete, incorporated to the state of Michigan in June 1959. He applied for copyrights on more than seventy songs before the end of 1959, including material used for the Miracles and Frances Burnett records that were leased to Chess and [[Coral Records]]. The ''[[Michigan Chronicle]]'' of Detroit called Gordy an "independent producer of records", as his contributions to the city were beginning to attract notice. By that time, he was the president of Jobete, Tamla, and Rayber, a music writing company.<ref name="Flory 29">Flory, p. 29.</ref>

Gordy worked in various Detroit-based studios during this period to produce recordings and demos, but most prominently with [[United Sound Systems]] which was considered the best studio in town. However, producing at United Sound Systems was financially taxing and not appropriate for every job, so Gordy decided it would be more cost effective to maintain his own facility.<ref name="Flory 29" /> In mid-1959, he purchased a photography studio at 2648 West Grand Boulevard and converted the main floor into a recording studio and office space. Now, rather than shopping his songs to other artists or leasing his recordings to outside companies, Gordy began using the Tamla and Motown imprints to release songs that he wrote and produced. He incorporated Motown Records in April 1960.<ref>Flory, p. 31.</ref>

Smokey Robinson became the vice president of the company (and later named his daughter "Tamla" and his son "Berry"). Several of [[Gordy family|Gordy's family members]], including his father Berry Sr., brothers Robert and George, and sister Esther, were given key roles in the company. By the middle of the decade, Gwen and Anna Gordy had joined the label in administrative positions as well. Gordy's partner at the time (and wife from 1960–64), [[Ray Singleton|Raynoma Liles]], also played a key role in the early days of Motown, leading the company's first session group, The Rayber Voices, and overseeing Jobete.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===West Grand Boulevard===
Also in 1959, Gordy purchased the property that would become Motown's [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] studio. The photography studio located in the back of the property was modified into a small recording studio, and the Gordys moved into the second-floor living quarters. Within seven years, Motown would occupy seven additional neighboring houses:

*Hitsville U.S.A., 1959 – (ground floor) administrative office, tape library, control room, Studio A; (upper floor) Gordy living quarters (1959–62), artists and repertoire (1962–72)
*Jobete Publishing office, 1961 – sales, billing, collections, shipping, and public relations
*Berry Gordy Jr. Enterprise, 1962 – offices for Berry Gordy Jr. and [[Esther Gordy Edwards]]
*Finance department, 1965 – royalties and payroll
*Artist personal development, 1966 – [[Harvey Fuqua]] (head of artist development and producer of stage performances), [[Maxine Powell]] (instructor in grooming, poise, and social graces for Motown artists), Maurice King (vocal coach, musical director and arranger), [[Cholly Atkins]] (house choreography), and rehearsal studios
*Two houses for administrative offices, 1966 – sales and marketing, traveling and traffic, and mixing and mastering
*ITMI (International Talent Management Inc.) office, 1966 – management

Motown had hired over 450 employees and had a gross income of $20 million by the end of 1966.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tamla record label.png|right|200px|thumb|The 1966 Tamla label]] -->Early Tamla/Motown artists included [[Mable John]], [[Eddie Holland]] and [[Mary Wells]]. "[[Shop Around]]", the Miracles' first number 1 R&B hit, peaked at number two on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1960. It was Tamla's first million-selling record. On April 14, 1960, Motown and Tamla Records merged into a new company called Motown Record Corporation. A year later, [[the Marvelettes]] scored Tamla's first US number-one pop hit, "[[Please Mr. Postman]]".<ref name="Larkin"/> By the mid-1960s, the company, with the help of songwriters and producers such as Robinson, [[A&R]] chief [[William "Mickey" Stevenson]], [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]], and [[Norman Whitfield]], had become a major force in the music industry.

From 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 [[Record chart|top 10]] hits. Top artists on the Motown label during that period included [[the Supremes]] (initially including [[Diana Ross]]), [[Four Tops|the Four Tops]], and [[the Jackson 5]], while [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[the Marvelettes]], and [[the Miracles]] had hits on the Tamla label. The company operated several labels in addition to the Tamla and Motown imprints. A third label, which '''Gordy''' named after himself (though it was originally called "Miracle") featured [[the Temptations]], [[the Contours]], [[Edwin Starr]], and [[Martha and the Vandellas]]. A fourth, '''V.I.P.''', released recordings by [[the Velvelettes]], [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]], [[The Monitors (American band)|the Monitors]], and [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]].

A fifth label, '''Soul''', featured [[Jr. Walker & the All Stars]], [[Jimmy Ruffin]], [[Shorty Long]], [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]], and [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]] (who had found success before joining Motown, as "The Pips" on [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]). Many more Motown-owned labels released recordings in other genres, including '''Workshop Jazz''' (jazz) [[Earl Washington (musician)|Earl Washington]] Reflections and Earl Washington's All Stars, '''Mel-o-dy''' (country, although it was originally an R&B label), and '''Rare Earth''', which featured the band [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]] themselves. Under the slogan "The Sound of Young America", Motown's acts were enjoying widespread popularity among black and white audiences alike.

Smokey Robinson said of Motown's cultural impact:

<blockquote>Into the 1960s, I was still not of a frame of mind that we were not only making music, we were making history. But I did recognize the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South in the early days of Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.<ref>Ron Thibodeaux, "My Smokey Valentine", ''The Times-Picayune'' (New Orleans, La.), February 14, 2009.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Berry Gordy House Boston Edison Detroit.JPG|thumb|left|Berry Gordy House, known as ''Motown Mansion'' in [[Detroit]]'s [[Boston-Edison Historic District]]<ref name=MotownMansion/>]]

In 1967 Berry Gordy purchased what is now known as ''Motown Mansion'' in Detroit's [[Boston-Edison Historic District]] as his home, leaving his previous home to his sister Anna and then-husband Marvin Gaye (where photos for the cover of his album ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' were taken).<ref name=MotownMansion>{{cite web|url=http://motownmansion.com/ |title=The Motown Mansion! |publisher=Motownmansion.com |date= |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref> In 1968, Gordy purchased the Donovan building on the corner of [[List of buildings located along Woodward Avenue, Detroit|Woodward Avenue]] and [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]], and moved Motown's Detroit offices there (the Donovan building was demolished in January 2006 to provide parking spaces for [[Super Bowl XL]]). In the same year Gordy purchased [[Golden World Records]], and its recording studio became "Studio B" to Hitsville's "Studio A".

In the United Kingdom, Motown's records were released on various labels: at first [[London Records|'''London''']] (only the Miracles' "Shop Around"/"[[Who's Lovin' You]]" and "Ain't It Baby"), then [[Fontana Records|'''Fontana''']] ("Please Mr. Postman" by the Marvelettes was one of four) and then [[Oriole Records (UK)|'''Oriole American''']] ("[[Fingertips (song)|Fingertips]]" by Little Stevie Wonder was one of many).  In 1963, Motown signed with EMI's [[Stateside Records|'''Stateside''']] label ("[[Where Did Our Love Go]]" by the Supremes and "[[My Guy]]" by Mary Wells were Motown's first British top-20 hits). Eventually EMI created the '''Tamla Motown''' label ("[[Stop! In the Name of Love]]" by the Supremes was the first Tamla Motown release in March 1965).

===Los Angeles: 1972–1998===
After the songwriting trio [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]] left the label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, Norman Whitfield became the company's top producer, turning out hits for The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Rare Earth. In the meantime Berry Gordy established Motown Productions, a television subsidiary which produced TV specials for the Motown artists, including ''[[TCB (TV program)|TCB]]'', with Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations, ''[[Diana!]]'' with Diana Ross, and ''[[Goin' Back to Indiana]]'' with [[the Jackson 5]]. The company loosened its production rules, allowing some of its longtime artists the opportunity to write and produce more of their own material. This resulted in the recordings of successful and critically acclaimed albums such as [[Marvin Gaye]]'s ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971) and ''[[Let's Get it On]]'' (1973), and [[Stevie Wonder]]'s ''[[Music of My Mind]]'' (1972), ''[[Talking Book]]'' (1972), and ''[[Innervisions]]'' (1973).

Motown had established branch offices in both New York City and Los Angeles during the mid-1960s, and by 1969 had begun gradually moving more of its operations to Los Angeles. The company moved all of its operations to Los Angeles in June 1972, with a number of artists, among them [[Martha Reeves]], the Four Tops, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and many of the [[Funk Brothers]] studio band, either staying behind in Detroit or leaving the company for other reasons. By re-locating, Motown aimed chiefly to branch out into the motion-picture industry, and Motown Productions got its start in film by turning out two hit-vehicles for [[Diana Ross]]: the [[Billie Holiday]] biographical film ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972), and ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]'' (1975). Other Motown films would include ''[[Scott Joplin (film)|Scott Joplin]]'' (1977), ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' (1978), ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Last Dragon]]'' (1985). [[Ewart Abner]], who had been associated with Motown since the 1960s, became its president in 1973.

By the 1970s, the Motown "hit factory" had become a target of a backlash from some fans of rock music. Record producer [[Pete Waterman]] recalls of this period: "I was a DJ for years and I worked for Motown – the press at the time, papers like [[NME]], used to call it Toytown. When I DJ'd on the [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|Poly]] circuit, the students wanted me to play [[Spooky Tooth]] and [[Velvet Underground]]. Things don't change. Nowadays, of course, Motown is hip."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s49QgtwybqUC&q=motown+toytown&pg=PT138|title=The Nineties: What the F**ck Was That All About?|first=John|last=Robb|date=October 31, 2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781409034421|accessdate=March 9, 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Despite losing Holland–Dozier–Holland, Norman Whitfield, and some of its other hitmakers by 1975, Motown still had a number of successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Lionel Richie]] and the [[Commodores]], [[Rick James]], [[Teena Marie]], the [[Dazz Band]], [[Jose Feliciano]] and [[DeBarge]]. By the mid-1980s  Motown had started losing money, and Berry Gordy sold his ownership in Motown to [[MCA Records]] (which began a US distribution deal with the label in 1983) and Boston Ventures in June 1988 for $61 million. In 1989, Gordy sold the Motown Productions TV/film operations to Motown executive [[Suzanne de Passe]], who renamed the company [[de Passe Entertainment]] and continues to run it {{As of|2018|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.depassejones.com/company|title=Company - De Passe Jones Entertainment|website=Home - De Passe Jones Entertainment|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref>

During the 1990s, Motown was home to successful recording artists such as [[Boyz II Men]] and [[Johnny Gill]], although the company itself remained in a state of turmoil. MCA appointed a series of executives to run the company, beginning with Berry Gordy's immediate successor, [[Jheryl Busby]]. Busby quarreled with MCA, alleging that the company did not give Motown's product adequate attention or promotion. In 1991, Motown sued MCA to have its distribution deal with the company terminated, and began releasing its product through [[PolyGram]]. PolyGram purchased Motown from Boston Ventures three years later.

In 1994, Busby was replaced by [[Andre Harrell]], the entrepreneur behind [[Uptown Records]]. Harrell served as Motown's CEO for just under two years, leaving the company after receiving bad publicity for being inefficient. Danny Goldberg, who ran PolyGram's [[Mercury Records]] group, assumed control of Motown, and [[George Jackson (producer)|George Jackson]] served as president.

===Final years of the Motown label: 1999–2005===
By 1998, Motown had added stars such as [[702 (band)|702]], [[Brian McKnight]], and [[Erykah Badu]] to its roster. In December 1998, [[PolyGram]] was acquired by [[Seagram]], and Motown was absorbed into the [[Universal Music Group]]. Seagram had purchased Motown's former parent MCA in 1995, and Motown was in effect reunited with many of its MCA corporate siblings (Seagram had hoped to build a media empire around Universal, and started by purchasing PolyGram). Universal briefly considered shuttering the label, but instead decided to restructure it. [[Kedar Massenburg]], a producer for Erykah Badu, became the head of the label, and oversaw successful recordings from Badu, McKnight, [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], and new Motown artist [[India.Arie]].

Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and the Temptations had remained with the label since its early days, although all except Wonder recorded for other labels for several years. Ross left Motown for [[RCA Records]] from 1981 to 1988, but returned in 1989 and stayed until 2002, while Robinson left Motown in 1991 (although he did return to release [[Intimate (Smokey Robinson album)|one more album for the label]] in 1999). The Temptations left for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1977, but returned in 1980 and eventually left again in 2004. {{As of|2018}}, Wonder is the only artist from Motown's early period still on the label.

===Universal Motown: 2005–2011===
{{Further|Universal Motown Records}}
In 2005, Massenburg was replaced by [[Sylvia Rhone]], former CEO of [[Elektra Records]]. Motown was merged with [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]] to create the [[Universal Motown Records]] and placed under the newly created umbrella division of [[Universal Motown Republic Group]]. Notable artists on Universal Motown included [[Drake Bell]], [[Ryan Leslie]], [[Melanie Fiona]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[Forever the Sickest Kids]], [[The Veer Union]] and [[Four Year Strong]]. Motown celebrated its 50th anniversary on January 12, 2009.

===Relaunch: 2011–present===

==Motown Sound==
Motown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the [[trademark]] "The Motown Sound". Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown Sound typically used [[tambourine]]s to accent the [[back beat]], prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive [[Melody|melodic]] and [[Chord (music)|chord]] structures, and a [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] singing style that originated in [[gospel music]]. In 1971, [[Jon Landau]] wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and "a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-motown-story-19710513|title=The Motown Story|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, [[melisma]]tic vocal riffs were avoided.<ref>Chin, Brian & David Nathan, "Reflections Of..." ''The Supremes'' [CD boxed-set liner notes] (New York: Motown Record Co./Universal Music, 2000).</ref> Motown producers believed steadfastly in the "[[KISS principle]]" (keep it simple, stupid).<ref>Williams, Otis & Patricia Romanowski, ''Temptations'' (Lanham, MD: Cooper Square, 1988; updated 2002). {{ISBN|0-8154-1218-5}}, p. 157.</ref>

The Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy; the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" and "[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]". In several cases, producers would re-work tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer [[Norman Whitfield]] did with "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and The Temptations' "[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]".

Many of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for [[the Supremes]], were written by the songwriting trio of [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]] ([[Lamont Dozier]] and brothers [[Brian Holland|Brian]] and [[Eddie Holland]]). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included [[Norman Whitfield]], [[William "Mickey" Stevenson]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Barrett Strong]], [[Ashford & Simpson|Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson]], [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]], [[Pam Sawyer|Pamela Sawyer]] & [[Gloria Jones]], James Dean & [[William Weatherspoon]], [[Johnny Bristol]], [[Harvey Fuqua]], [[Gil Askey]],<ref name="Washington Times May 2006">{{cite news|title=Diana Ross: old wine in 'Blue' bottles |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-146501906 |publisher=[[News World Communications]] |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |last=Yourse |first=Robyn-Denise |date=May 19, 2006 |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |via=[[Questia Online Library]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref> [[Stevie Wonder]], and Gordy himself.

The style created by the Motown musicians was a major influence on several non-Motown artists of the mid-1960s, such as [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[the Foundations]]. In the United Kingdom, the Motown Sound became the basis of the [[northern soul]] movement. Smokey Robinson said the Motown Sound had little to do with Detroit:
{{quote|People would listen to it, and they'd say, 'Aha, they use more bass. Or they use more drums.' Bullshit. When we were first successful with it, people were coming from Germany, France, Italy, Mobile, Alabama. From New York, Chicago, California. From ''everywhere''. Just to record in Detroit. They figured it was in the air, that if they came to Detroit and recorded on the freeway, they'd get the Motown sound. Listen, the Motown sound to me is ''not'' an audible sound. It's spiritual, and it comes from the people that make it happen. What other people didn't realize is that we just had one studio there, but we recorded in [[Chicago]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], New York, L.A.—almost every big city. And we still got the sound.<ref>Hirshey, Gerri (1994 [1984]). ''Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music''. New York: Da Capo Press. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-306-80581-2}}.</ref>}}

===The Funk Brothers===
{{main|The Funk Brothers}}
In addition to the songwriting process of the writers and producers, one of the major factors in the widespread appeal of Motown's music was Gordy's practice of using a highly-select and tight-knit group of studio musicians, collectively known as [[the Funk Brothers]], to record the instrumental or "band" tracks of a majority of Motown recordings. Among the studio musicians responsible for the "Motown Sound" were keyboardists [[Earl Van Dyke]], [[Johnny Griffith (musician)|Johnny Griffith]], and [[Joe Hunter (musician)|Joe Hunter]]; guitarists [[Joe Messina]], [[Robert White (guitarist)|Robert White]], and [[Eddie Willis]]; percussionists [[Eddie "Bongo" Brown]] and [[Jack Ashford]]; drummers [[Benny Benjamin]], [[Uriel Jones]], and [[Richard "Pistol" Allen]]; and bassists [[James Jamerson]] and [[Bob Babbitt]]. The band's career and work is chronicled in the 2002 [[documentary film]] ''[[Standing in the Shadows of Motown (film)|Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]'', which publicised the fact that these musicians "played on more number-one records than The Beatles, Elvis, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys combined."<ref name="standing" /> Ashford later played on [[Raphael Saadiq]]'s 2008 album ''[[The Way I See It]]'', whose recording and production were modelled after the Motown Sound.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite journal|last=Lewis |first=Pete |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/409/raphael_saadiq_this_years_vintage/ |title=Raphael Saadiq: This Years Vintage |journal=[[Blues & Soul]] |location=London |issue=1020 |date=May 22, 2009 |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Apgl4SvN?url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/409/raphael_saadiq_this_years_vintage/ |archivedate=September 21, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Much of the Motown Sound came from the use of overdubbed and duplicated instrumentation. Motown songs regularly featured two drummers instead of one (either overdubbed or in unison), as well as three or four guitar lines.<ref name="standing">
{{cite video | people = Justman, Paul | title = [[Standing in the Shadows of Motown (film)|Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]  | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Artisan Entertainment]] | location = [[Santa Monica, California]] |year=2002 }}</ref>
Bassist [[James Jamerson]] often played his instrument with only the [[index finger]] of his right hand, and created many of the basslines apparent on Motown songs such as "[[Up the Ladder to the Roof]]" by The Supremes.<ref name="standing" />

==Artist development==
Artist development was a major part of Motown's operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad market acceptance, and that they should think, act, walk and talk like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era.<ref>Pitts, Leonard, Jr. “The Motown Factor”. Jazziz. Issue 20.12. Dec. 2003. 60-62. Print.</ref> Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Laurie, Timothy|date=2012|title=Crossover Fatigue: The Persistence of Gender at Motown Records|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=14|issue=1|pages=90–105|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.737344|s2cid=144019819|url=https://www.academia.edu/2137542|accessdate=2015-10-30}}</ref> The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less-experienced acts; experienced performers such as [[Jr. Walker]] and [[Marvin Gaye]] were exempt from artist-development classes.

Many of the young artists participated in an annual package tour called the "[[Motortown Revue]]", which was popular, first, on the "[[Chitlin' Circuit]]", and, later, around the world. The tours gave the younger artists a chance to hone their performance and social skills and learn from the more experienced artists.

==Motown subsidiary labels==
In order to avoid accusations of [[payola]] should DJs play too many records from the original Tamla label, Gordy formed Motown Records as a second label in 1960.  The two labels featured the same writers, producers and artists.

Many more subsidiary labels were established later under the umbrella of the Motown parent company, including Gordy Records, Soul Records and VIP Records; in reality the Motown Record Corporation controlled all of these labels.  Most of the distinctions between Motown labels were largely arbitrary, with the same writers, producers and musicians working on all the major subsidiaries, and artists were often shuffled between labels for internal marketing reasons. All of these records are usually considered to be "Motown" records, regardless of whether they actually appeared on the Motown Records label itself.

===Major divisions===
* Tamla Records: Established 1959, Tamla was a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&B/soul music. Tamla is the company's original label: Gordy founded Tamla Records several months before establishing the Motown Record Corporation. The label's numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Gordy in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Tamla artists included [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[the Marvelettes]]. Tamla was briefly re-activated in 1996 as a reggae label, but only released a 12" single by [[Cocoa Tea]] called "New Immigration Law". Tamla also had a sub-label called Penny Records in 1959; artists on that label included Bryan Brent And The Cut Outs, who recorded a single for the label entitled "Vacation Time" b/w "For Eternity" (2201). Tamla Records slogan: ''"The Sound that Makes the World Go 'Round"''.
* Motown Records: Established 1960, Motown was and remains the company's main label for mainstream R&B/soul music (and, today, [[hip-hop music]] as well). The label's numbering system was combined with those of Tamla and Gordy in 1982, and the label (and company) was purchased by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] in 1988. Notable Motown artists have included [[Mary Wells]], [[the Supremes]], [[Four Tops]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Commodores]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Dazz Band]], [[Brian McKnight]], [[98 Degrees]], and [[Erykah Badu]]. Motown Records slogan: ''"The Sound of Young America"''.
* Gordy Records: Established 1962, Gordy was also a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&B/soul music. Originally known as ''Miracle Records'' (slogan: ''"If It's a Hit, It's a Miracle"''), the name was changed in 1962 to avoid confusion with the Miracles singing group. The label's numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Tamla in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Gordy artists included [[the Temptations]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]], [[the Contours]], [[Edwin Starr]], [[Rick James]], [[The Mary Jane Girls]], [[Teena Marie]], [[Switch (band)|Switch]], and [[DeBarge]]. Gordy Records slogan: ''"It's What's in the Grooves that Counts"''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mike Callahan, Patrice Eyries|first=David Edwards|title=Gordy Album Discography, Part 1 (1962-1981)|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/motown/gordy/gordy.html|publisher=bsnpubs.com|accessdate=2014-03-16}}</ref>
* Tamla Motown Records: Motown's non-[[US]] label, established in March 1965 and folded into the regular Motown label in 1976. Distributed by [[EMI]], Tamla Motown issued the releases on the American Motown labels, using its own numbering system. In some cases, Tamla Motown would issue singles and albums not released in the United States (for example, the singles "[[I Second That Emotion]]" and "[[Why (Must We Fall in Love)]]" by Diana Ross & the Supremes with the Temptations, as well as the successful ''[[Motown Chartbusters]]'' series of albums).

===Secondary R&B labels===
* Check-Mate Records: Short-lived (1961–1962) R&B/soul subsidiary, purchased from [[Chess Records]]. Notable artists included [[David Ruffin]] and The Del-Phis (later [[Martha and the Vandellas]]).
* [[Miracle Records]]: Short-lived (1961) R&B/soul subsidiary that lasted less than a year. Some pressings featured the infamous tagline, "If it's a hit, it's a Miracle." Renamed '''Gordy Records''' in 1962. Notable releases included early recordings by [[Jimmy Ruffin]] and [[the Temptations]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Miracle {{!}} Motown Junkies|url=http://motownjunkies.co.uk/labels/miracle/|work=article|date=October 2, 2009|publisher=motownjunkies.co.uk|accessdate=2014-03-16}}</ref>
* [[MoWest Records]]: MoWest was a short-lived (1971–1973; 1976 in UK) subsidiary for R&B/soul artists based on the West Coast. Shut down when the main Motown office moved to Los Angeles. Notable artists included [[G. C. Cameron]], [[the Sisters Love]], [[Syreeta Wright]], [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]], [[Commodores]] (their first two singles in 1972 and 1973), and Los Angeles DJ [[Tom Clay]]. Unlike other Motown releases in the UK that were released by Tamla Motown, MoWest retained its US label design and logo for its UK releases as well.  In fact, MoWest lasted longer in the UK up until 1976.
* Motown Yesteryear: a label created in late 1970s and used through the 1980s for the reissues of 7-inch singles from all eras of the company's history, after printing in the initial label has ceased.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diana-web.com/discography/diana/re-yesteryear.jpg |title=Diana-web.com |accessdate=December 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045944/http://www.diana-web.com/discography/diana/re-yesteryear.jpg |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> One Motown Yesteryear single made ''Billboard''′s Top 40 – [[the Contours]]' "Do You Love Me", in 1988, when its inclusion in the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' revived interest.
* [[Soul Records]]: Established in 1964, Soul was a R&B/soul subsidiary for releases with less of a [[jazz]] feel and/or more of a [[blues]] feel. Notable Soul artists included [[Jr. Walker & the All-Stars]], [[Shorty Long]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[The Originals (band)|the Originals]], [[The Fantastic Four (R&B group)|the Fantastic Four]], and [[Jimmy Ruffin]]. The label was dissolved in 1978. This label has no affiliation with the short-lived S.O.U.L. Records- an early 1990s imprint that was founded by the production team [[the Bomb Squad]].
* [[V.I.P. Records]]: Established in 1964, V.I.P. was an R&B/soul subsidiary. Notable artists included [[the Velvelettes]], [[The Spinners (soul music)|the Spinners]], [[The Monitors (American band)|the Monitors]], [[the Elgins]] and [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]]. V.I.P. also was the outlet for pop records that were leased to Motown by EMI (the distributor of Tamla-Motown in Europe). The label was dissolved in 1974.
* [[Weed Records]]: A very short-lived subsidiary. Only one release, [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]]'s 1969 ''CC Rides Again'' album, was issued. This release featured the tongue-in-cheek tagline: "Your Favorite Artists Are On Weed". The logo was a parody of the "Snapping Fingers" logo for [[Stax Records]], but the hand in this case is holding up a peace sign.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mike Callahan|first=David Edwards|title=Weed Album Discography|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/motown/weed/weed.html|work=article|publisher=bsnpubs.com|accessdate=2014-03-16}}</ref>  The name "Weed Records" is now owned by the Tokyo/New York-based ''Weed Records''.
