The '''Science History Institute'''  is an institution that preserves and promotes understanding of the [[history of science]]. Located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], it includes a [[library]], [[museum]], [[archive]], research center and [[conference center]]. 

It was founded in 1982 as a joint venture of the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]], as the '''Center for the History of Chemistry''' ('''CHOC'''). The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) became a co-founder in 1984. It was renamed the '''Chemical Heritage Foundation''' ('''CHF''') in 1992, and moved two years later to the institution's current location, 315 Chestnut Street in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]].<ref name=HistoryCHF>{{cite journal|title=The History of CHF|journal=Chemical Heritage: Newsmagazine of the Chemical Heritage Foundation|date=2000-02-01|volume=18|issue=1|pages=16–22}}</ref> 

On December 1, 2015, CHF merged with the [[Life Sciences Foundation]], creating an organization that covers "the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering."<ref name="History">{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/history|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=27 March 2018|date=2016-05-31}}</ref><ref name="Merger">{{cite news|title=CHF and LSF Announce Merger|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chf-and-lsf-announce-merger-300159747.html|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=PR Newswire|date=Oct 14, 2015}}</ref>  As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.<ref name="Salisbury">{{cite news|last1=Salisbury|first1=Stephan|title=Chemical Heritage Foundation is morphing into the Science History Institute|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/arts/chemical-heritage-foundation-science-history-institute-philadelphia-20180103.html|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=January 3, 2018}}</ref>

The Institute focuses on the [[history of chemistry]], the [[history of science]], the [[history of technology]], trends in [[research and development]], the impact of [[science#Science and society|science on society]], and relationships between science and art. It supports a community of research scholars and an oral history program.  As of 2012, it was the largest U.S. grantor of research fellowships for the history of science.<ref name=FellowshipSupport>{{cite journal|last1=Gussman|first1=Neil|title=A philanthropic career: Arnold Beckman and chemical heritage|journal=Chemistry in Australia|date=2012|volume=October|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/News-and-Press/ChemistryInAustralia_Oct2012_Beckman.pdf|pages=32–33|accessdate=10 March 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050805/http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/News-and-Press/ChemistryInAustralia_Oct2012_Beckman.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref><ref name=Othmers>{{cite web|title=Honoring the Othmers: Generosity, Vision, and a Transformative Gift|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/about/history/chf-founders/2013-02-14-othmer-gift.aspx|website=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=11 March 2015|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712182322/http://www.chemheritage.org/about/history/chf-founders/2013-02-14-othmer-gift.aspx |archivedate=2016-07-12}}</ref>

==History==
The idea of creating "a library of reference and a chemical museum" in the United States can be found in the Proceedings of the first meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) in 1876.<ref name=ACS1876>{{cite journal|title=The American Chemical Society: Proceedings of the first meeting for organization, New York, April 6, 1876|journal=The American Chemist|date=1876|volume=7|issue=11|pages=401–402|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpMMAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA402|accessdate=19 March 2015|last1=Chandler|first1=Charles Frederick|last2=Chandler|first2=William Henry}}</ref> 

The idea of a Science History Institute dates to 1976, when the [[United States Bicentennial|nation's bicentennial]] and the ACS' centennial stimulated interest in history and chemistry. As part of the ACS centennial activities, John H. Wotiz of its history-of-chemistry division organized a session on the history of chemistry; he was a strong proponent of a national center for historical chemistry.<ref name="Centennial">{{cite journal|last1=Reese|first1=K.

===Center for the History of Chemistry===
In 1979, the ACS formed a task force chaired by [[Ned D. Heindel]] to look at creating a national center for the history of chemistry.<ref name=HistoryCHF/><ref name=CHOC18-3/> [[Arnold Thackray]], a professor in the Department of History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, and curator of the [[Edgar Fahs Smith]] Memorial Collection on the history of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, argued for the formation of such a center in Philadelphia. Thackray obtained promises of private support from chemist [[John C. Haas]] and institutional support from the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[DuPont]].<ref name=CHF-origin/> In December 1981, the ACS approved the establishment of the Center for the History of Chemistry, with support of $50,000 per year for five years, in cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania, which was to provide an equivalent in goods and services.<ref name=Centennial/> An agreement to create the Center for the History of Chemistry was signed by officers of the American Chemical Society and the University of Pennsylvania on January 22 and 26, 1982.<ref name=CHOC1-1>{{cite journal|title=Center for History of Chemistry Created|journal=CHOC News|date=1982|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–3, 11}}</ref>  A policy council was appointed by the sponsoring institutions to oversee routine operations of the center, and [[Arnold Thackray]] was appointed part-time director of the center on April 29, 1982.<ref name=CHOC1-1/> The center was inaugurated on March 11, 1983,<ref name=CHOC1-3>{{cite journal|title=Center for History of Chemistry Inaugurated|journal=CHOC News|date=1983|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–3}}</ref> in several vacant basement rooms on the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus.<ref name=CHF-origin>{{cite web|last=Gussman|first=Neil|title=The Power of John C.

A National Advisory Board was also formed from a wide-ranging group of people in academia and industry.<ref name=CHOC1-1/> In 1982, its members included John C. Haas, historians [[Margaret W. Rossiter]] and [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] and at least three [[Nobel Prize]] winners, [[Christian B. Anfinsen]], [[Herbert C. Brown]], and [[Glenn T. Seaborg]].<ref name=HistoryCHF/> The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) became a co-founder of the Center, signing an agreement on August 27 and 28, 1984.<ref name=Centennial/><ref name=CHOC2-1>{{cite journal|title=American Institute of Chemical Engineers Joins CHOC Endeavor|journal=CHOC News|date=1984|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–3}}</ref> In addition, the institution began to establish relationships with affiliated organizations such as [[The Chemists' Club]], the [[American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]], the [[American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists]], the [[Electrochemical Society]] and the [[American Society for Mass Spectrometry]].<ref name=electric>{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Flaumenhaft|first2=Daniel|title=Chemistry is electric!|date=1997|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-941901-17-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_0UvIZFypkC&pg=PA1965}}</ref>

As early as 1983, the Center for the History of Chemistry expressed an interest in "The Conservation of Historic American Chemical Instruments", in discussions of a possible joint project with the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]].  However, the center did not yet have exhibition or collections space to allow for the acquisition of any but the most limited quantities of documents.<ref name=CHOC1-3b>{{cite journal|title=The Conservation of Historic American Chemical Instruments|journal=CHOC News|date=1983|volume=1|issue=3|page=12}}</ref> The center did curate a number of traveling exhibitions by collaborating with other organizations, including "Joseph Priestley: Enlightened Chemist",<ref name=Priestley>{{cite web|title=Joseph Priestley, enlightened chemist an exhibit celebrating the 250th birthday of Joseph Priestley|url=http://ihm.nlm.nih.gov/luna/servlet/detail/NLMNLM~1~1~101437807~151872:Joseph-Priestley,-enlightened-chemi|place=Philadelphia|publisher=Center for History of Chemistry|date=1983}}</ref> "Polymers and People",<ref name=Polymers>{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=Eric|title=Polymers and People: An Informal History|date=1986|publisher=The Center for the History of Chemistry|location=Philadelphia|edition=1st}}</ref> "Scaling Up",<ref name=SmithReview>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=John K.|title="Scaling up: Science, Engineering, and the American Chemical Industry"-Center for History of Chemistry|journal=Technology and Culture|date=1986|volume=27|issue=4|pages=832–834|jstor=3105331|doi=10.2307/3105331}}</ref><ref name=Scaling>{{cite book|last1=Heitmann|first1=John Alfred|last2=Rhees|first2=David J.|title=Scaling up: science, engineering, and the American chemical industry|date=1990|publisher=Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania|location=Philadelphia, PA, US}}</ref>  and "Chemical Education in the United States".<ref name=Lewenstein>{{cite journal|last1=Lewenstein|first1=Bruce V.|title="To improve our knowledge in nature and arts": A history of chemical education in the United States|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=January 1989|volume=66|issue=1|pages=37|doi=10.1021/ed066p37|bibcode=1989JChEd..66...37L}}</ref>

====Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry (BCHOC)====
During the 1980s, the center came to the attention of [[Arnold Orville Beckman]]. The [[Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation]] provided a $2 million challenge grant in 1986 to stimulate expansion of the center as a research institute, the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry (BCHOC).<ref name=BeckmanCHF>{{cite web|title=Arnold O.

==== Othmer Library of Chemical History ====
In 1989, the Center received a further challenge grant, this time from [[Donald F. Othmer]] and his wife, Mildred Topp Othmer.  Donald Othmer was a quiet chemical engineering professor from Polytechnic University in Brooklyn.<ref name=Miller>{{cite news |first=Karen E. |last=Quinones Miller |title=Chemistry Foundation Here Finds Element Of Surprise A Professor Left It Millions |url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-14/news/25737042_1_chemical-heritage-foundation-chemical-engineering-chemistry-prize |quote=In 1982, when the Chemical Heritage Foundation was a fledgling research organization starting out with only $50,000, it asked chemical engineers and experts around the country to serve as advisers on its council of friends.

Again, efforts to match the grant were supported by the National Foundation for History of Chemistry and the American Chemical Society's Campaign for Chemistry.   The new library was further supported by the donation of 8,500 monographs, textbooks and reference works from The Chemists' Club of New York.<ref name=CHOC6-2>{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Charles C.|title=Making History: The Challenge Met - And the Challenge Ahead |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1989|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–2}}</ref><ref name=CHOC6-2b>{{cite journal|title=The Donald F. & Mildred Topp Othmer Library of Chemical History |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1989|volume=6|issue=2|page=insert}}</ref>

===Chemical Heritage Foundation===
On July 1, 1992, the National Foundation for History of Chemistry changed its name to the Chemical Heritage Foundation, in recognition of the international nature of chemical history.<ref name=HistoryCHF/><ref name=CHOC9-2>{{cite journal|title=The Chemical Heritage Foundation |journal=The Beckman Center for the History of Chemistry News|date=1992|volume=9|issue=2|pages=1, 16}}</ref> By 1994, the [[First National Bank (Philadelphia)|First National Bank]] at 315 Chestnut Street was being discussed as a possible permanent home for the Beckman Center and Othmer Library.<ref name=Miller/><ref name=CHOC11-2>{{cite journal|title=CHF Approaches Independence |journal=Chemical Heritage|date=1992|volume=11|issue=2|page=1}}</ref> The institution was able to purchase the bank and nearby property in 1995 in part through a matching grant from Donald Othmer.

=====Instrument collections=====

The Chemical Heritage Foundation's collections include such pioneering and landmark instruments as a 1934 [[Beckman Coulter|Beckman]] Model G pH Meter, a [[DuPont]] 900 Differential Thermal Analyzer, an early custom Electro-spray Ionization Mass Spectrometer used by [[John B. Fenn]],<ref name="Arnaud2008" /> a 1947 [[Mettler Toledo|Mettler]] B5 Single-Pan Balance, a 1963 [[Perkin-Elmer]] Model 125 Infrared Grating Spectrophotometer, and a c. 1980's Automated Peptide Synthesizer created by [[Bruce Merrifield]].<ref name="Arnaud2008" />

The foundation expanded its instrument collections slowly, mostly through donations of single instruments or small groups of instruments. In 2000, the CIMG was transformed into the Heritage Council Instruments and Artifacts Committee (HCIAC), which included staff and supporters and began meeting under founding chair W.

===Science History Institute===
On December 1, 2015, the Chemical Heritage Foundation merged with the [[Life Sciences Foundation]], also founded by Arnold Thackray.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Merger"/>  Recognizing that the joint organization's interests extended beyond the field of chemistry, the organization began a two-year renaming process, whose outcome required the agreement of its founding partners, the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]].  On February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, extending from the chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.<ref name="Salisbury"/>

===Leaders===
[[Arnold Thackray]], the institution's first president, was awarded the 1983 [[Dexter Award]] for his contributions to the history of chemistry.<ref name=DexterThackray>{{cite web|title=Arnold Thackray 1939–)|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Dexter%20Papers/ThackrayDexterBioJJB.pdf|publisher=Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society|accessdate=1 January 2006}}</ref><ref name=Baykoucheva>{{cite journal|last1=Baykoucheva|first1=Svetla|title=The Chemical Heritage Foundation: Past, Present, and Future Interview with Arnold Thackray|journal=Chemical Information Bulletin|date=2008|volume=60|issue=2|pages=10–13|url=http://www.acscinf.org/content/chemical-heritage-foundation-past-present-and-future|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> Thackray was succeeded by [[Thomas R.
