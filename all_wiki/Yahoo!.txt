The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Does 'Yahoo' Stand For? |url=http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/internet101/f/yahoostory.htm |work=About.com |access-date=July 2, 2012 |last=Gurnitsky |first=Joanna |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411035134/http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/internet101/f/yahoostory.htm |archive-date=April 11, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.yahoo.com//info//misc//history.html|title=The History of Yahoo! – How It All Started ...|date=January 9, 2011|publisher=Yahoo!|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109042907/http://docs.yahoo.com//info//misc//history.html|archive-date=January 9, 2011}}</ref> This meaning derives from the [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoo]] race of fictional beings from ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.

===Mobile services===
[[Yahoo Mobile]], a [[mobile virtual network operator]] in Japan, offers services for email, instant messaging, and [[mobile blogging]], as well as information services, searches and alerts. Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones.

Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results.

The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yahoo Gets Ahead of Google in the Mobile Search Market |url=http://www.usb4ever.com/yahoo-gets-ahead-of-google-p.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224203041/http://www.usb4ever.com/yahoo-gets-ahead-of-google-p.html |archive-date=December 24, 2007 |date=February 21, 2008}}</ref>

===Yahoo SearchMonkey===
Yahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters.

Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008, ReadWriteWeb award |access-date=March 30, 2009 |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_semantic_web_products_2008.php |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329043631/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_semantic_web_products_2008.php |archive-date=March 29, 2009  }}</ref>

====Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo====
On December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://techchunks.com/technology/confirmed-yahoo-shutting-down-delicious-buzz-altavista-other-services/ |title=Leak Confirmed – Yahoo Shutting Down Delicious, Buzz, AltaVista, MyBlogLog and Other Services |work=TechChunks |date=December 27, 2010 |access-date=May 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427152026/http://techchunks.com/technology/confirmed-yahoo-shutting-down-delicious-buzz-altavista-other-services/ |archive-date=April 27, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

The following services were in a column under "Sunset": Yahoo Picks, [[AltaVista]], MyM, [[AlltheWeb]], Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, [[del.icio.us]], and MyBlogLog. Under the "Merge" column were: Upcoming, [[FoxyTunes]], Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle.

11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the "Sunset" and "Merge" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.twitter.com/waxpancake/status/15483488237002752 |title=Twitter post of original slide |publisher=Twitter |date=December 16, 2010 |access-date=October 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027054250/https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/15483488237002752 |archive-date=October 27, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The blog on the ''del.icio.us'' website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that "Sunset" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: "We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press."<ref>{{cite news |title= Now Yahoo Says Delicious Will Live On ...

Yahoo got its first logo during its establishment in 1994—it consists of the "Yahoo" wordmark which is coloured black and are using the [[Times New Roman]] font, but it were later changed.

In March 1995, when the company changed its name to Yahoo, it introduced another logo which is briefly changed to a more elaborate text that includes an exclamation point at the end, but it were short-lived for only 5 months.

Later, in August 1995, that same year, Yahoo changed its logo again and it became an stylized yellow jumping "Y" figurine on a blue circle while the "Yahoo!" wordmark is written below, but the logo were also short-lived for 4 months until December 1995.

On January 1, 1996, Yahoo introduced a simplified new logo that included the text "Yahoo" and an exclamation mark, both in red with a slight shadow behind the text.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.logoorange.com/logodesign-Y.php |title=Yahoo Logo Design, Logo Design History |publisher=Logoorange.com |access-date=May 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929104206/http://www.logoorange.com/logodesign-Y.php |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> By May 2009, Yahoo tweaked the logo by recoloring it from red to purple and removing the logo's outline and shadow. At the time, the purple logo was accompanied by a new slogan, "It's Y!ou." A shortened variant of the logo, consisting of only the letter "Y" and an exclamation point, was also used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Y – Yahoo |url=http://www.all-acronyms.com/cat/7/Y/Yahoo/1183359 |publisher=All Acronyms |access-date=May 23, 2012 |year=2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221084601/http://www.all-acronyms.com/cat/7/Y/Yahoo/1183359 |archive-date=December 21, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

On August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013 at 4:00&nbsp;a.m. UTC. In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the "30 Days of Change" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yahoo is getting a new logo – in a month |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/08/06/yahoo-is-getting-a-new-logo/2617033/ |access-date=August 14, 2013 |newspaper=USA Today |date=August 7, 2013 |author=Swartz, Jon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126144328/http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/08/06/yahoo-is-getting-a-new-logo/2617033/ |archive-date=November 26, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yahoo's 30 days of change campaign will end with new logo design |url=http://www.techspot.com/news/53532-yahoos-30-days-of-change-campaign-will-end-with-new-logo-design.html |work=TechSpot |access-date=August 14, 2013 |author=Knight, Shawn |date=August 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810052313/http://www.techspot.com/news/53532-yahoos-30-days-of-change-campaign-will-end-with-new-logo-design.html |archive-date=August 10, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yahoo reveals its new logo |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/5/4696274/yahoo-reveals-its-new-logo |work=The Verge |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]] |access-date=September 19, 2013 |author=Newton, Casey |date=September 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920214635/http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/5/4696274/yahoo-reveals-its-new-logo |archive-date=September 20, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Mayer explains:

<blockquote>So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo – whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. Having a human touch, personal. Proud.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geeking Out on the Logo |url=http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/ |work=Marissa's Tumblr |publisher=Yahoo |access-date=September 19, 2013 |author=Mayer, Marissa |date=September 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053612/http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/ |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the "My Yahoo" personalized homepage. The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. Users can also select "theme packs" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as [[Empire of the Sun (band)|Empire of the Sun]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Yahoo Resurrects The Personalized Homepage With "My Yahoo" Revamp |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/yahoo-resurrects-the-personalized-homepage-with-my-yahoo-revamp/?ncid=tcdaily |work=TechCrunch |access-date=September 19, 2013 |author=Perez, Sarah |date=September 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923102800/http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/yahoo-resurrects-the-personalized-homepage-with-my-yahoo-revamp/?ncid=tcdaily |archive-date=September 23, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees.<ref name="Sew">{{cite web |title=6 Things We Learned From Marissa Mayer and Mark Zuckerberg at TechCrunch Disrupt 2013 |url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2296067/6-Things-We-Learned-From-Marissa-Mayer-and-Mark-Zuckerberg-at-TechCrunch-Disrupt-2013 |work=Search Engine Watch |access-date=September 23, 2013 |author=Edwards, Victoria |date=September 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924084501/http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2296067/6-Things-We-Learned-From-Marissa-Mayer-and-Mark-Zuckerberg-at-TechCrunch-Disrupt-2013 |archive-date=September 24, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

In September 2019 saw another logo change for Yahoo, which the company claims is a "refreshed brand identity [that] is simpler and more flexible, and looks back to the original, quirky 1996 logo." The logo is white text set against a purple background, with both the “y” and “!” of the logo reportedly set at an angle of 22.5 degrees.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yahoo Brand Identity |url=https://www.pentagram.com/work/yahoo/story |website=Pentagram |publisher=Pentagram |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>
