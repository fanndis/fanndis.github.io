By the early 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of people; the worldwide TM organization had grown to include educational programs, health products, and related services.

The TM technique involves the use of a silently-used sound called a mantra, and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day. It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, which costs a fee that varies by country.

For example, TM is simply – as they state – a technique. Although it enables one to cope with life, it offers no goal beyond human existence (such as moksha), nor does it offer rites or passage or an ethic. Unlike certain other Hindu-derived movements, TM does not prescribe a dharma to its followers – that is to say a set of spiritual obligations deriving from one’s essential nature.''</ref> The organization has also been criticized as well as praised for its public presentation and marketing techniques throughout its 50-year history.

==Maharishi effect==
In the 1960s, [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] described a paranormal effect claiming a significant number of individuals (1% of the people in a given area) practicing the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] (TM) could have an effect on the local environment.<ref>Dawson, Lorne L. (2003) Blackwell Publishing, Cults and New Religious Movements, page 47.</ref> This hypothetical influence was later termed the Maharishi effect. With the introduction of the TM-[[Siddhi#Patanjali's_Yoga_Sutras|Sidhi]] program in 1976, the Maharishi proposed that the {{clarify span|square root of one percent|date=June 2020}} of the population practicing the TM-Sidhi program, together at the same time and in the same place, would increase "life-supporting trends". This was referred to as the "extended Maharishi effect".<ref name="Karam">Karam, Ted (2005) Jumping on Water: Awaken Your Joy, Empower Your Life, page 137.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mum.edu/m_effect/ |archive-date=29 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629001458/http://www.mum.edu/m_effect/ |title=Maharishi Effect Research on the Maharishi Effect |publisher=Maharishi University of Management |access-date=29 December 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Evidence, which TM practitioners<ref name="Park">{{Cite book |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 9780198604433 |page = 30 |last = Park |first = Robert L. |title = Voodoo science: The road from foolishness to fraud |year = 2002 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xzCK6-Kqs6QC}}</ref> argue supports the existence of the effect, has been criticized as lacking a [[causality|causal basis]],<ref name="Fales">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2580722 |last1=Fales |first1=Evan |last2=Markovsky |first2=Barry |title=Evaluating Heterodox Theories |jstor=2580722 |journal=Social Forces |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=511–525 |year=1997}}</ref> being derived from [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked data]],<ref name="Schrodt">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0022002790034004008 |jstor=174187 |last=Schrodt |first=Phillip A. |title=A methodological critique of a test of the Maharishi technology of the unified field |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=34 |issue=4 |year=1990 |pages=745–755|s2cid=145426830 }}</ref> and being based on the [[credulity]] of believers.<ref name=Fales/><ref name="SFGate">{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/12/29/MN65432.DTL |last=Epstein |first=Edward |title=Politics and Transcendental Meditation |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=29 December 1995}}</ref>
