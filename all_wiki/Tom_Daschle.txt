'''Thomas Andrew Daschle''' ({{IPAc-en|'|d|æ|ʃ|əl}}; born December 9, 1947) is an American politician and lobbyist who served as a [[United States senator]] from [[South Dakota]] from 1987 to 2005. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he became U.S. Senate [[Minority Leader]] in 1995 and later the [[Majority Leader]] in 2001. 

After leaving the [[United States Air Force]], he was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1978 and served four terms. In [[United States Senate election in South Dakota, 1986|1986]], he was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming [[Minority Leader]] in 1995 and [[Majority Leader]] in 2001, becoming the highest-ranking elected official in South Dakota history.

In [[United States Senate election in South Dakota, 2004|2004]], he was defeated for reelection in a remarkable upset.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lauck |first1=Jon K. |title=Daschle Vs.

Daschle was an early supporter of [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential candidacy, and was nominated by [[President-elect]] Obama for the position of [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services]] after the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]].<ref name = PearNYT>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Pear|title=Daschle Will Lead Health Care Overhaul|format=Article|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/us/politics/w11health.html?hp |accessdate=December 11, 2008}}</ref> However, Daschle withdrew his name on February 3, 2009, amid a growing controversy over his failure to properly report and pay [[Income tax in the United States|income taxes]].<ref name=daschlewithdrawl>"[http://www.publicradio.org/columns/kpcc/kpccnewsinbrief/2009/02/daschle-withdraws-as-nominee-f.html Daschle withdraws as nominee for HHS secretary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331151615/http://www.publicradio.org/columns/kpcc/kpccnewsinbrief/2009/02/daschle-withdraws-as-nominee-f.html |date=March 31, 2012 }}", Associated Press, February 3, 2009; accessed February 3, 2009.</ref> He is currently working for The Daschle Group, a Public Policy Advisory of [[Baker Donelson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bakerdonelson.com/former-us-senator-tom-daschle-joins-with-baker-donelson-to-form-the-daschle-group-a-public-policy-advisory-of-baker-donelson-10-28-2014|title=Former U.S. Senator Tom Daschle Joins With Baker Donelson to Form The Daschle Group, A Public Policy Advisory of Baker Donelson|publisher=Baker Donelson|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref> a large law firm and [[lobbying]] group.

==Early life and education==
Daschle was born in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen]], [[South Dakota]], the son of Elizabeth B. (née Meier) and Sebastian C. Daschle, both of German descent. His paternal grandparents were [[Volga Germans]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reitwiesner|first=William|title=The Ancestors of Tom Daschle|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/daschle.html|accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref> He grew up in a working-class Roman Catholic family,  the eldest of four brothers.{{refn|group=Note|name=Bottum|As a result of [[Tom Daschle#Views on abortion|controversy surrounding Daschle's views on abortion]], he was ordered by his bishop in 2003 to stop identifying as Catholic.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bottum|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Bottum (author)|title=Tom Daschle's Duty to Be Morally Coherent|magazine=The Weekly Standard|year=2003|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/559jrrei.asp|accessdate=February 11, 2009}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Famous Germans from Russia|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~steeles/gerrus|accessdate =November 6, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305213055/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~steeles/gerrus|archivedate=March 5, 2008}}</ref> 

He became the first person in his family to graduate from college when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[South Dakota State University#Political Science Department|Department of Political Science]] at [[South Dakota State University]] in 1969. While attending South Dakota State University, Daschle became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]]. From 1969 to 1972, Daschle served in the [[United States Air Force]] as an [[intelligence officer]] with the [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=senatebio>"[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/common/generic/Sitter_Daschle.htm Senator Thomas A. Daschle]", [[United States Senate]]; retrieved February 3, 2009.</ref>

In the mid-1970s Daschle was an aide to Senator [[James Abourezk]].

==House of Representatives (1979–1987)==
In 1978 Daschle was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] at the age of 31, winning the race by a margin of 139 votes, following a recount, out of more than 129,000 votes cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1978election.pdf |title=Statistics of the Congressional Election of November 7, 1978 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> Daschle served four terms in the House of Representatives and quickly became a part of the Democratic leadership.

Although Daschle was not seeking the Vice-Presidency, he received 10 (0.30%) delegate votes for [[Vice President of the United States]] at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59872 |title=US Vice President – D Convention Race – August 11, 1980 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref>  Several others also received protest votes, but incumbent Vice President [[Walter Mondale]] was nevertheless renominated easily.

==United States Senate (1987–2005)==
[[File:Daschle Portrait.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Official Senate portrait by [[Aaron Shikler]]]]
In [[U.S. Senate election, 1986|1986]], Daschle was elected to the senate in a close victory over incumbent Republican [[James Abdnor]]. In his first year, he was appointed to the [[United States Senate Finance Committee|Finance Committee]]. 
===Party Leadership===
In 1994 he was chosen by his colleagues to succeed the retiring Senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] as Democratic minority leader. In the history of the Senate, only [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had served fewer years before being elected to lead his party. In addition to the minority leader's post, Daschle served as a member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry]]. South Dakotans reelected Daschle to the Senate by overwhelming margins [[United States Senate election in South Dakota, 1998|in 1998]]. 

At various points in his career, he served on the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]], [[U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|Indian Affairs]], [[U.S. Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]], and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Ethics]] Committees.

When the [[107th United States Congress|107th Congress]] commenced on January 3, 2001, the Senate was evenly divided—that is, there were 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. Outgoing [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] acted in his [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] capacity as [[ex officio]] [[President of the Senate#United States|President of the Senate]], and used his tie-breaking vote to give the Democrats the majority in that chamber. For the next two weeks, Daschle served as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. 

Then, upon the commencement of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] on January 20, 2001, [[Dick Cheney]] became president of the senate, thereby returning Democrats to the minority in that body; Daschle reverted to the position of [[Senate Minority Leader]]. However, on June 6, 2001, Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] announced in that he was leaving the Senate Republican [[caucus]] to become an independent and to caucus with Democrats;<ref>Entry for [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=J000072 James Merrill Jeffords] in the ''Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress''. (Accessed January 30, 2009.)</ref> this once again returned control of the body to the Democrats and Daschle again became majority leader.

Democratic losses in the November 2002 elections returned the party to the minority in the senate in January 2003, and Daschle once more reverted to being minority leader.

Daschle recounted his senate experiences from 2001 to 2003 in his first book, ''Like No Other Time: The 107th Congress and the Two Years That Changed America Forever'' {{ISBN|9781400049554}}, published in 2003.<ref>Tom Daschle and Michael D'Orso, ''Like No Other Time: The 107th Congress and the Two Years That Changed America Forever'', Crown, 2003. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-4955-4}}</ref> With Charles Robbins, he has also written the book ''The U.S. Senate: Fundamentals of American Government''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Anthrax case in 2001===
In October 2001, while he was the Senate Majority Leader, Daschle's office received a letter containing [[anthrax]], becoming a target of the [[2001 anthrax attacks]].<ref name=revkin>{{Cite news|last1=Revkin|first1=Andrew|title=A Nation Challenged: Tracing The Spores|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 18, 2001|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DC153EF93BA25753C1A9679C8B63}}</ref> Some of his staffers were confirmed to have been exposed,<ref name="revkin"/> as well as several of Senator [[Russ Feingold]]'s staffers and Capitol police officers.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Stout|first1=David|title=House Will Shut Down Until Tuesday for Anthrax Screening|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 17, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/national/17CND-ANTH.html?ex=1227243600&en=18449a3d1c502305&ei=5070}}</ref> His suite at the [[Hart Senate Office Building]] was the focus of an intensive cleanup led by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>“The Anthrax Cleanup of Capitol Hill.” Documentary by Xin Wang produced by the EPA Alumni Association.

===Views on abortion===
Daschle has a mixed voting record on [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion-related]] issues, which led the [[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice]] organization [[NARAL]] to give him a 50% vote rating.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2004/11/17/harry_reid/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207084842/http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2004/11/17/harry_reid/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 7, 2008|last=Green|first=Michael|title=Gambling on Harry Reid|date=November 17, 2004|work=Salon|accessdate=November 20, 2008}}</ref> 

In 1999 and 2003, Daschle voted in favor of the ban on [[partial-birth abortion]],<ref>{{USBill|106|S|1692|pipe=Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999}}, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=1&vote=00340 Record Vote No: 340]</ref><ref>{{USBill|108|S|3|pipe=Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003}}, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&session=1&vote=00051 Record Vote No: 51]</ref> and supported legislation making it a crime to harm an unborn child when someone attacks a pregnant woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/blog/entry.cfm?blog_id=2&id=B9F090EF-1321-AEAA-D3E4F888F0D20AC6|title=Daschle: Half Full or Half Empty?|last=Winters |first=Michael Sean|date=November 20, 2008 |publisher=America: The National Catholic Weekly|accessdate=November 20, 2008}}</ref> (Investigators into the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], which included Senator Daschle's Capitol Hill office, suspect that alleged anthrax mailer [[Bruce Ivins]] may have chosen to target Daschle over his views on abortion, although Ivins's lawyer disputed this alleged motive.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93385756|title=Anthrax Suspect's Abortion Stance Eyed As Motive|last=Temple-Raston|first=Dina|date=August 7, 2008|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=November 20, 2008}}</ref> 

In 2003, Roman Catholic Bishop [[Robert James Carlson|Robert Carlson]] reportedly wrote to Daschle, criticizing his stance on abortion as conflicting with Roman Catholic teaching, and stating that Daschle should no longer identify himself as a Catholic.<ref name=weeklystandard>{{cite web |last1=Bottum |first1=J. |title=Tom Daschle's Duty to Be Morally Coherent |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/3814 |website=The Weekly Standard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305140313/http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/3814 |archivedate=5 March 2016}}</ref>

===2004 Senate election===
{{Main|United States Senate election in South Dakota, 2004}}
In the 2004 Senate election, [[John Thune]] defeated Daschle by 4,508 votes, 50.5% to 49.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004/2004Stat.htm#41 |title=Statistics of the Presidential and Congressional Election of November 2, 2004|publisher=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> It was the first time that a Senate party leader had lost a bid for reelection since 1952 when [[Barry Goldwater]] defeated [[Ernest McFarland]] in Arizona.<ref>{{cite book|title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=Barone|first2=Chuck |last1=McCutcheon|first1=Michael|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2013}}</ref>  Senate Majority Leader [[Bill Frist]] visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that a leader of one party would not actively campaign for the defeat of the other.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Throughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President George W. Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the "chief obstructionist" of Bush's agenda and charged him with using [[filibuster]]s to block confirmation of several of Bush's nominees. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the war. In a nationally televised debate on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Thune accused Daschle of "emboldening the enemy" in his skepticism of the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg|title=Daschle Defends Iraq Remarks|work=New York Times|date=September 20, 2004|accessdate=November 25, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/20/politics/20dakota.html}}</ref>

When the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7% in January and February. By May, his lead was just 2% and summer polls showed a varying number of trends: Daschle or Thune led by no more than 2%, but some polls showed a tie. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2–5% while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49–49 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Post-Senate career==


===Career and public service===
Following his reelection defeat, Daschle took a position with the [[lobbying]] arm of the [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K&nbsp;Street]] law firm [[Alston & Bird]]. Because he was prohibited [[Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995|by law]] from lobbying for one year after leaving the Senate,<ref>''See'' {{usc|18|207}}; this one-year limit was increased in 2007 to two years by [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ081.110 Public Law 110-81], but the higher limit did not apply to Daschle.</ref> he instead worked as a "special policy adviser" for the firm.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4555416 |title=Talk of the Nation: Tom Daschle on His New Role as Lobbyist |publisher=NPR |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Alston">Alston</ref>

Daschle was also a senior fellow at the [[Center for American Progress]]. In addition, he served as National Co-Chair of [[ONE Campaign|ONE]] Vote ‘08, along with former senator [[Bill Frist]].  He and former senators [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], Bob Dole, and [[Howard Baker]] formed the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] (BPC), dedicated to finding bipartisan solutions for policy disputes.<ref name = senatebio/> Daschle is also a co-chair of BPC's Health Project.

In May 2005, [[South Dakota State University]], Daschle's alma mater, conferred upon him an honorary doctorate for public service.<ref name="HonorDegree">{{cite web|title=HONORARY DEGREES GIVEN BY SDSU SINCE 1923|url=http://www.sdstate.edu/academic/faculty/facultyawards/honorarydegree/upload/List-of-HONORARY-DEGREES.pdf|website=South Dakota State University|format=PDF|date=2005}}</ref> In May 2011, Daschle was further honored with an honorary [[Doctorate of Humane Letters]] by [[Northern State University]] in his hometown of Aberdeen.

In late September 2005, Daschle caught the attention of the media by reactivating his [[political action committee]], changing its name from DASHPAC to New Leadership for America PAC and procuring a speaking slot at the [[Iowa]] Democratic Party's annual [[Jefferson-Jackson Day]] dinner. He continued to keep a relatively high-profile among Democratic interest groups. These moves were interpreted by the media as an exploration of a potential [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential candidacy]]. On December 2, 2006, he announced he would not run for president in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | last =Belanger | first =Matt | title =Daschle Will Not Seek Presidency | publisher =Keloland TV | date =December 2, 2006 | url =http://www.keloland.com/News/NewsDetail6371.cfm?Id=0,52869 | accessdate =November 6, 2007 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071021152249/http://keloland.com/News/NewsDetail6371.cfm?Id=0,52869 | archivedate =October 21, 2007 | df =mdy-all }}</ref>

In an appearance on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' on February 12, 2006, former senator Daschle endorsed a controversial warrantless [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|surveillance program]] conducted by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), explaining that he had been briefed on the program while he was the Democratic leader in the Senate.<ref>{{cite news | last =Pincus | first =Walter | title =Spying Necessary, Democrats Say | newspaper =The Washington Post | date =February 13, 2006 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/12/AR2006021201174.html | accessdate =November 6, 2007 }}</ref>

In addition, Senator Daschle is a member of the board of trustees for the [[Richard C.

Tom Daschle is a Member of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

Daschle also served as vice chair of the board of directors of [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ndi.org/board-directors |website=NDI.org|accessdate=16 October 2014 |title=NDI-Board of Directors|publisher=National Democratic Institute}}</ref>

Daschle is the co-chair of the national advisory board at the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD). The institute was created at the University of Arizona after the tragic shooting of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, that killed 6 people and wounded 13 others.

In 2019, Daschle was named to the advisory board of Northern Swan Holdings Inc., a [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] investment firm.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fugleberg |first1=Jeremy |title=Former Sen.

===Obama campaign===

On February 21, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] reported that Daschle, after ruling out a presidential bid of his own in December 2006, had thrown his support behind Senator [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]] for the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], saying that Obama "personifies the future of Democratic leadership in our country."<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | vauthors = | title =Ex-Senate leader Daschle endorses Obama | work = | publisher =NBC News | date =February 21, 2007 | url =http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17263273 | doi = | accessdate =November 6, 2007 }}</ref>

In January 2005, having suggested that Obama take on some of his staffers, Daschle exited the Senate just as Obama entered.<ref name="multiple" /> These included Daschle's outgoing chief-of-staff [[Pete Rouse]] who helped to create a two-year plan in the Senate that would fast-track Obama for the presidential nomination. Daschle himself told Obama in 2006 that "windows of opportunity for running for the presidency close quickly. And that he should not assume, if he passes up this window, that there will be another."<ref name="multiple">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/choice2008/interviews/daschle.html FRONTLINE Interview: The Choice 2008] Retrieved February 5, 2009</ref>

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Daschle served as a key advisor to Obama and one of the national co-chairs for Obama's campaign.<ref>Margaret Talev, "[https://archive.today/20130129021234/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/56176.html Ex-Senate leader Daschle to serve as HHS head]", ''McClatchy Newspapers'', November 19, 2008.</ref> On June 3, 2008, Obama lost to Hillary Clinton in the [[South Dakota Democratic primary, 2008|Democratic primary]] in Daschle's home state of South Dakota, although that night Obama clinched his [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|party's nomination]] anyway.

Two days later, sources indicated Daschle "is interested in [[universal health care]] and might relish serving as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|HHS secretary]]."<ref name=nationaljournalhhs>{{cite web | last = McPike | first = Erin | title = Daschle Warm To Obama Health Role | publisher = NationalJournal.com | date = June 5, 2008 | url = http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressdaily/cda_20080605_5814.php | accessdate = June 7, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080608061311/http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressdaily/cda_20080605_5814.php | archivedate = June 8, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In the general election campaign, Daschle continued to consult Obama, campaign for him across [[swing state]]s, and advise his campaign organization until Obama was ultimately elected the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|44th President of the United States]] on November 4, 2008.

===Obama administration nomination===

His selection was announced at a news conference with Obama on December 11, 2008.<ref name = PearNYT/>

Some organizations objected to Daschle's selection, arguing that his work at Alston & Bird was tantamount to lobbying and therefore his selection violated Obama's promise to keep special interests out of the White House. According to Ellen Miller, executive director of the [[Sunlight Foundation]], Daschle technically complies with the transition rules against lobbyists but "many power brokers never register as lobbyists, but they are every bit as powerful."<ref name=usatodaynomination>Fredreka Schouten and David Jackson, "[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-11-19-daschle-health-team_N.htm Obama selects Tom Daschle as health chief]", ''[[USA Today]]'', November 20, 2008.</ref> [[Stephanie Cutter]], a spokeswoman for the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama transition]], responded that Daschle's work "does not represent a bar to his service in the transition" since "he was not a lobbyist, and he will recuse himself from any work that presents a conflict of interest."<ref name=usatodaynomination /> Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, praised Daschle on his nomination to Secretary of Health and Human Services for his "deep commitment to securing high-quality, affordable health care for everyone in our nation."<ref>{{cite news|title=Daschle Accepts Health Post in Obama's Cabinet|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/archive/Obama-to-Tap-Tom-Daschle-As-.html|accessdate=October 8, 2014|publisher=NBC Washington|date=November 19, 2008}}</ref>

====Withdrawal====
On January 30, 2009, it was reported that Daschle's friendship and business partnership with businessman [[Leo Hindery]] could cause problems for Daschle's Senate confirmation. Daschle has been a paid consultant and advisor to Hindery's [[InterMedia Partners]] since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a [[limousine]] and [[chauffeur]]. Daschle reportedly did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. A spokeswoman for Daschle said that he "simply and probably naively" considered the use of the car and driver "a generous offer" from Hindery, "a longtime friend."<ref name=washingtonposttaxes /><ref name=cnntaxes /><ref name=abctaxes>[[Jake Tapper]], "[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/bumps-in-the-ro.html Bumps in the Road: Obama's HHS Secretary Nominee Faces Tax Questions Over Car and Driver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718105724/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/bumps-in-the-ro.html |date=July 18, 2011 }}," [[ABC News]], January 30, 2009.

Daschle reportedly also did not pay taxes on an additional $83,333 that he earned as a consultant to [[InterMedia Partners]] in 2007; this was discovered by Senator Daschle's accountant in December 2008.<ref name=wsjtaxes2 /> According to [[ABC News]], Daschle also took tax deductions for $14,963 in donations that he made between 2005 and 2007 to charitable organizations that did not meet the requirements for being tax deductible.<ref>[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/01/more-daschle-ta.html More Daschle Tax Issues], ABC News, January 30, 2009</ref>

===Health policy===
Daschle co-wrote the 2008 book ''Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis'' {{ISBN|9780312383015}}.<ref>Tom Daschle, Scott S. Greenberger, and Jeanne M. Lambrew, ''Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis'', Thomas Dunne, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-312-38301-5}}</ref> He and his co-authors point out that "most of the world’s highest-ranking health-care systems employ some kind of [[Single payer|'single-payer']] strategy – that is, the government, directly or through insurers, is responsible for paying doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers." They argue that a single-payer approach is simple, equitable, provides everyone with the same benefits, and saves billions of dollars through economies of scale and simplified administration. They concede that implementing a single-payer system in the United States would be "politically problematic" even though some polls show more satisfaction with the single-payer [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] system than [[Private Option|private insurance]].<ref name=davis>Karen Davis, Cathy Schoen, Michelle Doty, and Katie Tenney "[http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w2.311v1/DC1 Medicare Versus Private Insurance: Rhetoric And Reality]", ''Health Affairs'', October 9, 2002. (Accessed June 18, 2009.)</ref>

A key element of the single-payer plan that Daschle and his co-authors propose in the book is a new "Federal Health Board" that would establish the framework and fill in the details. The board would somehow be simultaneously "insulated from political pressure" and "accountable to elected officials and the American people." The board would "promote 'high-value' medical care by recommending coverage of those drugs and procedures backed by solid evidence."<ref>{{cite web|last=McCanne |first=Don |url=http://www.pnhp.org/blog/2008/12/08/sen-daschles-critical/ |title=Sen.

One of Daschle's co-authors, [[Jeanne Lambrew]], had been slated before his withdrawal to serve as his deputy in the White House Office of Health Reform.<ref name=capretta />

Daschle also served as a panelist on the [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], a body that recommended changes to U.S. policy to strengthen national biodefense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biodefensestudy.org/|title=Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense|website=www.biodefensestudy.org|access-date=2017-03-07}}</ref> In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former senator Joe Lieberman and former governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, ''The National Blueprint for Biodefense'', proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.

===9/11===
Daschle claims he was asked by vice president [[Dick Cheney]] "not to investigate" the events of [[9/11]].<ref>''[[Meet the Press]]'', May 2002, Host Tim Russert, Guest Dick Cheney</ref>

He told reporters, "the vice president expressed the concern that a review of what happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from the effort in the war on terrorism. I acknowledged that concern, and it is for that reason that the Intelligence Committee is going to begin this effort, trying to limit the scope and the overall review of what happened. But clearly, I think the American people are entitled to know what happened and why." <ref name="TerrorProbe">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/inv.terror.probe/|title=Bush asks Daschle to limit Sept. 11 probes|date=29 January 2002|website=CNN|quote=Tuesday's discussion followed a rare call to Daschle from Vice President Dick Cheney last Friday to make the same request.}}</ref>

==Personal life==
