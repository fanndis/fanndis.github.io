==History==
In the 1990s, [[Bernard Arnault]] had the idea to create a group of luxury brands.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRZvHxUJUoE</ref>

''[[The Dapifer]]'' reported that LVMH would gain ownership of Christian Dior haute couture, leather, both men's and women's ready-to-wear, and footwear lines.<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 April 2017 |title=LVMH Subsidiaries, Brands and the $13 Billion Christian Dior Buy Out - The Dapifer |work=THE DAPIFER |url=https://www.thedapifer.com/lvmh-subsidiaries-chrisitan-dior-company/ |access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref>

In January 2018, LVMH announced record sales of 42.6 billion Euros in 2017, up 13% over the previous year, as all divisions turned in strong performances. In the same year, the net profit increased 29%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Luxury Group LVMH Cautious for 2018 Despite Record Profits |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2018-01-25/luxury-group-lvmh-cautious-for-2018-despite-record-profits}}</ref>

Co-founder Alain Chevalier died 1 November 2018, aged 87.<ref>https://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/alain-chevalier-co-founder-of-lvmh-dies-at-1202897939/</ref>

Arnault's successful integration of various famous [[aspirational brand]]s into a single group has inspired other luxury companies to do the same. Thus, the French conglomerate [[Kering]] and the Swiss-based [[Richemont]] have also created extended portfolios of luxury brands. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frankfurt Stock Exchange |url=http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208093448/http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro%20stoxx%2050%20EU0009658145/constituents |archive-date=8 February 2019 |access-date=22 October 2015}}</ref>

In November 2019, LVMH planned to acquire [[Tiffany & Co.]] for approximately US $16.2 billion.

In mid-September 2020, a reliable source told [[Forbes (magazine)]] that the reason for Arnault's decision to cancel the Tiffany purchase was purely financial: because Tiffany was paying millions in dividends to shareholders despite a financial loss of US$32 million during the pandemic. Some US$70 million had already been paid out by Tiffany, with an additional US$70 million scheduled to be paid in November 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Billionaire Arnault On The Offensive After Tiffany Pays Out $140 Million Pandemic Dividends Despite $32 Million In Losses |url=https://www.24x7news.live/grandmaster%E2%80%89bernard-arnault-looks-to-the-tiffany-endgame/ |access-date=16 September 2020 |website=Forbes}}</ref> LVMH filed a counterclaim against the court action commenced by Tiffany; a statement issued by LMVH blamed Tiffany's mismanagement during the pandemic and claimed that it was 'burning cash and reporting losses'". <ref>{{Cite web |date=29 September 2020 |title=LVMH files countersuit against Tiffany over US$14.5B deal |url=https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/business/2020/9/29/1_5124559.html |access-date=1 October 2020 |publisher=CTV News}}</ref>  In late October 2020 however, Tiffany and LVMH agreed to the original takeover plan, though at a slightly reduced price of nearly $16 billion, a minor reduction of 2.6% from the aforementioned deal. The new deal reduced the amount paid per share by LVMH from the original price of $135 to $131.50.<ref>{{Cite web|title=LVMH agrees to buy Tiffany for lower price|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/exxon-to-cut-global-workforce-by-15-percent-including-1900-us-jobs/2020/10/29/efbc31e6-19da-11eb-aeec-b93bcc29a01b_story.html|website=The Washington Post}}</ref>

LVMH has the largest market capitalization in France, and now in the [[Eurozone|Euro zone]], with a record of 203 billion euros ($220 billion) on 17 January 2020, as per [[Bloomberg News]].
