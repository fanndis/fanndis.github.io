The ruling party since [[1959 Singaporean general election|1959]], it was founded in 1954 as a pro-independence political party descended from an earlier student organization, and it has gone on to dominate the political system of the nation. The PAP has [[Dominant-party system|dominated]] Singapore's politics and has been credited as being central to the city-state's rapid political, social and economic development.<ref>"A History of Singapore: Lion City, Asian Tiger". [[Discovery Channel]]. 2005.</ref>

Positioned on the centre-right of Singaporean politics, the People Action Party is ideologically [[Conservatism|conservative]]. The party has generally adopted [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic policies]]—favouring [[free market]] economics but has at times engaged in [[Economic interventionism|state interventionism]]. On social policy, it supports [[civic nationalism]] and [[Singaporean communitarianism|communitarianism]] with a [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] approach. In foreign policy, it favours a strong military capability, serving as the guarantor of the country's independence due to its strategic position as a [[city-state]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/285586/1/.html|title=SAF remains final guarantor of Singapore's independence|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|location=Singapore|date=1 July 2007|access-date=19 February 2011|archive-date=16 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516092109/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/285586/1/.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="MindefApr2005">{{cite press release|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2005/apr/21apr05_nr2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024173928/http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2005/apr/21apr05_nr2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 October 2007|title=Lunch Talk on "Defending Singapore: Strategies for a Small State" by Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean|publisher=Ministry of Defence|date=21 April 2005|access-date=19 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Lee Kuan Yew]], [[Toh Chin Chye]] and [[Goh Keng Swee]] were involved in the [[Malayan Forum]], a London-based student activist group that was against [[Federation of Malaya|colonial rule in Malaya]] in the 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwohR6juj-MC&dq|title=Goh Keng Swee: A Public Career Remembered|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|last2=Guan|first2=Chong|last3=Kwa|first3=Chong Guan|date=2012|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814291392|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQ-JAAAAQBAJ&dq|title=Lee Kuan Yew: The Crucial Years|last=Josey|first=Alex|date=15 February 2013|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|isbn=9789814435499|language=en}}</ref> Upon returning to Singapore, the group met regularly to discuss approaches to attain independence in Malayan territories and started looking for like-minded individuals to start a political party.

===Formation===
The PAP was officially registered as a political party on 21 November 1954. [[Convenors]] of the party include a group of trade unionists, lawyers and journalists such as Lee Kuan Yew, [[Abdul Samad Ismail]], [[Toh Chin Chye]], [[Devan Nair]], S. Rajaratnam, Chan Chiaw Thor, Fong Swee Suan, Tann Wee Keng and Tann Wee Tiong.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19541024-1.2.55|title=Nine Form New Political Party in Singapore|date=24 October 1954|work=The Straits Times|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-date=17 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817151523/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19541024-1.2.55|url-status=live}}</ref> The political party was led by Lee Kuan Yew as its secretary-general, with Toh Chin Chye as its founding chairman.

The PAP first contested the [[1955 Singaporean general election|1955 general election]] in which 25 of 32 seats in the legislature were up for election. In this election, the PAP's four candidates gained much support from the trade union members and student groups such as the [[University Socialist Club]], who canvassed for them.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Men in White: The Untold Story of Singapore's Ruling Political Party..

In April 1956, Lim and Lee represented the PAP at the [[Merdeka|London Constitutional Talks]] along with Chief Minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]] which ended in failure as the British declined to grant Singapore [[Self-governance of Singapore|internal self-government]]. On 7 June 1956, Marshall, disappointed with the constitutional talks, stepped down as Chief Minister as he had pledged to do so earlier if self-governance was not achieved. He was replaced by [[Lim Yew Hock]], another Labour Front member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1462_2009-02-18.html|title=Lim Chin Siong|author=Wong Hongyi|year=2009|work=Singapore Infopedia|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728022721/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1462_2009-02-18.html|archive-date=28 July 2009}}</ref> Lim pursued a largely [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign and managed to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government. The [[Constitution of Singapore]] was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly.

PAP and left-wing members who were [[communists]] were criticised for inciting riots in the mid-1950s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19550922-1.2.2|title=Mr. Lim Sits on The Fence|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-date=18 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818013755/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19550922-1.2.2|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19550517-1.2.2|title=The Guilty Men - By Goode|date=17 May 1955|work=The Straits Times|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-date=18 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818012524/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19550517-1.2.2|url-status=live}}</ref> Lim Chin Siong, Fong Swee Suan and [[Devan Nair]] as well as several unionists were detained by the police after the [[Chinese middle schools riots]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19561028-1.2.5|title=Who's Who - The Top 15 Names|date=28 October 1956|work=The Straits Times|access-date=17 August 2017|archive-date=18 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818013327/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19561028-1.2.5|url-status=live}}</ref> Lim Chin Siong was placed under solitary confinement for close to a year, away from his other PAP colleagues, as they were placed in the Medium Security Prison (MSP) instead.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Ministry of Finance|date=August 2015|title=INCOME GROWTH, INEQUALITY AND MOBILITY TRENDS IN SINGAPORE|url=https://app.mof.gov.sg/Portals/0/Feature%20Articles/Income%20Growth,%20Distribution%20and%20Mobility%20Trends%20in%20Singapore.pdf|journal=Ministry of Finance Occasional Paper|access-date=14 April 2016|archive-date=7 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407020634/https://app.mof.gov.sg/Portals/0/Feature%20Articles/Income%20Growth,%20Distribution%20and%20Mobility%20Trends%20in%20Singapore.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> 

The number of PAP members imprisoned rose in August 1957, when PAP members from the trade unions (viewed as "communist or pro-communist") won half the seats in the CEC. The "moderate" CEC members, including Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and others, refused to take their appointments in the CEC. Yew Hock's government again made a sweeping round of arrests, imprisoning all the "communist" members, before the "moderates" re-assumed their office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-pap-man-recounts-1957-kelong-meeting|title=Ex-PAP man recounts 1957 'kelong meeting'|last=Leong|first=Weng Kam|date=10 June 2016|publisher=The Straits Times|access-date=19 August 2016|archive-date=21 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921184554/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-pap-man-recounts-1957-kelong-meeting|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following this, the PAP decided to re-assert ties with the labour faction of Singapore in the hope of securing the votes of working-class Chinese Singaporeans, many of whom were supporters of the jailed unionists. Lee Kuan Yew convinced the incarcerated union leaders to sign documents to state their support for the party and its policies, promising to release the jailed members of the PAP when the party came to power in the next elections.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buuiCgAAQBAJ|title=Leaders of Singapore|last=Chew|first=Melanie|date=29 July 2015|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814719452|pages=80|language=en}}</ref> Ex-[[Barisan Sosialis]] member Tan Jing Quee claims that Lee was secretly in collusion with the British to stop Lim Chin Siong and the labour supporters from attaining power because of their huge popularity.

Although the "Communist" faction had been frozen out of ever taking over the PAP, other problems had begun to arise internally. [[Ong Eng Guan]], the former Mayor of the City Council after PAP's victory in the [[1957 Singapore City Council election]], presented a set of "16 Resolutions" to revisit some issues previously explored by Chin Siong's faction of the PAP: abolishing the PPSO, revising the Constitution, and changing the method of selecting cadre members.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/economicoriginsd00acem|url-access=limited|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|publisher=Cambridge Press|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/economicoriginsd00acem/page/n24 8]–10}}</ref>{{rp|82}}

Although Ong's 16 Resolutions originated from the left-wing faction led by Lim Chin Siong, that faction had only reluctantly asked the PAP leadership to clarify its position on them,<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Thum|first=Ping Tjin|date=Nov 2013|title='The Fundamental Issue is Anti-colonialism, Not Merger': Singapore's "Progressive Left", Operation Coldstore, and the Creation of Malaysia|journal=ARI Working Paper|issue=211}}</ref> as they still thought that the party with Lee Kuan Yew at the helm was a better alternative than Ong who was regarded as mercurial and a tyrant.<ref name=":1" /> However, Lee took the stance taken by the left-wing PAP members as a lack of confidence in his leadership. This issue caused a rift between the "moderate" PAP members (led by Lee) and the "left-wing" faction (led by Lim).

Ong was then expelled, and he resigned his Assembly seat to challenge the government to a by-election in Hong Lim in April 1961, where he won 73.3% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://singapore-elections.com/by-election/1961-4/hong-lim.html|title=Singapore Legislative Assembly By-Election April 1961 > Hong Lim|website=singapore-elections.com|access-date=19 August 2016|archive-date=1 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601144636/http://singapore-elections.com/by-election/1961-4/hong-lim.html|url-status=live}}</ref> This was despite the fact that Lee Kuan Yew had made a secret alliance with [[Fong Chong Pik]], the leader of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), to get the CPM cadres to support the PAP in the by-election.<ref name=":6" />

====Barisan Sosialis====
The breakaway group of members formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]] with Lim Chin Siong as Secretary-General.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fajar Generation: The University Socialist Club and the Politics of Postwar Malaya and Singapore|last1=Poh|first1=Soo K|last2=Tan|first2=Jing Quee|last3=Koh|first3=Kay Yew|publisher=SIRD|year=2010|isbn=9789833782864|location=Petaling Jaya|pages=59–60}}</ref> Aside from the Chinese union leaders, lawyers Thampoe Thamby Rajah and Tann Wee Tiong,<ref>{{cite news|title=Lawyers Rajah, Tann join Barisan Socialis|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19610815-1.2.49|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=15 August 1961|access-date=18 September 2017|archive-date=30 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830151144/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19610815-1.2.49|url-status=live}}</ref> several members from the University Socialist Club such as James Puthucheary and [[Poh Soo Kai]] joined the party.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The University Socialist Club and the Contest for Malaya: Tangled Strands of Modernity|last=Loh|first=Kah S|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-9089644091|location=Amsterdam|pages=24–25}}</ref> 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.

===Merger years 1963-1965===
{{see also|PAP-UMNO relations}}
After gaining independence from Britain, Singapore joined the federation of Malaysia in 1963. Although the PAP was the ruling party in the state of Singapore, the PAP functioned as an opposition party at the federal level in the larger Malaysian political landscape. At that time and until the [[2018 Malaysian general election|2018 general election]], the federal government in Kuala Lumpur was controlled by a coalition led by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO). However, the prospect that the PAP might rule Malaysia agitated UMNO. The PAP's decision to contest federal parliamentary seats outside Singapore and the UMNO decision to contest seats within Singapore breached an unspoken agreement to respect each other's spheres of influence and aggravated [[PAP–UMNO relations]]. The [[clash of personalities]] between PAP leader Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysian [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] resulted in a crisis and led to Rahman forcing Singapore to leave Malaysia on 9 August 1965. Upon independence, the nascent People's Action Party of Malaya, which had been registered in Malaysia on 10 March 1964, had its registration cancelled on 9 September 1965, just a month after Singapore's exit. Those with the now non-existent party applied to register People's Action Party, Malaya which was again rejected by the Malaysian government, before settling with the [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]].

===Post-independence, 1965 to present===
The PAP has held an overwhelming majority of seats in the [[Parliament of Singapore]] since 1966, when the opposition Barisan Sosialis (Socialist Front) resigned from Parliament after winning 13 seats following the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 general election]] which took place months after a number of their leaders had been arrested in [[Operation Coldstore]] based on false charges of being communists.<ref name="comet" /> It subsequently achieved a monopoly in an expanding parliament (winning every parliamentary seat) for the next four elections ([[1968 Singaporean general election|1968]], [[1972 Singaporean general election|1972]], [[1976 Singaporean general election|1976]] and [[1980 Singaporean general election|1980]]). Opposition parties returned to the legislature at a [[1981 Anson by-election|1981 by-election]]. The [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 general election]] was the first election in 21 years in which opposition parties won seats. From then until [[2006 Singaporean general election|2006]], the PAP faced four opposition MPs at most.  Opposition parties did not win more than four parliamentary seats from 1984 until [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011]] when the [[The Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] won six seats and took away a [[Group Representation Constituency]] (GRC) for the first time for any opposition party. Even so, it still holds a [[supermajority]] in the legislature, to the point that Singapore is effectively a [[dominant party system]].

== Organisation ==
[[File:People's Action Party Headquarters.JPG|thumb|240px|People's Action Party headquarters in New Upper Changi Road]]
In its initial years, it adopted a traditionalist [[Leninism|Leninist]] party organisation, together with a vanguard cadre from its [[labour movement|labour]]-leaning faction in 1958, the PAP Executive later expelled the leftist faction, bringing the ideological basis of the party into the centre and later in the 1960s moving further to the right. In the beginning, there were about 500 so-called temporary [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]] appointed,<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane K. Mauzy and R.S. Milne |year=2002 |title=Singapore Politics Under the People's Action Party |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporepolitic00mauz |url-access=limited |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-24653-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/singaporepolitic00mauz/page/n59 41]}}</ref> but the current number of cadres is unknown and the register of cadres is kept confidential. In 1988, [[Wong Kan Seng]] revealed that there were more than 1,000 cadres. Cadre members have the right to attend party conferences and to vote for and elect and to be elected to the [[Central Executive Committee (PAP)|Central Executive Committee]] (CEC), the pinnacle of party leaders. To become a cadre, a party member is first nominated by the MP in his or her branch. The candidate then undergoes three sessions of interviews, each with four or five ministers or MPs and the appointment is then made by the CEC. About 100 candidates are nominated each year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/80404st1.htm|title=The PAP cadre system|date=4 April 1998|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|author=Koh Buck Song|access-date=10 January 2006|archive-date=8 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108023347/http://www.singapore-window.org/80404st1.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Central Executive Committee and Secretary-General ===
Political power in the party is concentrated in the CEC, led by the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General of the PAP is the leader of the party. Because of the PAP electoral victories in every general election since 1959, the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] has been by convention the Secretary-General of the PAP since 1959. Most CEC members are also cabinet members. From 1957 onwards, the rules laid down that the outgoing CEC should recommend a list of candidates from which the cadre members can then vote for the next CEC. This has been changed recently so that the CEC nominates eight members and the party caucus selects the remaining ten.

Historically, the position of Secretary-General was not considered for the post of Prime Minister, but rather the Central Executive Committee held an election to choose the Prime Minister. There was a contest between PAP Secretary-General Lee Kuan Yew and PAP treasurer [[Ong Eng Guan]]. Lee won the leadership and inaugurated the first Prime Minister of Singapore.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lee Kuan Yew elected as Prime Minister of Singapore|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20090910-166931.html|newspaper=AsiaOne|access-date=16 December 2012|date=10 September 2009|archive-date=14 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214001920/http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20090910-166931.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since that election, there is a tradition that Singapore's Prime Minister is the Secretary-General of the winning party with the majority of the seats.

The next lower level committee is the HQ Executive Committee (HQ Ex-Co) which performs the party's administration and oversees 12 sub-committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pap.org.sg/abt_leadership_hqexe.shtml|title=About the Leadership HQ Executive Committee|publisher=People's Action Party|access-date=10 May 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060506032823/http://www.pap.org.sg/abt_leadership_hqexe.shtml  |archive-date = 6 May 2006}}</ref> The sub-committees are the following:

== Ideology ==
{{Conservatism sidebar}}
Since the early years of the PAP's rule, the idea of survival has been a central theme of [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]]. According to Diane Mauzy and R. S. Milne, most analysts of Singapore have discerned four major [[ideologies]] of the PAP, namely [[Realpolitik|pragmatism]], [[meritocracy]], [[multiracialism]] and [[Asian values]] or [[communitarianism]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Christopher Tremewan|year=1996|title=The Political Economy of Social Control in Singapore (St. Anthony's Series)|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-15865-1|page=105  }}</ref> In January 1991, the PAP introduced the White Paper on Shared Values which tried to create a national ideology and institutionalise Asian values. The party also says it has rejected what it considers Western-style [[liberal democracy]] despite the presence of many aspects of liberal democracy in Singapore's public policy such as the recognition of democratic institutions. Professor Hussin Mutalib opines that for [[Lee Kuan Yew]] "Singapore would be better off without liberal democracy".<ref>{{cite book|author=Hussin Mutalib|year=2004|title=Parties and Politics. A Study of Opposition Parties and the PAP in Singapore|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Adademic|isbn=981-210-408-9|page=20}}</ref>

The party [[Macroeconomics|economic ideology]] has always accepted the need for some [[social welfare|welfare spending]], pragmatic [[economic interventionism]] and general [[Keynesian]] [[economic policy]]. However, [[free-market]] policies have been popular since the 1980s as part of the wider implementation of a [[meritocracy]] in [[civil society]] and Singapore frequently ranks extremely highly on indices of [[economic freedom]] published by [[Liberal theory of economics|economically liberal]] organisations such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Lee Kuan Yew also said in 1992: "Through [[Hong Kong]] watching, I concluded that state welfare and subsidies blunted the individual's drive to succeed. I watched with amazement the ease with which Hong Kong workers adjusted their salaries upwards in boom times and downwards in recessions. I resolved to reverse course on the welfare policies which my party had inherited or copied from [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] policies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/speeches/speeches-99/optimism_for_the_new-millennium.doc.htm|title=Optimism for the New Millennium.|date=9 December 1999|access-date=10 May 2006|publisher=Rotary Club of Wellington North|author=Roger Kerr |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060307184005/http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/speeches/speeches-99/optimism_for_the_new-millennium.doc.htm  |archive-date = 7 March 2006}}</ref>

The party is deeply suspicious of communist political ideologies despite a brief joint alliance with the pro-labour co-founders of the PAP, who were accused of being communists, against [[colonialism]] in Singapore during the party's early years. In 2015, the party was seen by some observers to have adopted a [[Centre-left politics|left-of-centre]] tack in certain areas in order to remain electorally dominant.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Azhar|first1=Saeed|last2=Chalmers|first2=John|title=Singapore's rulers hope a nudge to the left will keep voters loyal|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-election/singapores-rulers-hope-a-nudge-to-the-left-will-keep-voters-loyal-idUSKCN0R60XS20150906|access-date=21 November 2017|work=[[Reuters]]|date=6 September 2015|archive-date=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034259/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-election/singapores-rulers-hope-a-nudge-to-the-left-will-keep-voters-loyal-idUSKCN0R60XS20150906|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[socialism]] practised by the PAP during its first few decades in power was of a pragmatic kind as characterised by the party's rejection of [[nationalisation]]. According to [[Chan Heng Chee]], by the late 1970s the intellectual credo of the government rested explicitly upon a philosophy of self-reliance, similar to the [[rugged individualism]] of the [[Anglo-Saxon model|American brand of capitalism]]. Despite this, the PAP still claimed to be a [[socialist party]], pointing out its regulation of the private sector, activist intervention in the economy and social policies as evidence of this.<ref>Driven by Growth: Political Change in the Asia-Pacific Region edited by James W. Morley</ref> In 1976, the PAP resigned from the [[Socialist International]] after the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Dutch Labour Party]] had proposed to expel the party,<ref>{{cite web|title=PAP bows out of Socialist International |url=http://www.wp.org.sg/news/news_articles/pap_socialistint.htm |publisher=[[Workers' Party of Singapore]] |date=June 1976 |access-date=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917160621/http://www.wp.org.sg/news/news_articles/pap_socialistint.htm |archive-date=17 September 2007 }}</ref> accusing it of suppressing freedom of speech.

The PAP symbol (which is red and blue on white) stands for action inside interracial unity. PAP members at party rallies have sometimes worn a uniform of white shirts and white trousers which symbolises purity of the party's ideologies of the government. The party also reminded that once the uniform is sullied, it would be difficult to make clean again.

At an Institute of Policy Studies dialogue held on 2 July 2015, Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] spoke about the need to maintain a Jeffersonian [[Meritocracy|natural aristocracy]] in the system to instill a culture of respect and to avoid [[anarchy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/china/2015/09/03/unnatural-aristocrats|title=Unnatural aristocrats|work=The Economist|access-date=28 July 2018|language=en|archive-date=28 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728201035/https://www.economist.com/china/2015/09/03/unnatural-aristocrats|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Kenneth Paul Tan, the PAP government has been able to amend the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] without much obstruction thanks to an overwhelming majority in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]], introducing multi-member constituencies, unelected parliamentary memberships and other institutional changes that have in effect strengthened the government's dominance and control of Parliament.<ref name="Tan2012">{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date= 2012|volume=42|issue=1|pages=67–92|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644|s2cid=56236985}}</ref> It has also propagated the idea that pragmatism and economic considerations triumph over accountability, transparency and checks and balances.<ref name="Tan2007">{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Singapore's National Day Rally speech: A site of ideological negotiation|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=2007|volume=37|issue=3|pages=292–308|doi=10.1080/00472330701408635|s2cid=145405958}}</ref> By drawing from a notion of [[Confucian values]] and [[Asian culture]] to construct ideological bulwarks like [[Asian values|Asian democracy]], the PAP government has been able to justify its liberal democracy deficit and authoritarian means.<ref name="Tan2012" />

== Leadership ==
For many years, the party was led by former PAP Secretary-General [[Lee Kuan Yew]], who was [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] from 1959 to 1990. Lee handed over the positions of Secretary-General and Prime Minister to [[Goh Chok Tong]] in 1991. The current Secretary-General of the PAP and Prime Minister of Singapore is [[Lee Hsien Loong]], son of Lee Kuan Yew, who succeeded Goh Chok Tong on 12 August 2004.

The first chairman of the PAP was Toh Chin Chye. The current chairman of the PAP is [[Gan Kim Yong]].<ref>{{cite web|title=PAP's new CEC|url=https://www.pap.org.sg/pap-new-cec|publisher=People's Action Party|access-date=23 November 2018|archive-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429092816/https://www.pap.org.sg/pap-new-cec|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Internet presence ==
Since 1995, the youth wing of the PAP has had an internet presence "posting corrections to 'misinformation' about Singaporean politics or culture".<ref name="Mickey">{{cite news|title=Mickey Unbound|url=https://www.wired.com/1995/07/updata-41/|access-date=6 November 2017|work=Wired|date=1 July 1995|archive-date=10 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210032937/https://www.wired.com/1995/07/updata-41/|url-status=live}}</ref> In February 2007, it was reported by ''[[The Straits Times]]'' that the PAP's new media committee chaired by minister [[Ng Eng Hen]] had initiated an effort to counter critics anonymously on the [[Internet]] "as it was necessary for the PAP to have a voice on cyberspace".<ref name=":3">{{cite news | title = PAP moves to counter criticism of party, Govt in cyberspace | date = 3 February 2007 | author = Li Xueying |location = Singapore | newspaper= The Straits Times}}</ref> The initiative was divided by two sub-committees, one of which was in charge of strategising the campaigns and is co-headed by minister [[Lui Tuck Yew]] and MP Zaqy Mohamad. The other sub-committee new media capabilities group led by MPs Baey Yam Keng and Josephine Teo executed the strategies. The initiative was set up after the [[2006 Singaporean general election|2006 general election]] and also included around 20 IT-savvy PAP activists.<ref name=":3" />
