She has also listed in her early influences the likes of [[John Cale]], [[Otis Redding]], Siouxsie, [[David Byrne]] and [[Lou Reed]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Glass |url=http://www.documentjournal.com/article/john-cale-florence-welch |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205195236/http://www.documentjournal.com/article/john-cale-florence-welch |title=John Cale Muses on Poetry, Sobriety, and Hood By Air with Florence Welch|work=documentjournal.com|date= 30 November 2016|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-date=5 December 2016}}</ref> In a review of ''Ceremonials'', Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Florence and the Machine's style as "dark, robust and romantic", deeming the ballad "Only If for a Night" as a mix of "classic soul and midnight-on-the-moors English art rock".<ref name="rollingstone"/> Welch stated that her lyrics related to [[Renaissance]] artists : "We're dealing with all of the same things they did: love and death, time and pain, heaven and hell".<ref name="LAT">{{cite web |url=http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/01/visionary-vixen.html |title=Visionary Vixen|work=[[Los Angeles Times Magazine]] |publisher=Los Angeles Times Communications |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911182616/http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2011/01/visionary-vixen.html |archive-date=2011-09-11}}</ref>  Welch has used religious imagery in her music and performances, though she has stated, "I'm not a religious person.

Nick Welch, her father, contributed a "rock and roll element to the family mix"; in his twenties, he lived in a [[West End of London|West End]] squat and attended the Squatters' Ball organised by [[Heathcote Williams]] where [[The 101ers]] played regularly.<ref name="q_odell">{{cite journal |last=Odell |first=Mike |date=May 2010 |title=Florence Attacks! |journal=[[Q magazine|Q]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |issue=286 |pages=46–52}}</ref> A self-confessed "frustrated performer", if Nick, as he put it, "nudged Flo in any way, it's only been to listen to the [[Ramones]] rather than [[Green Day]]."<ref name="q_odell"/> Evelyn, Welch's mother, had an equally strong, yet completely different influence on her daughter. A visit to one of her mother's renaissance lectures left teenage Florence deeply impressed. She explained, "I aspire to something like that, but with music. I hope that my music has some of the big themes—sex, death, love, violence—that will still be part of the human story in 200 years' time."<ref name="q_odell"/>

==Personal life==
Welch considers herself an introvert, and is passionate about reading and literature. She has held many events with her fan-run book club, Between Two Books. "It’s a huge generalization to say that all readers are introverts; I'm sure there's a lot of extroverted bookworms out there, but, for me, it's nice to know people of similar inclinations can actually come together in a social way and talk about something that is inherently solitary."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Petrarca |first1=Emilia |title=Florence Welch, Book Club Enthusiast, Gets Candid About Literature |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/florence-welch-book-club-enthusiast-gets-candid-about-the-literature-that-changed-her-life |website=W Magazine |publisher=W Magazine |access-date=13 July 2018}}</ref>

Although many of her songs contain religious themes and elements, Welch has said she does not follow any particular religion. "I went to Catholic school, and the first songs I remember liking were hymns. I find it's nice to mix the mundane and the magical, the irrelevant with the huge themes. Sex, love, death, marriage, guilt—mix that with seeing a huge sky or going for a walk or turning the page of a book. Living is dealing with the everyday and the notion that you're going to die."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gunderson |first1=Edna |title=Florence + High Profile |url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/usa-today-us-edition/20110131/284417030510285 |newspaper=USA Today |access-date=13 July 2018 |date=31 July 2011}}</ref>

Welch has been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression, as well as with alcohol. Many of her songs reflect these issues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Florence Welch reveals struggle with alcoholism, depression |url=https://www.1057thepoint.com/music-news/florence-welch-reveals-struggle-with-alcoholism-depression/ |website=105.7 The Point |publisher=105.7 The Point |access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref>

In 2015, Welch broke her foot after leaping off the stage at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]].<ref name="The Independent 15 April 2015">{{cite news |last= Battersby   |first= Matilda |title= Florence Welch breaks foot leaping offstage at Coachella|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/coouchella-florence-welch-breaks-foot-leaping-offstage-at-coachella-10177186.html| date=15 April 2015|newspaper= [[The Independent]] |location=London| access-date=27 July 2015 }}</ref> She revealed that she used to drink alcohol before every performance, telling ''Billboard'': "I'm quite shy, really—that's probably why I used to drink a lot. But I don't anymore. When I finally took time off to make this new record, I had time to strengthen. And when I was coming back into the fray, I really didn't want to lose that. I thought I could go dive-bomb back into it, but look what happened. I dived into it and literally broke myself."<ref name=":3"/>

In 2016, Welch voiced her support for Remain during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/eu-referendum-brexit-remain-who-do-celebrities-support-david-beckham-jk-rowling-a7094751.html|title=The celebrities that support Brexit (and the ones backing Remain)|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> on that issue. Welch is also a vocal advocate for [[LGBT]] rights, and regularly  waves the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]] at her concerts, particularly during her song "[[Spectrum (Say My Name)]]".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stern |first1=Bradley |title=Florence Welch Holds Rainbow Flag, Leads 'Love Is Love' Chant in Concert |url=http://popcrush.com/florence-the-machine-rainbow-flag-love-chant-how-beautiful-tour-brooklyn/ |website=Pop crush |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rini |first1=Jen |title=Firefly Recap: A Weekend of Love, Awareness, and Music |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2016/06/20/firefly-music-festival-recap/86131342/ |website=USA Today |publisher=USA Today |access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> In 2019, Welch expressed her support for women's rights during concerts in Las Vegas, Nevada, Chicago, Illinois, Raleigh and Columbia, Maryland.
