'''Sylvi Listhaug''' (born 25 December 1977) is a Norwegian politician for the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] who served as Minister for the Elderly and Public Health of [[Norway]] under Prime Minister [[Erna Solberg]] from May to December 2019. In addition, she has also served as the [[Minister of Petroleum and Energy]] of [[Norway]] from December 2019 to January 2020. Listhaug served as Norway's first [[Solberg's Cabinet|Minister of Immigration and Integration]] from 2015 to 2018, a specially created cabinet position during the [[European migrant crisis]], and [[Ministry of Agriculture and Food (Norway)|Minister of Agriculture and Food]] from 2013 to 2015. She served as [[Minister of Justice and Public Security|Minister of Justice, Public Security and Immigration]] from January 2018 until her resignation in March 2018. Originally from the rural municipality of [[Ørskog]] in [[Sunnmøre]], she began her political career in [[Oslo]] as City Commissioner of Welfare and Social Services.

As Minister of Migration and Integration, Listhaug reduced the number of [[asylum seekers]] arriving in Norway from 30,000 in 2015 to 2,000 in 2017.<ref name="jpost.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Norwegians-now-get-what-Israel-goes-through-says-Minister-506213|title=Norwegians now 'experiencing the same fear as Israelis' says minister - Israel News - Jerusalem Post|website=Jpost.com|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> Although the drop in asylum seekers was partially linked to an overfall fall in traffic to Europe, Listhaug was attributed for proposing and securing support for many new regulations and overseeing the tightening of the system, which resulted in a 19-year low in number of new asylum arrivals.<ref name="rt.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/363544-norway-immigrants-pork-listhaug/|title=‘We eat pork and drink alcohol’: Norwegian minister roasted after giving Muslims integration advice|website=RT International|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

===Oslo city commissioner===
[[File:Sylvi Listhaug 2276.jpg|thumb|Listhaug in 2009]]
Listhaug was appointed city commissioner (''byråd'') of welfare and social services in the city government of [[Oslo]] in 2006, having been secretary to the previous commissioner [[Margaret Eckbo]]. Listhaug spearheaded a number of reforms as commissioner, introducing free choice in home care, and reintroducing senior homes in her first year. She stated as her goals more competition and better nursing homes, and opening for more private companies.<ref>[http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Vil-ha-flere-private-sykehjem-6460402.html "Vil ha flere private sykehjem"], ''Osloby''</ref>

In 2009 she became the subject of a nursing home funding scandal, after it was revealed that a company that had been granted a total amount of 23,5 million NOK from Oslo municipality to build nursing homes for Norwegians in [[Altea]], [[Spain]] had not yet even been granted a Spanish construction permit.<ref>[http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/2702939.html "Her skulle det stått et sykehjem"], ''Nettavisen'', 09.09.09</ref><ref>[http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/2703604.html "- Trist at vi ikke har fått det til"], ''Nettavisen'', 09.09.09</ref> Listhaug claimed she was not responsible for the plans, which were designed to make Oslo a prime example for other municipalities in regards to care for the elderly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/fra-odelsjente-til-skandaleminister-1.13970686|title=Frå odelsjente til skandaleminister|first=Espen|last=Alnes|date=20 March 2018|website=NRK|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nettavisen.no/na24/--jeg-trekker-meg-ikke/2993890.html|title=- Jeg trekker meg ikke|first=Heidi Schei|last=Lilleås|website=Nettavisen|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> Listhaug told reporters from the state broadcaster ''[[NRK]]'' in March 2010 that she did “not have the responsibility for the construction of the nursing home nor authoring the contracts.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/overtalt-til-sykehjem-i-spania-1.7042300|title=Overtalt til sykehjem i Spania|first=Anette Holth|last=Hansen|date=17 March 2010|website=NRK|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

Other proposals by Listhaug as city commissioner included a stricter policy on [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] patients,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article406787.ece|work=Dagsavisen|title=Du vet aldri når det klikker for dem|first1=Sturla Smári|last1=Hanssen|first2=Tore|last2=Letvik|first3=Jo Moen|last3=Bredeveien|date=24 March 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and putting up posters of convicted rapists in their local community.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/02/23/nyheter/innenriks/frp/voldtekt/10550784/|work=Dagbladet|date=23 February 2010|title=Vil henge opp plakater av voldtektsforbrytere}}</ref> Before the [[Pride parade|gay parade]] in Oslo in 2009, Listhaug suggested to some controversy that "half and almost wholly naked people dancing around in the streets of Oslo" could rather lead to less tolerance of homosexuals, thus working against its goal, although she made clear that homosexuals should be able to party "when and where they want".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/06/24/nyheter/homofili/homofile/innenriks/frp/6873193/|work=Dagbladet|title=Frp vil ikke ha halvnakne homodansere|first1=Vegard Kristiansen|last1=Kvaale|first2=Peder|last2=Ottosen|date=24 June 2009}}</ref>

=== Political consultant ===
From 2012 until her cabinet appointment, Listhaug had worked as a senior consultant with [[First House (company)|First House]],<ref name="ministry" /> a Norwegian strategic advisory, corporate communications, governmental affairs and crisis management/issue management agency. Shortly after her appointment, media attention centered on her decision to keep secret her list of clients during her time in the job.<ref name="SNL" /> The list of public clients was made public in early 2014 after Listhaug herself declared a personal conflict of interest.<ref>[http://www.nrk.no/norge/offentliggjor-listhaugs-lister-1.11475138 "Listhaugs liste over offentlige kunder er frigitt"], ''NRK'', 16.01.2014</ref>

=== Minister of Agriculture (2013–2015) ===
[[File:Listhaug_hogan_european_commissioner_for_agriculture.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Listhaug during a meeting with [[Phil Hogan]], the [[European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development]].]]
On 16 October 2013 Listhaug was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Food in the new [[Solberg's Cabinet|Solberg Cabinet]].<ref>IBP, Inc. (2015). ''Norway Investment and Business Guide Volume 1 Strategic and Practical Information''. Lulu Publications, Inc. Page 35. {{ISBN|9781514530184}}.</ref><ref name="ministry"/> The Solberg government signalled a drastic change of course in Norwegian agricultural policy by opening for more freely sale and purchase of farms, and seeking a development towards more sustainable fewer and bigger farms.<ref name="SNL"/> Listhaug as Minister of Agriculture sought to remove laws which require farm-owners to live on the farm. Listhaug argued her changes would lead to a more efficient food production in Norway, ultimately reducing high [[food prices]]. She also lowered government subsidies to farmers, who receive one of the highest government subsidies in the world, according to the [[OECD]].<ref name="bbc.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-32237521|title=The women making a song and dance about farming in Norway|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=28 March 2019|website=Bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20130920/norway-has-worlds-highest-farm-subsidies|title=Norway farmers world's most subsidised: OECD|date=20 September 2013|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> As an example, Norwegian farmers receive over 50% of their farm income as government support, while the equivalent number for U.S. farmers is 8%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2018-07-25/trumps-aid-package-will-hurt-australian-farmers-says-nff/10034662|title=Australian farmers say Trump's $12 billion aid package will hurt them|first=By Nikolai Beilharz and Jess|last=Davis|date=25 July 2018|website=ABC Rural|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20120920/norways-farm-subsidies-highest-in-oecd|title=Norway's farm subsidies highest in OECD|date=20 September 2012|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

As Listhaug in 2010 had called the Norwegian agricultural policy a "communist system" in an [[op-ed]], this received widespread attention in media and social media.<ref>[http://e24.no/makro-og-politikk/i-2010-kalte-hun-norsk-landbruk-kommunisme-naa-blir-hun-ny-landbruksminister/22583737 "I 2010 kalte hun norsk landbruk «kommunisme», nå blir hun ny landbruksminister"], ''E24'', 16.10.2013</ref> After being pressured with the comment in a television debate, she stated her intent on following the new government's policy agreement.<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/10/17/nyheter/landbruk/arbeidsliv/politikk/innenriks/29842241/ "Listhaug tok avstand fra uttalelser om kommunistisk landbruk"], ''Dagbladet'', 17.10.2013</ref> Prior comments by Listhaug and the new government's course was met with scepticism and protest among some farmers.<ref name="SNL"/>

During her time as Minister of Agriculture and Food, Listhaug had, somewhat controversially, contacts with clients of First House, including the farmers’ organization [[Norges Bondelaget]], the [[NHO]] employers’ organization unit representing food and beverage firm, the brewing organization [[Bryggeriforeningen]], and supermarket chain [[REMA 1000|Rema 1000]], one of her last clients for First House before she joined the government herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2013/10/25/pressure-grows-on-the-food-minister/|title=Pressure grows on the ‘food minister’|website=Newsinenglish.no|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-30}}</ref>

===Minister of Immigration (2015–2018)===
On 16 December 2015 Listhaug was appointed Minister of Immigration and Integration, a newly formed cabinet position under the [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security]], amid the [[European migrant crisis]] and record-high numbers of [[asylum seeker]]s in Norway that resulted in a broad parliamentary agreement to tighten asylum regulations.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Norway: New Ministry Is Created to Address Influx of Migrants|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/world/europe/norway-new-ministry-is-created-to-address-influx-of-migrants.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="DetStore">{{Cite news|author=Lepperød, Trond|title=Ser ingen motsetning mellom kristen nestekjærlighet og stramme tøyler i asylpolitikken|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/politikk/ser-ingen-motsetning-mellom-kristen-nestekjrlighet-og-stramme-tyler-i-asylpolitikken/3423172263.html|work=Nettavisen|date=19 December 2015|language=no}}</ref> The month prior to her appointment Listhaug criticised what she described as a "tyranny of goodness" haunting the Norwegian immigration debate, and that it would be more Christian and reasonable to help as many people as possible through foreign aid to refugees abroad rather than aiding fewer and more costly asylum seekers in Norway.<ref name="DetStore"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Norway populists win new immigration ministry |url=http://www.thelocal.no/20151216/norway-populists-win-new-immigration-ministry|work=The Local|date=16 December 2015}}</ref> She later vowed that her proposed asylum regulations would make Norway's asylum policies "one of the strictest in Europe".<ref>{{Cite news|title=– Vi kommer til å få en asylpolitikk som er blant de strengeste i Europa|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-vi-kommer-til-a-fa-en-asylpolitikk-som-er-blant-de-strengeste-i-europa-1.12724216|publisher=NRK|date=29 December 2015|language=no}}</ref><ref>Lundby, Knut (2018).

In August 2017, a row took place between Listhaug and [[Sweden]]'s political establishment after Listhaug planned a visit to the Swedish suburb of [[Rinkeby]] in the context of the country's [[vulnerable area]]s, having warned during her time as minister about the need to avoid "Swedish conditions" in Norway.

[[File:Regjeringen_Solberg_2018-01-17-7629.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sylvi Listhaug and the [[Solberg Cabinet]] presented after change of ministers.]]
After securing renewed support for the centre-right coalition in the 2017 parliamentary election, Listhaug was appointed Minister of Justice, Public Security and Immigration in January 2018, absorbing her former cabinet position following a government re-shuffle.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Sylvi Listhaug om sin nye jobb: -Jeg kommer ikke til å forandre meg|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/sylvi-listhaug-om-sin-nye-jobb--jeg-kommer-ikke-til-a-forandre-meg/69351570|work=Dagbladet|date=17 January 2018|language=no}}</ref> As Minister of Justice, Listhaug “waged a war” against pedophile perpetrators, both internationally and domestically. Listhaug introduced new legislation which would remove the passports from pedophiles committing assaults abroad, and it caused controversy when she unapologetically referred to these individuals as “monsters.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vl.no/nyhet/ber-listhaug-vaske-munnen-sin-1.1090946|title=Prest ber Listhaug vaske munnen|website=Vl.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/article/ap-G13ML4.html|title=Listhaug om monsterkritikken: – Kom dere videre|last=NTB|website=Aftenposten|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tv2.no/a/9624447/|title=Listhaug vil endre loven for å stoppe pedofile "monstre"|first=TV 2|last=AS|website=TV 2|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

In March 2018 Listhaug posted a Facebook message claiming that the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] "cares more about the rights of terrorists than national security" following disagreement on a parliamentary vote about whether the state should be able to withdraw the citizenship of threats to national security. After insisting for several days amid criticism that no apology was warranted other than stating regret if offending anyone, the government led by Prime Minister Solberg, and eventually Listhaug herself apologised for the post in parliament. As Listhaug's initial apology was considered "not good enough" by Labour leader [[Jonas Gahr Støre]], this caused the opposition, including Labour and the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] to state their support for a [[motion of no confidence]] pushed by the [[Red Party (Norway)|Red Party]]. The day before the vote on 20 March, the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] also concluded they would support the motion, thereby indicating a parliamentary majority for the motion of no confidence.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holter|first1=Mikael|last2=Sleire|first2=Sveinung|title=Facebook Post Pushes Norway Government to Brink of Collapse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-18/facebook-post-pushes-norway-government-to-the-brink-of-collapse|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Norwegian minister faces no-confidence vote after terrorism post|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/norway-minister-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-terrorism-post|work=The Guardian|date=19 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Norwegian political storm evokes Trump and Breivik|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-politics-breivik/norwegian-political-storm-evokes-trump-and-breivik-idUSKCN1GO1R3|publisher=Reuters|date=12 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Justice minister Sylvi Listhaug removes Facebook post after scandal|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20180315/norway-justice-minister-sylvi-listhaug-removes-facebook-post-after-scandal|newspaper=The Local|agency=AFP|date=15 March 2018}}</ref> Listhaug resigned herself in the morning before the parliamentary session.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Norwegian Political Standoff Ends With Justice Minister’s Resignation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/norway-s-justice-minister-resigns-to-avert-government-crisis|work=Bloomberg|date=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Norway justice minister quits to avert government collapse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/20/norway-justice-minister-sylvi-listhaug-quits-avert-government-collapse|work=The Guardian|date=20 March 2018}}</ref>

===First deputy leader (2018–present) ===
In June 2018, Sylvi Listhaug was nominated by [[Møre and Romsdal]] Progress Party as a candidate for first deputy leader of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]]. The party's annual national meeting will constitute a new deputy leader on 3 September 2018, in order to replace [[Per Sandberg]]. State broadcaster [[NRK]] reported in August 2018 that Listhaug likely will be elected by the central board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/sylvi-listhaug-blir-trolig-nestleder-i-frp-1.14164466|title=Sylvi Listhaug blir trolig nestleder i Frp|first=Sofie Dege|last=Dimmen|date=13 August 2018|website=NRK|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> Listhaug told reporters in [[Arendal]]: "I am humbled and honored to be mentioned as a deputy leader candidate", and added “I am ready to serve if the party wants me in such a role."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/rogalandsavis/sylvi-listhaug-sier-ja-til-a-overta-som-nestleder-1.1186880|title=Sylvi Listhaug sier ja til å overta som nestleder|website=Dagsavisen.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adressa.no/nyheter/politikk/2018/08/15/Sylvi-Listhaug-sier-ja-til-%C3%A5-overta-som-nestleder-17326227.ece|title=Sylvi Listhaug sier ja til å overta som nestleder|last=ntb|date=15 August 2018|website=Adressa.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

On 3 September 2018 the Progress Party's Central Board unanimously voted to constitute Listhaug as acting first deputy leader of the party. The formal election took take place during the party's national convention in May 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/sylvi-listhaug-konstituert-som-nestleder-i-frp-1.14192714|title=Sylvi Listhaug konstituert som nestleder i Frp|first=Linn|last=Blomkvist|date=3 September 2018|website=NRK|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

=== Minister of the Elderly and Public Health (2019) ===
Sylvi Listhaug was appointed Minister for the elderly and public health Friday 3 May 2019 in [[Solberg's Cabinet|Erna Solberg's coalition government]]. She was minister in the Ministry of Health and Care Services where [[Bent Høie]] (H) also is a Minister (of Health).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/hod/id421/|title=Ministry of Health and Care Services|last=Services|first=Ministry of Health and Care|date=2017-05-11|website=Government.no|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/sylvi-listhaug-er-ny-eldre--og-folkehelseminister/id2643758/|title=Sylvi Listhaug er ny eldre- og folkehelseminister (not yet in english)|last=Helse og omsorgsdepartementet|date=2019-05-03|website=Regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>

On Monday, 6 May 2019, she created controversy when she, newly elected as the new health minister, told reporters from [[NRK]]: "People should be allowed to smoke, drink and eat as much red meat as much as they want. The authorities may like to inform, but people know pretty much what is healthy and what is not healthy, I think." The secretary general of the [[Norwegian Cancer Society]], [[Anne Lise Ryel]], said Listhaug's comments were “potentially harmful to public health.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48190197|title=Let people smoke, drink and eat red meat - Norwegian health minister|date=May 7, 2019|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/world/europe/norway-minister-smoking.html|title=Smoke, Drink and Eat What You Want, Norway’s Public Health Minister Says|first=Palko|last=Karasz|date=May 10, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In January 2020, she and the rest of [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] ministers withdrew from the government after a dispute over the return of an IS woman and her children.

==Political views==
[[File:Sylvi_Listhaug-5.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
Listhaug believes that the elderly should have legal rights to a place in private nursing homes paid by public funding. She has advocated "zero tolerance" on crime, more visible police, and said that integration has to become better by having stricter demands on people who move to Norway, combined with a more restrictive immigration policy.<ref name=nrk290609>{{cite news|url=http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/ostlandssendingen/valg_2009_oslo_og_akershus/1.6664438|work=NRK|first=Grethe Kielland|last=Jenssen|date=29 June 2009|title=- Tryggheten skal tilbake til Oslo}}</ref>

Although a lifelong Christian, Listhaug has considered leaving the [[Church of Norway]] which she has described as "thoroughly socialist",<ref name="DetStore"/> due to the former Red-Green government's interventionist policy on appointment of bishops, as well as church leaders in her view voicing political opinions on too many issues.<ref name="auto1">Lundby, Knut (2018).

Listhaug is in favor of [[immigrant repatriation]] from Norway.

===Migration policy===
[[File:Sylvi listhaug Kommunesektorens organisasjon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Listhaug speaking to the [[Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities]].]]
She is noted for her hard-line immigration policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/774802/not-evil-apostle-Norway-minister-rails-against-criticism-tough-immigration|title='I’m not an evil apostle' Norway minister rails against criticism over immigration policy|first=Lizzie|last=Stromme|date=3 March 2017|website=Express.co.uk|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> As Minister of Migration and Integration, Listhaug presented a 150-page document with 40 proposals for new asylum- and migration regulations, in which she claimed would make Norway's migrant policy “one of the strictest in Europe.” The proposals, which failed to summon necessary parliamentary support in June 2016, included proposals such as:<ref>Ugland, Trygve (2018). ''Policy Learning from Canada:&nbsp;Reforming Scandinavian Immigration and Integration Policies''. University of Toronto Press. Pages 85-86. {{ISBN|9781487503192}}.</ref>

*More efficient ID clarification procedures;
*Simplifying the process for the refusal of asylum applications;
*Introducing temporary protection until age 18 for unaccompanied minors;
*Greater opportunity for deporting persons whose applications proved to be unfounded;
*Stricter integration criteria for permanent residency;
*Tighter restrictions on right to family reunification.

The proposal also included procedures which would allow detaining migrants who submit “obviously groundless asylum claims” for up to 72 hours, in order to prevent them from evading deportation. Speaking to state broadcaster ''[[NRK]]'', Sylvi Listhaug said: “We can see that unfounded asylum seekers disappear while the police are processing their applications. This will prohibit them from running off and eventually getting involved in criminal activity. Now we will know where we have them, get their applications processed and then return them.” Minister Listhaug added that 90 out of 537 asylum seekers processed under the 48-hour procedure in 2015 disappeared, and that the locations of ninety percent of those still remain unknown to authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/658391/Norway-tough-Government-JAIL-migrants-groundless-asylum-applications|title=Norway gets tough: Government will JAIL migrants who file ‘groundless asylum applications’|first=Lizzie|last=Stromme|date=5 April 2016|website=Express.co.uk|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20160405/norway-wants-to-jail-groundless-asylum-seekers|title=Norway wants to jail ‘groundless’ asylum seekers|date=5 April 2016|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> The proposals also would expand the ability of law enforcement agencies to store and acquire [[biometric]] information such as fingerprints, in order to determine whether an asylum applicant may present a security threat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20160330/norways-integration-minister-we-cant-be-like-sweden|title=Norway's integration minister: We can't be like Sweden|date=30 March 2016|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

In Listhaug's response to the parliament's rejection of her proposals for stricter migration policies, she stated: “This is primarily a shame for the Norwegian nation. We need a sustainable policy that safeguards the Norwegian welfare model. The level of immigration to Norway will be a decisive factor in this.” Shortly after, Sylvi Listhaug traveled to [[Canada]] in order to learn more about the Canadian private sponsorship program for refugees.<ref>Ugland, Trygve (2018). ''Policy Learning from Canada:&nbsp;Reforming Scandinavian Immigration and Integration Policies''. University of Toronto Press. Page 86. {{ISBN|9781487503192}}.</ref>

Speaking to reporters from ''[[Ynet]]'' in 2017, Listhaug told reporters that she believes fewer illegal immigrants are coming to Norway due to the fact that Norway deports undocumented migrants back to their country of origin.<ref name="jpost.com"/> As immigration minister, Listhaug went on a trip visiting three countries in East Africa with the goal of implementing new return agreements. In advance of the trip, Listhaug told reporters: “Return policy is highly prioritized in Norway, so it will be natural for us to ensure that people who are not entitled to stay in Norway can be returned to the countries from which they come from.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://norwaytoday.info/news/listhaug-wants-return-agreements-in-place-with-east-africa/|title=Listhaug wants return agreements in place with East Africa|first=Victoria|last=Garza|date=9 January 2018|website=Norwaytoday.info|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

Sweden's Migration Minister Heléne Fritzon canceled a meeting due to be held with Sylvi Listhaug in August 2017, claiming that Listhaug spread an “inaccurate image of Sweden.” Listhaug said in an interview with ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' that “parallel societies have developed in more than 60 places in Sweden”, calling them “no-go zones”, while insisting that there are conditions of lawlessness in some areas with large quantities of people with immigrant backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20170829/meeting-between-swedish-and-norwegian-ministers-scrapped-following-no-go-zone-claims|title=Meeting between Swedish and Norwegian ministers scrapped following 'no-go zone' claims|date=29 August 2017|website=Thelocal.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/world/europe/norway-election.html|title=Ruling Conservative-Led Bloc Wins Norway’s National Elections|first=Henrik Pryser|last=Libell|date=11 September 2017|accessdate=28 March 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

===Law and order===
As Minister of Justice, Listhaug received criticism and praise for calling pedophile perpetrators “monsters.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/listhaug-mener-_monster_-beskrivelse-vil-avskrekke-overgripere-1.13886503|title=Listhaug mener "monster"-beskrivelse vil avskrekke overgripere|first=Guro|last=Flaarønning|date=26 January 2018|website=NRK|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref> Listhaug announced more legislative changes to stop pedophiles committing assaults abroad, and told reporters: “It is absolutely terrible to think that these monsters are allowed to leave our country and travel to places where poor families and poor children are exploited in the worst way.” Listhaug added that “we must do whatever we can to stop them.” She is a proponent of stripping these individuals of their passports when sentenced for this type of abuse, not allowing them to leave the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.4072/norway-goes-to-war-against-pedophilia.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821093732/http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.4072/norway-goes-to-war-against-pedophilia.html |archive-date=2018-08-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/a/69412005|title=- Min jobb er å redde barn|first=Steinar Solås|last=Suvatne|date=6 February 2018|website=Dagbladet.no|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref>

===Agricultural policy===
[[File:Sylvi listhaug sami parliament sametinget.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Listhaug during a meeting with the [[Sami Parliament of Norway]], 2014.]] 
Listhaug served as [[Minister of Agriculture and Food (Norway)|Minister of Agriculture and Food]] from 2013 to 2015, and implemented new agricultural policies signaling a drastic change of course. The new policies allowed for more freely sales- and purchases of farms, while also seeking fewer and bigger, sustainable farms.<ref name=SNL/> As minister, she lowered government payments to farmers, who receive one of the highest levels of government subsidies in the world, according to the [[OECD]]. During her tenure, the department also sought to scrap the law which makes it a duty to live on the farm. The changes could lead to larger farms and a more efficient food production, which the department argued would reduce the country's high food prices.<ref name="bbc.com"/>

===Foreign policy===
A strong supporter of [[Israel]] with her study trip to the country during her teacher studies, Listhaug has voiced support for moving the Norwegian embassy in Israel from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=idag>{{cite news|url=http://www.idag.no/aktuelt-oppslag.php3?ID=16749|work=Norge IDAG|title=Står opp for kristne verdier|last=Nordgaard|first=Tor-Bjørn|date=15 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726195332/http://www.idag.no/aktuelt-oppslag.php3?ID=16749|archive-date=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Listhaug told reporters in 2017 that European nations “and their citizens need to understand the situation in Israel better,” and added that “the Progress Party has always been a supporter of Israel’s need to protect themselves in a region where you are the only democracy.” She made it clear that the party does not necessarily support everything the State of Israel does, but stated that “you have a right to defend your people and your borders because you live in a region that has a lot of problems.”<ref name="jpost.com"/>
