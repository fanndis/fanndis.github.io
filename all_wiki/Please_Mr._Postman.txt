"'''Please Mr. Postman'''" is a folk song written by [[Georgia Dobbins]], William Garrett, [[Freddie Gorman]], [[Brian Holland]] and [[Robert Bateman (songwriter)|Robert Bateman]]. It is the debut single by [[the Marvelettes]] for the Tamla ([[Motown]]) label,<ref name=pc25/> notable as the first Motown song to reach the number-one position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop singles chart. The single achieved this position in late 1961; it hit number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] as well.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=379}}</ref> "Please Mr. Postman" became a number-one hit again in early 1975 when [[the Carpenters]]' cover of the song reached the top position of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. "Please Mr. Postman" has been [[cover version|covered]] several times, including by the British rock group [[The Beatles]] in 1963.

==The Marvelettes version==

===Background===
In April 1961, [[the Marvelettes]] (then known as "The Marvels") arranged an audition for [[Berry Gordy]]'s Tamla label. Marvels original lead singer Georgia Dobbins needed an original song for their audition, and got a blues song from her friend William Garrett, which she then reworked for the group. Dobbins left the group after the audition and was replaced, Gordy renamed the group and hired "Brianbert"&mdash;[[Brian Holland]] and Robert Bateman's songwriting partnership&mdash;to rework the song yet again. Freddie Gorman, himself a Detroit postman and another songwriting partner of Holland (before Holland became part of the [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]] team) was also involved in the final reworking.

The Marvelettes recording features lead singer [[Gladys Horton]] hoping that the [[mail carrier|postman]] has brought her a letter from her boyfriend. Accompaniment is provided by [[the Funk Brothers]], including [[Marvin Gaye]] on [[drum kit|drums]]. The Marvelettes' version later appeared in a bar fight scene in the film ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].

Songwriting credits for "Please Mr. Postman" seem to have changed over the years. The original Tamla 45 single for the Marvelettes' version credits "Dobbins/Garett/Brianbert" as the songwriters, and credits "Brianbert" as producer. The original ''[[With the Beatles]]'' album cover credited it to just Brian Holland (the 1987 CD release credits it to "Dobbin-Garrett-Garman<!--sic-->-Brianbert"). The 1976 Beatles discography book ''All Together Now'' credits the songwriting to Holland, Bateman, and Berry Gordy. The 1992 Motown [[boxed set]] ''Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection'' credits Dobbins, Garrett, Holland, Bateman, and Gorman as the composers. The [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] credits "Please Mr. Postman" to just Holland, Bateman, and Gorman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibit_home_page.asp?exhibitId=291 |title=Brian Holland |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |accessdate=January 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402040744/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibit_home_page.asp?exhibitId=291 |archive-date=April 2, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> EMI Music Publishing, the current music publisher of the song, list all five writers in their catalog.

[[Ava DuVernay]] was commissioned by the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] to create a film which debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. This film, ''August 28: A Day in the Life of a People'', tells of six significant events in [[African-American history]] that happened on the same date, [[August 28]]. Events depicted include (among others) the release of the song.<ref name=Essence-NMAAHC-2016>{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Rachaell|title=Why Is August 28 So Special To Black People?

===Background===
"Please Mr. Postman" was [[cover version|covered]] in a version by British rock group [[the Beatles]] on their ''[[With the Beatles]]'' album in the UK and on ''[[The Beatles' Second Album]]'' in the US. Sung by [[John Lennon]], their version reverses the genders.<ref name=pc25>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19780/m1/ |title=Show 25 - The Soul Reformation: Phase two, the Motown story.

[[The Beatles]] included "Please Mr. Postman" as part of their live act in 1962, performing it regularly at [[the Cavern Club]]. They also performed the song three separate times during live performances on the BBC. By the time it was recorded for their second album, ''[[With the Beatles]]'', it had been dropped from their set, and required some work in the studio to bring it up to an acceptable standard.<ref name="macdonald2p91"/> [[Ian MacDonald]] criticised their version for having a "[[wall of sound]]" and for a "general airlessness."<ref name="macdonald2p91"/> It was released by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in Canada with "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" as the A-side.

===Background===
A hit cover of "Please Mr. Postman" was recorded by the [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]], whose version took the song again to number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart in early 1975. The Carpenters' version resembles an old 1950s rock & roll song. The single was released in late 1974, reached number one on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] charts in January 1975,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=47}}</ref> and was the duo's 10th and final million-selling single. The corresponding ''[[Horizon (The Carpenters album)|Horizon]]'' album was belatedly released in June 1975 and went Platinum.

The Carpenters' cover version was also [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by [[rapper]] [[Juelz Santana]] for his single "[[Oh Yes (Juelz Santana song)|Oh Yes]]". It is used by the ''[[Rob, Arnie and Dawn Show]]'' to introduce their Listener Mail segment, and was sung by the presenters of British Saturday morning show ''[[SMTV Live]]'' to introduce the mailbag section. Reaching number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1975, in a UK television special on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in  2016 it was voted number one in ''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Nation's Favourite Carpenters Song]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Nation's Favourite Carpenters Song |url=https://www.itv.com/hub/the-nations-favourite-carpenters-song/2a4042 |accessdate=25 May 2020 |agency=ITV}}</ref>

===Music video===
A [[music video]] of the song, filmed in [[Disneyland]], can be found on the DVD ''[[Gold: Greatest Hits (video)|Gold: Greatest Hits]]'' (released in 2002), originally packaged as ''Yesterday Once More'' (released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1985).
