=== History ===
In the beginning of the 1950s some of the most influential Jewish scholars from Germany met in Jerusalem to discuss what form the Leo Baeck Institute would take. The founding conference took place from May 25–31, 1955; [[Martin Buber]], [[Ernst Simon]] and [[Gershom Scholem]] were some of the intellectual heavyweights present.

Most attendees as well as the personalities steering the institute had known each other before their flight from Germany through organizations like the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens|Central-Verein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens]] and the [[:de:Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland|Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland]].{{sfn|Nattermann|2008|page=100}} Others had held positions with the [[Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden]] (formed under Leo Baeck's direction and later renamed the [[Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland]]).{{sfn|Nattermann|2008|page=62}}

It was initially assumed that this project would take the form of a long-term historical project, preparing a comprehensive work on the history of German Jewry. With the expectation that this would not last more than a decade, institute members concentrated entirely on research projects and filling in the history of German Jewry from the [[Haskalah|Enlightenment]] to the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]].

The Leo Baeck Institute was created in 1955 at a conference in Jerusalem. It was founded as a board that was made up of two governing bodies, a research and publication board, and an administrative board.<ref>[[#Hoffmann_founding|Hoffmann 2008]],&nbsp;p.&nbsp;43</ref> It is now a central umbrella organization focused on the study of the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry. It was founded internationally, with multiple locations made up of three independent branches. The Leo Baeck Institute International board coordinates the activities of all three branches, and each branch reports at annual international board meetings about their research and publication projects.{{sfn|Pomerance|2008|pages=240–242}} It is named in honor of its international president, [[Leo Baeck]], the senior Rabbi of Berlin in Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] and the last leader of the Jewish Community under the Nazis.<ref name=NYTimes-ChancellorSchmidt-1980>{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Laurie|title=A Chancellor Visits With German Jews|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/20/111311911.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 November 1980|page=3}}</ref><ref name=LeoBaeck-Biography-German-1996>{{cite book|last1=Friedländer|first1=Albert H.|title=Leo Baeck: Leben und Lehre|date=1996|publisher=Kaiser|location=Gütersloh|ISBN=978-3-579-05084-3|edition=2.

== Leo Baeck Institute, Jerusalem ==
{{main|Leo Baeck Institute Jerusalem}}

As the second generation took over, the LBI Jerusalem transformed from a memorial community to a research centre. Almost all members of the LBI Jerusalem’s second generation were professional historians; most had left Germany as children or adolescents and had either little of no share at all in the founders memories. For this reason the “memorial function” of the historiography now lost significance. In its place came more strictly scholarly aspirations.{{sfn|Nattermann|2008|pages=59–60}}

Through their publications, scholarly seminars, academic and cultural events, alongside an archive, the Leo Baeck Institute Jerusalem has been the leading venue for German-Jewish [[historiography]] and documentation in Israel. Its archives consist of a microfilm collection of Jewish newspapers from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as a collection of family papers, genealogical materials and community histories.

== Leo Baeck Institute, London ==
{{main|Leo Baeck Institute London}}
The ''Leo Baeck Institute London'', founded in 1955, researches the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry from the 17th century to the present day.
The Institute aims both to facilitate academic exchange and to use the German and Central European Jewish experience from the 17th to the 21st centuries to help understand contemporary socio-political debates concerning immigration, minorities, integration, and civil rights, in particular in the UK. Its teaching and research capacity expanded significantly with the Institute’s move from its historic home in central London to Queen Mary, University of London, in 2011. Since then the LBI London has established European Jewish History as a teaching and research field at the School of History at Queen Mary. The LBI London remains an independent institute. It is a registered charity under English law.

===Publications===
The Institute’s flagship publication, the ''Leo Baeck Institute Year Book'' (since 1956) is the leading international publication in the field of the history and culture of German-speaking Jews. Published by Oxford University Press with a circulation of over 2,000 copies, it publishes original research on the cultural, economic, political, social and religious history of German-speaking Jews. The Leo Baeck Institute Year Book Essay Prize is awarded annually to an early-career researcher writing on the history or culture of German-speaking Jewry. In addition to its Year Book, the LBI London publishes monographs and edited volumes in German and English. Its two series, ''Schriftenreihe wissenschaftlicher Abhandlungen des Leo Baeck Instituts'', in German, and ''German Jewish Cultures'', in English, cover the period from the Enlightenment to the contemporary era with a special focus on European Jewish history.

===Academic programmes and events===
The Institute organises a range of events, such as international conferences and a public programme of lectures and workshops, often in collaboration with other UK or international organizations. Events are aimed at a broad audience. 
A ''Leo Baeck Fellowship Programme'' (in collaboration with the [[Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes]]) was created in 2005 to support doctoral candidates in German-Jewish studies. The programme includes bi-annual seminars during which Fellows discuss their research with senior academics in the field. Up to 12 fellowships are awarded each year. In collaboration with the [[Queen Mary University of London]], the Institute offers the ''Leo Baeck Institute MA in European Jewish History'', currently the only postgraduate programme in the UK focusing on the field of European Jewish history. Among other topics, the programme explores the question of emancipation, equal rights, identities, the role of antisemitism, and Jewish intellectual history. The Institute also offers MA and PhD bursaries to support students on this course.
