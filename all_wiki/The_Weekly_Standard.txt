==History==

The ''Standard'' was viewed as heavily influential during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of president George W. Bush]] (2001-2009), being called the [[Inflight magazine|in-flight magazine]] of [[Air Force One]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2BSgV1T|title=Weekly Standard faces uncertain future after holding its ground against Trump|last=Schwartz|first=Jason|date=December 4, 2018|website=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref> In 2003, although the magazine's circulation was only 55,000, Kristol said that "We have a funny relationship with the top tier of the administration. They very much keep us at arm's length, but [Vice President] [[Dick Cheney]] does send over someone to pick up 30 copies of the magazine every Monday."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/89505.html|title=When this weekly speaks, White House listens|last=Carr|first=David|date=June 24, 2004|work=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624110826/http://www.iht.com/articles/89505.html|archive-date=June 24, 2004|url-status=dead|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref>

In 2006, though the publication had never been profitable and reputedly lost more than a million dollars a year, News Corporation head [[Rupert Murdoch]] initially dismissed the idea of selling it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016fa_fact1?printable=true|title=Murdoch's Game|date=October 16, 2006|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Subsequently in June 2009, a report circulated that a sale of the publication to [[Philip Anschutz]] was imminent, with Murdoch's position being that, having since purchased ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2007, his interest in the smaller publication had diminished.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carr|first=David|author-link=David Carr (journalist)|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.fnytimes.com/2009/06/10/will-the-standard-pass-from-murdoch-to-anschutz/|title=Will The Standard Pass From Murdoch to Anschutz?|date=June 10, 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Worden|first=Nat|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124465301083402649|title=News Corp.

The ''Standard'' increased its paid circulation by 39 percent between its June 2009 and June 2010 [[BPA Worldwide|BPA]] statements.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mickey|first=Bill|url=http://www.audiencedevelopment.com/2010/weekly+standard+boosts+its+circ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121071618/http://www.audiencedevelopment.com/2010/weekly+standard+boosts+its+circ|title=The Weekly Standard Boosts Its Circ|archive-date=November 21, 2011|date=October 6, 2010|website=Audience Development}}</ref> Its print circulation of about 100,000 in 2013 had decreased to 72,000 by 2017, according to the BPA, with circulation dropping about 10 percent between 2016 and 2017.<ref name=":0" />

In late 2016, Kristol ended his time as editor-in-chief.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/310193-bill-kristol-stepping-down-as-weekly-standard-editor-in-chief|title=Bill Kristol stepping down as Weekly Standard editor-in-chief|last=Rupert|first=Evelyn|date=December 13, 2016|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref> He was replaced by Stephen Hayes, the magazine's senior writer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.depauw.edu/news-media/latest-news/details/32765/|title=Stephen F.

In December 2017, ''The Weekly Standard'' became an official fact-checking partner for [[Facebook]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1095509/facebooks-latest-solution-to-its-fake-news-problem-sign-on-a-right-wing-fact-checker/|title=Facebook looks to conservative Weekly Standard to combat its fake news problem â€” Quartz|website=qz.com|language=en|access-date=September 15, 2018}}</ref> 

On December 14, 2018, Clarity Media Group announced that it would cease publication of the magazine after 23 years. While some speculated that the closure of ''The Weekly Standard'' was so Clarity Media's other magazine, the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'', could absorb the ''Standard''{{'}}s subscribers, a statement from Clarity Media Group chairman Ryan McKibben said that such speculation was incorrect.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Darcy |first1=Oliver |title=The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine critical of Trump, to shutter after 23 years |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/14/media/weekly-standard-end/index.html |website=CNN Business |publisher=CNN Interactive |access-date=December 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/14/weekly-standard-closes-rightwing-media-trump|title=Weekly Standard, rightwing magazine opposed to Trump, closes after 23 years|first=Ed|last=Pilkington|date=December 14, 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Kristol attributed the magazine's demise to the hostility of supporters of the [[Donald Trump]] administration.<ref>{{cite news |title=Meet the Other Resistance: The Republican One |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/magazine/republican-primary-trump-resistance.html |work=New York Times |date=24 April 2019}}</ref>

===Support of the invasion of Iraq===
The ''Standard'' promoted and supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to remove [[Saddam Hussein]]. In November 1997 [[Bill Kristol]] and [[Robert Kagan]] wrote an editorial titled "Saddam Must Go", in which they stated "We know it seems unthinkable to propose another ground attack to take Baghdad. But it's time to start thinking the unthinkable."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/saddam-must-go|title=SADDAM MUST Go|last=Kristol|first=Bill|date=November 17, 1997|website=WeeklyStandard|language=en|access-date=December 16, 2018}}</ref>  

In the first issue the magazine published after 9/11, according to [[Scott McConnell]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'', "[[Gary Schmitt]] and [[Giselle Donnelly|Tom Donnelly]], two employees of Kristolâ€™s [[Project for the New American Century|PNAC]], clarified what ought to be the countryâ€™s war aims. Their rhetoric was to link Saddam Hussein and [[Osama bin Laden]] in virtually every paragraph, to join them at the hip in the minds of readers, and then to lay out a strategy that actually gave attacking Saddam priority over eliminating al-Qaeda."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-weekly-standards-war/|title=The Weekly Standard's War|last=McConnell|first=Scott|date=November 21, 2005|website=TheAmericanConservative|language=en|access-date=December 16, 2018}}</ref>

On December 16, 2018, co-founder and contributing editor [[John Podhoretz]] defended the coverage answering the question by [[Lulu Garcia-Navarro]] on [[NPR]]: "Do you regret the coverage of Iraq War?" saying "I think, basically, whatâ€”all a magazineâ€”editors, writersâ€”can promise is that they will be honest and say what they mean and think and argue the best way that they can. And with the facts available at the time, that is what The ''Standard'' did."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/16/677157708/co-founder-cannibalism-not-anti-trump-stand-killed-weekly-standard|title=Co-Founder: 'Cannibalism,' Not Anti-Trump Stand, Killed 'Weekly Standard'|date=December 16, 2018|website=NPR|language=en|access-date=December 16, 2018}}</ref>

===Libel case===
In 1997, nearly a year after a cover story that included allegations of hiring a prostitute and plagiarism against best-selling author [[Deepak Chopra]], the editors of ''The Weekly Standard'' accepted full responsibility for the errors in the story, and apologized."<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/apology-to-deepak-chopra-the-weekly-standard-suit-settled-156220725.html APOLOGY TO DEEPAK CHOPRA: THE WEEKLY STANDARD SUIT SETTLED], [[PR Newswire]], June 23, 1997.
