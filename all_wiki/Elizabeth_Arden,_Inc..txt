As of September 7, 2016, the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Revlon|Revlon, Inc.]]<ref name=Gen1>{{cite web| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160907006742/en/Revlon-Announces-Completion-Elizabeth-Arden-Acquisition | title=Official Press Release | date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Elizabeth Arden - Magazine ad - Zan-e Rooz, Issue 181 - 31 August 1968.jpg|thumb|A 1968 Magazine ad of Elizabeth Arden in Persian, [[Zan-e Rooz]]]]
The company was founded as ''Red Door'' salon on [[Fifth Avenue]] in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in 1971 for $38 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|38000000|1971|r=0}}}} today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to [[Fabergé (cosmetics)|Fabergé]] in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from [[Unilever]] in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which was publicly listed ({{NASDAQ|RDEN}}). The company is located in [[Pembroke Pines, Florida]], a suburb of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.elizabetharden.com/corporate-locations.php|title=Corporate Locations, Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|author=Elizabeth Arden Webmaster|work=elizabetharden.com|accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref> The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.

Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were [[Vendela Kirsebom]] during the 1980s, [[Amber Valletta]] to the mid-1990s, and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]. E. Scott Beattie became the companies chief executive officer (CEO) in March 1998, until Debra Perelman took over on May 23, 2018. On December 2, 2014, the company announced Karlina Caune would be the new face of the brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.elizabetharden.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98237&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1994025|title=Elizabeth Arden - a global prestige beauty fragrance cosmetics and skincare products company - Press Release|author=Elizabeth Arden Webmaster|work=elizabetharden.com|accessdate=23 July 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150411035848/http://ir.elizabetharden.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=98237&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1994025|archive-date=11 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to [[Britney Spears]] [[Britney Spears products#Fragrances|fragrances]], as well as the [[Hilary Duff]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Mariah Carey]] fragrance collections. [[Juicy Couture]]'s "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love & Juicy Couture", and [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Taylor Swift]]'s fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taylorswift.com/news#57124|title=TAYLOR LAUNCHES WONDERSTRUCK|publisher=TaylorSwift.com|accessdate=July 17, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/63Sv1MrIE?url=http://www.taylorswift.com/news#57124|archive-date=November 25, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on [[Pinterest]], Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence-boosting make-up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to helping cancer patients to manage the appearance-related side effects of cancer treatment.

==Sale to Revlon==
In June 2016, US cosmetics company [[Revlon]] announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (£611m). When the deal was concluded, the company was expected to have annual gross sales of US $3 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/17/revlon-to-buy-elizabeth-arden-870-million-dollars |title=Revlon to buy Elizabeth Arden |last=Kollewe |first=Julia |date=June 17, 2016 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=June 17, 2016 |quote=The equity value of the deal is $419m, with the rest made up by debt.
