The first member of his family to attend college, Payne graduated from the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1964 with a degree in English.<ref name=HistoryMakers/><ref name=AAPRC>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrusade.net/words/mt-archives/000507.shtml |title=AAPRC Weekly: Les Payne |first=Gwendolyn |last=Quinn |publisher=African-American Public Relations Collective |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref> He was interested in pursuing a career in journalism, but as an African American he found no opportunities in the mainstream press. Instead, Payne joined the army, where he eventually became a [[Captain (United States)|captain]]. He ended his army career with two years as an information officer, writing speeches for General [[William Westmoreland]] and running the army newspaper.<ref name=AAPRC/>

===Career===
''Newsday'' hired Payne in 1969 as an [[Investigative journalism|investigative reporter]].<ref name=AAPRC/> In 1973, he helped write "The Heroin Trail", a series of 33 articles that detailed how [[heroin]] originated in [[Turkey|Turkish]] poppy fields and found its way to the streets of New York City.<ref name=HistoryMakers/> ''Newsday'' won the [[1974 Pulitzer Prize|1974]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] for "The Heroin Trail".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1974 |title=1974 Winners |publisher=The Pulitzer Prizes |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref> Next year, it was published as a book credited to the newspaper staff, ''The Heroin Trail'' ([[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]], 1975).<ref name=HistoryMakers/><ref>[http://lccn.loc.gov/74015466 "The Heroin trail"]. Library of Congress Catalog Record (LCC). Retrieved October 26, 2013.</ref>

In 1975, Payne and other African Americans working in the media established the National Association of Black Journalists. Payne served as the group's fourth president.<ref name=Prince2009>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedefendersonline.com/2009/01/22/pulling-no-punches-a-salute-to-les-payne/ |title=Pulling No Punches: A Salute to Les Payne |first=Richard |last=Prince |authorlink=Richard Prince (journalist) |date=January 22, 2009 |work=The Defenders Online |publisher=[[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref>

Payne co-wrote a series of articles about the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] and the kidnapping of [[Patty Hearst]]. These became the basis of his next book, ''The Life and Death of the SLA'' ([[Ballantine Books]], 1976), credited to "Les Payne and Tim Findley, with Carolyn Craven".<ref name=AAPRC/><ref>[http://lccn.loc.gov/76017833 "The life and death of the SLA"]. LCC record. Retrieved October 26, 2013.</ref> Payne's reporting from South Africa during the 1976 [[Soweto Uprising]] was selected by the jury for a Pulitzer Prize in International Journalism, but the group's advisory board overruled their decision with no explanation.<ref name=ODU/><ref name=Eisner>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/les-paynes-too-quiet-departure |title=Les Payne's Too Quiet Departure |first=Peter |last=Eisner |date=January 12, 2009 |work=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref> Despite being barred from the country, Payne returned to South Africa in 1985 to chronicle the changes that had taken place during the intervening years.<ref name=ODU/>

Payne started writing a weekly [[Column (periodical)|column]] for ''Newsday'' in 1980.<ref name=Prince2008>{{cite web |url=http://mije.org/richardprince/newsday-dumps-les-payne |title=Newsday Drops Les Payne |first=Richard |last=Prince |date=December 31, 2008 |publisher=[[Robert C.

Payne served as ''Newsday''{{'}}s national editor and assistant managing editor for foreign and national news; at different times, he was responsible for the newspaper's coverage of health and science, New York City, and investigations.<ref name=Eisner/> He was responsible for ''New York Newsday'', the newspaper's short-lived attempt to compete in the New York City market.<ref name=Prince2009/> His staff won many journalism awards, including six Pulitzer Prizes.<ref name=Eisner/>
