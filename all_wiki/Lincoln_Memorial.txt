The '''Lincoln Memorial''' is a [[US national memorial]] built to honor the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th]] [[President of the United States]], [[Abraham Lincoln]]. It is located on the western end of the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], across from the [[Washington Monument]]. Taking the form of a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] temple, the memorial's architect was [[Henry Bacon]]. The designer of the memorial interior's large central statue – ''[[Statue of Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|Abraham Lincoln]]'', 1920 – was [[Daniel Chester French]]; the Lincoln statue was carved by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/cultural_diversity/Lincoln_Memorial_National_Memorial.html "Lincoln Memorial National Memorial; Washington, DC] [[National Park Service]]</ref> The painter of the interior murals was [[Jules Guerin]]. Dedicated in May 1922, it is one of several [[Presidential memorials in the United States|memorials built to honor an American president]]. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on [[race relations]].

The building is in the form of a Greek [[Doric order|Doric]] temple and contains a large seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscriptions of two well-known speeches by Lincoln, The [[The Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg Address]] and his [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]. The memorial has been the site of many famous speeches, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the rally at the end of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].

Like other monuments on the National Mall{{snd}}including the nearby [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], [[Korean War Veterans Memorial]], and [[National World War II Memorial]] – the memorial is administered by the [[National Park Service]] under its [[National Mall and Memorial Parks]] group. It has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since October 15, 1966, and was ranked seventh on the [[American Institute of Architects]] 2007 list of [[America's Favorite Architecture]]. The memorial is open to the public 24 hours a day, and more than seven million people visit it annually.<ref>[https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Annual%20Park%20Recreation%20Visitation%20%281904%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year%29?Park=LINC "Annual Park Recreation Visitation (1904 – Last Calendar Year)"] [[National Park Service]]</ref>

==History==
[[File:Taft-Harding-Lincoln.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft|Taft]], President [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] and [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922]]

The first public memorial to [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], was [[Statue of Abraham Lincoln (District of Columbia City Hall)|a statue]] by [[Lot Flannery]] erected in front of the [[District of Columbia City Hall]] in 1868, three years after [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's assassination]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Renovation and Expansion of the Historic DC Courthouse|url=http://www.dcappeals.gov/dccourts/appeals/pdf/appeals_renovation_expansion.pdf|publisher=DC Court of Appeals|accessdate=5 October 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62dfFdX74?url=http://www.dcappeals.gov/dccourts/appeals/pdf/appeals_renovation_expansion.pdf|archive-date=23 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Washington's Lincoln: The First Monument to the Martyred President|url=http://intowner.com/2016/01/11/washingtons-lincoln-the-first-monument-to-the-martyred-president/|publisher=The Intowner|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln's death. In 1867, [[United State Congress|Congress]] passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, [[Clark Mills (sculptor)|Clark Mills]], was chosen to design the monument. His plans reflected the nationalistic spirit of the time, and called for a {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} structure adorned with six equestrian and 31 pedestrian statues of colossal proportions, crowned by a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} statue of Abraham Lincoln. Subscriptions for the project were insufficient.<ref name=nrhp4>NRHP Nomination, p. 4</ref>

The matter lay dormant until the start of the 20th century, when, under the leadership of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Shelby M. Cullom]] of [[Illinois]], six separate bills were introduced in Congress for the incorporation of a new memorial commission. The first five bills, proposed in the years 1901, 1902, and 1908, met with defeat because of opposition from Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joe Cannon]]. The sixth bill (Senate Bill 9449), introduced on December 13, 1910, passed. The Lincoln Memorial Commission had its first meeting the following year and [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[William H. Taft]] was chosen as the commission's president. Progress continued at a steady pace and by 1913 Congress had approved of the Commission's choice of design and location.<ref name=nrhp4/>

There were questions regarding the commission's plan. Many thought that architect Henry Bacon's Greek temple design was far too ostentatious for a man of Lincoln's humble character. Instead they proposed a simple log cabin shrine. The site too did not go unopposed. The recently reclaimed land in [[West Potomac Park]] was seen by many to be either too swampy or too inaccessible. Other sites, such as [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]], were put forth. The Commission stood firm in its recommendation, feeling that the Potomac Park location, situated on the [[Washington Monument]]–[[United States Capitol|Capitol]] axis, overlooking the [[Potomac River]] and surrounded by open land, was ideal. Furthermore, the Potomac Park site had already been designated in the [[McMillan Plan]] of 1901 to be the location of a future monument comparable to that of the Washington Monument.<ref name=nrhp4/><ref>Thomas, Christopher A. (2002) ''The Lincoln Memorial and American Life'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|069101194X}}</ref>

With Congressional approval and a $300,000 allocation, the project got underway. On February 12, 1914, a dedication ceremony was conducted and the following month the actual construction began. Work progressed steadily according to schedule. Some changes were made to the plan. The statue of Lincoln, originally designed to be {{convert|10|ft|m}} tall, was enlarged to {{convert|19|ft|m}} to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the huge chamber. As late as 1920, the decision was made to substitute an open portal for the bronze and glass grille which was to have guarded the entrance. Despite these changes, the Memorial was finished on schedule. Commission president William H. Taft – who was then Chief Justice of the United States – dedicated the Memorial on May 30, 1922, and presented it to [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Warren G. Harding]], who accepted it on behalf of the American people. Lincoln's only surviving son, 78-year-old [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], was in attendance.<ref name=nrhp5>NRHP Nomination, p. 5</ref> Prominent African Americans were invited to the event and discovered upon arrival they were assigned a segregated section guarded by [[U. S. Marines]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yellin|first=Eric S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fixBOW3902UC&q=Whitefield+J.+McKinlay&pg=PA176|title=Racism in the Nation's Service: Government Workers and the Color Line in Woodrow Wilson's America|date=2013-04-22|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-1-4696-0721-4|language=en}}</ref>

The Memorial was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.<ref name=nrhp6>NRHP Nomination, p. 6</ref>

==Exterior==
The exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic [[Greek temple]] and features [[Yule marble]] quarried from [[Colorado]]. The structure measures {{convert|189.7|by|118.5|ft|m}} and is {{convert|99|ft|m}} tall. It is surrounded by a [[peristyle]] of 36 [[Fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[Doric column]]s, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death, and two columns [[Anta (architecture)|in-antis]] at the entrance behind the [[colonnade]]. The columns stand {{convert|44|ft|m}} tall with a base diameter of {{convert|7.5|ft|m}}. Each column is built from 12 drums including the [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building's interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of [[Ancient Greek architecture]].<ref name=nrhp2>NRHP Nomination, p. 2</ref>

[[File:Lincoln Memorial Friezes crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Detail of the Memorial's [[frieze]]s]]

Above the colonnade, inscribed on the [[frieze]], are the names of the 36 states in the Union at the time of [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's death]] and the dates in which they entered the Union.<ref group=Note>The date for Ohio was incorrectly entered as 1802, as opposed to the correct year, 1803.</ref> Their names are separated by double wreath medallions in [[bas-relief]]. The [[cornice]] is composed of a carved scroll regularly interspersed with projecting lions' heads and ornamented with palmetto cresting along the upper edge. Above this on the attic frieze are inscribed the names of the 48 states present at the time of the Memorial's dedication. A bit higher is a [[garland]] joined by ribbons and palm leaves, supported by the wings of eagles. All ornamentation on the friezes and cornices was done by [[Ernest C. Bairstow]].<ref name=nrhp2/>

The Memorial is anchored in a concrete foundation, {{convert|44|to|66|ft|m}} in depth, constructed by M. F. Comer and Company and the National Foundation and Engineering Company, and is encompassed by a {{convert|187|by|257|ft|m|adj=on}} rectangular granite [[retaining wall]] measuring {{convert|14|ft|m}} in height.<ref name=nrhp2/>

Leading up to the shrine on the east side are the main steps. Beginning at the edge of the [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]], the steps rise to the '''Lincoln Memorial Circle''' roadway surrounding the edifice, then to the main portal, intermittently spaced with a series of platforms. Flanking the steps as they approach the entrance are two buttresses each crowned with an {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=on}} tall tripod carved from pink [[Tennessee marble]]<ref name=nrhp2/> by the Piccirilli Brothers.<ref>Concklin, Edward F. (1927) ''The Lincoln Memorial, Washington''. [[United States Government Printing Office]]</ref>

==Interior==
[[File:Lincoln Memorial, "I Have a Dream" 50th anniversary.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|President [[Barack Obama]], First Lady [[Michelle Obama]], and former Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]] walk past the statue of President Abraham Lincoln to participate in the ceremony on the 50th anniversary of the historic [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] and Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech]]
The Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four [[Ionic column]]s, each {{convert|50|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|5.5|ft|m}} across at their base. The central chamber, housing the statue of Lincoln, is 60 feet wide, 74 feet deep, and 60 feet high.<ref>U. S. Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks. [https://www.nps.gov/linc/learn/historyculture/lincoln-memorial-building-statistics.htm ''Lincoln Memorial Building Statistics'']</ref> The north and south chambers display carved inscriptions of Lincoln's [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] and his [[Gettysburg Address]].<ref group=Note>In the line from the second inaugural, "With high hope for the future," the ''F'' in ''FUTURE'' was carved as an ''E''. To obscure this error the spurious bottom line of the E is not painted in with black paint.</ref> Bordering these inscriptions are [[pilaster]]s ornamented with [[fasces]], eagles, and wreaths. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation are by [[Evelyn Beatrice Longman]].<ref name=nrhp2/>

The Memorial is replete with symbolic elements. The 36 columns represent the states of the Union at the time of [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's death]]; the 48 stone festoons above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922. Inside, each inscription is surmounted by a {{convert|60|by|12|ft|m|adj=on}} mural by [[Jules Guerin]] portraying principles seen as evident in Lincoln's life: Freedom, Liberty, Mortality, Justice, and the Law on the south wall; Unity, Fraternity, and Charity on the north. Cypress trees, representing Eternity, are in the murals' backgrounds. The murals' paint incorporated kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture.<ref name=nrhp3>NRHP Nomination, p. 3</ref>

The ceiling consists of bronze girders ornamented with laurel and oak leaves. Between these are panels of [[Sylacauga marble|Alabama marble]], saturated with [[Mineral oil|paraffin]] to increase translucency. But feeling that the statue required even more light, Bacon and French designed metal slats for the ceiling to conceal floodlights, which could be modulated to supplement the natural light; this modification was installed in 1929. The one major alteration since was the addition of an elevator for the disabled in the 1970s.<ref name=nrhp3/>

=== Undercroft ===
Below the memorial is an [[undercroft]]. Due to water seeping through the calcium carbonate within the marble, over time [[stalactites]] and [[stalagmites]] have formed within the undercroft.<ref>[[United Press]] (August 28, 1957) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19570828&id=znIzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zu4HAAAAIBAJ&pg=4867,7051275 "Lincoln Memorial has some stalactites"] ''[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]''</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, there were regular tours of the undercroft.<ref>Hodge, Paul (October 27, 1977) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1977/10/27/whats-afoot-under-abe-lincolns-feet/f48997a6-1f6a-466d-b3fe-2b9ad2db4532/ "What's Afoot Under Abe Lincoln's Feet?"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref> The tours stopped abruptly in 1989 after a visitor noticed [[asbestos]] and notified the [[National Park Service]].<ref>Twoomey, Steve (April 9, 1990) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1990/04/09/monuments-losing-battle-with-erosion/1c59551e-bdc4-4c0c-9cf7-47e51c74da7c/ "Monuments Losing Battle with Erosion"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref> For the memorial's centennial in 2022, the undercroft is planned to be open to visitors following a rehabilitation project funded by [[David Rubenstein]].<ref>Staff (ndg) [https://parkplanning.nps.gov/projectHome.cfm?projectId=66405 "Lincoln Center Rehabilitation"] [[National Park Service]] website</ref><ref>Reid, Chip (November 23, 2016) [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lincoln-memorial-prepares-for-long-awaited-makeover-david-rubenstein/ "Lincoln Memorial to get long-awaited makeover, underground visitor's center"] [[CBS News]]</ref>

Lying between the north and south chambers of the open-air Memorial is the central hall, which contains the large solitary [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|figure of Abraham Lincoln]] sitting in contemplation. Its sculptor, [[Daniel Chester French]], supervised the [[Piccirilli Brothers]] in its construction, and it took four years to complete.

The {{convert|175|ST|MT|lk=on}} statue, carved from Georgia white marble, was shipped in 28 pieces.<ref name=nrhp3/> Originally intended to be only {{convert|10|ft|m}} tall, the sculpture was enlarged to {{convert|19|ft|m}} from head to foot considering it would look small within the extensive interior space.<ref name=”dupre”>{{cite book|last=[[Judith Dupré|Dupré, Judith]] | date= 2007 | title= Monuments: America's History in Art and Memory | url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Monuments/6kUaAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 | location=New York | publisher= Random House | pages= 86–95| isbn=978-1-4000-6582-0}}</ref> If Lincoln were depicted standing he would be {{convert|28|ft|m}} tall.

The widest span of the statue corresponds to its height, and it rests upon an oblong pedestal of Tennessee marble {{convert|10|ft|m}} high, {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|17|ft|m}} deep. Directly beneath this lies a platform of Tennessee marble about {{convert|34.5|ft|m}} long, {{convert|28|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|6.5|in|m}} high. Lincoln's arms rest on representations of Roman  fasces, a subtle touch that associates the statue with the Augustan (and imperial) theme (obelisk and funerary monuments) of the Washington Mall.<ref>See [[Edmund Buchner|Buchner, Edmund]] (1976).

===Sculptural features===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln Stands Guard.jpg|thumb|The sculptor's possible use of sign language is speculated, as the statue's left hand forms an "A" while the right hand portrays an "L"]]
An [[urban legend]] holds that the face of General [[Robert E. Lee]] is carved onto the back of Lincoln's head,<ref name=npsfaq /> and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]] (now within the bounds of [[Arlington National Cemetery]]). Another popular legend is that Lincoln's hands are shown using [[sign language]] to represent his initials, his left hand signing an ''A'' and his right signing an ''L''. The National Park Service denies both legends.<ref name=npsfaq>[http://www.nps.gov/linc/faqs.htm "Lincoln Memorial: Frequently Asked Questions"] on the [[National Park Service]] website</ref>

However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with [[American Sign Language]], and he would have had a reason to do so, that is, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving [[Gallaudet University]], a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees.<ref>Prokopowicz, Gerald J. (2008) ''Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions About Abraham Lincoln''. Pantheon. {{ISBN|978-0-375-42541-7}}</ref> The [[National Geographic Society]]'s publication "Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C." states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language.<ref>Evelyn, Douglas E. and Dickson, Paul A.

Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln's hands carved to represent the letters "A" and "L" in American Sign Language, "I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands."<ref>Percoco, James A., speech given on April 17, 2008, in the Jefferson Room of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] as part of the National Archive's "Noontime Programs" lecture series.

== Sacred space ==
[[File:View of Crowd at 1963 March on Washington.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963 brought 250,000 people to the [[National Mall]] and is famous for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.]]
[[File:i-have-a-dream-site crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The location on the steps where King delivered the speech is commemorated with this inscription.]]

The Memorial has become a symbolically sacred venue especially for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] refused to allow the African-American [[Alto (voice)|contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] to perform before an integrated audience at the organization's [[Constitution Hall]]. At the suggestion of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the wife of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harold L. Ickes]], the Secretary of the Interior, arranged for a performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday of that year, to a live audience of 75,000 and a nationwide radio audience.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fdrlibrary.org/anderson |title=Eleanor Roosevelt and Marian Anderson |publisher=FDR Presidential Library & Museum |language=en-US |access-date=2018-05-28 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On August 28, 1963, the memorial grounds were the site of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which proved to be a high point of the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]. It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people came to the event, where they heard [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], deliver his historic "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech before the memorial honoring the president who had issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] 100 years earlier.  King's speech, with its language of patriotism and its evocation of Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]], was meant to match the symbolism of the Lincoln Memorial as a monument to national unity.<ref>Fairclough, Adam (1997) "Civil Rights and the Lincoln Memorial: The Censored Speeches of Robert R. Moton (1922) and John Lewis (1963)" ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' v.82 pp.408–416.</ref> Labor leader [[Walter Reuther]], an organizer of the march, persuaded the other organizers to move the march to the Lincoln Memorial from the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]]. Reuther believed the location would be less threatening to Congress and that the occasion would be especially appropriate underneath the gaze of Abraham Lincoln's statute.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maraniss|first=David|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894936463|title=Once in a Great City: A Detroit Story|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4767-4838-2|location=New York|pages=236|oclc=894936463}}</ref> The D.C. police also appreciated the location because it was surrounded on three sides by water, so that any incident could be easily contained.<ref>Jennings, Peter and Brewster, Todd (1998) ''The Century: A Chronicle of the 20th Century''. New York: Doubleday. {{isbn|9780385483278}}</ref> 

Twenty years later, on August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices.  King's speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln's statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/stand-where-martin-luther-king-jr-gave-the-i-have-a-dream-speech.htm |title=Stand Where Martin Luther King, Jr. Gave the "I Have a Dream" Speech |publisher=National Park Service |language=en |access-date=2018-05-28 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

At the memorial on May 9, 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] had a [[Richard Nixon's visit to the Lincoln Memorial|middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters]] who, just days after the [[Kent State shootings]], were preparing to [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|march against the Vietnam War]].<ref name="Nix Prez Rev">{{cite video| people=Director: Joe Angio|title=Nixon a Presidency Revealed|medium=television|publisher=History Channel|date=2007-02-15}}</ref>

On February 27, 2017, [[graffiti]] written in [[permanent marker]] was found at the memorial, the [[Washington Monument]], the [[District of Columbia War Memorial]], and the [[National World War II Memorial]], saying "Jackie shot JFK", "blood test is a lie", as well as other claims. Street signs and utility boxes were also defaced. Authorities believed that a single person was responsible for all the vandalism.<ref>Staff (February 21, 2017) [http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/World-War-II-Memorial-Lincoln-Memorial-Washington-Monument-Vandalized-in-DC-414365003.html "World War II Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, DC War Memorial Vandalized"] NBC 4 Washington News</ref>

On August 15, 2017, [[Reuters]] reported that "Fuck law" was [[spray paint]]ed in red on one of the columns. The initials "M+E" were etched on the same pillar. A "mild, gel-type architectural paint stripper" was used to remove the paint without damaging the memorial. However, the etching was deemed "permanent damage." A [[Smithsonian Institution]] directional sign several blocks away was also defaced.<ref>Staff (August 15, 2017) [http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Lincoln-Memorial-Vandalized-With-Red-Spray-Paint-440565873.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_DCBrand "Lincoln Memorial Vandalized With Red Spray Paint"] NBC 4 Washington News</ref><ref>[[Reuters]] (August 15, 2017) [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/08/15/us/15reuters-washingtondc-memorial.html?_r=0 "Lincoln Memorial in Washington Defaced With Expletive"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

On September 18, 2017, Nurtilek Bakirov from [[Kyrgyzstan]] was arrested when a police officer saw him vandalizing the Memorial at around 1:00 PM EDT. Bakirov used a penny to carve the letters "HYPT MAEK" in what appeared to be [[Cyrillic alphabets|Cyrillic letters]] into the fifth pillar on the north side. {{as of|2017|9|20|df=US}}, police do not know what the words mean, although there is a possibility that they contain a reference to the vandal's name.  Court documents indicate that the letters cannot be completely removed, but could be polished at the cost of approximately $2,000.  A conservator for the National Park Service said that the stone would weather over time, helping to obscure the letters, although she characterized it as "permanent damage".<ref name="Police make arrest after man scratches memorial">{{cite news | author=Mower, Justin Wm. | title=Police arrest man accused of vandalizing the Lincoln Memorial with a penny | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/man-arrested-after-vandalizing-lincoln-memorial-with-penny-police-say/2017/09/19/084a7e54-9d5e-11e7-84fb-b4831436e807_story.html | newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]| date=September 19, 2017 | accessdate=20 September 2017}}</ref>

As one of the most prominent American monuments, the Lincoln Memorial is often featured in books, films, and television shows that take place in Washington; by 2003 it had appeared in over 60 films,<ref>Rosales, Jean K. and Jose, Michael R. (2003) ''DC Goes to the Movies: A Unique Guide to Reel Washington'' iUniverse.

Some examples of films include [[Frank Capra]]'s 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', where in a key scene the statue and the Memorial's inscription provide inspiration to freshman Senator Jefferson Smith, played by [[James Stewart]].<ref name="wp">{{cite news|last1=Toney|first1=Veronica|title=It's not just 'Forrest Gump.'

Additional films and television programs which use the Memorial include ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993); [[National Treasure (film)|''National Treasure'']] (2004), in which the main characters discuss the possibility of stealing the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] while sitting on the steps of the Memorial; the 2009 comedy ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'', where the statue of Lincoln helps Larry defeat the Horus warriors, voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]; the 1991 "[[Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'';<ref name="Sacher2014" /> the scene from ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), in which Forrest ([[Tom Hanks]]) delivers a speech standing on a podium in front of the Memorial facing the reflecting pool; the 2013 finale of ''[[The Amazing Race 22]]'', in which the final three teams had to find the spot where [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivered his historic 1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/entertainment/2013/05/the_amazing_race_recap_beacon.html|title=The Amazing Race recap: Beacon of Hope|work=[[The Birmingham News]]|last=Jacobson|first=Jennifer|date=6 May 2013|accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref> and the 2013 film ''[[White House Down]]'', in which the President ([[Jamie Foxx]]) requests a fly-by of the Lincoln Memorial, at both the beginning and the end of the movie to pay homage to his hero.<ref name="wp" /> In ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (season 3, episode 6), June, the lead character, is seen standing in front of the statue of Lincoln, which has been desecrated.

Many of the appearances of the Lincoln Memorial are actually digital [[visual effects]], due to restrictive filming rules.<ref name="Sacher2014">{{cite book|last=Sacher|first=Jay|title=Lincoln Memorial: The Story and Design of an American Monument|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JXiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|accessdate=February 12, 2017|date=May 6, 2014|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=9781452131986|pages=83–85}}</ref>  As of 2017, according to the [[National Park Service]], "Filming/photography is prohibited above the white marble steps and the interior chamber of the Lincoln Memorial."<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/nama/planyourvisit/permits-faqs.htm "Permit FAQS"] National Park Service</ref>

Mitchell Newton-Matza said in 2016 that "Reflecting its cherished place in the hearts of Americans, the Lincoln Memorial has often been featured prominently in popular culture, especially motion pictures."<ref>{{cite book|author=Mitchell Newton-Matza|title=Historic Sites and Landmarks that Shaped America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nW_YDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA324|year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=324|isbn=9781610697507}}</ref>  According to Tracey Gold Bennett, "The majesty of the Lincoln Memorial is a big draw for film location scouts, producers, and directors because this landmark has appeared in a considerable number of films."<ref>{{cite book|author=Tracey Gold Bennett|title=Washington, D.C., Film and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p76EAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|year=2014|publisher=Arcadia|page=27|isbn=9781439642764}}</ref>

Jay Sacher writes:

<blockquote>From high to low, the memorial is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism. From [[Forrest Gump]]'s [[Zelig]]-like insertion into anti-war rallies on the steps of the memorial, to the villainous [[Decepticon]] robots discarding the Lincoln statue and claiming it as a throne. ... The memorial's place in the culture is assured even as it is parodied.<ref name=Sacher2014 /></blockquote>

The site is also present in the 2017 [[Axis victory in world war ii|World War II alternative history]] [[video game]], [[Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus]], which is set in the 1960s where the Nazis took over America. The Washington Monument was reinforced to make it taller, and the statue of Abraham Lincoln was replaced with a seated statue of [[Adolf Hitler]]{{cn|date=December 2020}}
