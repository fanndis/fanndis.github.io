==Personal life==
In 2017, Chance was attending the [[University of Tulsa]] and majoring in History,<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8062510/watch-greyson-chance-low-premiere</ref> but he later dropped out to focus on music. On July 19, 2017, Chance [[Coming out|came out]] as gay in an [[Instagram]] post.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvYc54Hc51/ |first=Greyson |last=Chance |via=Instagram |date=July 19, 2017 |title=The decision to write this came after I received a message from a brave individual. Such message inspired me to shed light on an aspect of my private life which I have kept distant from my career in music. I came to fully recognize that I was gay when I was sixteen. I decided not to publicize my sexuality largely due to a matter of privacy, as I was still trying to find comfort and confidence within my own skin. Further, I always found conversations regarding music, politics, art, books – and the greatness of Nas' catalog – to be far more interesting than what type of guy I was into. This is still true today. While this message is most definitely overdue, I encourage anyone who is navigating their sexuality to devote as much time as they need to the process of finding self-confidence, self-acceptance, and self-love. Hell, for me, it took years to write this message. Nevertheless, I figured now was the time to let a few more friends know that I am happy, I am here for you, and I am proud of who I am.
