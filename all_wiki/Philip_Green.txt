''Financial Times'', 18 September 2015</ref>

When Green was twelve, his father died of a heart attack, and he inherited the family business. After leaving boarding school at 15 with no [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-levels]], Green worked for a shoe importer in [[East London]]<ref name="Guardian"/> before travelling to the US, Europe and the [[Far East]]. On his return, aged 21, he set up his first business, importing jeans from the Far East to sell on to London retailers. The business was assisted with a £20,000 loan (equivalent to £216,000 in 2014) backed by his family.<ref>China Influence. {{Cite web|url=http://chinainfluence.org/2016/02/16/the-brits-that-changed-china/|title=The Brits that Changed China|access-date=19 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221154502/http://chinainfluence.org/2016/02/16/the-brits-that-changed-china/|archive-date=21 February 2016|url-status=dead}} Phillip Green.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/45992860-5cb4-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html|title=Interview: Philip Green|work=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Pages/resources/inflationtools/calculator/flash/default.aspx|title=Inflation Calculator|publisher=Bank of England}}</ref>

In 1979, Green bought up, at low prices, the entire stock of ten designer-label clothes retailers that had gone into receivership.

In 2010, Green was again accused of using sweatshops, this time by [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' programme.

===Anti-Irish outburst===
When ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper investigated a proposed takeover of [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] in 2003, Green responded to queries about Arcadia's accounts by insulting and swearing at the journalists, asking them "Is this ''[[The Beano]]'' or ''The Guardian''?".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/mar/04/supermarkets|title=Days of anger, shouting, abuse and threats|date=4 March 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 April 2009|location=London, UK}}</ref>

Green issued an apology to the Irish later, to prevent a customer boycott, according to ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/mar/05/2|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|first=Julia|last=Finch|title=Threat of consumer boycott leads to Bhs owner issuing apology to the Irish|date=5 March 2003}}</ref>

===Demise of BHS===
[[File:British Home Stores closing down sale Wood Green, London 3 August 2016 10.jpg|thumb|right|Advertising the closing down sale for a London branch of BHS.]]
Green bought [[British Home Stores|BHS]] for £200m in 2000, but the firm performed poorly so he sold it for just £1 in 2015. By April 2016 BHS had debts of £1.3bn, including a pensions deficit of £571m.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35834473 |title=The demise of BHS on the High Street |work=[[BBC News]] |date=25 April 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2016 }}</ref> Despite the deficit of £571m, Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. Referring to the conduct of Green, [[Angela Eagle]], the shadow business secretary, said: "In this situation it appears this owner extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from the business and walked away to his favourite tax haven, leaving the Pension Protection Scheme to pick up the bill."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration |title=BHS paid more than £25m to owner in 13 months before administration |author1=Graham Ruddick |author2=Sarah Butler |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 April 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2016 }}</ref> [[Simon Walker (business)|Simon Walker]], the Director General of the [[Institute of Directors]], described Green's "lamentable failure of behaviour" which was deeply damaging to the reputation of business. He then added that he had moral responsibilities to the pension fund and a proper investigation was needed but not one that took years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/03/sir-philip-green-accused-of--lamentable-failure-over-bhs-collaps/|title=Sir Philip Green accused of  'lamentable failure' over BHS collapse |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref> It took months for the negotiation to be settled down, it ended with Green agreeing to a voluntary settlement of £363m into the scheme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/27/sir-philip-green-main-bhs-sale-pension-regulator-report|title=Green's 'main purpose' in BHS sale was to avoid pension liability, says watchdog|last=Butler|first=Sarah|date=27 June 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Appearance before joint Select Committee meeting===
Ahead of a joint Business and Work and Pensions Select Committee meeting, Green called the inquiry biased, and stated that he "therefore required [its chair, Frank Field] to resign". Field pointed out that the size of the pensions deficit is a fact, not a matter of opinion, and that Parliament and not Green decides who chairs Committees.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/11/philip-green-calls-for-frank-field-resign-bhs-topshop|title=Sir Philip Green calls for Frank Field to resign |work=The Guardian|author=Chris Johnston|date=11 June 2016|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref>

===Knighthood===
In 2016, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] approved a motion asking the [[Honours Forfeiture Committee]] to recommend Green's knighthood be "cancelled and annulled". One hundred MPs voted in favour of the motion, the first time MPs have proposed someone be stripped of a knighthood.<ref name="dt102016">{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Laura|title='Sir Philip Green 'beat BHS black and blue' say MPs as they approve calls to strip him of his knighthood'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/20/mps-to-vote-on-motion-to-strip-sir-philip-green-of-knighthood-ov|accessdate=20 October 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> The vote was not binding on the government.

===Sexual harassment and bullying allegations===
In October 2018, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that "a leading businessman has been granted an injunction against" the newspaper to stop the "newspaper revealing alleged sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff".<ref name="Newell">{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/23/british-metoo-scandal-cannot-revealed/|title=The British #MeToo scandal which cannot be revealed|last=Newell|first=Claire|date=23 October 2018|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2019-05-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}<!-- Article published on a Tuesday. --></ref> The following day, in the [[House of Lords]], Labour peer [[Peter Hain]] exercised [[parliamentary privilege]] to name Green as the subject of the allegations.<ref name="Elgot">{{cite news |last1=Elgot |first1=Jessica |title=Philip Green: I am not guilty of unlawful sexual, racist behaviour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/sir-philip-green-named-as-man-at-centre-of-uk-metoo-scandal |accessdate=26 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=26 October 2018 |pages=1, 6}}</ref> ''The Telegraph'' said that the allegations would "reignite the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo movement]] against the mistreatment of women, minorities and others by powerful employers.<ref name="Newell" /> Opposition MPs, including Labour MPs [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] and [[Jess Phillips]], and Liberal Democrat leader [[Vince Cable]], called for a revocation of Green's knighthood.

In May 2019, Green was charged with four counts of [[misdemeanor assault]] in the US after an [[Arizona]] [[Pilates]] teacher accused him of frequently touching her inappropriately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-people-philip-green-idUKKCN1T12A5|title=Retail tycoon Philip Green charged in U.S. with spanking pilates...|date=31 May 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=2 June 2019|language=en}}</ref>

=== COVID-19 ===
In response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Green's Arcadia Group closed 550 stores in the UK, furloughing 14,500 of its workers in the process. Arcadia Group publicly requested taxpayer help to cover the pay of the furloughed workers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group requests taxpayer help to pay staff amid coronavirus pandemic|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/916610/sir-philip-greens-arcadia-group-requests-taxpayer-help-to-pay-staff-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-916610.html|date=3 April 2020|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|language=en|access-date=12 May 2020}}</ref>
