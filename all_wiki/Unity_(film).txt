==Premise==
{{quote box|width=250px|
The title "''Unity''{{-"}} signifies the intention of the content. It's not so much to entertain, like a past-time, but rather turn something "on" inside you that has been suppressed or forgotten by the mask that society or tradition puts upon us. But more than that the film also helps relate us to the mystery of existence, to all of existence, which we are merely a part.|--[[Shaun Monson]]<ref name=Variety />}}

''Unity'' is a documentary that explores humanity's transformation, presented in five chapters: "Cosmic", "Mind", "Body", "Heart" and "Soul".<ref name=UnityWebsite />
