== Background ==
As per the requirements of the Indian Constitution, [[Elections in India|elections to the Lok Sabha]] must be held at an interval of five years or whenever parliament is dissolved by the [[President of India|president]]. The [[2009 Indian general election|previous election]], to the [[15th Lok Sabha]], was conducted in April–May 2009, and its term would have naturally expired on 31 May 2014. The election to the 16th Lok Sabha was organised and conducted by the [[Election Commission of India]] (ECI) and was held in multiple phases, to better handle the large electoral base and security concerns.

Since the last general election in 2009, the [[2011 Indian anti-corruption movement|anti-corruption movement]] by [[Anna Hazare]], and other similar moves by [[Ramdev|Baba Ramdev]] and [[Arvind Kejriwal]] (founder of [[Aam Aadmi Party]]), gathered momentum and political interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seekersfind.in/loksabha-election-2014-prediction-survey/ |title=Lok Sabha election 2014 predictions Survey&nbsp;– Opinion Poll |publisher=Seekers Find .in |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=31 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804032238/http://www.seekersfind.in/loksabha-election-2014-prediction-survey/ |archivedate=4 August 2013  }}</ref> Kejriwal went on to form a separate political party, Aam Aadmi Party, in November 2012. The [[2012 Indian presidential election|2012 presidential election]] resulted in [[Pranab Mukherjee]] of [[Indian National Congress]] becoming the president.  Andhra politics was further shaken following the death of its [[Chief Minister (India)|chief minister]], [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy]]. His son, [[Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy]], then broke from the [[Indian National Congress|INC]] and founded the [[YSR Congress Party]], taking several politicians with him.

The final session of parliament started on 6 February and ended on 21 February. Amongst the agenda in the final session was passing [[The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill, 2013]] in tackling corruption and the creation of Telangana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/521241|title=Stormy session marks Indian Parliament's last session before 2014 elections|publisher=Arabnews.com|date=6 February 2014}}</ref>

==Controversies==
{{further|Campaigning in the Indian general election, 2014#Controversies}}
During the course of the campaign, several controversies arose with parties being accused by one another and the [[Election Commission of India]] of violating [[Election Commission of India's Model Code of Conduct]] that is in force during the election.

In the run-up to the election the [[media in India]] was criticised for its establishment ties between family owners and political parties. It caused self-censorship and editorial dismissals at certain media outlets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sevanti Ninan|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/india-media-20131119151238287298.html |title='Managing' India's media|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref>

''[[India Today]]'' temporarily suspended its [[CVoter]] opinion poll in late February after a News Express sting operation suggesting Polling Agencies like Ipsos and CVoter fudged the numbers to show BJP candidate Narendra Modi in the lead. However, with the final results matching the Modi landslide projected by the polls; the unsubstantiated charges were proved to be politically motivated. The 2014 elections confirmed the accuracy of the Election Polling in India.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/india-today-suspends-c-voter-after-sting-alleged-it-fixed-opinion-polls-1408579.html |title=India Today suspends C-voter after sting alleged it fixed opinion polls |work=Firstpost |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>

==Voting==
According to the [[Election Commission of India]], 814.5 million people were eligible to vote, with an increase of 100 million voters since the last general election in 2009,<ref name="India announces election dates"/> making this the largest-ever election in the world.<ref name="news.biharprabha.com"/> Around 23.1 million or 2.7% of the total eligible voters were aged 18–19 years.<ref name="dnaindia.com"/>

He accused the people who "were in charge of important departments and held key positions" of not listening to party cadres and MPs, which he believed prevented a "diverse opinion" from being heard and "shut out a lot of people".

It is not the advisors alone. The people who take the advice also have to bear responsibility. Those who gave advice and those who received the advice as also those who feel they can give better advice – all have to bear responsibility."
