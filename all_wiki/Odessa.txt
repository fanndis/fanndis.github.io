Before the Tsarist establishment of Odessa, an [[ancient Greek]] settlement existed at its location. A more recent [[Tatars|Tatar]] settlement was also founded at the location by [[Hacı I Giray]], the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]] in 1440 that was named after him as Hacibey (or [[Khadjibey]]).<ref>Pultar, Gonul. {{Google books|KhiQAwAAQBAJ|Imagined Identities: Identity Formation in the Age of Globalization|page=355}}</ref> After a period of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duchy]] control, Hacibey and surroundings became part of the domain of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]]s in 1529 and remained there until the empire's defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1792.

In 1794, the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the [[Russian Empire|Russian empress]] [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]]. From 1819 to 1858, Odessa was a [[list of free ports|free port]]—a [[Free economic zone|porto-franco]]. During the Soviet period, it was the most important port of trade in the [[Soviet Union]] and a Soviet [[naval dockyard|naval base]]. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and [[free economic zone]] for a period of 25 years.

During the 19th century, Odessa was the fourth largest city of Imperial Russia, after [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Warsaw]].<ref name="PH">{{cite journal |first=Patricia |last=Herlihy |author-link=Patricia Herlihy |year=1977 |title=The Ethnic Composition of the City of Odessa in the Nineteenth Century |journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=53–78 |url=http://www.huri.harvard.edu/pdf/hus_volumes/vI_n1march1977.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529124351/http://www.huri.harvard.edu/pdf/hus_volumes/vI_n1march1977.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 May 2008 }}</ref> Its historical architecture has a style more [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles.

Odessa is a [[warm-water port]]. The city of Odessa hosts both the [[Port of Odessa]] and [[Yuzhne|Port Yuzhne]], a significant oil [[container terminal|terminal]] situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, [[Port of Chornomorsk|Chornomorsk]], is located in the same [[oblast]], to the south-west of Odessa. Together they represent a major [[transport hub]] integrating with railways. Odessa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to Russian and European networks by strategic [[pipeline transport|pipelines]]. Current population is {{Ua-pop-est2020|1,017,699}}

== Name ==
The city was named in compliance with the [[Greek Plan]] of Catherine the Great. It was named after the ancient Greek city of [[Varna#Antiquity and Bulgarian conquest|Odessos]], which was mistakenly believed to have been located here. Odessa is located in between the ancient Greek cities of [[Tyras]] and [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], different from the ancient Odessos's location further west along the coast, which is at present day [[Varna]], Bulgaria.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcfLKHVi2UUC&pg=PA254|title=The Greek Settlements in Thrace Until the Macedonian Conquest|first=Benjamin H.|last=Isaac|date=1 January 1986|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9004069216}}</ref>

Catherine's [[secretary of state]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Adrian Gribovsky|ru|3=Грибовский, Адриан Моисеевич}} claimed in his memoirs that the name was his suggestion. Some expressed doubts about this claim, while others noted the reputation of Gribovsky as an honest and modest man.<ref>[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123898 "Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors"], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'',

=== Early history ===

Odessa was the site of a large [[Greek colony|Greek settlement]] no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a [[necropolis]] from the 5th–3rd centuries BC has long been known in this area). Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]]. Whether the Bay of Odessa is the ancient "Port of the Histrians" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence.<ref>"The Greek Colonisation of the Black Sea Area: Historical Interpretation of Archaeology," December 1998, Tsetskhladze, Gocha R. (ed.), ''Franz Steiner Verlag'', p. 41, n. 116.</ref> [[Artifact (archaeology)|Archaeological artifacts]] confirm extensive links between the Odessa area and the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

In the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odessa region included various [[nomad]]ic tribes ([[Pechenegs|Petchenegs]], [[Cumans]]), the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Crimean Khanate]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Yedisan]] [[Crimean Tatars]] traded there in the 14th century.

Since middle of the 13th century the city's territory belonged to the Golden Horde domain.<ref name=ehuver10>Vermenych, Ya.

During the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Hacı I Giray]] of [[Crimea]] (1441–1466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odessa was then a fortress known as [[Khadjibey]] (named for Hacı I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in [[Modern English|English]], Hacıbey or Hocabey in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and Hacıbey in [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]).

=== Ottoman Silistre ===
Khadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529<ref name=ehuver10/> as part of a region known as [[Yedisan]] after one of Nogay Hordes, and was administered in the Ottoman [[Silistra Eyalet|Silistra (Özi) Eyalet]], Sanjak of Özi.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the [[Fortification|fortress]] at Khadjibey (also was known Hocabey), which was named ''Yeni Dünya''<ref name=ehuver10/> (literally "New World").

The city of Odessa, founded by the Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]], centers on the site of the Turkish fortress Khadzhibei, which was occupied by a Russian Army in 1789. The Flemish engineer working for the empress, Franz de Volan ([[François Sainte de Wollant]]) recommended the area of Khadzhibei fortress as the site for the region's basic port: it had an ice-free harbor, breakwaters could be cheaply constructed that would render the harbor safe and it would have the capacity to accommodate large fleets. The Namestnik of Yekaterinoslav and Voznesensk, [[Platon Zubov]] (one of Catherine's favorites) supported this proposal, and in 1794 Catherine approved the founding of the new port-city and invested the first money in constructing the city.

However, adjacent to the new official locality, a [[Moldavia]]n colony already existed, which by the end of the 18th century was an independent settlement named [[Moldavanka]]. Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odessa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of Khadjibey (since 1795 Odessa proper), on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odessa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.<ref name="Richardson, p.110">[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 110.</ref>

===Renaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port===
In 1795 Khadjibey was officially renamed as Odessa after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area.<ref name=ehuver10/><ref name=ukrssrtronko>[[Petro Tronko]]. ''[http://ukrssr.com.ua/odeska/viniknennya-i-rozvitok-mista-odesa Creation and development of the city of Odessa (Виникнення і розвиток міста Одеса)]''. [[The History of Cities and Villages of the Ukrainian SSR]].</ref> In reality it was located at the mouth of [[Tylihul Estuary]] (liman).<ref name=ehuver10/> The first census that was conducted in Odessa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people.<ref name=ehuver10/> Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odessa Commodity Exchange.<ref name=ehuver10/> In 1801 in Odessa had opened the first commercial bank.<ref name=ehuver10/> In 1803 the city accounted for 9,000 people.<ref name=ukrssrtronko/>

In their settlement, also known as Novaya Slobodka, the Moldavians owned relatively small plots on which they built village-style houses and cultivated vineyards and gardens. What became Mykhailovsky Square was the center of this settlement and the site of its first [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox church]], the [[Church of the Dormition (Odessa)|Church of the Dormition]], built in 1821 close to the seashore, as well as of a cemetery. Nearby stood the [[barracks|military barracks]] and the country houses (''[[dacha]]'') of the city's wealthy residents, including that of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], appointed by Tzar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] as Governor of Odessa in 1803.

[[File:Большая Московская.jpg|thumb|upright|right|In the mid-19th century Odessa became a resort town famed for its popularity among the Russian upper classes. This popularity prompted a new age of investment in the building of hotels and leisure projects.]]

In the period from 1795 to 1814 the population of Odessa increased 15 times over and reached almost 20 thousand people. The first city plan was designed by the engineer F. Devollan in the late 18th century.<ref name="UKRWorld"/> Colonists of various ethnicities settled mainly in the area of the former colony, outside of the official boundaries, and as a consequence, in the first third of the 19th century, Moldavanka emerged as the dominant settlement. After planning by the official architects who designed buildings in Odessa's central district, such as the Italians [[Francesco Carlo Boffo]] and [[Giovanni Torricelli]], Moldovanka was included in the general city plan, though the original grid-like plan of Moldovankan streets, lanes and squares remained unchanged.<ref name="Richardson, p.110"/>

The new city quickly became a major success although initially it received little state funding and privileges.<ref name="older settlements already">[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/123898 Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (18 November 2014)</ref> Its early growth owed much to the work of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]], who served as the city's governor between 1803 and 1814. Having fled the [[French Revolution]], he had served in [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine's]] army against the Turks. He is credited with designing the city and organizing its amenities and infrastructure, and is considered{{by whom|date=August 2011}} one of the founding fathers of Odessa, together with another Frenchman, Count [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|Andrault de Langeron]], who succeeded him in office. Richelieu is commemorated by a [[bronze sculpture|bronze statue]], unveiled in 1828 to a design by [[Ivan Martos]]. His contributions to the city are mentioned by [[Mark Twain]] in his travelogue ''[[The Innocents Abroad|Innocents Abroad]]'': "I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa – watched over it with paternal care – labored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests – spent his fortune freely to the same end – endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old World".
[[File:CP Odessa Dom Russova circa 1920s.JPG|left|thumb|By the early 1900s Odessa had become a large, thriving city, complete with European architecture and electrified urban transport.]]

In 1819, the city became a free port, a status it retained until 1859. It became home to an extremely diverse population of Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Frenchmen, Germans (including Mennonites), Greeks, Italians, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, and traders representing many other nationalities (hence numerous "ethnic" names on the city's map, for example ''Frantsuzky'' (French) and ''Italiansky'' (Italian) Boulevards, ''Grecheskaya'' (Greek), ''Yevreyskaya'' (Jewish), ''Arnautskaya'' (Albanian) Streets). Its [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] nature was documented by the great [[List of Russian language poets|Russian poet]] [[Alexander Pushkin]], who lived in [[exile|internal exile]] in Odessa between 1823 and 1824. In his letters he wrote that Odessa was a city where "the air is filled with all Europe, French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read".

Odessa's growth was interrupted by the [[Crimean War]] of 1853–1856, during which it was bombarded by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Second French Empire|Imperial French]] naval forces.<ref>Clive Pointing, ''The Crimean War: The Truth Behind the Myth'', Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7011-7390-4}}.</ref> It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odessa Russia's largest grain-exporting port. In 1866, the city was linked by rail with [[Kyiv]] and [[Kharkiv]] as well as with [[Iaşi]] in Romania.

The city became the home of a large Jewish community during the 19th century, and by 1897 Jews were estimated to comprise some 37% of the population. The community, however, was repeatedly subjected to [[anti-Semitism]] and anti-Jewish agitation from almost all Christian segments of the population.<ref name="bh.org.il">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Odessa |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/odessa |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> [[Pogrom]]s were carried out in [[Odessa pogrom|1821, 1859, 1871, 1881 and 1905]]. Many Odessan Jews fled abroad after 1882, particularly to the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] region that became [[Palestine (region)#Late Ottoman and British Mandate periods|Palestine]], and the city became an important base of support for [[Zionism]].

=== Beginnings of revolution ===

In 1905, Odessa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the [[Russian battleship Potemkin]] and the [[Iskra#History|Menshevik]]'s [[Iskra]]. [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s famous motion picture ''The Battleship Potemkin'' commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odessan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the "Potemkin Steps"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history. At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duc de Richelieu]]. The actual massacre took place in streets nearby, not on the steps themselves, but the film caused many to visit Odessa to see the site of the "slaughter". The "Odessa Steps" continue to be a [[tourist attraction]] in Odessa. The film was made at [[Odessa Film Studio|Odessa's Cinema Factory]], one of the oldest cinema studios in the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]].

Following the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917 during [[Ukrainian-Soviet War]], Odessa saw two Bolshevik armed insurgencies, the [[Odessa Bolshevik Uprising|second of which]] succeeded in establishing their control over the city; for the following months the city became a center of the [[Odessa Soviet Republic]]. After signing of the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], providing support to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].<ref name=UkrainianWeekOd16042018>{{citation | last = Tynchenko | first = Yaros | title = The Ukrainian Navy and the Crimean Issue in 1917-18 | url = http://ukrainianweek.com/History/105648 | work = [[The Ukrainian Week]] | date = 23 March 2018 | accessdate = 14 October 2018}}</ref>

With the end of the [[World War I]] and withdrawal of armies of Central Powers, the Soviet forces fought for control over the country with the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. A few months later the city was occupied by the [[French Army]] and the [[Greek Army]] that supported the Russian [[White movement|White Army]] in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian general [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] who sided with Bolsheviks managed to drive the unwelcome [[Triple Entente]] forces out of the city, but Odessa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army. Finally, by 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure the city.

The people of Odessa suffered badly from a [[famine]] that resulted from the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1921–1922 due to the Soviet policies of [[prodrazverstka]].<gallery mode="packed-hover" caption="Revolutionary soldiers, Odessa - 1916" heights="200">

=== World War II ===
Odessa was attacked by Romanian and German troops in August 1941. The [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|defense of Odessa]] lasted 73 days from 5 August to 16 October 1941. The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes. The first line was {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} long and situated some {{convert|25|to|30|km|abbr=off}} from the city. The second and main line of defense was situated {{convert|6|to|8|km|abbr=off}} from the city and was about {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} long. The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself.

[[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Soviet Union|A medal]], [[Medal "For the Defence of Odessa"|"For the Defence of Odessa"]], was established on 22 December 1942. Approximately 38,000 medals were awarded to servicemen of the Soviet Army, Navy, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and civil citizens who took part in the city's defense. It was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of "[[Hero City]]" in 1945. (These others were [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], and [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Sevastopol]]).

[[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odessa. Her first two kills were effected near Belyayevka using a Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle with a P.E. 4-power scope. She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odessa. Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).

Before being occupied by Romanian troops in 1941, a part of the city's population, industry, infrastructure and all cultural valuables possible were evacuated to inner regions of the USSR and the retreating Red Army units destroyed as much as they could of Odessa's remaining harbour facilities. The city was [[land mine]]d in the same way as Kyiv.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

During [[World War II]], from 1941–1944, Odessa was subject to [[Romania during World War II|Romanian]] administration, as the city had been made part of [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Nataliya |author2=Yuri Kruglyak |url=http://www.odessitclub.org/en/archives/dallin/chapter_5.html#Elite |title=Odessa population during WWII |publisher=Odessitclub.org |access-date=28 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929073610/http://www.odessitclub.org/en/archives/dallin/chapter_5.html |archive-date=29 September 2011 }}</ref> Partisan fighting continued, however, in the [[Odessa Catacombs|city's catacombs]].

[[File:Odessa Soviet artilery.JPG|right|thumb|Soviet gun crew in action at Odessa in 1941]]

Following the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|Siege of Odessa]], and the [[Axis powers|Axis]] occupation, approximately 25,000 Odessans were murdered in the outskirts of the city and over 35,000 deported; this came to be known as the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]]. Most of the atrocities were committed during the first six months of the occupation which officially began on 17 October 1941, when 80% of the 210,000 Jews in the region were killed,<ref name="Richardson, p.33">[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 33.</ref> compared to Jews in Romania proper where the majority survived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/02/05/the-antonescu-paradox-romania-world-war-ii-hitler/|title=The Antonescu Paradox|date=5 February 2016|website=Foreign Policy}}</ref> After the Nazi forces began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, the Romanian administration changed its policy, refusing to deport the remaining [[Jewish population]] to extermination camps in German [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]], and allowing Jews to work as hired labourers. As a result, despite the events of 1941, the survival of the Jewish population in this area was higher than in other areas of occupied eastern Europe.<ref name="Richardson, p.33"/>

The city suffered severe damage and sustained many casualties over the course of the war. Many parts of Odessa were damaged during both its siege and recapture on 10 April 1944, when the city was finally liberated by the Red Army. Some of the Odessans had a more favourable view of the Romanian occupation, in contrast with the Soviet official view that the period was exclusively a time of hardship, deprivation, oppression and suffering – claims embodied in public monuments and disseminated through the media to this day.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 103.</ref> Subsequent Soviet policies imprisoned and executed numerous Odessans (and deported most of the German population) on account of collaboration with the occupiers.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 17.</ref>

=== Postwar history ===
[[File:RIAN archive 171693 Fleet of whalers lying up in Odessa port.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Ships at anchor in Odessa – the USSR's largest port, 1960]]

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew. Nevertheless, the majority of Odessa's Jews emigrated to [[Israel]], the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s. Many ended up in the [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood of [[Brighton Beach]], sometimes known as "Little Odessa". Domestic migration of the Odessan middle and [[Social class|upper classes]] to Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale. Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union.

[[File:Russov House Odessa2020.png|thumb|Nowadays the city is undergoing a phase of widespread urban restoration: Russov House in 2020]]
As a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the city preserved and somewhat reinforced its unique cosmopolitan mix of Russian/Ukrainian/Jewish culture and a predominantly [[Russophone]] environment with the [[:ru:Русский язык Одессы|uniquely accented dialect of Russian spoken in the city]]. The city's unique identity has been formed largely thanks to its varied demography; all the city's communities have influenced aspects of Odessan life in some way or form.

Odessa is a city of more than 1 million people. The city's industries include shipbuilding, [[oil refinery|oil refining]], chemicals, metalworking, and food processing. Odessa is also a Ukrainian [[Ukrainian Navy|naval]] base and home to a [[fishing fleet]]. It is known for its large outdoor market – the [[Seventh-Kilometer Market]], the largest of its kind in Europe.

The city has seen violence in the [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine]] during [[2014 Odessa clashes]]. The [[2 May 2014 Odessa clashes]] between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian protestors killed 42 people. Four were killed during the protests, and at least 32 trade unionists were killed after a trade union building was set on fire after Molotov cocktails exchange between sides<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-05-02|title=Ukraine clashes: dozens dead after Odessa building fire|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/ukraine-dead-odessa-building-fire|access-date=2020-10-16|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Canada|date=2 May 2014|title=At least 35 killed in Odessa, Ukraine, as building set on fire|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukrainian-helicopters-shot-down-pilots-killed-as-violence-breaks-out-in-eastern-city/article18385793/|url-status=dead|access-date=22 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506162417/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ukrainian-helicopters-shot-down-pilots-killed-as-violence-breaks-out-in-eastern-city/article18385793/|archive-date=6 May 2014}}</ref>.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
[[File:Воронцовський маяк.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Vorontsov Lighthouse]] in the Gulf of Odessa. The city is located on the Black Sea.]]
Odessa is situated ({{Coord|46|28|N|30|44|E|type:city(1,012,500)_region:UA}}) on terraced hills overlooking a small harbor on the [[Black Sea]] in the [[Gulf of Odessa]], approximately {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the estuary of the [[Dniester]] river and some {{convert|443|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Ukrainian capital [[Kyiv]]. The average elevation at which the city is located is around {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off}}, while the maximum is {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=off}} and minimum (on the coast) amounts to {{convert|4.2|m|1|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The city currently covers a territory of {{convert|162.42|km²|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="zakon.rada.gov.ua">{{cite web|url=https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3064-iii?lang=en|language=uk|website=zakon.rada.gov.ua|title=About change area of Odessa city}}</ref> the population density for which is around 6,139 persons/km². Sources of running water in the city include the Dniester River, from which water is taken and then purified at a processing plant just outside the city. Being located in the south of Ukraine, the topography of the area surrounding the city is typically flat and there are no large mountains or hills for many kilometres around. Flora is of the deciduous variety and Odessa is known for its tree-lined avenues which, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, made the city a favourite year-round retreat for the Russian aristocracy.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The city's location on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] has also helped to create a booming tourist industry in Odessa. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The city's Arkadia beach has long been a favourite place for relaxation, both for the city's inhabitants and its visitors.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} This is a large sandy beach which is located to the south of the city centre. Odessa's many sandy beaches are considered to be quite unique in Ukraine,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} as the country's southern coast (particularly in the Crimea) tends to be a location in which the formation of stoney and pebble beaches has proliferated.

The coastal cliffs adjacent to the city are home to frequent [[landslide]]s, resulting in a typical change of landscape along the Black Sea. Due to the fluctuating slopes of land, city planners are responsible for monitoring the stability of such areas, and for preserving potentially threatened building and other structures of the city [[above sea level]] near water.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cherkez|first1=E. A.|last2=Dragomyretska|first2=O. V.|last3=Gorokhovich|first3=Y.|date=11 November 2006|title=Landslide protection of the historical heritage in Odessa (Ukraine) |journal=Landslides|volume=3|issue=4|pages=303–309|doi=10.1007/s10346-006-0058-8|s2cid=17314959}}</ref> Also a potential danger to the infrastructure and architecture of the city is the presence of multiple openings underground. These cavities can cause buildings to collapse, resulting in a loss of money and business. Due to the effects of climate and weather on sedimentary rocks beneath the city, the result is instability under some buildings' foundations.

=== Climate ===
Odessa has a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'', using the {{convert|0|C|disp=sqbr}} isotherm) that borderlines the [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'') as well as a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') This has, over the past few centuries, aided the city greatly in creating conditions necessary for the development of summer tourism. During the tsarist era, Odessa's climate was considered to be beneficial for the body, and thus many wealthy but sickly persons were sent to the city in order to relax and recuperate. This resulted in the development of spa culture and the establishment of a number of high-end hotels in the city. The average annual temperature of sea is {{convert|13|-|14|C}}, whilst seasonal temperatures range from an average of {{convert|6|C}} in the period from January to March, to {{convert|23|C}} in August. Typically, for a total of 4 months – from June to September – the average sea temperature in the Gulf of Odessa and city's bay area exceeds {{convert|20|C}}.<ref name="weather2travel">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/ukraine/odessa.php|title=Odessa Climate Guide|accessdate=5 June 2009}}</ref>

The city typically experiences dry, cold winters, which are relatively mild when compared to most of Ukraine as they're marked by temperatures which rarely fall below {{convert|-10|C}}. Summers on the other hand do see an increased level of precipitation, and the city often experiences warm weather with temperatures often reaching into the high 20s and low 30s. Snow cover is often light or moderate, and municipal services rarely experience the same problems that can often be found in other, more northern, Ukrainian cities. This is largely because the higher winter temperatures and coastal location of Odessa prevent significant snowfall. Additionally the city hardly ever faces the phenomenon of sea-freezing.

A 2015 study by the [[International Republican Institute]] found that 68% of Odessa was ethnic Ukrainian, and 25% ethnic Russian.<ref name=iri1/>

Despite Odessa's Ukrainian majority, [[Russian language|Russian]] is the dominant language in the city. In 2015, the main language spoken at home was [[Russian language|Russian]] − around 78% of the total population − followed by [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] at 6%, and an equal combination of Ukrainian and Russian, 15%.<ref name=iri1>{{cite journal|title=Ukrainian Municipal Survey, March 2–20, 2015|journal=IRI|url=http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2015-05-19_ukraine_national_municipal_survey_march_2-20_2015.pdf}}</ref>

Odessa oblast is also home to a number of other nationalities and minority [[ethnic group]]s, including [[Albanians]], [[Armenians]], [[Azeris]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Georgians]], [[Greeks]], [[Jews]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], among others.<ref name=Census2001/> Up until the early 1940s the city had a large Jewish population. As the result of [[Holocaust|mass deportation to extermination camps]] during the [[Second World War]], the city's Jewish population declined considerably. Since the 1970s, the majority of the remaining Jewish population [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]] and other countries, shrinking the Jewish community.

Through most of the 19th century and until the mid 20th century, the largest ethnic group in Odessa was [[Russians]], with the second largest ethnic group being [[Jews]].<ref>Dnistryansky, М.S.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
[[File:Будівля старої біржі, Одеса DSC8077.jpg|left|thumb|[[Odessa City Hall]], the seat of the city's municipal authorities]]
Whilst Odessa is the [[Capital city|administrative centre]] of the [[Odessa Oblast]], the city is also the main constituent of the Odessa Municipality. However, since Odessa is a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]], this makes the city subject directly to the administration of the oblast's authorities, thus removing it from the responsibility of the municipality.

The city of Odessa is governed by a mayor and city council which work cooperatively to ensure the smooth-running of the city and procure its municipal bylaws. The city's budget is also controlled by the administration.

The mayoralty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/ua/mayor |title=Official Website of the city administration: Structure of the Mayorality |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> plays the role of the executive in the city's municipal administration. Above all comes the mayor, who is elected, by the city's electorate, for five years in a direct election. [[2015 Ukrainian local elections#Odessa|2015 Mayoral election of Odessa]] [[Gennadiy Trukhanov]] was reelected in the first round of the election with 52,9% of the vote.<ref name="en.interfax.com.ua">{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/299747.html|title=Incumbent Odesa Mayor Trukhanov declared winner in Sunday mayoral election|work=interfax.com.ua}}</ref> Trukhanov was again reelected in the second round of the [[2020 Ukrainian local elections#Odessa|2020 Mayoral election of Odessa]] when 54.28% of the voters voted for him.<ref name="tyzhden.ua/post/249910">{{in lang|uk}} [https://m.tyzhden.ua/post/249910 Trukhanov officially won the mayoral election in Odessa], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (17 November 2020)</ref> 

There are five deputy mayors, each of which is responsible for a certain particular part of the city's public policy.
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary b42 726-0.jpg|right|thumb|An old map of Odessa's city centre.  North is to the left.]]
The City Council<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/council/ |title=Official Website of the city administration: City Council |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> of the city makes up the administration's [[legislative]] branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or [[rada]]. The municipal council is made up of 120 elected members,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/ua/council/members/ |title=City Council members |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council is the fifth in the city's modern history, and was elected in January 2011. In the regular meetings of the municipal council, problems facing the city are discussed, and annually the city's budget is drawn up. The council has seventeen standing commissions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessa.ua/council/commissions/ |title=Official Website of the city administration, Standing commissions of the City Council |publisher=Odessa.ua |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> which play an important role in controlling the finances and trading practices of the city and its merchants.

The territory of Odessa is divided into four administrative [[raion]]s (districts):
* Kyivsky Raion
* Malynovsky Raion
* Prymorsky Raion
* Suvorovsky Raion

In addition, every [[raion]] has its own administration, subordinate to the Odessa [[City council]], and with limited responsibilities.

Many of Odessa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture. This is particularly noticeable in buildings built by architects such as the Italian [[Francesco Boffo]], who in early 19th-century built a palace and colonnade for the Governor of Odessa, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the [[Potocki Palace, Odessa|Potocki Palace]] and many other public buildings.

[[File:Opera2011.jpg|thumb|The [[Baroque architecture#Rome and Southern Italy|Italian baroque]] facade of the [[Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater]].]]
In 1887 one of the city's most well known architectural monuments was completed – the theatre, which still hosts a range of performances to this day; it is widely regarded as one of the world's finest opera houses. The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by [[Ferdinand Fellner|Fellner]] and [[Hermann Helmer|Helmer]] in [[neo-baroque]]; its luxurious hall was built in the [[rococo]] style. It is said that thanks to its unique acoustics even a whisper from the stage can be heard in any part of the hall. The theatre was projected along the lines of Dresden's [[Semperoper]] built in 1878, with its nontraditional foyer following the curvatures of the auditorium; the building's most recent renovation was completed in 2007.<ref>Buildings for Music, Michael Forsythe, Cambridge University Press, p. 344 {{ISBN|9780521268622}}</ref>

[[File:Ekaterininskay square Odessa 2010.JPG|thumb|left|The centre of Odessa, with its statue of [[Catherine the Great]], is one of the city's central landmarks.]]
Odessa's most iconic symbol, the [[Potemkin Stairs]], is a vast staircase that conjures an illusion so that those at the top only see a series of large steps, while at the bottom all the steps appear to merge into one pyramid-shaped mass. The original 200 steps (now reduced to 192) were designed by Italian architect Francesco Boffo and built between 1837 and 1841. The steps were made famous by [[Sergei Eisenstein]] in his film, [[Battleship Potemkin]].

Most of the city's 19th-century houses were built of [[limestone]] mined nearby. Abandoned mines were later used and broadened by local [[smuggling|smugglers]]. This created a gigantic complicated [[labyrinth]] of tunnels beneath Odessa, known as "[[Odessa Catacombs]]". During World War II, the catacombs served as a hiding place for [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] and natural shelter for civilians, who were escaping air plane bombing.
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Приморский бульвар, 11.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Londonskaya Hotel]], on Odessa's magnificent Primorsky Bulvar, is one of the city's landmark buildings.]]

Deribasivska Street, an attractive pedestrian avenue named after José de Ribas, the Spanish-born founder of Odessa and decorated Russian Navy Admiral from the Russo-Turkish War, is famous by its unique character and architecture.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} During the summer it is common to find large crowds of people leisurely sitting and talking on the outdoor terraces of numerous cafés, bars and restaurants, or simply enjoying a walk along the cobblestone street, which is not open to vehicular traffic and is kept shaded by the linden trees which line its route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/deribasovskaya/ |access-date=26 December 2011 |url-status=dead |title=Deribasovskaya Street|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104105310/http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/deribasovskaya/ |archive-date=4 January 2012 }}</ref> A similar streetscape can also be found in that of Primorsky Bulvar, a grand thoroughfare which runs along the edge of the plateau upon which the city is situated, and where many of the city's most imposing buildings are to be found.

As one of the biggest on the Black Sea, Odessa's port is busy all year round. The Odessa Sea Port is located on an artificial stretch of Black Sea coast, along with the north-western part of the Gulf of Odessa. The total shoreline length of Odessa's sea port is around {{convert|7.23|km|2|abbr=out}}. The port, which includes an oil refinery, container handling facility, passenger area and numerous areas for handling dry cargo, is lucky in that its work does not depend on seasonal weather; the harbour itself is defended from the elements by breakwaters. The port is able to handle up to 14 million tons of cargo and about 24 million tons of oil products annually, whilst its passenger terminals can cater for around 4 million passengers a year at full capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/odessa-passage/ |access-date=26 December 2011 |url-status=dead |title=The Passage|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104104712/http://www.odessaapartments.dompavlov.com/content/odessa-passage/ |archive-date=4 January 2012 }}</ref>

=== Parks and gardens ===
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Свято-Преображенский кафедральный собор 02.jpg|left|thumb|The city's Preobrazhensky Park surrounds its cathedral.]]
[[File:Odessa AlexanderII colomn and spruce tree.jpg|thumb|right|The Alexander Column in [[Shevchenko Park (Odessa)|Schevchenko Park]]]]
[[File:Primorskiy Parkway.jpg|thumb|right|Park zone at Primorskiy prospekt in Odessa]]
There are a number of public parks and gardens in Odessa, among these are the Preobrazhensky, Gorky and Victory parks, the latter of which is an arboretum. The city is also home to a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and a number of other smaller gardens.

The [[Odessa city garden|City Garden]], or Gorodskoy Sad, is perhaps the most famous of Odessa's gardens. Laid out in 1803 by Felix De Ribas (brother of the founder of Odessa, [[José de Ribas]]) on a plot of urban land he owned, the garden is located right in the heart of the city. When Felix decided that he was no longer able to provide enough money for the garden's upkeep, he decided to present it to the people of Odessa.<ref>{{cite web|first=Oleg|last=Gubar|url=https://www.odessitclub.org/publications/almanac/alm_27/alm_27_28-45.pdf |title=How was the City Garden formed? |publisher=Odessitclub |date= 2011}}</ref> The transfer of ownership took place on 10 November 1806. Nowadays the garden is home to a bandstand and is the traditional location for outdoor theater in the summertime. Numerous sculptures can also be found within the grounds as well as a musical fountain, the waters of which are computer controlled to coordinate with the musical melody being played.

Odessa's largest park, [[Shevchenko Park (Odessa)|Shevchenko Park]] (previously Alexander Park), was founded in 1875, during a visit to the city by [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]]. The park covers an area of around {{convert|700|by|900|m|ft|abbr=off}} and is located near the centre of the city, on the side closest to the sea. Within the park there are a variety of cultural and entertainment facilities, and wide pedestrian avenues. In the center of the park is the local top-flight football team's [[Chornomorets Stadium]], the Alexander Column and municipal observatory. The Baryatinsky Bulvar is popular for its route, which starts at the park's gate before winding its way along the edge of the coastal plateau. There are a number of monuments and memorials in the park, one of which is dedicated to the park's namesake, the Ukrainian national poet [[Taras Shevchenko]].

== Education ==
[[File:Odesa National scientific library-03.jpg|left|thumb|The Odessa National Scientific Library is a major research library, and centre for study, in southern Ukraine.]]
Odessa is home to several universities and other institutions of higher education. The city's best-known and most prestigious university is the [[Odessa National University|Odessa 'I.I. Mechnikov' National University]]. This university is the oldest in the city and was first founded by an edict of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1865 as the Imperial [[Novorossiya Governorate|Novorossian]] University. Since then the university has developed to become one of modern Ukraine's leading research and teaching universities, with staff of around 1,800 and total of thirteen academic faculties. Other than the National University, the city is also home to the 1921-inaugurated [[OSEU|Odessa National Economic University]], the [[Odessa National Medical University]] (founded 1900), the 1918-founded [[Odessa National Polytechnic University]] and the [[Odessa National Maritime University]] (established 1930).
[[File:Odesa Olgivska-4 0-1.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the Odessa National Medical University.]]
In addition to these universities, the city is home to the Odessa Law Academy, the National Academy of Telecommunications and the [[Odessa National Maritime Academy]]. The last of these institutions is a highly specialised and prestigious establishment for the preparation and training of merchant mariners which sees around 1,000 newly qualified officer cadets graduate each year and take up employment in the [[merchant marine]]s of numerous countries around the world. The South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University is also based in the city, this is one of the largest institutions for the preparation of educational specialists in Ukraine and is recognised as one of the country's finest of such universities.

In addition to all the state-run universities mentioned above, Odessa is also home to many private educational institutes and academies which offer highly specified courses in a range of different subjects. These establishments, however, typically charge much higher fees than government-owned establishments and may not have held the same level of official accreditation as their state-run peers. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

With regard to primary and secondary education, Odessa has many schools catering for all ages from kindergarten through to lyceum (final secondary school level) age. Most of these schools are state-owned and operated, and all schools have to be state-accredited in order to teach children.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Odessa}}

=== Museums, art and music ===
[[File:Odessa arheological museum.JPG|thumb|left|Odessa Archaeological Museum was designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] just like many other landmarks of the city.]]
[[Odessa Art Museum|Fine Arts museum]] is the biggest art gallery in the city, which collection includes canvas mostly of Russian painters from 17th-21st centuries, icon collection and modern art. The [[Odessa Museum of Western and Eastern Art]] is big art museum; it has large European collections from the 16–20th centuries along with the art from the East on display. There are paintings from [[Caravaggio]], [[Pierre Mignard|Mignard]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]], Teniers and Del Piombo. Also of note is the city's [[Odessa Pushkin Museum|Alexander Pushkin Museum]], which is dedicated to detailing the short time [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] spent in exile in Odessa, a period during which he continued to write. The poet also has a city street named after him, as well as a statue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Travel-News/Odessa-The-Star-of-Exile|title=Odessa: The Star of Exile|work=jpost.com}}</ref> Other museums in the city include the [[Odessa Archeological Museum]], which is housed in a neoclassical building, the [[Odessa Numismatics Museum]], the [[Odessa Museum of the Regional History]], Museum of Heroic Defense of Odessa (411th Battery).

Among the city's public sculptures, two sets of ''[[Medici lions]]'' can be noted, at the [[Vorontsov Palace (Odessa)|Vorontsov Palace]]<ref>[[:Commons:Category:Medici lions at Vorontsov palace in Odessa]]</ref> as well as the [[Starosinnyi Garden]].<ref>[[:Commons:File:Starosinnyi Garden.JPG]]</ref>

[[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]], the major star of the [[Yiddish theatre]] in New York and father of the actor, director and teacher [[Stella Adler]], was born and spent his youth in Odessa. The most popular Russian show business people from Odessa are [[Yakov Smirnoff]] (comedian), [[Mikhail Zhvanetsky]] (legendary [[List of humorists|humorist]] writer, who began his career as a port engineer) and Roman Kartsev (comedian {{Interlanguage link multi|Карцев, Роман Андреевич|ru}}). Zhvanetsky's and Kartsev's success in the 1970s, along with Odessa's [[KVN]] team, contributed to Odessa's established status as "capital of Soviet humor", culminating in the annual [[Humorina|Humoryna]] festival, carried out around the beginning of April.

Odessa was also the home of the late Armenian painter [[Sarkis Ordyan]] (1918–2003), the Ukrainian painter [[Mickola Vorokhta]] and the Greek philologist, author and promoter of [[Modern Greek|Demotic Greek]] [[Ioannis Psycharis]] (1854–1929). [[Yuri Siritsov]], bass player of the Israeli Metal band PallaneX is originally from Odessa. [[Igor Glazer]] Production Manager [[Baruch Agadati]] (1895–1976), the Israeli classical ballet dancer, choreographer, painter, and film producer and director grew up in Odessa, as did Israeli artist and author [[Nachum Gutman]] (1898–1980). Israeli painter [[Avigdor Stematsky]] (1908–89) was born in Odessa.

[[File:Bunina-15-135.jpg|thumb|The main hall of the Odessa Philharmonic Society's theatre.]]
Odessa produced one of the founders of the Soviet violin school, [[Pyotr Stolyarsky]]. It has also produced many musicians, including the violinists [[Nathan Milstein]], [[David Oistrakh]] and [[Igor Oistrakh]], [[Boris Goldstein]], [[Zakhar Bron]] and pianists [[Sviatoslav Richter]], [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]], [[Vladimir de Pachmann]], [[Shura Cherkassky]], [[Emil Gilels]], [[Maria Grinberg]], [[Simon Barere]], [[Leo Podolsky]] and [[Yakov Zak]]. (Note: Richter studied in Odessa but wasn't born there.)

The [[Odessa International Film Festival]] is also held in this city annually since 2010.

=== Literature ===
[[File:Одеса 189115.JPG|thumb|left|The [[School of Stolyarsky]], founded in 1933, has long been recognised as a centre of musical excellence.]]
Poet [[Anna Akhmatova]] was born in Bolshoy Fontan near Odessa,<ref name="anderson">{{cite book|last= Anderson|first= Nancy K.|author2=Anna Andreevna Akhmatova|title= The word that causes death's defeat|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2004|isbn= 0-300-10377-8}}</ref> however her further work was not connected with the city and its literary tradition. The city has produced many writers, including [[Isaak Babel|Isaac Babel]], whose series of short stories, [[Odessa Tales]], are set in the city. Other Odessites are the duo [[Ilf and Petrov]] - authors of "[[twelve Chairs|The Twelve chairs]]", and [[Yury Olesha|Yuri Olesha]] - author of "The Three Fat Men". [[Vera Inber]], a poet and writer, as well as the poet and journalist, [[Margarita Aliger]] were both born in Odessa. The Italian writer, slavist and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] dissident [[Leone Ginzburg]] was born in Odessa into a Jewish family, and then went to Italy where he grew up and lived.

One of the most prominent pre-war [[Russian literature|Soviet writers]], [[Valentin Kataev]], was born here and began his writing career as early as high school (gymnasia). Before moving to Moscow in 1922, he made quite a few acquaintances here, including [[Yury Olesha]] and [[Ilf and Petrov|Ilya Ilf]] (Ilf's co-author Petrov was in fact Kataev's brother, Petrov being his pen-name). Kataev became a benefactor for these young authors, who would become some of the most talented and popular [[List of Russian language writers|Russian writers]] of this period. In 1955 Kataev became the first [[editing|chief editor]] of the ''Youth'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Юность, Yunost'}}), one of the leading [[literary magazine|literature magazines]] of the [[Khrushchev Thaw|Ottepel]] of the 1950s and 1960s. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

These authors and comedians played a great role in establishing the "Odessa myth" in the Soviet Union. Odessites were and are viewed in the ethnic stereotype as sharp-witted, street-wise and eternally optimistic.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} These qualities are reflected in the "Odessa dialect", which borrows chiefly from the characteristic speech of the Odessan Jews, and is enriched by a plethora of influences common for the port city. The "Odessite speech" became a staple of the "Soviet Jew" depicted in a multitude of jokes and comedy acts, in which a Jewish adherent served as a wise and subtle dissenter and opportunist, always pursuing his own [[Quality of life|well-being]], but unwittingly pointing out the flaws and absurdities of the Soviet regime. The Odessan Jew in the jokes always "came out clean" and was, in the end, a lovable character – unlike some of other jocular nation stereotypes such as The Chukcha, The Ukrainian, The Estonian or The American.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tanny|first=Jarrod|title=City of Rogues and Schnorrers: Russia's Jews and the Myth of Old Odessa|year=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-22328-9|pages=13–22, 142–156|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=650630|accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref>

{{Further|Humorina}}
[[April Fools' Day]], held annually on 1 April, is one of the most celebrated festivals in the city. Practical joking is a central theme throughout, and Odessans dress in unique, colorful attire to express their spontaneous and comedic selves. The tradition has been celebrated since the early 1970s, when the humor of Ukraine’s citizens were drawn to television and the media, further developing into a mass festival. Large amounts of money are made from the festivities, supporting Odessa’s local entertainers and shops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/odessa-celebrates-april-fools-day.html|title=Odessa Celebrates April Fools' Day|last=Barry|first=Ellen|date=1 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=14 November 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Odessa arkadia2018.jpg|left|thumb|[[Arcadia (Odessa)|Arcadia]] is the well-known neighborhood with plenty of shops and new apartments]]

The economy of Odessa largely stems from its traditional role as a port city. The nearly ice-free port lies near the mouths of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], the [[Southern Bug]], the [[Dniester]] and the [[Danube]] rivers, which provide good links to the hinterland.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

During the Soviet period (until 1991) the city functioned as the USSR's largest trading port; it continues in a similar role as independent Ukraine's busiest international port. The port complex contains an oil and gas transfer and storage facility, a cargo-handling area and a large passenger port. In 2007 the Port of Odessa handled 31,368,000 tonnes of cargo.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.ukrport.org.ua/members.htm Ассоциация портов Украины и всего Чёрного моря: члены<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229103802/http://www.ukrport.org.ua/members.htm |date=29 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackseatrans.com/article.php?articleID=747|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109222022/http://www.blackseatrans.com/article.php?articleID=747|url-status=dead|title=Ports of Ukraine<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->|archive-date=9 November 2007}}</ref> The port of Odessa is also one of the [[Ukrainian Navy]]'s most important bases on the [[Black Sea]]. Rail transport is another important sector of the economy in Odessa – largely due to the role it plays in delivering goods and imports to and from the city's port.

Industrial enterprises located in and around the city include those dedicated to fuel refinement, machine building, metallurgy, and other types of light industry such as food preparation, timber plants and chemical industry. Agriculture is a relatively important sector in the territories surrounding the city. The [[Seventh-Kilometer Market]] is a major commercial complex on the outskirts of the city where private traders now operate one of the largest market complexes in Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.odessa-info.com.ua/about/ |title=Одесса &#124; о городе |publisher=Odessa-info.com.ua |access-date=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221429/http://www.odessa-info.com.ua/about/ |archive-date=24 May 2013  }}</ref> The market has roughly 6,000 traders and an estimated 150,000 customers per day. Daily sales, according to the Ukrainian periodical ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', were believed to be as high as USD 20 million in 2004. With a staff of 1,200 (mostly guards and janitors), the market is also the region's largest employer. It is owned by local land and agriculture [[tycoon]] Viktor A. Dobriansky and three partners of his. [[Tavria-V]] is the most popular retail chain in Odessa. Key areas of [[business sector|business]] include: retail, wholesale, catering, production, construction and development, private label. Consumer recognition is mainly attributed{{by whom|date=November 2014}} to the high level of service and the quality of services. [[Tavria-V]] is the biggest private company and the biggest tax payer.

[[File:Deribasovskaya-33-36.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Odessa Passage|Passage]] galleries, one of the city's landmarks.]]

[[Deribasivska Street]] is one of the city's most important commercial streets, hosting many of the city's boutiques and higher-end shops. In addition to this there are a number of large commercial shopping centres in the city. The 19th-century shopping gallery [[Odessa Passage|Passage]] was, for a long time, the city's most upscale shopping district, and remains {{as of | 2014 | alt = to this day}} an important landmark of Odessa.

The [[Tourism in Ukraine|tourism]] sector is of great importance to Odessa, which is currently{{when|date=November 2014}} the second most-visited Ukrainian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ua/data/upload/publication/eu/en/2889/002_profile_sez.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023180441/http://www.mfa.gov.ua/data/upload/publication/eu/en/2889/002_profile_sez.pdf |archive-date=23 October 2012 }}</ref> In 2003 this sector recorded a total revenue of 189,2 mln UAH. Other sectors of the city's economy include the banking sector: the city hosts a branch of the [[National Bank of Ukraine]]. [[Imexbank]], one of Ukraine's largest commercial banks, was based in the city, however on May 27, 2015, the Deposit Guarantee Fund of Ukraine made a decision to liquidate the bank. Foreign business ventures have thrived in the area, as since 1 January 2000, much of the city and its surrounding area has been declared{{by whom|date=November 2014}} a [[free economic zone]] – this has aided the foundation of foreign companies' and corporations' Ukrainian divisions and allowed them to more easily invest in the Ukrainian manufacturing and service sectors. To date a number of Japanese and Chinese companies, as well as a host of European enterprises, have invested in the development of the free economic zone, to this end private investors in the city have invested a great deal of money into the provision of quality office real estate and modern manufacturing facilities such as warehouses and plant complexes.

Odessa also has a well-developed IT industry with large number of IT outsourcing companies and IT product startups. Among most famous startups is [[Looksery]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Snap became a resident of UNIT.City|url=https://ain.ua/en/2018/11/20/snap-became-a-resident-of-unit-city/|date=2018-11-20|website=AIN.UA|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref> and AI Factory both developed in Odessa and acquaired by [[Snap Inc.|Snap inc]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Snap acquires Ukrainian startup AI Factory for $166M|url=https://ain.ua/en/2019/12/26/snap-acquires-ai-factory-for-166m/|date=2019-12-26|website=AIN.UA|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

== Transport ==

=== Maritime transport ===
{{further|UkrFerry|Black Sea Shipping Company}}
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Морской вокзал 22.jpg|right|thumb|Odessa has long been an important [[Black Sea]] port.]]
[[File:Black Sea Shipping Company logo.svg|thumb|Soviet cruise line based in Odessa|left]]
Odessa is a major maritime-transport hub that includes several ports including [[Port of Odessa]], [[Port of Chornomorsk]] (ferry, freight), [[Yuzhne]] (freight only).  The Port of Odessa became a provisional headquarters for the [[Ukrainian Navy]], following the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014. Before the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the Port of Odessa harbored the major Soviet cruise line [[Black Sea Shipping Company]].

Passenger ships and ferries connect Odessa with [[Istanbul]], [[Haifa]] and [[Varna]], whilst river cruises can occasionally be booked for travel up the [[Dnieper River]] to cities such as [[Kherson]], [[Dnipro]] and [[Kyiv]].

=== Roads and automotive transport ===

The first car in the Russian Empire, a [[Mercedes-Benz]] belonging to V. Navrotsky, came to Odessa from France in 1891. He was a popular city publisher of the newspaper ''The Odessa Leaf''.

[[File:Odessa road.jpg|thumb|left|The M05 Highway links Odessa with the nation's capital, Kyiv. Odessa junction.]]
Odessa is linked to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by the [[M05 highway (Ukraine)|M05 Highway]], a high quality multi-lane road which is set to be re-designated, after further reconstructive works, as an 'Avtomagistral' (motorway) in the near future. Other routes of national significance, passing through Odessa, include the M16 Highway to [[Moldova]], M15 to [[Izmail]] and [[Romania]], and the [[Highway M14 (Ukraine)|M14]] which runs from Odessa, through [[Mykolaiv]] and [[Kherson]] to Ukraine's eastern border with Russia. The M14 is of particular importance to Odessa's maritime and shipbuilding industries as it links the city with Ukraine's other large deep water port [[Mariupol]] which is located in the south east of the country.

Odessa also has a well-developed system of inter-urban municipal roads and minor beltways. However, the city is still lacking an extra-urban bypass for transit traffic which does not wish to proceed through the city centre.

Intercity bus services are available from Odessa to many cities in Russia (Moscow, [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Pyatigorsk]]), Germany (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Munich]]), Greece ([[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[Varna]] and [[Sofia]]) and several cities of [[Ukraine]] and Europe.

=== Railways ===
[[File:Будівля залізничного вокзалу 01.jpg|thumb|right|Odessa Holovna is one of Ukraine's largest railway terminals. Every day trains depart to many national and international destinations.]]
Odessa is served by a number of railway stations and halts, the largest of which is [[Odessa Train Station|Odessa Holovna]] (Main Station), from where passenger train services connect Odessa with [[Warsaw]], Prague, [[Bratislava]], Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], the cities of Ukraine and many other cities of the former USSR. The city's first railway station was opened in the 1880s, however, during the Second World War, the iconic building of the main station, which had long been considered to be one of the [[Russian Empire]]'s premier stations, was destroyed through enemy action. In 1952 the station was rebuilt to the designs of A Chuprina. The current station, which is characterised by its many [[Socialist Realism|socialist-realist]] architectural details and grand scale, was renovated by the state railway operator [[Ukrainian Railways]] in 2006.

=== Public transport ===
[[File:Oděsa, Sofijska, tramvaj.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Odessa tram]] on Sofievska Street.]]
[[File:Украина, Одесса - Потемкинская лестница 10.jpg|thumb|Odessa funicular]]
In 1881 Odessa became the first city in Imperial Russia to have steam tramway lines, an innovation that came only one year after the establishment of [[horsecar|horse tramway]] services in 1880 operated by the "Tramways d'Odessa", a Belgian owned company. The first [[Narrow gauge railway|metre gauge]] steam tramway line ran from Railway Station to Great Fontaine and the second one to Hadzhi Bey Liman. These routes were both operated by the same Belgian company. Electric tramway started to operate on 22 August 1907. Trams were imported from Germany.

The city's [[public transport|public transit]] system is currently made up of trams,<ref name="trams">{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmaestro.com/tram|title=Odessa Tram Themes|accessdate=2 May 2006}}</ref> [[trolleybus]]es, buses and fixed-route taxis ([[marshrutka]]s). Odessa also has a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] to [[Vidrada]] Beach,<ref>[http://wikimapia.org/6811754/Cable-car-to-beach-Otrada Odessa Cable Car to Vidrada/Otrada Beach] on [[Wikimapia]]</ref> and recreational ferry service. There are two routes of public transport which connect Odessa Airport with the city center: trolley-bus №14 and marshrutka №117.<ref>[https://leodessa.com/odessa-public-transport/ Odessa tour guide]. leodessa.com</ref>

One additional mode of transport in Odessa is the [[Potemkin Stairs]] [[Odessa Funicular|funicular railway]], which runs between the city's Primorsky Bulvar and the sea terminal, has been in service since 1902. In 1998, after many years of neglect, the city decided to raise funds for a replacement track and cars. This project was delayed on multiple occasions but was finally completed eight years later in 2005.<ref>[http://www.odessaguide.net/sights_cablecar.en.html Odessa Sights]. odessaguide.net</ref> The [[funicular]] has now become as much a part of historic Odessa as the staircase to which it runs parallel.

=== Air transport ===
[[Odesa International Airport]], which is located to the south-west of the city centre, is served by a number of airlines. The airport is also often used by citizens of neighbouring countries for whom Odessa is the nearest large city and who can travel visa-free to Ukraine.

Transit flights from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East to Odessa are offered by [[Ukraine International Airlines]] through their hub at Kyiv's [[Boryspil International Airport]]. Additionally Turkish Airlines wide network and daily flights offers more than 246 destinations all over the world.

Odessa will become one of five Ukrainian cities to host the [[FIBA EuroBasket 2015|39th European Basketball Championship]] in 2015.

=== Athletes ===
The cyclist and aviator [[Sergei Utochkin]] was one of the most famous natives of Odessa in the years before the Russian Revolution. [[Chess]] player [[Efim Geller]] was born in the city. Gymnast [[Tatiana Gutsu]] (known as "The Painted Bird of Odessa") brought home Ukraine's first Olympic gold medal as an independent nation when she outscored the USA's [[Shannon Miller]] in the women's all-around event at [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, Spain. Figure skaters [[Oksana Grishuk]] and [[Evgeny Platov]] won the 1994 and 1998 Olympic gold medals as well as the 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 World Championships in ice dance. Both were born and raised in the city, though they skated at first for the Soviet Union, in the Unified Team, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and then Russia. Hennadiy Avdyeyenko won a 1988 Olympic gold medal in thehigh jump, setting an Olympic record at {{convert|2.38|m|ft|2|abbr=off}}.
