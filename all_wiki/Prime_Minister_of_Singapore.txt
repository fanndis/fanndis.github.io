{{Politics of Singapore}}

The '''prime minister of the Republic of Singapore''' is the [[head of government|head of the government]] of the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]] and the country's most powerful political figure. The president [[President of Singapore|of Singapore]] appoints as Prime Minister a [[List of Singapore MPs|member of Parliament]] (MP) who, in his or her opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. In practice, the prime minister is usually the leader of the majority party in the legislature. [[Lee Hsien Loong]] is the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] since 2004.

Under the [[Constitution of Singapore]], executive power is vested in the president. However, the Constitution also vests "general direction and control of the government" in the Cabinet. The president is almost always bound to act on the advice of the Cabinet or any minister acting under Cabinet authority. Thus, in practice, most of the actual work of governing is done by the prime minister and Cabinet.

The office of Prime Minister dates back to 1959 and was appointed at first by the [[governor of Singapore]] then the [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]] (vice-regal head of state), when Singapore achieved [[Self-governance of Singapore|self-governance]] as the State of Singapore within the [[British Empire]]. The title of Prime Minister remained unchanged after the [[Singapore in Malaysia|merger]] with the [[Federation of Malaya]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], while [[Singapore in Malaysia|Singapore was a state]] in the Federation of [[Malaysia]] from 1963 to 1965, and after independence in 1965.

The late [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was the first prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. Lee was succeeded by [[Goh Chok Tong]] and was conferred the title of [[Senior Minister]] in the Prime Minister's Office. [[Goh Chok Tong]] retired on 12 August 2004 and was succeeded by Lee Kuan Yew's son [[Lee Hsien Loong]]. [[Goh Chok Tong]] was appointed Senior Minister, and the elder Lee [[Minister Mentor]]. Lee and Goh resigned from the Cabinet in 2011 but remained as members of Parliament. The only former living prime minister is [[Goh Chok Tong]] who served from 1990 to 2004. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_139_2005-01-19.html|title=Past and present leaders of Singapore {{!}} Infopedia|last=Singapore|first=National Library Board|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref>

The prime minister's annual salary was [[Singapore dollar|S$]]3.07&nbsp;million before a salary review in 2011.<ref name="PSD Salary 2012">{{cite web|title=White Paper - Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government|url=http://www.psd.gov.sg/docs/default-source/white-paper/white-20paper-20--20salaries-20for-20a-20capable-20and-20committed-20govt-1.pdf|website=Public Service Division|accessdate=15 April 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507095558/http://www.psd.gov.sg/white-paper/white-paper|archivedate=7 May 2015|date=10 January 2012}}</ref> On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the prime minister to review the salaries of the prime minister as well as the president, political appointment holders, and members of Parliament.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Committee to review salaries of the President, Prime Minister and Political Appointment Holders |url=http://www.pmo.gov.sg/mediacentre/committee-review-salaries-president-prime-minister-and-political-appointment-holders |publisher=Prime Minister's Office |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011334/http://www.pmo.gov.sg/mediacentre/committee-review-salaries-president-prime-minister-and-political-appointment-holders |archivedate=5 March 2016 |date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> After the recommended wage reductions by the committee were accepted in Parliament, the prime minister's salary was reduced by 36% (including the removal of his pension) to S$2.2&nbsp;million (approximately US$1.7&nbsp;million at the time).<ref name="PSD Salary 2012"/>

Nonetheless, the prime minister of Singapore remains the highest-paid political leader in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mathew|first1=Jerin|title=Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong remains highest paid country leader with $1.7m annual salary|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/singapore-pm-lee-hsien-loong-remains-highest-paid-country-leader-1-7m-annual-salary-1493952|accessdate=15 April 2020|work=International Business Times|date=28 March 2015}}</ref>

| colspan="6" | <small>The first prime minister of Singapore. He is the longest-serving prime minister of Singapore. His tenure led to the expansion of Singapore's economy from a [[British Crown Colony]] into a [[first world country]]. He introduced the [[National service in Singapore|National Service]] (NS) scheme, with the help of his defence minister [[Goh Keng Swee]]. He introduced the [[Population planning in Singapore|Stop-At-Two child policy]] in 1960s, for fearing of over expansion of Singapore population. In the 1980s, he introduced the [[Population planning in Singapore#The demographic transition and the Graduate Mothers Scheme|Graduate Mother Scheme]] to counter the effects of the previous policy, which received a huge backlash. The policy was withdrawn shortly thereafter. He led the PAP into 8 consecutive election victories.

== Allowance ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
The prime minister receives an annual total salary package (inclusive of 13th month bonus, Annual Variable Component and National Bonus) that is twice the MR4 benchmark, or $2.2m, which represents a reduction of 36% from 2010 levels. As there is no one to decide on the annual performance bonus for the PM, the PM's bonus will be based only on the National Bonus.

Pensions for political appointment holders, including the prime minister, have been removed with effect from 21 May 2021.

The prime minister is on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme.

The Istana is the working office of the prime minister. The prime minister is also accorded the use of an official car that is subject to tax. The prime minister is protected by the Specialised Security Command of the Singapore Police Force, who also ensure the protection of the president, the other Cabinet ministers and visiting foreign dignitaries. The Prime Minister also receives an undisclosed allowance for the maintenance of his office and for travel expenses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.police.gov.sg/Media-Room/Features/Leading-the-Specialised-Security-Command|title=Leading the Specialised Security Command|website=Singapore Police Force}}</ref>

== Powers ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
The prime minister is chosen by the president and is usually the leader of the majority party in the legislature. Since independence, this has been the secretary-general of the People's Action Party. 

The prime minister of Singapore chooses the other members of the Cabinet by advising the president; the president must exercise his or her powers in accordance with the advice of the prime minister, effectively making the prime minister the head of the executive branch. The prime minister also, in recent times, can nominate the speaker of Parliament. 

The prime minister leads the government in the policy of the day and as the leader of the majority party in Parliament, is responsible for passing legislation through Parliament. The prime minister also appoints the leader of the House, who is responsible for arranging government business and organising the legislative programme in Parliament, usually under the directive of the prime minister and the Cabinet. The prime minister is responsible for overseeing the overall day-to-day affairs of the government and executing government policy.

The prime minister can issue a Proclamation of Emergency by advising the president to do so; the president is obligated to follow the advice of the prime minister. The prime minister can declare a defence or security measure, which extends to a declaration of war. The prime minister, followed by the minister for defence, the permanent secretary of defence and the chief of Defence Force, has executive authority over the armed forces although the nominal position of Commander-in-Chief falls under the president.
