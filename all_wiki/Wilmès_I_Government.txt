The '''Wilmès I Government''' was a caretaker<ref>https://www.politico.eu/article/sophie-wilmes-to-replace-charles-michel-as-belgian-pm/</ref> [[Federal Government of Belgium]], led by [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Sophie Wilmès]], the first ever female Prime Minister of Belgium.

== History ==
The creation of the Wilmès Government was announced on 26 October 2019, when previous Prime Minister [[Charles Michel]] announced he would be succeeded by [[Sophie Wilmès]] ultimately on 1 November 2019, effectively forming a new government.<ref name=wilmes>{{cite news|url=https://vrtnws.be/p.L7kpLY49v|title=Sophie Wilmès (MR) wordt nieuwe premier in lopende zaken: "Alles aan doen om de stabiliteit te verzekeren"|trans-title=Sophie Wilmès (MR) to become new Prime Minister of caretaker cabinet: "Give it all to ensure stability"|publisher=vrt.be|date=26 October 2019|accessdate=27 October 2019|language=Dutch}}</ref> Charles Michel left his post as he had been elected to become the next [[President of the European Council]] as from 1 December 2019 and wanted to have sufficient time to prepare for his role as President of the European Council hence leaving already by November.

The Wilmès Government was governing as a [[caretaker government]], until a new cabinet was formed based on the results of the [[2019 Belgian federal election|federal elections]] of 26 May 2019, for which negotiations were still ongoing. Hence the government was a continuation of the [[Centre politics|centre]] [[Minority government|minority]] [[Coalition government|coalition]] [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] (CD&V), the [[Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten|Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats]] (Open Vld) and the [[Mouvement Réformateur|Reformist Movement]] (MR) which together constituted the Michel II Government. On 16 March, the Wilmès Government was given support by several opposition parties to handle the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium|coronavirus outbreak]] in Belgium, for which the cabinet is going to be supported by a majority in parliament by granting it special powers under the form of the [[Wilmès II Government]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/detail_en-route-vers-un-gouvernement-wilmes-2-0-suivez-la-conference-de-presse-en-direct?id=10458538|title=Le gouvernement Wilmès va être doté de pouvoirs spéciaux pendant 6 mois|last=Touriel|first=Aubry|date=2020-03-15|website=RTBF Info|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The opposition parties were giving support for three months to take corona measures, with a possible further three month extension, are the socialists ([[Socialistische Partij Anders|sp.a]] & [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|PS]]), the greens ([[Groen (political party)|Groen]] and [[Ecolo]]), the [[Centre démocrate humaniste|cdH]] and [[DéFI]], leaving only the [[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]] and the [[Workers' Party of Belgium|PVDA/PTB]] and [[Vlaams Belang]] in the opposition. 

==Composition==
The composition of the government was similar to that of the [[Michel II Government]], with the only differences being [[Sophie Wilmès]] taking over the role of [[Charles Michel]] as Prime Minister and [[David Clarinval]] coming in to replace Wilmès as [[Minister of Budget (Belgium)|Minister of Budget]], Civil Service, National Lottery and Scientific Policy.
