The '''Songwriters Hall of Fame''' ('''SHOF''') is an American institution founded in 1969 by songwriter [[Johnny Mercer]], music publisher/songwriter [[Abe Olman]] and publisher/executive [[Howie Richmond]] to honor those whose work represents and maintains the heritage and legacy of a spectrum of the most beloved English language songs from the world's popular music songbook. It not only celebrates these established songwriters, but is also involved in the development of new English language songwriting talent through workshops, showcases and scholarships. There are many programs designed to teach and discover new English language songwriters. [[Nile Rodgers]] serves as the organization's chairman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8463518/nile-rodgers-chairman-songwriters-hall-of-fame-announcement|title=Nile Rodgers Appointed Chairman of the Songwriters Hall of Fame: Exclusive|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}</ref>
