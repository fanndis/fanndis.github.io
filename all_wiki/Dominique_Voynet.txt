==Life==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}
Dominique Voynet trained as a doctor, specifically as an anaesthetist. During her studies in the late 1970s, she began participating in environmental activism. She fought against the establishment of nuclear reactors in [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant|Fessenheim]] and [[Malville]], and the [[deforestation]] of the [[Vosges]] area on behalf of the Belfort Association for the Protection of Nature.

She also became a member of [[Amnesty International]] and the [[French Democratic Confederation of Labour]] (CFDT). In her student years, she was a broadcaster for an independent radio station, "Radio ondes rouges" (Red Radio Waves). Her pacifist and environmental efforts continued with her membership of [[Front de lutte antimilitariste]] (FLAM, "Front for the Antimilitarist Struggle") and [[Friends of the Earth]].

Politics tempted her at this time, however the issues that were dear to her &ndash; social efforts, peace and environmentalism &ndash; were not represented in France by any party at the time. For this reason, she became one of the founding members of [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]] in France.
