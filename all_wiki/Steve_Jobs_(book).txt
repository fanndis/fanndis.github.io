===Front cover===
The front cover uses a photo of Steve Jobs commissioned by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in 2006 for a portfolio of powerful people. The photograph was taken by [[Albert Watson (photographer)|Albert Watson]].

When the photograph was taken, he said he insisted on having a three-hour period to set up his equipment, adding that he wanted to make "[every shoot] as greased lightning fast as possible for the [subject]." When Jobs arrived he didn't immediately look at Watson, but instead at the equipment, focusing on Watson's [[Large format (photography)|4×5 camera]] before saying, "wow, you're shooting film."<ref name="Steve Jobs: Visionary, Inventor, and Very Challenging Photo Subject">{{cite web

{{Quotation|If you look at that shot, you can see the intensity. It was my intention that by looking at him, that you knew this guy was smart. I heard later that it was his favorite photograph of all time.|[[Albert Watson (photographer)|Albert Watson]]<ref name="Steve Jobs: Visionary, Inventor, and Very Challenging Photo Subject"/>}}

Jobs gave Watson an hour—longer than he had given most photographers for a portrait session. Watson reportedly instructed Jobs to make "95 percent, almost 100 percent of eye contact with the camera," and to "think about the next project you have on the table," in addition to thinking about instances when people have challenged him.<ref name="Steve Jobs: Visionary, Inventor, and Very Challenging Photo Subject" />

===Back cover===
The back cover uses another photographic portrait of Jobs taken in his [[living room]] in [[Woodside, California|Woodside]], [[California]] in February 1984 by [[Norman Seeff]]. In a ''Behind the Cover'' article published by ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, Seeff recalls him and Jobs "just sitting" on his living room floor, talking about "creativity and everyday stuff," when Jobs left the room and returned with a [[Macintosh 128K]] (the original Macintosh computer). Jobs "[plopped] down" in the [[lotus position]] holding the computer in his lap when Seeff took the photograph.<ref name="Behind the Cover: Steve Jobs">{{cite news

[[File:ISteve- The Book of Jobs.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The placeholder cover used for the book uses the [[working title]], ''iSteve: The Book of Jobs''.]]

===Title===
The book's [[working title]], ''iSteve: The Book of Jobs'', was chosen by publisher [[Simon & Schuster]]'s publicity department. Although author [[Walter Isaacson]] was "never quite sure about it", his wife and daughter reportedly were. However, they thought it was "too cutesy" and as a result Isaacson persuaded the publisher to change the title to something "simpler and more elegant."<ref>{{cite news

The title ''Steve Jobs'' was allegedly chosen to reflect Jobs's "minimalist" style and to emphasize the biography's authenticity, further differentiating it from unauthorized publications, such as ''[[iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business]]'' by Jeffrey Young.<ref>{{cite web

===Chapters===
Many of the chapters within the book have sub-headings, which are matched in various audiobook versions resulting in listings showing 150+ chapters when there are only 42 chapters. The audiobook contains a mistake on one chapter title, listing Chapter 41 as "Round Three, A Never-ending Struggle" instead of "Round Three, Twilight Struggle" as published.
