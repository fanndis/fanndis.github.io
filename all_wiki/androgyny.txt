'''Androgyny''' is the combination of [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] characteristics into an ambiguous form. Androgyny may be expressed with regard to [[Sex differences in humans|biological sex]], [[gender identity]], [[gender expression]], or [[sexual identity]].

When ''androgyny'' refers to mixed biological sex characteristics in humans, it often refers to [[intersex]] people. Regarding gender identity, androgynous individuals may refer to themselves as [[non-binary gender|non-binary]], [[genderqueer]], or [[Gender neutrality|gender neutral]], while others may identify as transgender men or women, or may be [[cisgender]]. As a form of gender expression, androgyny can be achieved through personal grooming, fashion, or a certain amount of [[Transgender hormone therapy|THT]] treatment. Androgynous gender expression has waxed and waned in popularity in different cultures and throughout history.

==Etymology==
Androgyny as a noun came into use {{circa|1850}}, [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the adjective ''androgynous''.  The adjective use dates from the early 17th century and is itself derived from the older French (14th Century) and English ({{circa|1550}}) term ''androgyne''. The terms are ultimately derived from {{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἀνδρόγυνος|ἀνδρόγυνος]]}}, from {{lang|el|ἀνήρ}}, [[Word stem|stem]] {{lang|el|ἀνδρ}}- (''anér, andro-'', meaning man) and {{lang|el|γυνή}} (''gunē, gyné'', meaning woman) through the {{lang-lat|[[wikt:androgynus|androgynus]]}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=androgynous&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: ''androgynous'' |access-date=13 July 2013}}</ref>  The older word form ''androgyne'' is still in use as a noun with an overlapping set of meanings.
==History==
{{See also|Sexuality in ancient Rome#Hermaphroditism and androgyny}}
Androgyny among humans – expressed in terms of biological sex characteristics, gender identity, or gender expression – is attested to from earliest history and across world cultures. In ancient [[Sumer]], androgynous and [[intersex]] men were heavily involved in the cult of [[Inanna]].<ref name="Leick">{{cite book|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|orig-year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&pg=PA64}}</ref>{{rp|157–158}} A set of priests known as [[gala (priests)|gala]] worked in Inanna's temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations.<ref name="Leick"/>{{rp|285}} ''Gala'' took female names, spoke in the ''[[Sumerian language#Dialects|eme-sal]]'' dialect, which was traditionally reserved for women, and appear to have engaged in [[Gay sexual practices|sexual acts with men]].<ref name="Roscoe">{{cite book|last1=Roscoe|first1=Will|last2=Murray|first2=Stephen O.|date=1997|title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature|location=New York City, New York|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0-8147-7467-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Zw-AAAAQBAJ&q=Gordon%201959%20gala&pg=PA65|pages=65–66}}</ref> In later [[Mesopotamia]]n cultures, ''kurgarrū'' and ''assinnu'' were servants of the goddess [[Ishtar]] (Inanna's [[East Semitic]] equivalent), who [[cross-dressing|dressed in female clothing]] and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples.<ref name="Roscoe"/> Several Akkadian [[proverb]]s seem to suggest that they may have also engaged in sexual activity with men.<ref name="Roscoe"/> Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''.<ref name="Leick"/>{{rp|158–163}} In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.<ref name="Roscoe"/>

The [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myth]] of [[Hermaphroditus]] and [[Salmacis]], two divinities who fused into a single immortal – provided a frame of reference used in Western culture for centuries. Androgyny and homosexuality are seen in [[Plato's Symposium]] in a myth that, according to Plato, [[Aristophanes]] tells the audience, possibly with a comic intention.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Symposium: and, The Phaedrus; Plato's erotic dialogues|year=1993|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-1617-4|others=Translated and with introduction and commentaries by William S. Cobb}}</ref> People used to be spherical creatures, with two bodies attached back to back who cartwheeled around. There were three sexes: the male-male people who descended from the sun, the female-female people who descended from the earth, and the male-female people who came from the moon. This last pairing represented the androgynous couple. These sphere people tried to take over the gods and failed. [[Zeus]] then decided to cut them in half and had [[Apollo]] repair the resulting cut surfaces, leaving the [[navel]] as a reminder to not defy the gods again. If they did, he would cleave them in two again to hop around on one leg. This is one of the earlier written references to androgyny - and the only case in classical greek texts that female homosexuality (lesbianism) is ever mentioned. Other early references to androgyny include astronomy, where androgyn was a name given to planets that were sometimes warm and sometimes cold.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.198 | title=Androgyn |publisher=University of Michigan Library | access-date=1 April 2015}}</ref>

Philosophers such as [[Philo of Alexandria]], and early Christian leaders such as [[Origen]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]], continued to promote the idea of androgyny as humans' original and perfect state during [[late antiquity]].”<ref name="Lugt, Maaike 2010">van der Lugt, Maaike, "Sex Difference in Medieval Theology and Canon Law," ''Medieval Feminist Forum (University of Iowa)'' vol. 46 no. 1 (2010): 101–121</ref>  In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], the concept of androgyny played an important role in both Christian [[Theology|theological]] debate and [[Alchemy|Alchemical]] theory. Influential Theologians such as [[John of Damascus]] and [[John Scotus Eriugena]] continued to promote the pre-fall androgyny proposed by the early [[Church Fathers]], while other clergy expounded and debated the proper view and treatment of contemporary hermaphrodites.<ref name="Lugt, Maaike 2010"/>

[[Western esotericism]]’s embrace of androgyny continued into the [[Modern history|modern period]].  A 1550 anthology of Alchemical thought, ''[[De Alchemia]]'', included the influential [[Rosary of the Philosophers]], which depicts the sacred marriage of the masculine principle (Sol) with the feminine principle (Luna) producing the "Divine Androgyne," a representation of Alchemical [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] beliefs in dualism, transformation, and the transcendental perfection of the union of opposites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Alchemy|last=Hauck|first=Dennis William|date=2008|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=9781592577354|location=New York|oclc=176917711}}</ref>  The symbolism and meaning of androgyny was a central preoccupation of the [[German mystic]] [[Jakob Böhme]] and the Swedish philosopher [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].  The philosophical concept of the “Universal Androgyne” (or “Universal Hermaphrodite”) – a perfect merging of the sexes that predated the current corrupted world and/or was the utopia of the next – also plays a central role in [[Rosicrucian]] doctrine<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians|last=Atkinson|first=William Walker|date=2012|publisher=Weiser Books|isbn=9781578635344|editor-last=Marsh|editor-first=Clint|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=52–61|oclc=792888485}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rose-croix.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rosicrucian_prophecies.pdf#page=4|title=Rosicrucian Prophecies|last=Rosicrucian Order|first=AMORC|date=13 December 2011|website=rose-croix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-04}}</ref> and in philosophical traditions such as [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|Swedenborgianism]] and [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]].

==Symbols and iconography==
[[File:Chambers 1908 Caduceus.png|thumb|The Caduceus]]
In the ancient and medieval worlds, androgynous people and/or hermaphrodites were represented in art by the [[caduceus]], a wand of transformative power in ancient Greco-Roman mythology.  The caduceus was created by [[Tiresias]] and represents his transformation into a woman by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] in punishment for striking at mating snakes. The caduceus was later carried by [[Hermes]]/[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and was the basis for the [[astronomical symbol]] for the [[planet]] [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the botanical sign for hermaphrodite.  That sign is now sometimes used for [[transgender]] people.

Another common androgyny icon in the medieval and early modern period was the [[Rebis]], a [[conjoined]] male and female figure, often with solar and lunar motifs.  Still another symbol was what is today called [[sun cross]], which united the cross (or [[saltire]]) symbol for male with the circle for female.<ref>William Wallace Atkinson, The Secret Doctrines of the Rosicrucians (London: L.N. Fowler & Co., 1918), 53-54.</ref>  This sign is now the astronomical symbol for the planet [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/680/solar-system-symbols|title=Solar System Symbols|website=Solar System Exploration: NASA Science|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref><!-- |accessed {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814172945/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galleries/solar-system-symbols%7Caccessed |date=14 August 2016 }} 23 February 2016 ??? -->

==Biological==
{{See also|Sex differences in humans}}

Historically, the word ''androgynous'' was applied to humans with a mixture of male and female sex characteristics, and was sometimes used synonymously with the term ''[[hermaphrodite]]''.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/androgyny</ref> In some disciplines, such as botany, ''androgynous'' and ''hermaphroditic'' are still used interchangeably.

When androgyny is used to refer to physical traits, it often refers to a person whose biological sex is difficult to discern at a glance because of their mixture of male and female characteristics. Because androgyny encompasses additional meanings related to gender identity and gender expression that are distinct from biological sex, today the word ''androgynous'' is rarely used to formally describe mixed biological sex characteristics in humans. <ref>http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex</ref> In modern English, the word ''[[intersex]]'' is used to more precisely describe individuals with mixed or ambiguous sex characteristics. However, both intersex and non-intersex people can exhibit a mixture of male and female sex traits such as hormone levels, type of internal and external genitalia, and the appearance of secondary sex characteristics. 
== Psychological ==
Though definitions of androgyny vary throughout the scientific community, it is generally supported that androgyny represents a blending of traits associated with both masculinity and femininity. In psychological study, various measures have been used to characterize gender, such as the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory|Bem Sex Role Inventory]], the [[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=Psychological Androgyny|last=Cook|first=Ellen Piel|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1985|isbn=0-08-031613-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologicaland0000cook}}</ref> 

Broadly speaking, masculine traits are categorized as agentic and instrumental, dealing with assertiveness and analytical skill. Feminine traits are categorized as communal and expressive, dealing with empathy and subjectivity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Androgynous Manager|last=Sargent|first=Alice G.|publisher=AMACOM|year=1981|isbn=0-8144-5568-9|location=New York|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/androgynousmanag0000sarg}}</ref> Androgynous individuals exhibit behavior that extends beyond what is normally associated with their given sex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/androgyny|title=Androgyny|last=Rogers|first=Kara|date=February 6, 2009|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref> Due to the possession of both masculine and feminine characteristics, androgynous individuals have access to a wider array of psychological competencies in regards to emotional regulation, communication styles, and situational adaptability.

=== Bem Sex-Role Inventory ===
The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] (BSRI) was constructed by the early leading proponent of androgyny, [[Sandra Bem]] (1977).<ref name="Santrock">Santrock, J. W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development''.<!--Perhaps the year is wrong (2007 or 2009) or the title is wrong (Life-Span Development).--> New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill Companies. 007760637X {{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>{{better source|reason=Not clear what item this is.|date=November 2019}}  The BSRI is one of the most widely used gender measures. Based on an individual's responses to the items in the BSRI, they are classified as having one of four gender role orientations: masculine, feminine, androgynous, or undifferentiated. Bem understood that both masculine and feminine characteristics could be expressed by anyone and it would determine those gender role orientations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria L.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|pages=11}}</ref>

An androgynous person is an individual who has a high degree of both feminine (expressive) and masculine (instrumental) traits. A feminine individual is ranked high on feminine (expressive) traits and ranked low on masculine (instrumental) traits. A masculine individual is ranked high on instrumental traits and ranked low on expressive traits. An undifferentiated person is low on both feminine and masculine traits.<ref name="Santrock" />

According to Sandra Bem, androgynous individuals are more flexible and more mentally healthy than either masculine or feminine individuals; undifferentiated individuals are less competent.<ref name="Santrock" /> More recent research has debunked this idea, at least to some extent, and Bem herself has found weaknesses in her original pioneering work. Now she prefers to work with [[gender schema theory]].

One study found that masculine and androgynous individuals had higher expectations for being able to control the outcomes of their academic efforts than feminine or undifferentiated individuals.<ref name="Choi">Choi, N. (2004). Sex role group differences in specific, academic, and general self-efficacy. Journal of Psychology, 138, 149–159.</ref>

=== Personal Attributes Questionnaire ===
The [[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]] (PAQ) was developed in the 70s by Janet Spence, Robert Helmreich, and Joy Stapp. This test asked subjects to complete a survey consisting of three sets of scales relating to masculinity, femininity, and masculinity-femininity. These scales had sets of adjectives commonly associated with males, females, and both. These descriptors were chosen based on typical characteristics as rated by a population of undergrad students. Similar to the BSRI, the PAQ labeled androgynous individuals as people who ranked highly in both the areas of masculinity and femininity. However, Spence and Helmreich considered androgyny to be a descriptor of high levels of masculinity and femininity as opposed to a category in and of itself.<ref name=":5" />

==Gender identity==
An individual's gender identity, a personal sense of one's own gender, may be described as androgynous if they feel that they have both masculine and feminine aspects. The word ''androgyne'' can refer to a person who does not fit neatly into one of the typical masculine or feminine [[gender roles]] of their society, or to a person whose gender is a mixture of male and female, not necessarily half-and-half. Many androgynous individuals identify as being mentally or emotionally both masculine and feminine. They may also identify as "[[gender-neutral]]", "genderqueer", or "non-binary".{{cn|date=February 2020}} A person who is androgynous may engage freely in what is seen as masculine or feminine behaviors as well as tasks. They have a balanced identity that includes the virtues of both men and women and may disassociate the task with what gender they may be socially or physically assigned to.<ref name=":0" /> People who are androgynous disregard what traits are culturally constructed specifically for males and females within a specific society, and rather focus on what behavior is most effective within the situational circumstance.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1 = Woodhill|first1 = Brenda|date = 2004|journal = Journal of Gender Studies|doi = 10.1080/09589236.2004.10599911|first2 = Curtis|last2 = Samuels|title = Desirable and Undesirable Androgyny: A Prescription for the Twenty-First Century|volume = 13|pages = 15–28|s2cid = 146597061}}</ref>

Many non-western cultures recognize additional androgynous gender identities. Jewish culture recognizes the [[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] and [[Androgynos]] genders. Chinese culture has the [[Yinyang ren]] gender. The [[Bugis]] of Indonesia recognize five genders, [[Bissu]] representing the androgynous category. In Hawaiian culture, the third gender [[Māhū]] is recognized. In Oaxacan Zapotec culture, the [[Muxe]] are recognized as a third gender. In India, the [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] is the third androgynous gender. Samoans accept [[Fa'afafine|Fa’afafine]] as a third gender. Native American culture includes [[Two-spirit|Two Spirit]] as a general third gender.

==Gender expression==
[[Gender expression]], which includes a mixture of masculine and feminine characteristics, can be described as androgynous. The categories of masculine and feminine in gender expression are [[social construction of gender | socially constructed]], and rely on shared conceptions of clothing, behavior, communication style, and other aspects of presentation. In some cultures, androgynous gender expression has been celebrated, while in others, androgynous expression has been [[gender policing|limited or suppressed.]] To say that a culture or relationship is androgynous is to say that it lacks rigid [[gender role]]s, or has blurred lines between gender roles.

The word ''[[genderqueer]]'' is often used by androgynous individuals to refer to themselves, but the terms ''genderqueer'' and ''androgynous'' are neither equivalent nor interchangeable.<ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genderqueer</ref> ''Genderqueer'' is not specific to androgynes. It may refer to any person, [[cisgender]] or [[transgender]], whose behavior falls outside conventional gender norms.  Furthermore, ''genderqueer'', by virtue of its ties with [[queer]] culture, carries sociopolitical connotations that ''androgyny'' does not carry.  For these reasons, some androgynes may find the label ''genderqueer'' inaccurate, inapplicable, or offensive.  ''Androgyneity'' is considered by some to be a viable alternative to ''androgyn'' for differentiating internal (psychological) factors from external (visual) factors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://androgyne.0catch.com/psych.htm#androgyneity |title=Psychological Androgyny -- A Personal Take |access-date=13 July 2014 }}</ref>

Terms such as ''[[bisexual]]'', ''[[heterosexual]]'', and ''[[homosexual]]'' are less applicable to androgynous individuals who do not identify as men or women to begin with. Infrequently the words ''[[gynephilia]]'' and ''[[androphilia]]'' are used, and some describe themselves as ''androsexual''. These words refer to the gender of the person someone is attracted to, but do not imply any particular gender on the part of the person who is feeling the attraction.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

===Androgyny in fashion===
''Main article: [[Androgyny in fashion]]''

Throughout most of twentieth century Western history, social rules have restricted people's dress according to gender. Trousers were traditionally a male form of dress, frowned upon for women.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=History of Twentieth Century Fashion|last1=Ewing|first1=E.|last2=Mackrell|first2=A.|publisher=Quite Specific Media Group Ltd|year=2002|location=LA}}</ref> However, during the 1800s, female spies were introduced and [[Vivandière]]s wore a certain uniform with a dress over trousers. Women activists during that time would also decide to wear trousers, for example [[Luisa Capetillo]], a women's rights activist and the first woman in Puerto Rico to wear trousers in public.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Luisa Capetillo, Pioneer Puerto Rican Feminist: With the collaboration of students from the Graduate Program in Translation, The University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, Spring 1991|last=Valle-Ferrer|first=Norma|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|isbn=9780820442853|language=en}}</ref>

In the 1900s, starting around World War I traditional gender roles blurred and fashion pioneers such as [[Paul Poiret]] and [[Coco Chanel]] introduced trousers to women's fashion. The "flapper style" for women of this era included trousers and a chic bob, which gave women an androgynous look.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qfl0AQAAQBAJ|title=A Social History of Late Ottoman Women: New Perspectives|last1=Köksal|first1=Duygu|last2=Falierou|first2=Anastasia|date=10 October 2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004255258|language=en}}</ref> Coco Chanel, who had a love for wearing trousers herself, created trouser designs for women such as beach pajamas and horse-riding attire.<ref name=":1" /> During the 1930s, glamorous actresses such as [[Marlene Dietrich]] fascinated and shocked many with their strong desire to wear trousers and adopt the androgynous style.

During the 1970s, [[Jimi Hendrix]] was wearing [[high heels]] and blouses quite often, and [[David Bowie]] presented his alter ego [[Ziggy stardust (persona)|Ziggy Stardust]], a character that was a symbol of sexual ambiguity when he launched the album ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and Spiders from Mars''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wsimag.com/fashion/91-androgyny-in-the-fashion-world|title=Androgyny in the fashion world|last=Lalovic|first=Itana|date=19 November 2013|website=Wall Street International|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> This was when androgyny entered the mainstream in the 1970s and had a big influence in pop culture. Another significant influence during this time included [[John Travolta]], one of the androgynous male heroes of the post-counter-culture disco era in the 1970s, who starred in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDdtBc2LjKQC|title=Extra-Ordinary Men: White Heterosexual Masculinity and Contemporary Popular Cinema|last=Rehling|first=Nicola|date=21 June 2010|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9781461633426|language=en}}</ref>

Continuing into the 1980s, the rise of avant-garde fashion designers like [[Yohji Yamamoto]],<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Influences: Challenging Western Traditions|journal=London: Berg}}</ref> challenged the social constructs around gender. They reinvigorated androgyny in fashion, addressing gender issues. This was also reflected within pop culture icons during the 1980s, such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Annie Lennox]].<ref>{{cite news|author =Andrew Anthony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/10/annie-lennox-eurythmics-christmas-cornucopia-universal-child|title=Annie Lennox: the interview|work=The Observer|access-date=2 October 2012|location=London, UK|date=10 October 2010}}</ref>

[[Power dressing]] for women became even more prominent within the 1980s which was previously only something done by men in order to look structured and powerful. However, during the 1980s this began to take a turn as women were entering jobs with equal roles to the men. In the article “The Menswear Phenomenon” by Kathleen Beckett written for Vogue in 1984 the concept of power dressing is explored as women entered these jobs they had no choice but to tailor their wardrobes accordingly, eventually leading the ascension of power dressing as a popular style for women.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Menswear Phenomenon.|journal=Vogue; Conde Nast}}</ref> Women begin to find through fashion they can incite men to pay more attention to the seduction of their mental prowess rather, than the physical attraction of their appearance. This influence in the fashion world quickly makes its way to the world of film, with movies like "Working Girl" using power dressing women as their main subject matter.

Androgynous fashion made its most powerful in the 1980s debut through the work of Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo, who brought in a distinct Japanese style that adopted distinctively gender ambiguous theme. These two designers consider themselves to very much a part of the avant-garde, reinvigorating Japanism.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Influences: Challenging Western Traditions.|journal=London: Berg.}}</ref> Following a more anti-fashion approach and deconstructing garments, in order to move away from the more mundane aspects of current Western fashion. This would end up leading a change in Western fashion in the 1980s that would lead on for more gender friendly garment construction. This is because designers like Yamamoto believe that the idea of androgyny should be celebrated, as it is an unbiased way for an individual to identify with one's self and that fashion is purely a catalyst for this.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

Also during the 1980s, [[Grace Jones]], a singer and fashion model, gender-thwarted appearance in the 1980s, which startled the public. Her androgynous style inspired many and she became an androgynous style icon for modern celebrities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/05/14/androgynous-fashion-moments/|title=Androgynous Fashion Moments|date=14 May 2015|website=Highsnobiety|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>  

In 2016, [[Louis Vuitton]] revealed that [[Jaden Smith]] would star in their womenswear campaign. Because of events like this, [[gender fluidity]] in fashion is being vigorously discussed in the media, with the concept being articulated by [[Lady Gaga]], [[Ruby Rose]], and in [[Tom Hooper]]'s film ''[[The Danish Girl (film)|The Danish Girl]]''. Jaden Smith and other young individuals, such as [[Lily-Rose Depp]], have inspired the movement with his appeal for clothes to be non-gender specific, meaning that men can wear skirts and women can wear boxer shorts if they so wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cubmagazine.co.uk/2016/02/gender-fluidity-in-the-fashion-industry/ |title=Gender Fluidity in the Fashion Industry|date=8 February 2016|website=Cub Magazine|access-date=2017-02-19}}</ref>

The rise of the [[metrosexual]] in the first decade of the 2000s has also been described as a related phenomenon associated with this trend. Traditional gender stereotypes have been challenged and reset in recent years dating back to the 1960s, the [[hippie movement]] and [[flower power]].
