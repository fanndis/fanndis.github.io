The '''Canada–United States border''', officially known as the '''International Boundary''', is the longest [[border|international border]] in the world between two countries.{{efn|Longest by total length - the [[Kazakhstan-Russia border]] is the world's longest continuous land border.}} The terrestrial boundary (including boundaries in the [[Great Lakes]], Atlantic and Pacific coasts) is {{convert|8,891|km|mi|0|sp=us}} long. The land border has two sections: [[Canada]]'s border with the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]] to its south, and Canada's border with the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] to its west.  The bi-national [[International Boundary Commission]] deals with issues relating to marking and maintaining the boundary, and the [[International Joint Commission]] deals with issues concerning boundary waters. The agencies currently responsible for facilitating legal passage through the international boundary are the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (CBSA) and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP).

==History==
===18th century===
[[File:45th parallel US Canada.svg|thumb|upright|The [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] (marked in red) was established as a border between the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] and the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]]]
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]] ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the United States. In the second article of the Treaty, the parties agreed on all boundaries of the United States, including, but not limited to, the boundary to the north along then-[[British North America]]. The agreed-upon boundary included the line from the northwest angle of [[Nova Scotia]] to the northwesternmost head of [[Connecticut River]], and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel of north latitude]].

The parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] (including what would later become the [[Vermont|State of Vermont]]). It was [[Collins–Valentine line|surveyed and marked by John Collins and Thomas Valentine]] from 1771 to 1773.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Francis M. Carroll|title=A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian–American Boundary, 1783–1842|url=https://archive.org/details/goodwisemeasures0000carr|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/goodwisemeasures0000carr/page/85 85]|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|year=2001}}</ref>

The [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the Great Lakes became the boundary further west, between the United States and what is now [[Ontario]]. Northwest of [[Lake Superior]], the boundary followed rivers to the [[Lake of the Woods]]. From the [[northwesternmost point of the Lake of the Woods]], the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the [[Mississippi River]]. In fact, that line never meets the river since [[Lake Itasca|the river's source]] is further south.

====Jay Treaty (1794)====
The [[Jay Treaty]] of 1794 (effective 1796) created the [[International Boundary Commission]], which was charged with surveying and mapping the boundary. It also provided for the removal of British military and administration from [[Detroit]], as well as other frontier outposts on the U.S. side. The Jay Treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Ghent]] (effective 1815) concluding the [[War of 1812]], which included pre-war boundaries.

===19th century===
[[File:Signing of Treaty of Ghent (1814).jpg|thumb|left|Signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814, which ended the [[War of 1812]] and returned the border to its pre-war state. Subsequent treaties agreed upon saw the border demilitarized, and most boundary disputes resolved.]]
Signed in December 1814, the Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812, returning the boundaries of [[British North America]] and the United States to the state they were prior to the war. In the following decades, the United States and the United Kingdom concluded several treaties that settled the major boundary disputes between the two, enabling the border to be [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarized]]. The [[Rush–Bagot Treaty]] of 1817 provided a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the War of 1812 and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between British North America and the United States.

==== London Convention (1818) ====
The [[Treaty of 1818]] saw expansion of both British North America and the US, where the boundary extended westward along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], from the [[Northwest Angle]] at Lake of the Woods to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The treaty extinguished British claims to the south of that line up to the [[Red River Valley]], which was part of [[Rupert's Land]]. The treaty also extinguished U.S. claims to land north of that line in the watershed of the [[Missouri River]], which was part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. This amounted to three small areas, consisting of the northern part of the drainages of the [[Milk River (Alberta–Montana)|Milk River]] (today in southern [[Alberta]] and southwestern [[Saskatchewan]]), the [[Poplar River (Montana–Saskatchewan)|Poplar River]] (Saskatchewan), and [[Big Muddy Creek (Missouri River tributary)|Big Muddy Creek]] (Saskatchewan).{{citation needed|date = August 2013}} Along the 49th parallel, the border vista is theoretically straight, but in practice follows the 19th-century surveyed border markers and varies by several hundred feet in spots.<ref>{{cite web| title=Canada & The United States (Bizarre Borders Part 2)| url=http://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/canada-the-united-states-bizarre-borders-part-2| access-date=June 21, 2013}}</ref>

==== Webster–Ashburton Treaty (1842) ====
[[File:Webster-Ashburton treaty map-es.svg|thumb|upright|Disputed territory between [[British North America]] and [[Maine]] marked in pink. The dispute was settled in the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] in 1848. The teal line on the map marks the final border.]]
Disputes over the interpretation of the border treaties and mistakes in surveying required additional negotiations, which resulted in the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. The treaty resolved the [[Aroostook War]], a dispute over the boundary between [[Maine]], [[New Brunswick]], and the [[Province of Canada]]. The treaty redefined the border between [[New Hampshire]], Vermont, and New York on the one hand, and the Province of Canada on the other, resolving the [[Republic of Indian Stream|Indian Stream]] dispute and the [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Blunder]] dilemma at the outlet to [[Lake Champlain]].

The part of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] that separates Quebec from the U.S. states of Vermont and New York had [[Collins–Valentine line|first been surveyed from 1771 to 1773]] after it had been declared the boundary between New York (including what later became Vermont) and Quebec. It was surveyed again after the War of 1812. The U.S. federal government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at [[Rouses Point, New York]], on Lake Champlain. After a significant portion of the construction was completed, measurements revealed that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) south of the surveyed line. The fort, which became known as "[[Fort Blunder]]", was in Canada, which created a dilemma for the U.S. that was not resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed. The border along the [[Boundary Waters]] in present-day Ontario and [[Minnesota]] between Lake Superior and the Northwest Angle was also redefined.<ref name = WA>{{cite web |publisher=Yale Law School |year=1842 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/br-1842.asp|title=British-American Diplomacy The Webster-Ashburton Treaty|access-date=March 1, 2007}}</ref><ref name = Lass>{{cite book |last=Lass |first=William E. |title=Minnesota's Boundary with Canada |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |year=1980 |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |page=2 |isbn=0-87351-153-0}}</ref>

==== Oregon Treaty (1846) ====
{{Main|Oregon Treaty}}
[[File:Oregoncountry.png|thumb|upright|Map of the disputed [[Oregon Country]], with the American, and British claims marked. The dispute was settled in the Oregon Treaty, placing the boundary along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]].]]
An [[Oregon boundary dispute|1844 boundary dispute]] during the [[Presidency of James K. Polk]] led to a call for the northern boundary of the U.S. west of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to be [[54°40′ or fight|54°40′N]] related to the southern boundary of Russia's [[Russian America|Alaska Territory]]. However, Great Britain wanted a border that followed the [[Columbia River]] to the Pacific Ocean. The dispute was resolved in the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, which established the 49th parallel as the boundary through the Rockies.<ref>Henry Commager, "England and Oregon Treaty of 1846."

==== Boundary surveys (mid–19th century) ====
The Northwest Boundary Survey (1857–1861) laid out the land boundary. However, the water boundary was not settled for some time. After the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] in 1859, arbitration in 1872 established the border between the [[Gulf Islands]] and the [[San Juan Islands]].

The International Boundary Survey (or, the "Northern Boundary Survey" in the US) began in 1872.<ref>{{cite book |last=McManus |first=Sheila |title=The Line Which Separates: Race, Gender, and the Making of the Alberta-Montana Borderlands |publisher=University of Alberta Press |year=2005 |location=Edmonton, Alberta |page=[https://archive.org/details/linewhichseparat00mcma/page/7 7] |url=https://archive.org/details/linewhichseparat00mcma |url-access=registration |quote=called it the Northern Boundary Survey. |isbn=0-88864-434-5}}</ref> Its mandate was to establish the border as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. Archibald Campbell led the way for the United States, while Donald Cameron headed the British team.

On April 11, 1908, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed, under Article IV of the [[Treaty of 1908]] "concerning the boundary between the United States and the Dominion of Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean", to survey and delimit the boundary between Canada and the U.S. through the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]] and Great Lakes, in accordance with modern surveying techniques, and thus accomplished several changes to the border.<ref>{{cite document| title=Treaty of 1908 (included in ''Joint report upon the survey and demarcation of the boundary between the United States and Canada from the gulf of Georgia to the northwesternmost point of Lake of the woods.

In 1909, under the [[Boundary Waters Treaty]], the [[International Joint Commission]] was established for Canada and the U.S. to investigate and approve projects that affect the waters and waterways along the border.

===21st century===
As a result of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the Canada–US border was promptly shut without any warning, and no goods or people were allowed to cross. In the wake of the impromptu border closure, procedures were jointly developed to ensure that commercial traffic could cross the border even if people were restricted from crossing. These procedures were later used for a border closure caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Panetta|first=Alexander|date=20 March 2020|title=How the shutdown after 9/11 paved the way for the new Canada-U.S. border response to COVID-19|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-covid-19-border-canada-united-states-trade-1.5503192|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=CBC}}</ref>

== Security ==
=== Law enforcement approach ===
The International Boundary is commonly referred to as the world's "longest undefended border," though this is true only in the military sense, as civilian law enforcement is present. It is illegal to cross the border outside border controls, as anyone crossing the border must be checked per immigration<ref>{{Cite canlaw|abbr=S.C.|year=2001|section=18|chapter=27|wikilink=Immigration and Refugee Protection Act|regtitle=|short title=Immigration and Refugee Protection Act|link=https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/FullText.html|linkloc=Justice Laws}}</ref><ref>{{USC|8|1324}}; {{USC|8|1325}}; and {{USC|8|1326}}.</ref> and customs laws.<ref>{{Cite canlaw|abbr=R.S.C.|year=1985|section=11|chapter=1|short title=Customs Act|link=https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52.6/|linkloc=Justice Laws}}</ref><ref>{{USC|19|1459}}.</ref> The relatively low level of security measures stands in contrast to that of the [[Mexico–United States border|United States&nbsp;– Mexico border]] (one-third length of Canada–U.S. border), which is actively patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to prevent [[illegal immigration|illegal migration]] and [[illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]].
[[File:US-Canada border counties.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|U.S. counties]] sharing a land or water border with Canada{{legend|#22b14c|Land border}}{{legend|#00b7ef|Water border only}}]]
Parts of the International Boundary cross through mountainous terrain or heavily forested areas, but significant portions also cross remote prairie farmland and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, in addition to the maritime components of the boundary at the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] oceans. The border also runs through the middle of the [[Akwesasne|Akwesasne Nation]] and even divides some buildings found in communities in Vermont and Quebec.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) identifies the chief issues along the border as domestic and international terrorism; [[drug smuggling]] and smuggling of products (such as [[tobacco]]) to evade customs duties; and illegal immigration.<ref name=GAO2019>{{cite report|title=CBP Identified Resource Challenges but Needs Performance Measures to Assess Security Between Ports of Entry|date=June 2019|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/700012.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office}}</ref> A June 2019 U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] report identified specific staffing and resource shortfalls faced by the CBP on the Northern border than adversely impact enforcement actions; the U.S. Border Patrol "identified an insufficient number of agents that limited patrol missions along the northern border" while [[CBP Air and Marine Operations]] "identified an insufficient number of agents along the northern border, which limited the number and frequency of air and maritime missions."<ref name=GAO2019/>

There are eight [[U.S. Border Patrol]] sectors based on the Canada–U.S. border, each covering a designated "area of responsibility"; the sectors are (from west to east) based in [[Blaine, Washington]]; [[Spokane, Washington]]; [[Havre, Montana]]; [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]]; [[Detroit, Michigan]]; [[Buffalo, New York]]; [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton, Vermont]]; and [[Houlton, Maine]].<ref name=GAO2019/>

Following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] in the United States, security along the border was dramatically tightened by the two countries in both populated and rural areas. Both nations are also actively involved in detailed and extensive tactical and strategic intelligence sharing.

In December 2010, Canada and the United States were negotiating an agreement titled "Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Competitiveness" which would give the U.S. more influence over Canada's border security and immigration controls, and more information would be shared by Canada with the U.S.<ref>Mark Kennedy, PostMedia News [https://montrealgazette.com/news/Political+time+bombs+litter+Harper+path/3966709/story.html Political Time Bombs Litter Harper's Path] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216060158/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Political+time+bombs+litter+Harper+path/3966709/story.html |date=December 16, 2010 }}, December 13, 2010</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2020}}

=== Security measures ===
[[File:North West Angle border 4.JPG|thumb|Canadian border crossing sign with lights to alert those crossing to report to customs remotely. Remote customs exists in areas where staffed border crossings are unavailable.]]
Residents of both nations who own property adjacent to the border are forbidden to build within the six-meter-wide (almost 20 feet) boundary vista without permission from the [[International Boundary Commission]]. They are required to report such construction to their respective governments.

==== Smuggling ====
[[File:USBP snow M14 2017.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Border Patrol]] agent tracking someone in harsh winter conditions on the northern border]]
Smuggling of [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]] ([[Rum-running|"rum running"]]) was widespread during the 1920s, when [[Prohibition]] was in effect nationally in the [[Prohibition in the United States|United States]] and parts of [[Prohibition in Canada|Canada]].

In more recent years, Canadian officials have brought attention to [[Narcotic|drug]], [[cigarette]], and [[firearm]]s smuggling from the United States, while U.S. officials have made complaints of drug smuggling via Canada. In July 2005, law enforcement personnel arrested three men who had built a {{convert|360|ft|adj=on}} tunnel under the border between British Columbia and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], intended for the use of smuggling [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], the first such tunnel known on this border.<ref>{{cite news|last=Frieden|first=Terry|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/07/21/border.tunnel/|title=Drug tunnel found under Canada border: Five arrests made after agents monitored construction|date=July 22, 2006|publisher=CNN|url-status=live}}</ref> From 2007 to 2010, 147 people were arrested<sup>[for smuggling what?]</sup> on the property of a [[Bed and breakfast|bed-and-breakfast]] in Blaine, Washington, but agents estimate that they caught only about 5% of smugglers.<ref name="macdonald201007_08">{{Cite magazine |last=MacDonald |first=Jake |date=July–August 2010 |title=The Canada-U.S. Border |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/ja10/smuggler-inn.asp |magazine=Canadian Geographic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710045056/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/ja10/smuggler-inn.asp |archive-date=July 10, 2010}}</ref>

Because of its location, [[Cornwall, Ontario]], experiences ongoing smuggling—mostly of tobacco and firearms from the United States. The neighboring [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] territory of [[Akwesasne]] straddles the Ontario–Quebec–New York borders, where its [[First Nations]] sovereignty prevents [[Ontario Provincial Police]], [[Sûreté du Québec]], [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], Canada Border Services Agency, [[Canadian Coast Guard]], [[United States Border Patrol]], [[United States Coast Guard]], and [[New York State Police]] from exercising jurisdiction over exchanges taking place within the territory.<ref>Royal Canadian Mounted Police, [http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/on/news-nouvelles/2009/09-02-25-cornwall-eng.htm "Fifteen People Arrested for Possession of Contraband Tobacco during High Intensity Enforcement Project"], press release, February 25, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615204956/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/on/news-nouvelles/2009/09-02-25-cornwall-eng.htm |date=June 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=ecc66684-6dde-4924-bea7-9e54ff7b6063| title=Smuggling's price| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| date=November 21, 2008| first=Neco| last=Cockburn| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212114729/http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=ecc66684-6dde-4924-bea7-9e54ff7b6063| archivedate=February 12, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==== 2009 border occupation ====
In May 2009, the Mohawk people of Akwesasne occupied the area around the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (CBSA) port of entry building to protest the Canadian government's decision to arm its border agents while operating on Mohawk territory.  The north span of the [[Seaway International Bridge]]  and the CBSA inspection facilities were closed.  During this occupation, the Canadian flag was replaced with the flag of the Mohawk people. Although U.S. Customs remained opened to southbound traffic, northbound traffic was blocked on the U.S. side by both American and Canadian officials. The Canadian border at this crossing remained closed for six weeks.  On July 13, 2009, the CBSA opened a temporary inspection station at the north end of the north span of the bridge in the city of Cornwall, allowing traffic to once again flow in both directions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cornwall border reopened after Mohawk dispute|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/cornwall-border-reopened-after-mohawk-dispute-1.435899|date=September 19, 2009|website=CTVNews|access-date=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

The Mohawk people of Akwesasne have staged ongoing protests at this border.  In 2014 they objected to a process that made their crossing more tedious; believing it violated their treaty rights of free passage.  When traveling from the U.S. to [[Cornwall Island (Ontario)|Cornwall Island]], they must first cross a second bridge into Canada, for inspection at the new Canadian border station. Discussions between inter-governmental agencies were being pursued on the feasibility of relocating the Canadian border inspection facilities on the U.S. side of the border.<ref>{{Cite web|title=New Cornwall bridge opens, but it still feels closed to Mohawks|url=https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/23858/20140124/new-cornwall-bridge-opens-but-it-still-feels-closed-to-mohawks|last1=Sommerstein|first1=David|last2=Canton|first2=in|website=NCPR|access-date=May 2, 2020|last3=NY}}</ref>

The [[Canadian territory]] of [[Yukon]] shares its entire border with the U.S. state of [[Alaska]], beginning at the [[Beaufort Sea]] at {{Coord|69|39|N|141|00|W|display=inline}} and proceeds southwards along the [[141st meridian west]]. At 60°18′N, the border proceeds away from the 141st meridian west in a southeastward direction, following the [[St. Elias Mountains]]. South of the [[60th parallel north]], the border continues into British Columbia.<ref>{{Google maps|title=Yukon Territory|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Yukon/@64.1860633,-150.0168066,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x51178198b4528b89:0x2e149cd561cc96ea!8m2!3d64.2823274!4d-135|accessdate=April 29, 2020}}</ref>

=== British Columbia ===
[[British Columbia]] has two international borders with the United States: with the state of Alaska along BC's northwest, and with the [[contiguous United States]] along the southern edge of the province, including (west to east) [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]].<ref name=":1">{{Google maps|title=British Columbia|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/place/British+Columbia/@53.7772148,-135.5211676,5z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x537a66c7aa6b6aaf:0x881b41e937e7f1f9!8m2!3d53.7266683!4d-127.6476206|accessdate=April 29, 2020}}</ref>

BC's Alaskan border, continuing from that of Yukon's, proceeds through the [[Saint Elias Mountains|St. Elias Mountains]], followed by [[Mt. Fairweather]] at {{Coord|58|54|N|137|31|W|display=inline}}, where the border heads northwestward towards the [[Coast Mountains]].<ref name=":1" /> At {{Coord|59|48|N|135|28|W|display=inline}}, the border begins a general southeastward direction along the Coast Mountains. The border eventually reaches the [[Portland Canal]] and follows it outward to the [[Dixon Entrance]], which takes the border down and out into the Pacific Ocean, terminating it upon reaching [[international waters]].

BC's border along the contiguous U.S. begins southwest of [[Vancouver Island]] and northwest of the [[Olympic Peninsula]], at the terminus of international waters in the Pacific Ocean.<ref name=":1" /> It follows the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] eastward, turning northeastward to enter [[Haro Strait]]. The border follows the strait in a northward direction, but turns sharply eastward through [[Boundary Pass]], separating the Canadian [[Gulf Islands]] from the American [[San Juan Islands]]. Upon reaching the [[Strait of Georgia]], the border turns due north and then towards the northwest, bisecting the strait until the 49th parallel north. After making a sharp turn eastbound, the border follows this parallel across the [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen Peninsula]], separating [[Point Roberts, Washington]] from [[Delta, British Columbia]], and continues into Alberta.

At {{Coord|45|59|N|83|26|W|display=inline}}, the border turns southward into the [[False Detour Channel]], from which it reaches [[Lake Huron]]. Through the Lake, the border heads southward until reaching the [[St. Clair River]], leading it to [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]]. The border proceeds through Lake St. Clair, reaching the [[Detroit River]], which leads it to [[Lake Erie]]. From Lake Erie the border is lead into the [[Niagara River]], which takes it into [[Lake Ontario]]. From here, the boundary heads northwestward until it reaches {{Coord|43|27|N|79|12|W|display=inline}}, where it makes a sharp turn towards the northeast. The border then reaches the St. Lawrence River, proceeding through it until finally, at {{Coord|45|00|N|74|40|W|display=inline}}, the border splits from the River and continues into Québec.<ref name=":3" />

=== Quebec ===
The province of Québec borders (west to east) the U.S. states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, beginning where the Ontario-New York border ends in the St. Lawrence River at the [[45th parallel north]].<ref>{{Google maps|title=Québec|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Quebec/@52.4464314,-86.24642,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4c58b5349fd1a8a1:0x1040cadae4d0020!8m2!3d52.9399159!4d-73.5491361|accessdate=April 29, 2020}}</ref> This border heads inland towards the east, remaining on or near the parallel. At {{Coord|45|00|N|71|30|W|display=inline}}, the border begins to follow various natural features of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], continuing to do so until  {{Coord|46|25|N|70|03|W|display=inline}}, where it begins to head northbound, then northeastward at {{Coord|46|41|N|69|59|W|display=inline}}. Finally, at {{Coord|47|27|N|69|13|W|display=inline}}, the border heads toward [[Beau Lake]], going through it and continuing into New Brunswick.

=== New Brunswick ===
The entire border of New Brunswick is shared with U.S. state of Maine, beginning at the southern tip of Beau Lake at {{Coord|47|18|N|69|03|W|display=inline}}, subsequently proceeding to the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]].<ref>{{Google maps|title=New Brunswick|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/place/NB/@46.1765991,-68.5939437,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4ca3fdd032350ecd:0xe66dc95a026805cc!8m2!3d46.5653163!4d-66.4619164|accessdate=April 29, 2020}}</ref> The border moves through the River until  {{Coord|47|04|N|67|47|W|display=inline}}, where it splits from the river and heads southward into the [[Chiputneticook Lakes]] at {{Coord|45|56|N|67|47|W|display=inline}}, which subsequently leads the border to the [[St. Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]]. The border proceeds through the St. Croix to [[Passamaquoddy Bay]], which then leads it to [[Grand Manan Island]] into the middle of the [[Bay of Fundy]]. Here, the border turns towards the south and terminates upon reaching international waters.

=== Airports ===
[[File:CBP International Travel Preclearance Operations in Canada (39844023192).jpg|thumb|Entrance to a U.S. pre-clearance area at [[Vancouver International Airport]]. Pre-clearance areas are situated in several Canadian airports to help expedite the customs process.]]
The U.S. maintains [[United States border preclearance|pre-clearance facilities]] (i.e. immigration offices) at eight Canadian airports with international air service to the United States: [[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]]; [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]; [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax Stanfield]]; [[Montréal–Trudeau International Airport|Montreal–Trudeau]]; [[Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport|Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier]]; [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto–Pearson]], [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver]]; and [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson]]. These procedures expedite travel by allowing flights originating in Canada to land at a U.S. airport without being processed as an international arrival. Canada does not maintain equivalent personnel at U.S. airports due to the sheer number of Canada-bound flights from U.S. departure locations, as well as because of the limited number of flights compared to that of U.S.-bound flights that depart major Canadian airports.

====Cross-border airports====
One curiosity on the Canada–U.S. border is the presence of six airports and eleven [[seaplane base]]s whose runways straddle the borderline. Such airports were built prior to the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|U.S. entry into World War II]] as a way to legally transfer U.S.-built aircraft, such as the [[Lockheed Hudson]], to Canada under the provisions of the [[Lend-Lease|''Lend-Lease Act'']]. In the interest of maintaining neutrality, U.S. military pilots were forbidden to deliver combat aircraft to Canada. As result, the aircraft were flown to the border, where they landed, then were towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses overnight. The next day, the planes were crewed by [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in [[Eastern Canada]] and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], from where they were flown to the [[United Kingdom]] and deployed in the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref>[http://archive.copanational.org/PlacesToFly/airport_view.php?pr_id=4&ap_id=1065 Places to Fly – Dunseith / International Peace Garden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613024215/http://archive.copanational.org/PlacesToFly/airport_view.php?pr_id=4&ap_id=1065 |date=June 13, 2012 }}.

[[File:Piney Pinecreek Border Airport.jpg|thumb|left|Ramp facilities at Piney Pinecreek Border Airport. The left-hand building and ramp are north of the border in Canada; those on the right are in the United States.]]
[[Piney Pinecreek Border Airport]] is located in [[Piney, Manitoba]] and [[Pinecreek, Minnesota|Pinecreek]], Minnesota. The northwest–southeast-oriented runway straddles the border, and there are two ramps: one in the U.S. and one in Canada. The airport is owned by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]].<ref name=":0">Simpson, Victoria. 2020. "[https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/4-airports-shared-by-the-us-and-canada.html 4 Airports Shared By The U.S. And Canada]." ''WorldAtlas''. Retrieved April 29, 2020.</ref>

[[International Peace Garden Airport]] is located in [[Boissevain, Manitoba|Boissevain]], Manitoba and [[Dunseith, North Dakota|Dunseith]], [[North Dakota]] adjacent to the [[International Peace Garden]]. The runway is entirely within North Dakota, but a ramp extends across the border to allow aircraft to access Canadian customs. While not jointly owned, it is operated as an international facility for customs clearance as part of the Peace Garden.

[[Coronach/Scobey Border Station Airport]] (or East Poplar Airport) is located in [[Coronach, Saskatchewan|Coronach]], Saskatchewan and [[Scobey, Montana|Scobey]], [[Montana]]. The airport is jointly owned by the Canadian and U.S. government, with its east–west runway sited exactly on the borderline.

[[Coutts/Ross International Airport]] is located in Alberta and Montana. Like Coronach/Scobey, the east–west runway is sited exactly on the border. The airport is owned entirely by the [[Montana Department of Transportation]] (DOT) Aeronautics Division.

[[Whetstone International Airport|Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport]], located in [[Del Bonita, Alberta|Del Bonita]], Alberta and [[Del Bonita, Montana|Del Bonita]], Montana, has an east–west runway sited exactly on the border, similar to Coutts/Ross. The airport is officially owned by the state of Montana and run by the state's DOT Aeronautics Division, thus it's been assigned a U.S. [[IATA airport code|identifier]] only. The facility is set up for both the general public (15 passengers max. per plane) as well as the [[United States Armed Forces|American military]].<ref name=":0" />

[[Avey Field State Airport]] is located in Washington and British Columbia. The privately owned airfield is mostly in the U.S., but several hundred feet of the north–south runway extend into Canada. As such, both Canadian and U.S. customs are available. It is assigned a U.S. identifier, but does not have a Canadian one.

Several seaplane bases have water runways that cross the border, though the extent to which they do may be difficult to ascertain. The land-based facilities for the bases are all contained within one country or the other, however, leading to multiple situations where twin seaplane bases may share the same body of water. The following seaplane facilities exist on the border:

* [[Rouses Point Seaplane Base|Rouses Point SPB]] (New York / Quebec)
* [[Van Buren Seaplane Base|Van Buren SPB]] (Maine / New Brunswick)
* [[Sault Ste Marie International Seaplane Base|Sault Ste Marie SPB]] & [[Sault Ste. Marie Water Aerodrome]] (Michigan / Ontario)
* [[Sand Point Lake Water Aerodrome]] (Minnesota / Ontario)
* [[International Falls Seaplane Base|International Falls SPB]] & [[Fort Frances Water Aerodrome]] (Minnesota / Ontario)
* [[Baudette International Airport]]{{efn|Water runway only; land runway does not cross border.}} & [[Rainy River Water Aerodrome]] (Minnesota / Ontario)
* [[Hyder Seaplane Base]] & [[Stewart Water Aerodrome]] (Alaska / British Columbia)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mythatchedhut.com/13-strange-facts-hyder-alaska/ |title=13 strange facts about the town of Hyder Alaska |accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref>

===Land border crossings===
[[File:Ambassadorbridgesailboatunderneath.jpg|thumb|The [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Michigan]] and [[Ontario]], is the busiest border crossing on the international boundary]]
Currently there are 119 legal land border crossings between the United States and Canada, 26 of which take place at a bridge or tunnel. Only 2 of the 119 crossings are one-way, the [[Churubusco–Franklin Centre Border Crossing]], where travellers may enter only the United States; and the [[Four Falls Border Crossing]], where travellers may enter only Canada.

There are six roads that have [[List of Canada–United States border crossings#Unstaffed road crossings|unstaffed road crossings]], and do not have border inspection services in one or both directions, where travellers are legally allowed to cross the border. Those that cross are required to report to customs, which are stationed further inland.

==== Rail crossings ====
There are 39 [[List of Canada–United States border crossings#Rail crossings|railroads]] that cross the U.S.–Canada border, nine of which are no longer in use. Eleven of these railroads cross the border at a bridge or tunnel.

Only four international rail lines currently carry passengers between the U.S. and Canada. At Vancouver's [[Pacific Central Station]], passengers are required to pass through U.S. pre-clearance facilities and pass their baggage through an [[X-ray machine]] before being allowed to board the [[Seattle]]-bound [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']] train, which makes no further stops before crossing the border. Pre-clearance facilities are not available for the popular [[Adirondack (train)|''Adirondack'']] (New York City to Montreal) or [[Maple Leaf (train)|''Maple Leaf'']] (New York City to Toronto) trains, since these lines have stops between Montreal or Toronto and the border. Instead, passengers must clear customs at a stop located at the actual border.

=== Seaports ===
[[File:Cape Vincent Intl Ferry.jpg|thumb|A ferry departing [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]], Ontario for [[Cape Vincent]], [[New York (state)|New York]]]]
There are 13 international [[List of Canada–United States border crossings#Ferry crossings|ferry crossings]] operating between the U.S. and Canada. Two of them carry passengers only and one carries only rail cars.  Four of the ferries operate only on a seasonal basis.

Similar to that of the pre-clearance facilities at Canadian airports, arrangements exist at major Canadian [[Port|seaports]] that handle sealed direct import shipments into the U.S. Along the East coast, ferry services operate between the province of New Brunswick and the state of Maine, while on the West coast, they operate between British Columbia and the states of Washington and Alaska. There are also several ferry services in the Great Lakes operating between the province of Ontario and the states of Michigan, New York, and Ohio. The ferry between Maine and Nova Scotia ended its operations in 2009, resuming again in 2014.

On [[Heart Island]] in the St. Lawrence River, the [[Boldt Castle]] has a border control point with no specific location on the Canadian side.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} As such, Canadians must present identification to land on the island.

=== Cross-border buildings ===
[[File:HaskellLibraryBorderLine.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Haskell Free Library and Opera House|Haskell Library]] sits on the international boundary, with the boundary marked by a black line on the floor of its reading room]]
A [[line house]] is a building located so that an international boundary passes through it. There are several such buildings that exist along the U.S.–Canada border:

* The [[Haskell Free Library and Opera House]] straddles the border in [[Derby Line, Vermont]], and [[Stanstead, Quebec]]. 
* Private homes divided by the boundary line between [[Estcourt Station, Maine]], and [[Pohénégamook]], Quebec.
* Private homes divided between [[Stanstead, Quebec#Beebe Plain|Beebe Plain, Quebec]] and [[Beebe Plain, Vermont]]; 
* A seasonal home divided at the intersection of Matthias Lane in [[Alburgh (town), Vermont|Alburgh, Vermont]], and Chemin au Bord de l'Eau in [[Noyan, Quebec]];

==Boundary divisions==
=== Practical exclaves ===
To be a true international [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], ''all'' potential paths of travel from the exclave to the home country must cross over only the territory of a different country or countries. Like exclaves, practical exclaves are not contiguous with the ''land'' of the home country and have ''land'' access only through another country or countries. Unlike exclaves, they are not ''entirely'' surrounded by foreign territory. Hence, they are exclaves ''for practical purposes'', without meeting the strict definition.

The term ''pene-exclave,'' also known as a "functional" or "practical" exclave,<ref name="EV" />{{rp|31}} was defined by G. W. S. Robinson (1959) as "parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently&nbsp;— in particular by wheeled traffic&nbsp;— only through the territory of another country."<ref name="Robinson">{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=G.

==== Practical exclaves of Canada ====
[[File:Campobello Island (3746650639).jpg|thumb|[[Campobello Island]] is a practical exclave of Canada, with land access to the mainland being only to Maine]]Akwesasne: The Quebec western portion of the Akwesasne reserve is a practical exclave of Canada because of the St. Lawrence River to the north, the [[St. Regis River]] to the east, New York State, U.S. to the south. To travel by land to elsewhere in Canada, one must drive through New York State.

[[Campobello Island]]: Located at the entrance to [[Passamaquoddy Bay]], adjacent to the entrance to [[Cobscook Bay]], and within the [[Bay of Fundy]]. The island is part of [[Charlotte County, New Brunswick|Charlotte County]], New Brunswick, but is actually physically connected by the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge]] with [[Lubec, Maine]], the easternmost tip of the continental United States.

Additionally, because of the terrain, several municipalities in [[southeast Alaska]] (the "Panhandle") are inaccessible by road, except via Canada. Specifically, the town of [[Hyder, Alaska]] is accessible only through [[Stewart, British Columbia]], or by floatplane. Moreover, [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]] and [[Skagway]] are accessible by road only through Canada, although there are car ferries which connect them to other Alaskan places.

In Minnesota, [[Elm Point, Minnesota|Elm Point]], two small pieces of land to its west ([[Buffalo Bay Point]]), and the [[Northwest Angle]] are bounded by the province of [[Manitoba]] and Lake of the Woods.

In Vermont, the [[Alburgh (town), Vermont|Alburgh Tongue]], as well as [[Lake Champlain#Province Point, Vermont|Province Point]], which is the small end of a peninsula east of [[Alburgh (town), Vermont|Alburgh]], are bounded by Quebec and Lake Champlain.{{efn|However, this peninsula and the island to its south are connected by road bridges directly to the United States mainland (as well as by a freight [and former passenger] rail line), such that it is possible to make a through journey in and out of the Alburgh Tongue without entering Canada.

[[Point Roberts, Washington]] is bounded by British Columbia, the Strait of Georgia, and [[Boundary Bay]].

=== Split features ===
Between Quebec and Vermont, [[Province Island]] is a piece of land that primarily lies in Canada, though a small portion of the island is situated in the U.S. state, lying south of the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]] with a border vista marking the international boundary. [[Canusa Street]] is the only portion of the Canada–United States border split down the middle of a street.

Between [[North Dakota]] and Manitoba, the international border splits a peninsula within a lake on the border of [[Rolette County, North Dakota|Rolette County]], ND, and the [[Wakopa Wildlife Management Area]], MB.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.historicmapworks.com/Map/US/501978/Hutchinson+Township++Page+069/Rolette+County+1910/North+Dakota/|work=Rolette County Atlas|year=1910|title=Hutchinson Township|page=69|publisher=Geo.
