==History==

===1959–1969===
The SF was founded on 15 February 1959 by [[Aksel Larsen]], a former leader of the [[Communist Party of Denmark]] (DKP).<ref>{{cite web |title=Denmark During the Cold War: Highlights of the DIIS report|publisher=Danish Institute for International Studies|url=http://www.diis.dk/sw26673.asp|date=30 June 2005}}</ref> Larsen was removed from the ranks of the DKP for his criticism over the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intervention in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Larsen and the new SF sought to form a third way between Denmark's United States-oriented [[social democracy]] and [[Soviet Union]]–oriented [[communism]], which sought to combine democracy with [[socialism]]. He was joined by a large share of the members of the DKP. They all supported the idea of independence from the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas Ekman Jørgensen |title=National Ways to Socialism? |editor=Martin Klimke |display-editors=etal |work=Between Prague Spring and French May |date=2011 |publisher=Berghahn |location=New York and Oxford |url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/extras/Klimke-TextAll_paperback.pdf#page=59 |accessdate=30 December 2014 |pages=51–52 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216215857/http://www.berghahnbooks.com/extras/Klimke-TextAll_paperback.pdf#page=59 |archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref>

In the [[1960 Danish parliamentary election|1960 elections]], the party entered the [[Folketing]] with eleven seats. The DKP lost all of its six seats. In the [[1964 Danish parliamentary election|1964 elections]] the party lost one seat. During the 1960s the SF became involved in the [[peace movement]] and the movements which opposed [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. It sought to "walk on two legs", by combining its parliamentary work with involvement in grass roots movements.

In the [[1966 Danish parliamentary election|1966 elections]], the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the SF won a combined majority in parliament, in which the SF doubled its number of seats from 10 to 20. A Social Democrat [[minority government]] was formed, which was supported by the SF. The cooperation lasted only one year, but lead to considerable conflict within the SF: in 1967 the [[Left Socialists]] (VS) broke away from the SF. In the subsequent [[1968 Danish parliamentary election|1968 elections]], the SF lost nine seats and the VS entered parliament with four. In 1969 the party chairperson Larsen stood down, he was replaced by [[Sigurd Ømann]].

===1969–1991===
In the [[1971 Danish parliamentary election|1971 elections]], the party regained ground on the VS, gaining six seats, while the VS left the Folketing. In 1972, the party participated in the [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] campaign against Denmark's entry into the [[European Economic Community]]. The Danish voters voted in favour of the European by a narrow margin. Because of its opposition to the EEC however boosted the SF's membership and support. In the subsequent [[1973 Danish parliamentary election|1973 "landslide" elections]], the SF lost six seats (reducing the party's share to 11), and the DKP re-entered the Folketing with six seats. In 1974, Ømann stood down as party chairperson in favour of Gert Petersen. In the [[1975 Danish parliamentary election|1975 elections]], the SF lost two seats and the VS re-entered the Folketing as well. In [[1977 Danish parliamentary election|1977]] the party reached an all-time low with only seven seats. During the 1970s, the SF began to change its program and electoral appeal. Where it had been a male-domined workers' party it became broader [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] political party that was oriented towards new voters and [[new social movements]]. It became more focused on the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[Identity politics|gender politics]].

In [[1979 Danish parliamentary election|1979]], the party won four seats as the DKP lost its six seats. In the [[1981 Danish parliamentary election|1981 elections]], the party almost doubled from eleven to twenty-one. In the [[1984 Danish parliamentary election|1984 elections]] it remained stable. In the [[1986 Danish Single European Act referendum|1986 referendum]] on the [[Single European Act]], the SF campaigned together with the Social Democrats and the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]] against the European Community. The SEA was adopted by a narrow margin. In the subsequent [[1987 Danish parliamentary election|1987]], it reached its all-time peak with twenty seven seats. In [[1988 Danish parliamentary election|1988]], it lost three seats, and in [[1990 Danish parliamentary election|1990]], it lost another nine, leaving only fifteen. In 1991, the party chairman Petersen stood down in favour of [[Holger K. Nielsen]]. Between 1982 and 1993, a centre-right government led by [[Poul Schlüter]] formed by the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservatives]], the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]], and allies was in power, even though the Social Democrats, SF, and the Social Liberals formed a majority in parliament. This, combined with its links with the peace and environmental movement, gave the SF the power to force alternative security and environmental policies.

===1991–2001===
In 1991, Petersen stood down as party chairman; he was replaced by [[Holger K. Nielsen]], who was – compared to the other candidate Steen Gade – closer to the party's socialist past.

In the [[1992 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum|1992 referendum]] on the [[treaty of Maastricht]], the SF campaigned for the "no"-vote. The Danish people voted against the referendum. In 1993, the SF formed a historic compromise with the other parties in the Folketing. It accepted the concessions made to the Danes in the [[Edinburgh Agreement (1992)|Edinburgh Agreement]] and to the SF in the National Compromise. Therefore, it campaigned to vote "yes" in the [[1993 Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum|second referendum]]. Just before the referendum in 1991, the SF's party congress had adopted a new program of action and principles, "Mod Nye Tider (Towards New Times)", which departed from the old anti-EU line. As a group in the SF became more positive of the EU, the SF became increasingly divided on the issue.

In [[1994 Danish parliamentary election|1994]], it lost another two seats and the [[Red-Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red-Green Alliance]] an alliance which included the DKP and the VS entered parliament with six seats. In the [[1998 Danish parliamentary election|1998 elections]] the party remained stable. During the [[1998 Danish Amsterdam Treaty referendum|1998 referendum]] on the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], it led the No-camp again, unsuccessfully. Between 1993 and 2001, the SF supported a [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrat]]/[[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal]] minority government led by [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]].

In the [[2000 Danish euro referendum|2000 referendum]] on the euro, the SF was part of the successful "no" campaign.

===In opposition 2001–2011===
In the [[2001 Danish parliamentary election|2001 elections]], the party lost one seat and after [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]], the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] and the [[Danish People's Party]] gained a majority SF lost almost all political influence in parliament. There were some local bright spots with great support to SF mayors in [[Vejle]], [[Them, Denmark|Them]], [[Nakskov]], [[Kalundborg]], and [[Maribo]] caused by charismatic candidates.

In 2004, the party's sole MEP again decided to sit with [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] group, instead of the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left|European United Left/Nordic Green Left]], leading to considerable internal conflict. The party has since then come around to her point of view, and in 2008, it was decided that future SF MEPs should sit in the Green Group, although at the time SF was still only an observer in the [[European Green Party]] and not a full member.

In the [[2005 Danish parliamentary election|2005 elections]], SF gained the worst election result since 1979, and lost yet another seat in parliament. On election night Holger K. Nielsen stepped down as party chairman in favour of a new chair. When [[Holger K. Nielsen]] announced that he would step down as chairman, three candidates for the post came forth: [[Pia Olsen|Pia Olsen Dyhr]], [[Meta Fuglsang]], and [[Villy Søvndal]]. At an at times chaotic process on the party congress resulted in the decision to hold a ballot among the party members to decide who should be chairman. Søvndal, running on a platform of moving the party further to the [[left-wing politics|political left]] won the ballot with 60% of the vote.

The election of Søvndal brought major changes to the party. Greater emphasis was placed on professionalism, the use of focus groups and a change in electoral strategy. The number of key issues was reduced to three to better penetrate in the media with fewer slogans.

In a 2006 internal referendum, 66% of the SF-members declared that the party should participate in the "yes"-camp in a referendum on the [[European Constitution]], a historic break from its Eurosceptic past.

In the [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|2007 election]], SF more than doubled its seats in parliament and became the fourth-largest party with increased support across the country. In itself this did not bring about any major change in political influence since the centre-right was able to maintain its majority. However the increase in votes and members of parliament brought optimism and new resources to the party. The media had also discovered Søvndal's ability to make an impact and gave him the opportunity to use that in many cases. The number of party members also greatly increased during this period.

At the 2006 party congress, Søvndal took exception to anti-democratic groups, mostly [[Hizb-ut-Tahrir]] using unusually harsh language. He repeated these statements on his blog in 2008 which led to great attention to the party and some internal criticism. Right-wing politicians praised Søvndal's statements and rhetoric which caused insecurity in some parts of the party who felt they were being embraced by some of SF's main political opponents on the right wing. The polls during these months showed a constant rise in support for the party which combined with a decline in support for the Social Democrats showed an almost equal support to the two parties. For the first time ever some polls showed greater support for SF than for the Social Democrats. In the spring of 2008 this however changed so that SF got 16% in the polls and the Social Democrats 23%.

In 2008, SF voted in favour for the national budget for 2009. This was the first time the SF had voted in favour of a national budget by the [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen|Fogh]] cabinet. This was widely regarded as an attempt to disprove the frequent accusations of SF not being "economically responsible".

===In government 2011–2014===
Before [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|the 2011 election]], SF announced that its goal was to be part of a cabinet consisting of SF, the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], and the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]]. While the Social Democrats were positive to the idea the Social Liberals were initially more sceptical, due to differences in economic policies. This became a reality with the formation [[cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt]]: For the first time, SF was part of a cabinet, with six cabinet ministers. In September 2012 Villy Søvndal announced that he was stepping down as chairman of the party. After a protracted election for the party chair [[Annette Vilhelmsen]] was elected chairwoman with 66% of the constituency, against the 34% achieved by her competitor [[Astrid Krag]]. Since Krag had the backing of most of the party leadership, Vilhelmsen's election was widely interpreted as a display of dissatisfaction with the leadership's approach to participating in government.

Vilhelmsen never managed to provide stable leadership for the party however. In January 2014, the party left the coalition government over a dispute involving the sale of shares in the state-owned energy company [[Ørsted (company)|DONG Energy]] to [[Goldman Sachs]], stating that they would instead provide [[confidence and supply]]. Vilhelmsen and a considerable part of the party leadership subsequently resigned. [[Pia Olsen Dyhr]] was subsequently elected new chairman of the party.

===Government support 2019–present===
The [[2019 Danish general election|2019 general election]] saw a victory for the 'red bloc' consisting of the Social Democrats, Social Liberals, SF, the Red-Green Alliance, the Faroese Social Democratic Party, and Siumut. SF received 7.7% of the vote, a 3.5% increase from 2015, netting them 14 seats. Following the results, Vice President [[Signe Munk]] stepped down to serve in the Folketing and [[Serdal Benli]] was elected to take Munk's place.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benli |first1=Serdal |title=Serdal Benli er ny næstformand |url=https://sf.dk/serdal-benli-er-ny-naestformand-i-sf/ |accessdate=27 April 2020 |date=17 June 2019}}</ref>

Prior to the election, SF spoke with leader of the Social Democrats [[Mette Frederiksen]] and brought a list of policy demands. These included strong climate action and the abolishment of the cash assistance ceiling, though the latter was abandoned during negotiations.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dhyr |first1=Pia Olsen |title=Ny regering skal sikre en rød-grøn retning for Danmark |url=https://sf.dk/ny-regering-skal-sikre-en-roed-groen-retning-for-danmark/ |accessdate=27 April 2020|date=26 June 2019}}</ref> Ultimately it was decided that the Social Democrats would form a one-party minority government supported by SF and the rest of the red bloc.

==Ideology and issues==

SF's ideological base is ''[[popular socialism]]'', inspired by [[green politics]] and [[democratic socialism]]. The party sees a democratic-socialist Denmark as the end goal of its politics. The party is a strong supporter of [[human rights]], the rights of minorities, and democracy.

An important issue dividing the party is the [[European Union]]. Historically the party was highly [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]. However, during the 1990s, when the EU began to implement policies oriented at regional development, environmental protection and social protection, the SF became more positive about the EU. In 2004 the party shifted towards a more [[pro-European]] stance.

Other important issues for the SF are ''[[globalization]] based on [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]].'' To that extent, it seeks to reform the [[World Trade Organization]], as well as [[Natural environment|environmental]] protection, and support feminism.

===International comparison===
{{Original research|date=November 2007}}
The SF is a [[Nordic Green Left Alliance|Nordic Green Left]] party like the Swedish [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]], the Norwegian [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]], the Finnish [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], and the Icelandic [[Left-Green Movement]]. These were also influenced by [[feminism]] and [[green politics]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Similar parties in Western Europe were the French [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] and the Dutch [[Pacifist Socialist Party]].

===Relationships to other parties===
The SF has good relationships with the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] who, in the past, have cooperated in [[minority government]]s supported from the outside by the SF, as is the current situation.

===International organizations===
SF is a member of the [[Nordic Green Left Alliance]] and the [[European Greens]]. Between 1979 and 1989, its MEPs sat in the [[Communist and Allies Group]]. Between 1989 and 1994, its sole MEP was member of the [[European United Left (1989–93)|European United Left]] parliamentary group. Between 1994 and 1999, its sole MEP sat in the [[European Greens|Green Group]]. Between 1999 and 2004, its sole MEP sat in the [[European United Left-Nordic Green Left|European United Left/Nordic Green Left]] group. After [[2004 European Parliament election in Denmark|2004 election]], SF's sole MEP, [[Margrete Auken]], controversially chose to sit in [[The Greens-European Free Alliance]] group. SF became a full member of the [[Global Greens]] in 2014.

==Organization==
The SF has a strong grass-roots organization: All members can participate in the [[party congress]]es, but only delegates have voting rights. In May 2010, the party had 17,883 members. Its youth organization is the [[Youth of the Socialist People's Party]]. The linked Socialist Popular Education Organisation organizes a yearly political summer meeting for members and non-members in [[Livø]].

==Representation==

===Party Chairperson===
The chairman of the SF has always been its party leader, which can't be taken for granted in Danish party politics.<ref>Lars Bille: Partier i forandring. En analyse af danske partiorganisationers udvikling 1960–1995, Odense 1997, {{ISBN|87-7838-314-5}}, p. 379</ref>
* [[Aksel Larsen]], 1959–1968
* [[Sigurd Ømann]], 1968–1974
* [[Gert Petersen]], 1974–1991
* [[Holger K. Nielsen]], 1991–2005
* [[Villy Søvndal]], 2005–2012
* [[Annette Vilhelmsen]], 2012–2014
* [[Pia Olsen Dyhr]], 2014–present

===Members of the Folketing===
In the [[2011 Danish parliamentary election|2015 election]], the SF fell from 16 (SF only had 12 seats as of 2015 because 4 members had left the party in 2013–2014) to 7 seats in the [[Folketing]].
* [[Holger K. Nielsen]]
* Lisbeth Bech Poulsen
* [[Pia Olsen Dyhr]]
* [[Jacob Mark]]
* Trine Torp 
* Karsten Hønge
* Kirsten Normann Andersen (took former MP Jonas Dahl's seat as he left the Folketing)

===Members of the European Parliament===
The SF has always been represented in the European Parliament. It gained one seat in [[1979 European Parliament election in Denmark|1979]], [[1984 European Parliament election in Denmark|1984]] (one additional seat on 1 January 1985), [[1989 European Parliament election in Denmark|1989]] and [[2004 European Parliament election in Denmark|2004]]. Since 2004, the elected candidate was [[Margrete Auken]]. Without the approval of the party's board, she joined The Greens–European Free Alliance parliamentary group, instead of the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left|European United Left/Nordic Green Left]] in 2004. Since then, the party has come around to her point of view, and at the national congress in 2008, it was decided that future SF MEPs will stay in the Greens–EFA group in the European Parliament, but SF will only join the [[European Green Party]] as an observer, and not as a member. In the [[2009 European Parliament election in Denmark|2009 European elections]], the party increased its share of votes to 15,6%, and got an additional seat which went to [[Emilie Turunen]], who became a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] in March 2013.
For the 2019 European Election, SF won back the 2nd seat and is now also represented by [[Kira Marie Peter-Hansen]], who is the youngest parliamentarian ever elected for the European Parliament.

===Municipal and regional government===
Currently the party has approximately 236 elected representatives in [[municipalities of Denmark|local town councils]] and 21 representatives in Denmark's fourteen [[regions of Denmark|regional councils]]. During the 1990s, the party gained its first mayors.
