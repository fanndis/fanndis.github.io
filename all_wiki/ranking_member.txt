In [[Politics of the United States|United States politics]], a '''ranking member''' is the most senior member of a congressional or state legislative committee from the minority party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/politicsglossary/Congressional/ranking-member/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701083132/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/politicsglossary/Congressional/ranking-member/ |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |title=Politics Glossary: ranking member |work=Washington Post}}</ref>  On many committees the ranking minority member, along with the chairman, serve as ''[[ex officio]]'' members of all of the committee's subcommittees.

Both the [[United States Senate]]<ref>https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/ranking_minority_member.htm</ref> and [[United States House of Representatives]]<ref>https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-are-the-house-committee-chairs</ref> use ranking members as part of their legislative structure.

When party control of a legislative chamber changes, a committee's ranking minority member is assured to become the next chairman of the committee, and vice versa.{{cn|date=October 2020}}<!--"assured" is a strong word-->

==Congressional usage==
Four Senate committees refer to the ranking minority member as [[vice chairman]]. The following committees follow the chairman/vice chairman structure for the majority and minority parties.

*[[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]]
*[[United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs|Senate Committee on Indian Affairs]]
*[[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Senate Select Committee on Ethics]]
*[[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]

Other Senate committees refer to the ranking minority members as ranking member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://banking.senate.gov/public/ |title=United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs: Home |publisher=Banking.senate.gov |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref>

The House of Representatives does not use the term vice chairman for the ranking minority member, though some committees do have a vice-chairman position, usually assigned to a senior member of the majority party other than the chairman. House committees that follow this structure are:

*[[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Committee on Agriculture]]
*[[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Committee on Appropriations]]
*[[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Committee on the Budget]]
*[[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Committee on Education and the Workforce]]
*[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Energy and Commerce]]
*[[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Committee on Financial Services]]
*[[United States House Committee on Government Reform|House Committee on Government Reform]]
*[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on Foreign Affairs]]
*[[United States House Committee on Resources|House Committee on Resources]]
*[[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|House Committee on Veterans' Affairs]]
*[[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] (subcommittees only)

Joint committees of the House and Senate operate in much the same way, with a chairman and vice-chairman from the majority party, alternating between a member of the House and a member of the Senate, and often two ranking members from both bodies.
