'''Malaysian Chinese people''' or '''Chinese Malaysians'''{{sfn|Dorall|2020}} ({{lang-zh|馬來西亞華人}}; {{lang-ms|Orang Cina Malaysia}}), are a local ethnic group in Malaysia. The group is defined as [[Malaysians|Malaysian citizens]] of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] ([[Han Chinese]]) ethnicity. Today, they form the second largest ethnic group after the Malay majority, constituting 23% of the Malaysian population. Most are descendants of [[South China|Southern Chinese]] immigrants who arrived in Malaysia between the early 19th century and the mid-20th century.

The sub-ethnic groups of Malaysian Chinese includes [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Teochew people|Teochew]], [[Hainan people|Hainan]], [[Fuzhou people|Foochow]] and [[Kwongsai people|Kwongsai]]. Malaysian Chinese also form the second largest community of [[Overseas Chinese]] in the world, after [[Thai Chinese]].

Malaysian Chinese are traditionally dominant in the business sector of the [[Economy of Malaysia|Malaysian economy]]. Different towns and cities in Malaysia are placed by different Chinese dialects among Chinese speakers; for example [[Cantonese]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Ipoh]] and [[Sandakan]], [[Hokkien]] in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Klang (city)|Klang]] and [[Kuching]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] in [[Johor Bahru]], [[Fuzhou dialect|Foochow]] in [[Sibu]], [[Miri]] and [[Sitiawan]] and [[Hainanese]] in [[Kuala Terengganu]].{{sfn|Gabaccía|Hoerder|2011|p=218}} But, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is now widely used as a [[working language]] or lingua franca among the different Chinese ethnicities and younger generations.

Culturally, most Malaysian Chinese have maintained their Chinese heritage, including their various dialects, although the descendants of the earliest Chinese migrants who arrived from the 13th to 17th centuries have assimilated aspects of the Malay or indigenous cultures, where they form a distinct sub-ethnic group known as the [[Peranakans]] in [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]], Baba-Nyonya in [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]] as well as the Sino-Natives in [[Sabah]]. Malaysian Chinese are usually referred to simply as "Chinese" in Malaysia, "''Orang Cina''" in [[Malay language|Malay]], "''Sina''" or "''Kina''" among [[Greater North Borneo languages|Borneo]] indigenous, "''Cīṉar''" ({{lang|ta|சீனர்}}) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and  "''[[Huaxia|Huaren]]''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|華人}}, Chinese people) or "''Huaqiao''" ({{lang|zh-Hant|華僑}}, Overseas Chinese) by local Chinese themselves.

Even with absolute population numbers increasing with each censuses, the proportion of ethnic Chinese among the country's total population has been consistently declining, partially due to a lower [[birth rate]] as well as a high level of [[emigration]] in recent decades. According to a report by the [[World Bank]], the [[Malaysian diaspora]] around the world in 2010 numbered at around a million, most of them ethnic Chinese. The main reasons for emigrating are the better economic and career prospects abroad and a sense of social injustice within Malaysia.{{sfn|World Bank|2011|p=12}} The large number of emigrants, many of whom are young and highly educated, constitute a significant "[[human capital flight|brain drain]]" from the country, especially to nearby Singapore.<ref>{{harvnb|Defillippi|Arthur|Lindsay|2009|p=117}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Fong|Zubair|2017|p=15}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Jakobsen|2014|p=170}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Tyson|2018|p=55}}</ref>

Since the [[History of China|early dynasties of China]], there has been connection between China and various early kingdoms in the [[Malay Archipelago]], such as in the northern area of [[Malay Peninsula]] and Po-Ni in the western part of [[Borneo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|1982|p=17}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Zepp|1989|pp=19–21}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Wong|1999|p=132}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Munoz|2006|p=178}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Lee|2013|p=542}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Wan|Mair|Roberts|Swofford|2013|pp=7–11}}</ref> The first recorded movement of people from [[Yuan dynasty|China]] into the present-territory of Malaysia was during the arrival of [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] expeditionary forces under the led of [[Kublai Khan]] to Borneo in 1292 for their preparation in the [[Mongol invasion of Java|invasion of Java]] in 1293.{{sfn|Royal Society (Great Britain)|1924|p=157}}{{sfn|Runciman|2011|p=11}} Many of his Chinese followers and traders later settled and established their own enclave within the [[Kinabatangan River]] as a result of the campaign with their arrival are warmly received by the [[indigenous people]] in the island who were eager to possess the [[jar]]s and [[bead]] they brought along with [[silk]]s, metalwork and [[Chinese ceramics|pottery]].{{sfn|Wong|1998|p=2}}{{sfn|Guillot|Lombard|Ptak|1998|p=162}}{{sfn|Runciman|2011|p=14}}

[[File:Map of Ming Chinese empire 1415.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Ming dynasty]] under [[Yongle Emperor]] in the year of 1415, map published in 1935.]]
Through the establishment of firm relationship, a Chinese explorer and mariner named [[Zheng He]] commanded [[Ming treasure voyages|several expeditions to southeastern Asia]] between 1405 and 1430 where they visiting [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in their third voyage.{{sfn|Brezina|2016|p=58}} His accompanier and translator named [[Ma Huan]] described the place in his ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'' as formerly under Siam before a local king there asserting for independence to become an "Islamised country", and by the time of their fourth imperial fleet visit, he described the local king had just [[religious conversion|converted]] and dressed like an [[Arab people|Arab]] with his kingdom are chafing under the Chinese dominance.{{sfn|Ma|Huan|Feng|1970|p=109}}{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=133}} The last edition of official Chinese historical works of ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' named as [[History of Ming]] (''Mingshi'') made a brief mention of an already established Chinese settlement in the area,{{sfn|Tan|1988|p=29}} followed by other records especially when trade contacts had been established with the [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]] region.{{sfn|Purcell|1947|p=115–125}} The ''Words about the Sea'' (Hai Yü) written by Hwang Chung (Huang Zhong) and published in 1537 gives further account on the life practice of the Chinese community in Malacca which are different than the local [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]].{{sfn|Groeneveldt|1876|p=7}}

The connection is well maintained even with the Islamisation of the Malacca and [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] kingdoms, whose [[thalassocracy]] once covered much of the territory of the present-day Malaysia.  Both of the Muslim sultanates pledged protection from the Chinese dynasties to shield them from further conquest either by neighbouring Javanese [[Majapahit]] or Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].{{sfn|Cohen|2000|p=175}}{{sfn|Ma|Cartier|2003|p=79}}{{sfn|de Vienne|2015|p=42–43}} The close relationship also resulted in the [[interracial marriage]] between the Sultanate royal family and Chinese envoy and representatives.{{sfn|Ma|Cartier|2003|p=90}}{{sfn|Lee|2010|p=11}}{{sfn|Ooi|2015|p=50}} Zheng He's arrival propagated the [[Islam in Southeast Asia|spread of Islam in the Malay Archipelago]] and aided the growth of [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] population from the eastern China's coastal towns of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]] with many of their traders arrived at the coastal towns of present-day Malaysia and [[Indonesia]] by the early 15th century.{{sfn|Ember|Ember|Skoggard|2004|p=115}}{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=11}} Apart from the early settlements in Kinabatangan and Malacca, two other oldest Chinese settlements are located in [[Terengganu]] and [[Penang Island]] as part of the trade networks with the respective areas.{{sfn|Lee|1965|p=306–314}}{{sfn|Wong|2016|p=9–21}}{{sfn|Wade|Chin|2018|p=249}}

Following the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquest of Malacca]] by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1511, many Chinese traders avoided [[Portuguese Malacca]] although the flow of emigrants from China continued.{{sfn|Guillot|Lombard|Ptak|1998|p=179}}
The [[Zhengde Emperor]] conducted several retaliations against the Portuguese due to their activities in Malacca during the [[Ming dynasty]], following the arrival of her fleet in Canton.{{sfn|Zhang|1934|p=67}} However, the Chinese emperor was reluctant to help the deposed Malaccan ruler reclaim his position, as the dynasty{{'s}} foreign policy was being changed to maintain friendly relations with the Portuguese.{{sfn|Zhang|1934|p=67}}{{sfn|Wade|Chin|2018|p=144}}

His successor, the [[Jiajing Emperor]] later changed the attitude of the Ming court by executing two government officials and reaffirming the importance of issues regarding the Malacca in major policy decisions.{{sfn|Wade|Chin|2018|p=144}} Regardless, some Chinese from China proper, including those from Fujian, defying Ming dynasty regulation for the sake of trade, informed the Portuguese on the trade route between [[Guangdong]] and Siam. The local Malaccan Chinese were not treated favourably by the Portuguese, so they, along with most overseas Chinese, refused to cooperate with the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Guillot|Lombard|Ptak|1998|p=179}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Wernham|1968|p=543}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Kratoska|2001a|p=101}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Borschberg|2004|p=12}}</ref> Through the administration of Portuguese in Malacca, Chinese Muslims sided with other Islamic traders against the latter by providing ships and [[human capital|capital]].{{sfn|Borschberg|2004|p=12}} A negotiation was later held in Guangdong regarding the Malaccan issues between the Chinese officials and Portuguese envoys, with Malacca remaining under Portuguese control.{{sfn|Wade|Chin|2018|p=145–146}}

Following the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] [[Battle of Malacca (1641)|takeover of Malacca]] in 1641,{{sfn|Blussé|2009|p=23}} many local Malaccan Chinese were hired for the construction of Dutch buildings.{{sfn|Lim|Fernando|2006|p=126}} The Dutch found the Chinese to be industrious and encouraged the latter{{'s}} participation in the economic life of the Dutch colony.{{sfn|Ramanathan|1994|p=67}} Under their administration, the Dutch also established a settlement in [[Perak Sultanate|Perak]] in 1650 through an earlier treaty with [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=479}} The Dutch further suggested the 17th Sultan of Perak, Alauddin, to allow the Chinese to develop [[tin mining|tin mines]], which was warmly welcomed by the latter. It also facilitated his scheme of requesting more Chinese workers to be sent from Malacca. He promised to punish any official guilty of mistreating the Chinese as well.{{sfn|Khoo|Lubis|2005|p=5}}{{sfn|Mizushima|Souza|Flynn|2014|p=210}}

With the Sultan{{'s}} consent, the Chinese began playing a leading role in the industry; however, as a result of the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1780, tin trade was adversely affected and many Chinese miners left.{{sfn|Khoo|1972|p=39}} Despite the existence of early Chinese settlements in Malacca and several areas along the coasts of the archipelago, the mass migration of Chinese to Malaysia largely occurred after the founding of British settlements in both [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] during the early 19th century.{{sfn|Hirschman|1986|p=338}}
[[File:British officials in Perak with wealthy Chinese person.jpg|thumb|left|Wealthy Chinese person with British officials in [[Perak Sultanate|Perak]], {{circa|1904}}.]]
The foundation of a British settlement in Penang (1786) and another in [[Founding of modern Singapore|Singapore]] in 1819 triggered an mass emigration from China to the Malay Peninsula.{{sfn|Hirschman|1986|p=338}} Following the establishment of British rule in [[Crown Colony of Labuan|Labuan]] in 1846, more ethnic Chinese, the majority of whom are [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and many of them from Singapore, arrived at the British Borneo part of [[North Borneo]]. The migration trend continued through the first few years of the establishment of the [[North Borneo Chartered Company]].{{sfn|Wong|1999|p=132}}
Chinese migration to both Labuan and North Borneo is largely confined to the [[agricultural]] sectors, while in the [[Raj of Sarawak]], they are largely restricted to the mining, as well as the agricultural sectors.{{sfn|Hewitt|1864|p=31}}{{sfn|Niew|1969|p=2}} Rajah [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Charles Brooke]] of Sarawak promoted the migration of the Chinese, along with the [[Dayak people|Dayak]], to the interior of Sarawak in order to develop the area. This resulted in the establishment of an administrative centre and a trading centre (''[[bazaar]]'') by the 19th century, primarily in the First, Second and Third Divisions of the country.{{sfn|Drabble|2000|p=86}}

In 1876, Rajah Charles further invited Chinese-[[black pepper|pepper]] grower from Singapore to settle in Kuching, which later being joined by local Chinese miners and others from neighbouring Dutch Borneo.{{sfn|Gurney|1986|p=268}}{{sfn|Bulbeck|Reid|Tan|Yiqi|1998|p=68}} With the introduction of pepper into the kingdom, the entire pepper cultivation in Sarawak area of Kuching-Serian in the First Division are dominated by the Hakka, while the [[Fuzhou people|Foochow]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] dominate the cultivation in Sarikei-Binatang area in the Third Division, making Sarawak the second largest pepper producer in the world.{{sfn|Bulbeck|Reid|Tan|Yiqi|1998|p=68}}{{sfn|Kaur|2016|p=48}} Following the British success in gaining direct control on the four states of Perak, [[Selangor Sultanate|Selangor]], [[Yamtuan Besar|Negeri Sembilan]] and [[Sultan of Pahang|Pahang]], nearly two million Chinese immigrants entered with half of 1.5 million in both Perak and Selangor.{{sfn|Doran|Dixon|1991|p=111}}{{sfn|Kratoska|2001b|p=209}}

With the [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times|further discovery of rich tin deposits]] in British Malaya, the Chinese immigrants became more involved in the tin mining businesses with many of their labourers work in the industry.{{sfn|Yat|1969|p=57}} With more tin mines opened in Perak, many of the Chinese community in neighbouring Penang also gain profits and become wealthy.{{sfn|Douw|Huang|Ip|2013|p=165}} By the 1870s, many Chinese tin mining communities had been established in the Malay Peninsula, particularly in [[Ipoh]] ([[Kinta Valley]]), [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]],
[[Seremban]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] ([[Klang Valley]]) which is largely dominated by Hakka and Cantonese group.{{sfn|Tin Industry (Research and Development) Board|1955|p=9}}{{sfn|Lin|Hill|1979|p=145}} Each of the mining communities were governed by a [[Kapitan Cina]] with duties and privileges similar as being used in the ''[[Kangchu system]]'' of [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]].{{sfn|Landa|2016|p=58}} The huge influx of Chinese migration are directly caused by the poverty in rural China and massive employment opportunities in the British colonial or [[protectorate]] territories with an estimated of 5 million Chinese had entered by the 19th century and 12 million more despite a total of 17 million later either moved to other parts of Southeast Asia or return to China.{{sfn|Ching|McKenna|1990|p=2}} Nonetheless with their economic success following the migration, there were also disorder among the Chinese communities as they were divided into different [[secret societies]] which in part exarcerbated by political unrest among Malay aristocracy fighting for the right to be chief with each side enlisting help from different Chinese secret societies faction.{{sfn|Landa|2016|p=58}}{{sfn|Comber|1956|p=146–162}} The situation of the local Malay politics at the time are described by observers as plagued with anarchy and civil war between their own kind, prompting alliances of high placed Malay political leaders with the Chinese as well European officials for protection and securing their investments.{{sfn|Peletz|1996|p=102}}

By the 1900s, civil wars and conflicts between the indigenous ethnics began to cease when the British established control over both Malaya and northern Borneo despite none of the Malay kingdoms actually being under colonial rule with all the related entities coming under political and economic stability as well economic prosperity under the British [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and economic geared up by the Chinese and Indian workforce through the national exploitation of tin and [[natural rubber|rubber]].{{sfn|Ching|McKenna|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|Khoo|2010}} Prior to the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Chinese Revolution]] that successfully overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]] in China, the leader of the [[Tongmenghui]] revolt named [[Sun Yat-sen]] raise overseas funding and organisational support from overseas Chinese communities mainly from [[French Indochina]], [[Dutch East Indies]], [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippines]], [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–1932)|Siam]], British Singapore, British Malaya and British Borneo with the establishment of Nanyang revolutionary organisation activities in [[Saigon]], [[Hanoi]], [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], [[Manila]], [[Bangkok]], Singapore and [[George Town, Penang|George Town]].<ref>{{harvnb|de Ruffé|1928|p=124}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Harris|1956|p=98}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Png|1961|pp=1–32}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Journal of the Siam Society|1974|p=44}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Suryadinata|2006|p=122}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Lai|Hock|2011|p=247}}</ref> Through the way to transform the current administration of China, a competition raise between three groups who champion the political reformation with each of the group targeted overseas Chinese especially in Malaya and Singapore for their source of support and funds.{{sfn|Khoo|2008|p=24}} The first group consists of the pro-Qing elite, who mainly targets wealthy Chinese for funds and expertise to modernise China, while the other two are reformists and revolutionaries who intends to advocated [[constitutional amendment|constitutional reforms]], introduction of [[parliamentary system]] and complete overthrow of Qing and Manchu political influence for a modern Chinese nation.{{sfn|Khoo|2008|p=24}}

Following the success of reformists and revolutionaries after the revolution with the establishment of a new Chinese government under the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], many branches of the Tongmenghui succeeding party of [[Kuomintang]] emerged in British Malaya with majority support were first shown by Straits-born Chinese than the China-born.{{sfn|Khoo|2010}} In British Borneo, Kuomintang activities came under the Democratic Party of North Borneo, a body formed by Chinese-educated [[:wikt:towkay|towkays]] despite it is not known whether China assisted the activities.{{sfn|Borneo Research Council|1977|p=114}} The patriotism among Chinese immigrant communities was then entirely focused on China.{{sfn|Wang|1964|p=141}} The British colonial authorities initially had no problem for any Chinese residing in the two territories becoming Kuomintang members but with the [[Pan-Asianism|pan-Asian]] policy within the organisation, this resulted the British and the new Chinese government unable to maintain a close relationship.{{sfn|Hak|2000|p=69}} By 1925, when a communist movement emerged among the overseas Chinese with the establishment of [[South Seas Communist Party]] in colonial Singapore and its subsequent banning, this further leading to the establishment of [[Indochinese Communist Party]], [[Communist Party of Malaya]], [[Communist Party of Burma]] and the [[Communist Party of Siam]] with the communist movement also maintaining relations with an earlier Southeast Asia [[Communist Party of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1957|p=213}}{{sfn|Hara|2016|p=12–13}} Prior to the [[World War II]], the Communist Party of Malaya followed the general communists line of opposing [[Liberal democracy|Western democracies]] by intensifying its propaganda against the Malayan government as well the colonial government of Singapore in 1940.{{sfn|Tay|2018}}

With the beginning of Sino-Japanese conflict and subsequent Japanese occupations of [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|British Borneo]], further activities by young Kuomintang enthusiasts were shortly stopped.{{sfn|Tregonning|1962|p=224}} When the [[Communist Party of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]] reached an agreement with the Kuomintang government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to put aside their conflict and rally together against Japanese aggression in July 1940, a growth of pro-independence opinions led to the banning of Kuomintang and other Chinese organisations in Malaya.{{sfn|Tay|2018}}{{sfn|Wang|1964|p=144}} Nevertheless, with the ensuing conflict with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] that also involving the British, Chiang Kai-shek urge every Kuomintang members to fight alongside the latter with the British colonial authorities in return announced the lifting of ban towards any Chinese associations including both the Kuomintang and Chinese communist movement as a sign to appreciating the value of co-operation.{{sfn|Cheah|2013|p=37}} The leaving of ban and subsequent recognition by the British colonial authorities towards the Communist Party of Malaya as their ally resulted in the formation of the party [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force of [[Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA) in 1941.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2012|p=136}} The MPAJA which consisted mainly of ethnic Chinese in Malaya waged a guerrilla war against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) throughout Malaya with the movement had a total strength of 10,000 men from eight battalions where they also made contact with the British [[Force 136]] during the war.{{sfn|Wong|2002a}} Some revolt by local Chinese under the influence of the Kuomintang such as the [[Jesselton revolt|Jesselton uprising]] in British Borneo occur through the Japanese harsh administration but as similarly happened towards many innocent civilians, they were severely repressed by Japanese secret police of [[Kenpeitai]].{{sfn|Thurman|Sherman|2001|p=123}}{{sfn|Tay|2016}}

In North Borneo, much of the underground anti-Japanese activities by ethnic Chinese is part of the Nanyang Chinese National Salvation Movement led by [[Tan Kah Kee]] while in Sarawak most of them operating under the communist-influenced movement of Sarawak Anti Fascist League.{{sfn|der Kroef|1964|p=50–60}}{{sfn|Wong|2001|p=93–105}} The [[Pacific War|victory of the Allies in the Pacific]] in 1945 led to the disbandment of MPAJA guerrillas in the Malay Peninsula and many of their leading members receiving awards from the British.{{sfn|Hartfield|2012|p=350}} But even with the disbandment after the war ended, the MPAJA has adopted a radical policy and began to massacring those, mainly Malays who they had considered as collaborators during their war against the Japanese, causing a rising [[ethnic tension|ethnic conflict]] when the Malays began to retaliated.{{sfn|Kantowicz|2000|p=111}} The MPAJA also targeting British posts with several [[grenade]] attacks on British troops.{{sfn|Hartfield|2012|p=350}} Different situation happened in North Borneo which is under Kuomintang influence when ethnic Chinese there choose to co-operate with the British and being loyal to King [[George VI]] towards the formation of the [[Crown Colony of North Borneo]] after the war.{{sfn|Kalgoorlie Miner|1946}}

With the rebranding of MPAJA to [[Malayan National Liberation Army]] (MNLA), attacks by communist insurgents further ensued with their guerrilla tactics in the jungles by sabotaging transportation networks and attacking British plantation sources that resulted in the assassination of several European plantation owners in Malaya.{{sfn|Kantowicz|2000|p=111}} The British intelligence estimate the support for the MNLA was mainly based on around 500,000 from the total of 3.12 million ethnic Chinese living in Malaya by the time and battling the insurgents proved difficult as most of them hid in inaccessible jungles.{{sfn|Koh|Choo|2009}} With the declaration of emergency on 18 June 1948 during the ensuing [[Malayan Emergency]], the early government response was chaotic and disorganised as their primary target is only to guard important economic targets.{{sfn|Leifer|2013|p=110}}{{sfn|Ong|2014|p=87}} The predominantly nature of the MNLA which consisted entirely from ethnic Chinese making most of the Malays who constituted nearly half of the population of five million in 1950 opposed the movement.{{sfn|Hack|1999|p=99–125}}

A military plan called [[Briggs' Plan]] which devised by British General [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Sir Harold Briggs]] are being undertaken shortly in 1950 to protect the population and isolate any connection of involved population from the insurgents which is also followed by the promise for independence, with the latter won majority support from the Malays although the Chinese population need more convincing as they feared on being treated as a "second-class citizens" in an independent Malaya.{{sfn|Chaliand|1982|p=272}} Among the steps being undertaken under the plan includes the establishment of rapid settlement of squatters under security surveillance, regrouping of labour, minimum level of troops throughout Malaya to support security forces on clearing priority areas and complete accord of operation between police and army with close integration of intelligence.{{sfn|Hamby|2002|p=59}} Under the continual resettlement scheme, more than 700,000 rural ethnic Chinese community were corralled into 582 new settlements established by the government around Malaya.{{sfn|Yamada|2004|p=225–231}} With the demise of British colonial administrator [[Henry Gurney]] after a sudden ambush by the insurgents in 1951, [[Gerald Templer]] are appointed as a new colonial administrator to Malaya by [[Winston Churchill]] in the following year with the latter then primarily choose the "[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds campaign]]" apart from military and psychological measures to combat the insurgents.{{sfn|Koh|Choo|2009}}{{sfn|Stubbs|2004|p=1}}{{sfn|Ramakrishna|2013|p=139}} As part of his campaign, Templer instituted incentive schemes for surrendering rebels including to those who encouraged them to surrender and used strict [[curfew]]s and tight control of food supplies from involved areas to flush out the insurgents.{{sfn|Nolan|2011|p=248}}{{sfn|Comber|2015|p=100}} Crops grown by the insurgents were sprayed with [[herbicide]] and [[defoliant]]s with any of the involved areas that already found to be free from the insurgents will be elevated to "white status" with any previous restrictions were lifted.{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=830}}{{sfn|Jackson|2008|p=49}}{{sfn|Hamblin|2013|p=175}} Even with the hearts and minds issued by Templer throughout the war, there were also incidents which proved to be a detriment to such a strategy, such as the [[Batang Kali massacre]], where 24 unarmed Malaysian civilians suspected of providing aid the MNLA were shot by a division of the [[Scots Guard]] in late 1948.{{sfn|Hale|2013|p=432}}

Despite large applause are given for his campaign, the root causes of the campaign success are mainly attributed to the continuous Briggs' Plan as expressed by the leader of the communist side [[Chin Peng]] where the massive resettlement of ethnic Chinese villagers resulted in the isolation of the communist movement.{{sfn|Gentile|2013|p=52}} Apart from that, the various early moves made by his predecessor Gurney for the introduction of a quasi-ministerial system with a bill to increase the number of non-Malays to be eligible for citizenship in the path towards independence also contributed to the victory.{{sfn|Tarling|1992|p=376}} Following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|fall of Kuomintang and the establishment of communist control]] in China in 1949, foreign missionaries in the country were forced by the new communist authorities to leave which then invited by Templer to provide [[spiritual healing]] to the residents of the new government-controlled villages in Malaya where they also provide medical education and welfare measures to one-third of the Chinese population.{{sfn|Roy|Saha|2016|p=68}} By September 1952, Templer realised the citizenship plan with every people born in Malaya were granted full citizenship which include 1.2 million Chinese within the scheme.{{sfn|Roy|Saha|2016|p=67}}

Colonial Office|1957|p=4}} The campaign against communists by the newly independent country continued until 1960 when the Malayan government declared the end of [[state of emergency]] after Chin Peng decided to abandon its armed struggle with the demobilisation of its armed units thus leaving his hide-out in southern [[Thailand]] for [[Beijing]] through [[North Vietnam]] where he was accommodated by the Chinese authorities in the [[International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China|International Liaison Bureau]] with medical benefits and monthly allowances.{{sfn|Singh|2014|p=39}}{{sfn|Garver|2015|p=200}} Through the meeting between the leader of Malayan communist with high-ranking Chinese communist politician such as [[Deng Xiaoping]] in Beijing, China urged them to continue their armed struggle, convincing the Communist Party of Malaya to reverse the policy they had decided earlier.{{sfn|Singh|2014|p=41}} The success of the establishment of a communist government in [[Mainland China]] also had great effect on the ethnic Chinese community in Sarawak, especially younger generations when they organised themselves into pro-Beijing friendship society of Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League and following local government vigilance that resulting to its disestablishment, it was re-established into Sarawak Advanced Youths' Association which later culminating into the [[communist insurgency in Sarawak]] in 1960.{{sfn|der Kroef|1964|p=50–60}} Even the conflicts with communist ensued, the economic situation of Malaya continued to prosper with strong financial position and defined by [[World Bank]] as among the most prosperous in Asia with large dependent on tin and rubber industries inherited since the British era which is largely dominated by ethnic Chinese and Indian workforce.{{sfn|Gomes|2007|p=46}}{{sfn|World Bank|2010}}

{{quote|It took a long time for us all to come to the same conclusions despite our differing experience in Malaya, Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. Our friends in Sabah are not here today officially, but I can assure you that we have many friends there. There is no doubt about it that it took us a long time to reach inevitable conclusion that these people [referring to the racial politics in Malay Peninsula] were up to no good. You know the line they were taking with growing truculence on a heavy racial accent, the intimidatory postures and the snarling guttural notes on which they sent out their signals to their followers on the basis of race lead us to only one conclusion -- that if this goes on, Malaysia will not belong to [[Malaysians]].

Lee's further callings for the re-alignment of forces between those who wanted a "true Malaysian nation" or those who preferred a country led by communal segregation dominated by one of the constituent party from the Alliance together with his attacks on the Malay ultras for their attempts to foster only Malay dominance over the new country of Malaysia has led to a [[PAP–UMNO relations|bitter relations between PAP and UMNO]] which further exaggerated into [[1964 race riots in Singapore|race riots in Singapore]] earlier in 1964 and leading to [[Singapore in Malaysia|their expulsion]] from the federation in August 1965.{{sfn|Cheah|2002|p=54}}{{sfn|Diamond|Plattner|Chu|2013|p=187}}{{sfn|Reid|2015|p=362}}

Of the 33 parliamentary seats contested during the election, MCA only managed to retain 13 seats and lost its control over the [[Government of Penang|Penang state government]] to GERAKAN with subsequent gain by the opposition parties led to further tension between the Chinese and Malay which erupted into the [[13 May incident|13 May riots]].{{sfn|Charles|Cheng|1971|p=47}}{{sfn|der Kroef|1981|p=107}} The clashes since then largely affecting the ethnic sentiments between the two groups in Malay Peninsula including in neighbouring Singapore which had similarly enduring clashes early in 1964 when it was still part of Malaysia.{{sfn|Kua|2007|p=74}}

In the aftermath of the riots that sent severe shock through the whole Malaysian society, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman placed the blame entirely on the communists rather than race issues plaguing both the ethnic Chinese and Malay, holding the view that Mainland China communist government was trying to do the similar things with what had been did by [[Soviet Union]] to eastern Europe, further in the opinion that the ongoing [[Vietnam War]] in their neighbour was "not simply a civil war but [[domino theory|communist ideology expansion]]".{{sfn|Cheng|2009|p=66}} Instead of declaring a state of emergency as done by the British authorities previously, the Malaysian government responded by introducing several policy initiatives including the security and development, neighbourhood watch program and the [[The People's Volunteer Corps|People's Volunteer Group]].{{sfn|Nazar|2005|p=19–20}} With the internal conflicts within the Communist Party of Malaya in the 1970s, the group split into two factions of [[Communist Party of Malaya/Revolutionary Faction|revolutionary]] in 1970 and [[Communist Party of Malaya/Marxist–Leninist|Marxist–Leninist]] in 1974.{{sfn|Chin|2003|p=467–468}} The communists struggle suffered setbacks when both [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Beijing began to established [[China–Malaysia relations|diplomatic relations]] in 1974 with China ending their aid to the movement, causing the merger between the two separated factions into the [[Malaysian Communist Party]] in 1983 before they surrendering to Thai authorities in 1987 following [[Communist insurgency in Thailand|continuous offensives]] by the latter with subsequent [[Peace Agreement of Hat Yai (1989)|peace agreement]] between Malaysian authorities and the communists movement in 1989.{{sfn|Khoo|2010}}{{sfn|Chin|2003|p=450}} Another communist insurgency by predominantly ethnic Chinese in Sarawak which partly supported by neighbouring Indonesia for their opposition towards the federation of Malaysia also ended through peace negotiations in 1990.{{sfn|Porritt|2004|p=279}}

The first census conducted in 1970 after Malaysia was formed in 1963 reported that there were 3,555,879 ethnic Chinese Malaysians, with the [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]] or Min Nan (福建人 or 闽南人) being the majority at 32.4%, followed by [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (客家人) at 22.1%, [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] (广府人) at 19.8%, [[Teochew people|Teochew]] (潮汕人) and [[Hainanese people|Hainanese]] (海南人) at 12.4% and 4.7% respectively.{{sfn|Wang|2012|p=12}} This increase to 4,554,664 in 1980 and 4,623,900 in 1991.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|Deterding|2016|p=4}} In 2000, the census reported that ethnic Chinese Malaysians numbered at 5,691,908, which was approximately 24.45% of the country's population at the time, with 86% of them living in urban areas.{{sfn|Ember|Ember|Skoggard|2004|p=698}} In [[West Malaysia]], Hokkien became the leading group followed by Cantonese, Hakka and Teochew.{{sfn|Kam|Tan|2000|p=39}} The pattern differs in East Malaysia where Hakka is the majority in Sabah and Sarawak followed by Hokkien and Cantonese in Sabah and the [[Foochow people|Foochow]] (福州人), Hokkien and Teochew in Sarawak.{{sfn|Kam|Tan|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|T'ien|1983|p=278}}{{sfn|Yong|2013|p=291}} In 2010, the population increase further to 6,392,636.{{sfn|Department of Statistics Malaysia|2010a|p=15}}

The Hokkien are notably prominent in the states of [[Johor]], [[Kedah]], Kelantan, Malacca, Penang, [[Perlis]], Sarawak, Labuan and Terengganu while the Hakka is prominent in Sabah and the second largest sub-group in [[Labuan]].{{sfn|Ember|Ember|Skoggard|2004|p=699}} The Cantonese (including the smaller population of Kwongsais or Guangxi (广西人) people in states such as [[Johor]], [[Pahang]] and [[Perak]]) are mostly concentrated in the cities of Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh, and to some extent in [[Bera District|Bera]], [[Hilir Perak]], [[Kuantan]], [[Muallim]], [[Bentong District|Bentong]], [[Kuala Kangsar District|Kuala Kangsar]], [[Lipis District|Lipis]], [[Hulu Perak]], [[Mersing]], [[Raub District|Raub]], [[Bagan Datuk District|Bagan Datoh]], [[Batu Pahat District|Batu Pahat]], [[Cameron Highlands]], [[Jerantut District|Jerantut]], [[Temerloh District|Temerloh]], [[Bahau]], [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]], [[Rompin District|Rompin]], [[Segamat District|Segamat]], [[Gopeng]], [[Maran District|Maran]], [[Tapah]], [[Pekan District|Pekan]], [[Bidor]] and [[Seremban]] in the peninsular as well as [[Sandakan]] and [[Keningau]] ([[Taishanese people|Taishanese]] or 台山人) in Sabah, and to a lesser extent, [[Miri]] and [[Sarikei]] in Sarawak.{{sfn|Ember|Ember|Skoggard|2004|p=699}} The Teochews are mostly found in Johor and Melaka, with a minority of them settling in pockets of Kedah, pockets of Penang and parts of coastal Selangor.

The Foochows are numerous in [[Yong Peng]], [[Sitiawan]], [[Sungai Pelek]], [[Miri]], [[Bintangor, Sarawak|Bintangor]], [[Sarikei]], [[Bintulu]], [[Kapit]], and [[Sibu]].{{sfn|Ember|Ember|Skoggard|2004|p=699}}{{sfn|Hock|Suryadinata|2012|p=114}} The population of Hainanese can be found in all cities and towns in Malaysia, numerously in Malacca and Terengganu and [[Putian people|Henghuas]] or Putian (兴化人 or 莆田人) and Hockchia or Fuqing (福清人) in various other areas.{{sfn|Ember|Ember|Skoggard|2004|p=699}} 

There is also a small community of ''[[Huáběi]]-ren'' (Northern Chinese or 华北人) in Sabah whose ancestors coming from various parts of [[Hebei]] (河北) and [[Shandong]] (山东) provinces in China with most of them calling themselves as ''[[Tiānjīn]]-ren'' (天津人 or 津侨). Besides that, Sanjiang-ren ({{zh|[[:zh:三江人|三江人]]}}) is a collective term used to categorise the group of people whose ancestors hailed from Shanghai (上海), Zhejiang (浙江), Jiangsu (江苏), Hubei (湖北) and Jiangxi (江西).

Since the country's foundation in 1963, the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA) had become the sole legitimate political representation for ethnic Chinese in Malaysia under the multi-racial political coalition of the [[Alliance Party (Malaysia)|Alliance Party]] (later expanded into [[Barisan Nasional|National Front]] coalition).{{sfn|Cartier|2011|p=71}} The growing restriction of non-Malay interests in Malaysian society and politics since the 1970s, however, caused a deep dissension among Chinese Malaysians. There grew a wide perception that their ethnic party representatives were unable to stand for their people's rights, and that decision-making was influenced by the Malay [[supremacism|supremacists]] dominated party of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO). The UMNO were part of the existing political coalition, and also championed Islamic values.<ref>{{harvnb|Strauch|1981|p=37}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Weiner|Özbudun|1987|p=136}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Teck|1988|p=18}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|The Coverage|2019}}</ref> Despite the coalition's multi-racial appearance, UMNO founding president [[Onn Jaafar]] has once said that their movement did not adhere to any ideology other than "[[Malayisation|Malayism]]", defined by Malay scholar [[Ariffin Omar]] as the belief that the interests of the Malay race must be upheld over anything else.{{sfn|Ting|2009|p=35}} Until 1968, the inability of MCA to preserve ethnic Chinese Malaysian interests, particularly with regards to their culture, education and language, resulted in the formation of another ethnic Chinese representative party, the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Malaysian People's Movement Party]] (GERAKAN) led by Chinese overseas-educated elite, although this party also joined the Alliance Party coalition in 1972.{{sfn|Jenkins|2008|p=91}}

Aside from their economic dominance, ethnic Chinese Malaysians are known for their contribution in the country [[healthcare]] sectors with their traditional health practice. Around 3,000 medicine shops in the country sell traditional Chinese medicine with development support also given by the country [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Health Ministry]].{{sfn|Stevenson|Tai|Yuan|2014|p=282}} Chinese traditional health practice services in the country generally encompass the ''zhong yi'' (Chinese medicine), ''[[qigong]]'' (health), [[chiropractic care]], [[acupuncture]] and several others.{{sfn|Beh|2017}} In 2012, the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Bill (T&CM) was passed by the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] for the establishment of "Traditional and Complementary Medicine Council" to register and regulate traditional and complementary medicine practitioners, including traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as well Malay, indigenous and Indians traditional medicine which followed by the enforcement of T&CM Act in the following year.{{sfn|Ministry of Health Malaysia|2015|p=10}} Since most of the traditional medicine pharmacies are family-apprentice trade, most of the traditional medicine practitioners are not registered as a doctor under the health department despite support given by the Health Ministry with most can practice the career without needed to be registered under government law.{{sfn|Stevenson|Tai|Yuan|2014|p=282}}

In educational aspects, Malaysia is the only country outside [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] with a comprehensive and complete Chinese education system and the only Southeast Asian country that has perpetuated the Chinese education system established since the colonial era as a result of heavy brokerage and lobbying efforts by ethnic Chinese Malaysians political leaders with continual funding from local Chinese communities.{{sfn|Curdt-Christiansen|Hancock|2014|p=145}}{{sfn|Ang|2017}} The first Chinese schools had been established in the country in the 19th century during the British colonial administration.{{sfn|Kam|Tan|2000|p=230}}{{sfn|Wong|2002b|p=35}}{{sfn|Charney|Yeoh|Tong|2003|p=147}} At the same time, Christian missions from China also founded schools for Chinese students to nurture Church workers, this are most notable among many Chinese Christians of Hakka origin in Sabah and the Foochow in Sarawak.<ref>{{harvnb|Ting|2011|p=38}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Charney|Yeoh|Tong|2003|p=147}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Bays|1996|p=165}}<br />{{*}} {{harvnb|Goh|2005|p=52}}</ref> Following the country's independence, some of the Chinese independent schools who were influenced by the new national agenda and desperately needed government financial support were willingly converted into [[English-medium education|English medium-schools]]. However, these schools were later scrupulously converted into [[Malay language|Malay]] medium-schools following the massive elimination of English medium-schools by the Malay-dominated regime in the 1970s in an effort to impose the Malay language as the only medium of instructions in all schools in the aftermath of ethnic riots in 1969.{{sfn|Curdt-Christiansen|Hancock|2014|p=145}}{{sfn|Ang|2017}} The following period was considered a dark time for local Chinese education, and witnessed a growing belief in the idea that the ethnic Chinese in Malaysia had to proceed on a basis of self-reliance and vigilance in order to preserve their language rights as the national education policy was seen as exclusionary and discriminatory for non-Malays, summed up in the aphorism "non-Malays belong to Malaysia but Malaysia only belongs to the Malays".{{sfn|Curdt-Christiansen|Hancock|2014|p=145}}{{sfn|Kee|Hill|Yin|2016|p=75}}

Although other remaining Chinese independent schools were also included in the national school system in 1996, these independent schools still did not receive any financial assistance from the federal government and its United Examinations Certificate (UEC) is not recognised by the government, making students who finishing their studies from the local Chinese independent schools unable to enroll in government-funded public [[tertiary education|tertiary institutions]].{{sfn|Kee|Hill|Yin|2016|p=77}} Since the late 1970, ethnic Chinese Malaysians had expanded their own Mandarin-language primary schools where around 90% of their children were enrolled based on the figures from 2006.{{sfn|Nelson|Meerman|Rahman|2008|p=201}} These schools gained reputation for not only maintaining good discipline but also providing the high-quality education that the Malay schools were seen by some to lack. This perceived superiority attracted a significant interest among [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] parents with various analyses placing the number of Bumiputera students enrollment in Chinese schools between 60,000 and 100,000 in 2000.{{sfn|Nelson|Meerman|Rahman|2008|p=201}} The federal government's failure to impose Malay as the sole unifying language throughout the country's educational systems unlike in China with [[Standard Chinese]] or Indonesia with [[Indonesian language]] are mainly attributed to the racial-based policy enforcement of ethnic inclusion and exclusion.{{sfn|Kee|Hill|Yin|2016|p=78}} Some argue that the educational policies imposed by the federal government over the years in regard to minority language education have created negative consequences for Malaysian youth: a mounting [[human capital flight|brain drain]] in particular. A study from 2000 found that the country had lost an ample amount of talented and skilled youth to other more favourable countries as the result of students form the large non-Malay minority language communities being forced to go to university abroad because they did not attend Malay language schools.{{sfn|Defillippi|Arthur|Lindsay|2009|p=117}}{{sfn|Fong|Zubair|2017|p=15}}

Chinese Malaysians cuisine developed a strong penchant of [[spices]] and [[chillies]] where any local Chinese [[kopi tiam]] or restaurant will offer pickled green or red chillies ''[[sambal]]'' for noodles and rice-based meals.{{sfn|Hutton|2005|p=13}} They borrowed [[curry tree|curry leaves]] from the Indians and have since adapted English [[Worcestershire sauce]] and [[tomato sauce]] along with Indian and Malay spices to the [[cooking pot]].{{sfn|Hutton|2005|p=13}} Among the notable Chinese dishes in the country including the ''[[bak kut teh]]'' (肉骨茶) (pork rib soup with Chinese herbs), ''[[char kway teow]]'' (炒粿条) (stir fried rice noodle), ''[[dim sum]]'' (点心) (ready-to-serve dishes), ''[[hae mee]]'' (虾面) (spicy prawn noodle soup served in savoury broth), [[Hainanese chicken rice]] (海南鸡饭), ''kai si hor fun'' (鸡丝河粉) (flat rice noodle soup with chicken slices, shrimps and bean sprouts), ''[[kolo mee|kolok or kolo mee]]'' (干捞面) (Sarawakian egg noodle served in dark sauce, tomato sauce or chilli sauce), ''[[lor mee]]'' (卤面) (thick yellow noodle served in dark sauce and thick broth), ''ngiu chap mee'' (牛杂面) (special Sabah mixed beef noodle), ''[[pan mee]]'' (板面) (handmade noodle soup served with pork balls, minced pork, dried anchovies, black fungus and vegetable), ''sang nyuk mee'' (生肉面) (special Sabah dry pork noodle or pork noodle soup), ''[[wonton noodle|wonton mee]]'' (云吞面) (dry noodle or noodle soup served with BBQ pork, minced pork and pork or shrimp dumplings) and ''[[yong tau foo]]'' (酿豆腐) (tofu and mixed vegetables filled with ground pork mixture or fish paste).

Commonly found in ethnic Chinese homes and shops are [[altar]]s installed for deities of their choice together with ancestors worship.
