A '''flight attendant''', also known as '''steward'''/'''stewardess''' or '''air host'''/'''air''' '''hostess,''' is a member of the [[aircrew]] aboard [[passenger airline|commercial flights]], many [[Business jet|business jets]] and some government aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cabinmanagers.com/corporate/ |title=Cabin Managers - Corporate |publisher=cabinmanagers.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforceenlistedjobs/a/afjob1a6x1.htm |title=1A6X1 - FLIGHT ATTENDANT |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |access-date=2012-08-22}}</ref> Collectively called '''cabin crew''', flight attendants are primarily responsible for passenger safety and comfort.

== History ==
[[File:Vraagteken vlucht Lockheed Electra naar Istanbul, Bestanddeelnr 910-7819.jpg|thumb|upright|Dutch stewardesses, Istanbul, 1959]]
The role of a flight attendant derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger train]]s, but it has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on [[aircraft]]. Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a ''cabin crew'', as distinguished from [[Aviator|pilots]] and [[Flight engineer|engineers]] in the [[cockpit]].

The German [[Heinrich Kubis]] was the world's first flight attendant, in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|author=Grossman, Dan |url=http://www.airships.net/blog/worlds-first-flight-attendant |title=The First Flight Attendant: Heinrich Kubis, 1912 |work=Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins |date=July 9, 2010 |access-date=2012-08-22}}</ref> Kubis first attended the passengers on board the DELAG Zeppelin ''[[LZ 10 Schwaben]].'' He also attended to the famous ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg]]'' and was on board when it burst into flames. He survived by jumping out a window when it neared the ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/161 161]|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/161}}</ref>

Origins of the word "steward" in transportation are reflected in the term "[[chief steward]]" as used in [[Ship transport|maritime transport]] terminology. The term [[purser]] and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international [[United Kingdom|British]] maritime tradition (i.e. [[chief mate]]) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian [[United States Merchant Marine]] on which [[United States|US]] aviation is somewhat modelled. Due to [[Public international law|international conventions]] and agreements, in which all ships' personnel who sail internationally are similarly [[Merchant Mariner's Document|documented]] by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall [[command hierarchy|rank]] and [[chain of command|command structure]] of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered.

[[File:Nelly Diener cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelly Diener]], the first air stewardess in Europe, hired in May 1934. She was killed, on the plane pictured behind her, in the July [[1934 Swissair Tuttlingen accident]].]]
[[Imperial Airways]] of the United Kingdom had "cabin boys" or "stewards"; in the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/07/23/before-the-stewardess-the-steward-when-flight-attendants-were-men/|title=Before the Stewardess, the Steward: When Flight Attendants Were Men - Sociological Images|last=Pages|first=The Society|website=thesocietypages.org|access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on [[Ford Trimotor]] planes between [[Detroit]] and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. [[Western Airlines]] (1928) and [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten-passenger [[Fokker]] aircraft used in the [[Caribbean]] had stewards in the era of gambling trips to [[Havana, Cuba]] from [[Key West, Florida]]. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology.

The first female flight attendant was a 25-year-old [[registered nurse]] named [[Ellen Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.travel.aol.com/2009/11/20/history-of-flight-attendant-uniforms/ |title=History of Flight Attendant Uniforms - AOL Travel News |publisher=AOL |date=2011-10-17 |access-date=2012-08-22}}</ref> Hired by [[United Airlines]] in 1930,<ref name="NYtimes">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/12/archives/air-hostess-finds-life-adventurous-they-are-crazy-about-their-jobs.html?sq=Air+hostess+finds+life+adventurous&scp=1&st=p |title=Air hostess finds life adventurous |work=The New York Times |date= April 12, 1936|page= N1}}</ref> she also first envisioned [[nurse]]s on aircraft. Other airlines followed suit, hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants, then called "stewardesses" or "air hostesses", on most of their flights. In the United States, the job was one of only a few in the 1930s to permit women, which, coupled with the [[Great Depression]], led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available. Two thousand women applied for just 43 positions offered by [[Trans-World Airlines|Transcontinental and Western Airlines]] in December 1935.<ref name="hostess">"The air hostess carries on", ''The New York Times''. April 19, 1936. Page XX12.</ref>

[[File:1949.01. Washing up on Catalina (Suva-Sydney) copy.jpg|thumb|upright|Washing dishes during flight, 1949]]
Female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones, and by 1936, they had all but taken over the role.<ref name="NYtimes"/> They were selected not only for their knowledge but also for their physical characteristics. A 1936 ''[[New York Times]]'' article described the requirements: <blockquote>The girls who qualify for hostesses must be petite; weight 100 to 118 pounds; height 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches; age 20 to 26 years. Add to that the rigid physical examination each must undergo four times every year, and you are assured of the bloom that goes with perfect health.<ref name="NYtimes"/></blockquote>

Three decades later, a 1966 ''New York Times'' classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements: <blockquote>A high school graduate, single (widows and divorcees with no children considered), 20 years of age (girls 19{{1/2}} may apply for future consideration). 5'2" but no more than 5'9", weight 105 to 135 in proportion to height and have at least 20/40 vision without glasses.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/us/63-years-flying-from-glamour-to-days-of-gray.html "63 Years Flying, From Glamour to Days of Gray"]. ''New York Times''. March 17, 2012.</ref></blockquote>

Appearance was considered as one of the most important factors to become a stewardess. At that time, airlines believed that the exploitation of female sexuality would increase their profits; thus the uniforms of female flight attendants were often formfitting, complete with white gloves and high heels.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boris|first=Eileen|year=2006|title=Desirable Dress: Rosies, Sky Girls, and the Politics of Appearance|journal=International Labor and Working Class History|volume=69 |issue=1|pages=123–142|doi=10.1017/S014754790600007X}}</ref>

In the United States, they were required to be unmarried and were fired if they decided to wed.<ref name="hostess" /> The requirement to be a [[registered nurse]] on an American airline was relaxed as more women were hired,<ref name="hostess" /> and disappeared almost entirely during [[Women in World War II|World War II]] as many nurses joined [[military nurse]] corps.

As there will be 41,030 new [[airliner]]s by 2036, [[Boeing]] expects 839,000 new cabin crew members from 2017 till then: 298,000 in Asia Pacific (37%), 169,000 in North America (21%) and 151,000 in Europe (19%).<ref>{{cite web |title= Pilot and Technician Outlook |date= 2017 |publisher= Boeing |url= http://www.boeing.com/commercial/market/long-term-market/pilot-and-technician-outlook/}}</ref>

==Overview==

The role of a flight attendant is to "provide routine services and respond to emergencies to ensure the safety and comfort of airline passengers while aboard planes".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/flight-attendants.htm|title=Flight Attendants : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>

Typically flight attendants require holding a high school diploma or equivalent, and in the United States, the median annual wage for flight attendants was $50,500 in May 2017, higher than the median for all workers of $37,690.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/home.htm|title=Transportation and Material Moving Occupations : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>

The number of flight attendants required on flights is mandated by each country's regulations. In the US, for light planes with 19 or fewer seats, or, if weighing more than 7,500 pounds, 9 or fewer seats, no flight attendant is needed; on larger aircraft, one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?mc=true&n=sp14.3.121.m&r=SUBPART&ty=HTML#se14.3.121_1391|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations: Title 14, §121.391 Flight attendants.}}</ref>

The majority of flight attendants for most airlines are female, though a substantial number of males have entered the industry since 1980.<ref name="female">Saenz, Rogelio and Evans, Louwanda (June 2009) "[http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2009/usflightattendants.aspx The Changing Demography of U.S. Flight Attendants]".

[[File:Egypt air Flyght attendant during flight.jpg|left|thumb|An [[EgyptAir]] flight attendant performing a [[pre-flight safety demonstration]]]]

Prior to each flight, flight attendants attend a safety briefing with the pilots and lead flight attendant. During this briefing, they go over safety and emergency checklists, the locations and amounts of emergency equipment and other features specific to that aircraft type. Boarding particulars are verified, such as special needs passengers, small children travelling as unaccompanied or VIPs. Weather conditions are discussed including anticipated [[turbulence]]. Prior to each flight a safety check is conducted to ensure all equipment such as [[personal flotation device|life-vests]], [[Flashlight|torch]]es (flash lights) and firefighting equipment are on board, in the right quantity, and in proper condition. Any unserviceable or missing items must be reported and rectified prior to [[takeoff|take-off]]. They must monitor the [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] for any unusual smells or situations. They assist with the loading of [[baggage allowance|carry-on baggage]], checking for weight, size and [[dangerous goods]]. They make sure those sitting in [[Exit row|emergency exit rows]] are willing and able to assist in an evacuation and move those who are not willing or able out of the row into another seat. They then must do a [[Pre-flight safety demonstration|safety demonstration]] or monitor passengers as they watch a safety video. They then must "secure the cabin" ensuring tray tables are stowed, [[airline seat|seats]] are in their upright positions, armrests down and carry-ons stowed correctly and seat belts are fastened prior to take-off. All the service between boarding and take-off is called ''Pre Take off Service''.<ref name="bls.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos171.htm|title=Flight Attendants : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=Bls.gov|access-date=2012-08-22}}</ref>

[[File:Aeroflot flight attendant (hostess).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aeroflot]] flight attendant, [[Belgrade]] (2017)]]
Once up in the air, flight attendants will usually serve drinks and/or food to passengers using an [[airline service trolley]]. When not performing customer service duties, flight attendants must periodically conduct cabin checks and listen for any unusual noises or situations. Checks must also be done on the lavatory to ensure the [[smoke detector]] hasn't been disabled or destroyed and to restock supplies as needed. Regular cockpit checks must be done to ensure the health and safety of the pilot(s). They must also respond to call lights dealing with special requests. During turbulence, flight attendants must ensure the cabin is secure. Prior to landing, all loose items, trays and rubbish must be collected and secured along with service and [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] equipment. All hot liquids must be disposed of. A final cabin check must then be completed prior to [[landing]]. It is vital that flight attendants remain aware as the majority of emergencies occur during take-off and landing.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/10/25/when-flying-is-taking-off-really-more-dangerous-than-landing/#7e01ac5b266e | title=When Flying, is Taking off Really More Dangerous Than Landing?}}</ref> Upon landing, flight attendants must remain stationed at exits and monitor the airplane and cabin as passengers disembark the plane. They also assist any special needs passengers and small children off the airplane and escort children, while following the proper paperwork and ID process to escort them to the designated person picking them up.

Flight attendants are trained to deal with a wide variety of emergencies, and are trained in [[first aid]]. More frequent situations may include a bleeding nose, illness, small injuries, intoxicated passengers, aggressive and anxiety stricken passengers. Emergency training includes [[rejected takeoff|rejected take-off]]s, [[emergency landing]]s, cardiac and in-flight medical situations, smoke in the cabin, fires, [[Cabin pressurization|depressurization]], on-board births and deaths, dangerous goods and spills in the cabin, [[emergency evacuation]]s, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]s, and [[water landing]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Chief Purser===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
The Chief Purser (CP), also titled as In-flight Service Manager (ISM), Flight Service Manager (FSM), Customer Service Manager (CSM) or Cabin Service Director (CSD) is the senior flight attendant in the chain of command of flight attendants. While not necessarily the most-senior crew members on a flight (in years of service to their respective carrier), Chief Pursers can have varying levels of "in-flight" or "on board" bidding seniority or tenure in relation to their flying partners. To reach this position, a crew member requires some minimum years of service as flight attendant. Further training is mandatory, and Chief Pursers typically earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and managerial role.

===Purser===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
The Purser is in charge of the cabin crew, in a specific section of a larger aircraft, or the whole aircraft itself (if the purser is the highest ranking). On board a larger aircraft, Pursers assist the Chief Purser in managing the cabin. Pursers are flight attendants or a related job, typically with an airline for several years prior to application for, and further training to become a purser, and normally earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and supervisory role.

==Qualifications==

===Training===
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2009}}

Flight attendants are normally trained in the [[airline hub|hub]] or headquarters city of an airline over a period that may run from four weeks to six months, depending on the country and airline. The main focus of training is safety, and attendants will be checked out for each type of aircraft in which they work. One of the most elaborate training facilities was [[Breech Academy]], which [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) opened in 1969 in [[Overland Park, Kansas]]. Other airlines were to also send their attendants to the school. However, during the fare wars, the school's viability declined and it closed around 1988.

Safety training includes, but is not limited to: emergency passenger evacuation management, use of evacuation slides/life rafts, in-flight [[firefighting]], [[first aid]], [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], [[defibrillation]], ditching/emergency landing procedures, [[Uncontrolled decompression|decompression emergencies]], [[crew resource management]], and security.

In the United States, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] requires flight attendants on aircraft with 20 or more seats and used by an air carrier for transportation to hold a ''Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency''. This is not considered to be the equivalent of an [[Pilot licensing and certification|airman certificate]] (license), although it is issued on the same card stock. It shows that a level of required training has been met. It is not limited to the air carrier at which the attendant is employed (although some initial documents showed the airlines where the holders were working), and is the attendant's personal property. It does have two ratings, Group 1 and Group 2 (listed on the certificate as "Group I" and "Group II"). Either or both of these may be earned depending upon the general type of aircraft, ([[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] or [[turbojet]]), on which the holder has trained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/info/all_infos/media/2008/FACert.pdf |title=Flight Attendant Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency |publisher=faa.gov}}</ref>

There are also training schools, not affiliated with any particular airline, where students generally not only undergo generic, though otherwise practically identical, training to flight attendants employed by an airline, but also take curriculum modules to help them gain employment. These schools often use actual airline equipment for their lessons, though some are equipped with full simulator cabins capable of replicating a number of emergency situations. In some countries, such as [[France]], a [[Academic degree|degree]] is required, together with the ''[[Safety training certificate (France) (Flight attendant)|Certificat de Formation à la Sécurité]]'' ([[Safety training certificate (France) (Flight attendant)|safety training certificate]]).<ref>{{in lang|fr}}[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/CFS_presentation-2.pdf Certificat de Formation à la Sécurité] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004002601/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/CFS_presentation-2.pdf |date=2012-10-04 }}</ref>

===Language===
[[Multilingualism|Multilingual]] flight attendants are often in demand to accommodate international travellers. The languages most in demand, other than [[English language|English]], are [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Flight Attendant Jobs for Second Language Speakers|url=http://blog.airlinecareer.com/2009/06/flight-attendant-jobs-for-second.html}}</ref>  and [[Greek language|Greek]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In the United States, airlines with international routes pay an additional stipend for language skills on top of flight pay, and some airlines hire specifically for certain languages when launching international destinations.

===Height===
Most airlines have height requirements for safety reasons, making sure that all flight attendants can reach overhead safety equipment. Typically, the acceptable height for this is {{convert|150|to|185|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://careers.airnz.co.nz/customers/flight_attendants| archive-url= https://archive.is/20121220105358/https://careers.airnz.co.nz/customers/flight_attendants| url-status= dead| archive-date= 2012-12-20| title= Becoming a Flight Attendant - Air New Zealand| access-date= 2010-10-22}}</ref>
Some airlines, such as [[EVA Air]], have height requirements for purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] purposes. Regional carriers using small aircraft with low ceilings can have height restrictions.

==Uniforms and presentation==
[[File:Garuda Indonesia Flight Attendants in Kebaya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Garuda Indonesia]] flight attendants in uniform featuring [[kebaya]].]]
The first flight attendant [[uniform]]s were designed to be durable, practical, and inspire confidence in passengers. In the 1930s, the first female flight attendants dressed in uniforms resembling [[nurses]]' outfits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flight attendants through the years|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-history-stewardesses-flight-attendants-20130516,0,327510.photogallery|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=March 7, 2014}}</ref> The first female flight attendants for United Airlines wore green berets, green capes and nurse's shoes.

Both male and female flight attendants for [[Hawaiian Airlines]] wear [[aloha shirts]] as their uniform.

Many early uniforms had a strongly military appearance; hats, [[jacket]]s, and [[skirt]]s showed simple straight lines and military details like [[epaulette]]s and brass buttons. Many uniforms had a summer and winter version, differentiated by [[colours]] and [[Textile|fabrics]] appropriate to the [[season]]: [[navy blue]] for winter, for example, [[Khaki (colour)|khaki]] for summer. But as the role of women in the air grew, and airline companies began to realise the [[publicity]] value of their female flight attendants, more feminine lines and colours began to appear in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Some airlines began to commission designs from high-end [[department store]]s and still others called in noted [[designer]]s or even [[Hatmaking|milliners]] to create distinctive and attractive apparel.

During the 1960s, [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) was known for brightly colored female flight attendant uniforms that included short [[miniskirt]]s. In the early 1970s, the uniform changed to [[hotpants]].<ref name=FORBES/>

Since the 1980s to present, Asian airlines, especially national flag carrier ones, usually feature the [[Folk costume|traditional dress]] and fabrics of their respective country in their female flight attendants' uniform. It was meant as a marketing strategy to showcase their national culture as well as to convey welcoming warmth and hospitality. For example, [[Thai Airways]] flight attendants are required to change from their corporate purple suits into traditional Thai costume prior to passengers boarding.<ref>{{cite web|title=The world's best airline is ..." 5.

[[Vietnam Airlines]]  flight attendants wear red [[áo dài]] and [[Air India]] flight attendants wear a [[Sari]] on all passenger flights.

During the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female flight attendants to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by [[USAir]].<ref name=marc>{{cite web |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=law_pubs |last=Linder |first=Marc |title=Smart Women, Stupid Shoes, and Cynical Employers |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=1 January 1997 |access-date=24 May 2016}}</ref> Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there.<ref name="Banaszak-HollLevitsky2010">{{cite book |author1=Jane C.

In 2015, the Israeli airline [[El Al]] introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2063591/i-dont-think-the-girls-thought-they-could-question-it-high-heels-policy-study-author/|title='I don't think the girls thought they could question it': high heels policy study author |last=Tucker |first=Erika |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref> The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule.

Flight attendants are generally expected to show a high level of [[personal grooming]] such as use of [[cosmetics]] (for women) and thorough personal [[hygiene]].

Most airlines require flight attendants not have any [[tattoo]]s visible when a [[uniform]] is worn. These requirements are designed to give the airlines a positive presentation. {{Citation needed|reason=is this true?|date=July 2018}}

In several airlines in the [[Islamic World]], such as [[Egypt Air]], [[Iran Air]] and [[Saudia]], female flight attendants' uniforms have added a [[hijab]] to conform to the Islamic customs.

== Health conditions ==
A 2018 study found higher instances of [[breast cancer]], [[melanoma]], [[Uterine cancer|uterine]], [[Gastrointestinal cancer|gastrointestinal]], [[Cervical cancer|cervical]], and [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]] cancers reported in flight attendants in contrast to the general population.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=McNeely|first=Eileen|last2=Mordukhovich|first2=Irina|last3=Tideman|first3=Samuel|last4=Gale|first4=Sara|last5=Coull|first5=Brent|date=2018-03-23|title=Estimating the health consequences of flight attendant work: comparing flight attendant health to the general population in a cross-sectional study|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=18|issue=1|pages=346|doi=10.1186/s12889-018-5221-3|issn=1471-2458|pmc=5865289|pmid=29566648}}</ref> Specifically, the increased cancer cases reported were seen in [[breast cancer]] (3.4% of flight crew compared to 2.3% in the general population - a 50% increase), [[cervical cancer]] (1.0% compared to 0.70%), [[gastrointestinal cancer]] (0.47% compared to 0.27% - a 74% increase),&nbsp;[[thyroid cancer]] (0.67% compared to 0.56%) and higher rates of both melanoma and non-melanoma [[skin cancer]]s with reports of the latter increasing with every five years spent in the job.<ref name=":1" /> The study did not look into what causes this increase, but the authors said increased exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from time spent in the thinner [[Mesosphere|upper atmosphere]], poor cabin air quality as well as [[Sleep deprivation|disrupted sleep]] and meal cycles could be factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cabin-crew-cancer-risk-flight-attendant-radiation-exposure-sleep-cycle-obesity-smoking-a8416166.html|title=Flight attendants have a higher risk of all types of cancers, finds study|date=2018-06-26|website=The Independent|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>

=== Radiation ===
Flight attendants and crew members are known to be exposed to [[Ionizing radiation|cosmic ionizing radiation]] which is a form of radiation that comes from space and intensifies as altitude above sea level increases. The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] lists Ionizing radiation as a known [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|human carcinogen]].<ref name="Griffiths 514–521"/> Passengers are also exposed to this type of cosmic radiation, but they spend a considerably less amount of time on the average in the air than crew members. An online travel agency report found, in particular, that travelling adults in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] spend on average 306 hours on flights to holiday destinations during their lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airport-world.com/news/general-news/5181-brits-will-spend-12-days.html|title=Brits will spend 12 days onboard flights in a lifetime - Airport World Magazine|last=Bates|first=Joe|website=www.airport-world.com|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> In contrast, according to the [[Federal Aviation Administration|US Federal Aviation Administration]], a flight attendant can spend up to 30 hours of flight time in seven consecutive days and in some cases more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/2000s/media/200721.pdf#page=23|title=Flight Attendant Fatigue|last=Mary|first=M.

Cabin crew members are also regularly exposed to more [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] than the general population, which can make these workers more vulnerable to [[skin cancer]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/62913-cancer-risk-flight-attendants.html|title=Why Cancer Rates Are Higher in Flight Attendants|last=Nierenberg|first=Cari|last2=June 25|first2=Live Science Contributor {{!}}|website=Live Science|access-date=2019-04-05|last3=ET|first3=2018 08:02pm}}</ref>

The U.S. [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements|National Council on Radiation Protection]] (NCRP) reports that aircrew have the largest average annual effective dose of all U.S. radiation workers.<ref name="cdc.gov"/>

=== Cabin air quality ===
Poor cabin air quality is a subject of ongoing study in relation to symptoms such as [[headache]], [[fatigue]], [[fever]], and [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] difficulties among many others that have been reported by flight attendants, particularly on long-haul routes.&nbsp;There is also much concern regarding the transmission of [[Infection|contagious diseases]], particularly [[tuberculosis]]. An open question remains whether&nbsp;these complaints are due to poor cabin air quality or to other factors inherent in flights, such as lowered [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], low [[humidity]], etc.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayman|first=Russell B.|date=March 2002|title=Cabin air quality: an overview|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=73|issue=3|pages=211–215|issn=0095-6562|pmid=11908887}}</ref> Other chemical contaminants found in the cabin may include engine leakages, [[pesticide]]s and [[flame retardant]]s, which contain compounds that may act as [[Endocrine disruptor|hormone disruptors]] and increase the risk of some [[cancer]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pinkerton|first=Lynne E.|last2=Hein|first2=Misty J.|last3=Grajewski|first3=Barbara|last4=Kamel|first4=Freya|date=July 2016|title=Mortality From Neurodegenerative Diseases in a Cohort of US Flight Attendants|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=59|issue=7|pages=532–537|doi=10.1002/ajim.22608|issn=0271-3586|pmc=4915549|pmid=27184412}}</ref>

=== Sleep disruption ===
Flight attendants often have [[Circadian rhythm sleep disorder|disrupted sleep cycles]]. They are more likely to have disruptions in their sleep patterns because they may work at night, cross time zones, and have irregular schedules. There is some evidence linking sleep disruptions to increased cancer risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/lack-sleep-increases-your-risk-some-cancers|title=Lack of Sleep Increases Your Risk of Some Cancers - National Sleep Foundation|website=www.sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> Flight attendants may also have different lifestyle behaviours related to diet, physical activity, and health care than the general population which could affect overall health and cancer risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/study-examines-cancer-rates-among-flight-attendants.html|title=Study Examines Cancer Rates Among Flight Attendants|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>

=== Secondhand tobacco smoke ===
Many of the flight attendants working today were exposed to second-hand [[Inflight smoking|in-flight smoke]] until 1998 with partial smoking bans enacted in 1988. The long-term effects of this historical [[Passive smoking|secondhand smoke]] exposure have not been well characterized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Repace|first=J|date=March 2004|title=Flying the smoky skies: secondhand smoke exposure of flight attendants|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=13|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i8–i19|doi=10.1136/tc.2003.003111|issn=0964-4563|pmc=1766146|pmid=14985612}}</ref>

== Sexual harassment ==
Flight attendants are exposed to verbal and [[sexual harassment]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/gulliver/2018/05/21/the-sexual-harassment-of-flight-attendants-is-a-massive-problem|title=The sexual harassment of flight attendants is a massive problem|date=2018-05-21|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-04-08|issn=0013-0613}}</ref> Studies in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]] have found that the vast majority (two-thirds) of flight attendants experience sexual harassment in the course of their careers, including [[sexual assault]], inappropriate touching and sexual comments both by colleagues and passengers.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.afacwa.org/metoo|title=#MeToo in the Air|website=Association of Flight Attendants-CWA|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.twu.com.au/home/campaigns/cabin-crew-sexual-harassment-survey/|title=TWU - Transport Workers Union (TWU) - Campaigns|website=www.twu.com.au|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> <blockquote>Flight attendants describe the verbal sexual harassment as comments that are “nasty, unwanted, lewd, crude, inappropriate, uncomfortable, sexual, suggestive, and dirty.” They also report being subjected to passengers’ explicit sexual fantasies, propositions, request for sexual “favours” and pornographic videos and pictures.<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>The studies also found that 70% of flight attendants who experience sexual harassment on the job "chose not to report the incident because they did not think it would be dealt with appropriately or they were concerned reporting it would make the situation worse" and "their airline was not doing enough to put a stop to harassment",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/cabin-crew-sexual-harassment-australia-airlines-twu-report-a8574116.html|title=Majority of flight attendants have experienced sexual harassment, new survey finds|date=2018-10-08|website=The Independent|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> and that "they have not noticed any employer efforts over the past year to address sexual harassment at work."<ref name=":2" />

== Emotional labour ==
The concept of [[emotional labor|emotional labour]] as the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfil the emotional requirements of a job through a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace (as opposed to the concept of [[emotion work]], i.e. the management of one's feelings in private life) was first established and linked to the profession of flight attendants by Professor Emirita of Sociology [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]], in her book, [[The Managed Heart]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=The managed heart : commercialization of human feeling|last=Hochschild, Arlie Russell, 1940-|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520048003|location=Berkeley|oclc=9280843}}</ref> According to Hochschild, flight attendants do emotional labour to enhance the status of the customer and entice further sales by their friendliness,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The managed heart : commercialization of human feeling|last=Hochschild, Arlie Russell, 1940-|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520048003|location=Berkeley|pages=16|oclc=9280843}}</ref> and support this effort by evoking feelings that make the "nice" display seem natural.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The managed heart : commercialization of human feeling|last=Hochschild, Arlie Russell, 1940-|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520048003|location=Berkeley|pages=165|oclc=9280843}}</ref> With regard to how flight attendants are supposed to use their smile in the job, the author writes:<blockquote>"[I]n the flight attendant’s work, smiling is separated from its usual function, which is to express a personal feeling, and attached to another one—expressing a company feeling. The company exhorts them to smile more, and “more sincerely,” at an increasing number of passengers. The workers respond to the speed-up with a slowdown: they smile less broadly, with a quick release and no sparkle in the eyes, thus dimming the company’s message to the people. It is a war of smiles."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The managed heart : commercialization of human feeling|last=Hochschild, Arlie Russell, 1940-|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520048003|location=Berkeley|pages=127|oclc=9280843}}</ref></blockquote>Hochschild notes that corporate logic in the airline industry&nbsp;generates a series of links between competition, market expansion, advertising, heightened passenger expectations about rights to display, and company demands for acting; and when conditions allow this logic to work, private use of emotional exchange gives way to corporate use of emotional exchange.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The managed heart : commercialization of human feeling|last=Hochschild, Arlie Russell, 1940-|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520048003|location=Berkeley|pages=90|oclc=9280843}}</ref>

Hochschild also writes of how flight attendants are trained to control passengers' feelings during times of turbulence and dangerous situations while suppressing their own fear or anxiety.<ref name=":3" />

The [[emotional labor|emotional labour]] performed by flight attendants and cross-cultural aspects of it have since been actively studied and are a topic of ongoing research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chongho|last2=An|first2=Myungsook|last3=Noh|first3=Yonghwi|date=2015-09-01|title=The effects of emotional display rules on flight attendants' emotional labor strategy, job burnout and performance|journal=Service Business|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=409–425|doi=10.1007/s11628-014-0231-4|issn=1862-8508}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okabe|first=Noriko|date=2019|editor-last=Kantola|editor-first=Jussi Ilari|editor2-last=Nazir|editor2-first=Salman|editor3-last=Barath|editor3-first=Tibor|title=Role Ambiguity and Trust Repair of Flight Attendants: Emotional Labor of Human Service Employees|journal=Advances in Human Factors, Business Management and Society|volume=783|series=Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|language=en|publisher=Springer International Publishing|pages=84–96|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-94709-9_9|isbn=9783319947099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Claire|date=2003-11-01|title=Sky Service: The Demands of Emotional Labour in the Airline Industry|journal=Gender, Work & Organization|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=513–550|doi=10.1111/1468-0432.00210|issn=1468-0432}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Taylor|first=Ian|chapter=Chapter 7 Cultural Differences in Emotional Labor in Flight Attendants|date=2006-01-01|volume=2|pages=167–191|series=Research on Emotion in Organizations|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|doi=10.1016/s1746-9791(06)02007-4|last2=Brotheridge|first2=Céleste M.|title=Individual and Organizational Perspectives on Emotion Management and Display|isbn=978-0-7623-1310-5}}</ref>

==In advertising==

[[File:Singapore Airlines Hostesses.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Singapore Girl]]s, featured in [[Singapore Airlines]]' advertising]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, many airlines began advertising the attractiveness and friendliness of their stewardesses. [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]] began a "Fly Me"; campaign using attractive female flight attendants with [[tagline]]s such as "I'm Lorraine. Fly me to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]." (A low budget 1973 film about three flight attendants, ''[[Fly Me]]'', starring [[Lenore Kasdorf]], was based on the ad campaign.) [[Braniff International Airways]] presented a campaign known as the "Air Strip" with similarly attractive young female flight attendant changing uniforms mid-flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/tech/col/smith/2006/06/23/askthepilot191/ |title=Ask the pilot |work=salon.com}}</ref> In the United States, many airlines had a policy such that only unmarried women could be flight attendants,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6722,3211,00.html |title=Flight attendant history 2 |publisher=united.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621021230/http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6722,3211,00.html |archive-date=2006-06-21 }}</ref> as well as a mandatory retirement age of 32 for stewardesses because of the belief women would be less appealing and attractive after this age.<ref>{{Cite news|title=They Don't Want Wings Clipped|last=Serling|first=Robert|date=Sep 13, 1963|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants’ employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<ref name="K Barry"/>

Flight attendant [[Roz Hanby]] became a minor celebrity when she became the face of [[British Airways]] in their "Fly the Flag" advertising campaign over a 7-year period in the 1980s. [[Singapore Airlines]] is currently one of the few airlines still choosing to use the image of their female flight attendants, known as [[Singapore Girl]]s, in their advertising material. However, this is starting to be phased out, in favor of advertising which emphasises the modernity of their fleet.

==Unions==
Flight attendant [[Trade union|unions]] were formed, beginning at United Airlines in the 1940s, to negotiate improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions.<ref>From Skygirl to Flight Attendant, Women and the Making of a Union by Georgia Panter Nielsen, ILR Press/Cornell, Ithaca, New York (1982){{ISBN|978-0-87546-093-2}}</ref> Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as [[Sexism|sexist]] [[stereotype]]s and unfair work practices such as age limits, size limits, limitations on marriage, and prohibition of pregnancy. Many of these limitations have been lifted by judicial mandates. The largest flight attendants' union is the [[Association of Flight Attendants]], representing nearly 60,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines within the US.<ref name="Association of Flight Attendants">{{cite web|title=Association of Flight Attendants - About AFA|url=http://www.afacwa.org/about_afa|access-date=2014-01-25}}</ref>

The [[Association of Professional Flight Attendants]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apfa.org|title=Association of Professional Flight Attendants - Home|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref> represents the flight attendants of American Airlines, the world's largest carrier. APFA is the largest independent flight attendant union in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hub.aa.com/en/nr/pressrelease/apfa-nations-largest-independent-flight-attendant-union-calls-for-approval-of-oneworlds-immunity-application|title=Newsroom - Home - American Airlines Group, Inc.|access-date=9 December 2016}}</ref>

In the UK, cabin crew can be represented by either Cabin Crew '89, or the much larger and more powerful [[Transport and General Workers' Union]].

In Australia, flight attendants are represented by the [[Flight Attendants' Association of Australia]] (FAAA). There are two divisions: one for international crews ([[flight length|long-haul]]) and one for domestic crews (short-haul).

In New Zealand, flight attendants can be represented by either the [[Flight Attendants and Related Services Association]] (FARSA) or by the [[Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union]] (EPMU).

In Canada, flight attendants are represented by either the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]] (CUPE) or by the Canadian Flight Attendants Union (CFAU).

===Discrimination===
Originally female flight attendants were required to be single upon hiring, and were fired if they got married, exceeded weight regulations, or reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline.<ref name="femininityinflight.com"/> In the 1970s the group Stewardesses for Women's Rights protested sexist advertising and company discrimination, and brought many cases to court. In 1964 United States President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the Civil Rights Act into law which prohibited sex discrimination and led to the creation of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] in 1968. The EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant. For stewardesses, this meant that they had an official governing body to report offences to and allowed them to successfully challenge age ceiling and marriage bans in relation to their effectiveness as employees.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Femininity in Flight: A History of Flight Attendants|last=Barry|first=Kathleen|publisher=Duke University|year=2007|location=Durham, NC|pages=128–129}}</ref>

In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants’ employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<ref name="K Barry"/>  The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of ''Diaz vs. Pan Am''.<ref name="genders1" /> The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s.<ref name="nytimes1986" /> The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions,<ref name="quindlen1993" /> were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations.<ref name="nytimes1991" /> By the end of the 1970s, the term ''stewardess'' had generally been replaced by the [[Gender neutrality in English|gender-neutral]] alternative ''flight attendant.'' More recently the term ''cabin crew'' or ''cabin staff'' has begun to replace 'flight attendants' in some parts of the world, because of the term's recognition of their role as members of the crew.

==Roles in emergencies==
Actions of flight attendants in emergencies have long been credited in saving lives; in the United States, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) and other aviation authorities view flight attendants as essential for safety, and are thus usually required on Part 121 aircraft operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/121.391 |title=14 CFR 121.391 - Flight attendants. &#124; US Law &#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |access-date=2015-07-22}}</ref>  Studies, some done in light of [[British Airtours Flight 28M]], have concluded that assertive cabin crew are essential for the rapid evacuation of aeroplanes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.casa.gov.au/fsa/2005/aug/44-47.pdf |title=Evacuate, Evacuate, Evacuate |publisher=casa.gov.au |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822140626/http://casa.gov.au/fsa/2005/aug/44-47.pdf |archive-date=2006-08-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/2006/pdf/grant_20040239.pdf |title=Evacuation Commands for Optimal Passenger Management |publisher=atsb.gov.au |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913154209/http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/2006/pdf/grant_20040239.pdf |archive-date=2006-09-13 }}</ref> Notable examples of cabin crew actions include:

* Flight Attendants on [[Air Canada Flight 797]] (Sergio Benetti, Judi Davidson, Laura Kayama) used procedures which were not specifically taught in training such as moving passengers to the front of the aircraft to move them away from the fire and smoke, and passing out towels for passengers to cover their nose and mouths with while the cabin was filling with smoke.

* Nine cabin crew members aboard [[Air France Flight 358]] successfully evacuated the aircraft within 90 seconds after the A340-300 overran a runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The NTSB stated that the actions of the cabin crew contributed to the 100% survival rate.
* The flight attendants of [[Philippine Airlines Flight 434]] kept the passengers calm after a bomb exploded during the flight from [[Cebu]] to [[Tokyo]]. Though one passenger was killed during the explosion, they took care of the injured passengers.

Some exception include [[Air Canada Flight 797]], where the investigative Board found that the flight attendant in charge's "misleading" reports about the fire "influenced the captain's decision to delay the initiation of a descent" and that such "delay increased the time for the fire to propagate and the time that passengers were exposed to the toxic environment before the airplane could be evacuated." The accident killed 23 passengers; none of the flight attendants sustained any injuries. Chief Flight Attendant Sergio Benetti was the first to open the front door of the aircraft, and escaped out that way, leaving all passengers and other crew behind.
