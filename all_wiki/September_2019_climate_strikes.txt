==== Political response ====
[[Yves-François Blanchet]] of Bloc Québécois, [[Elizabeth May]] of the Green Party, and Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] of the Liberal Party marched in Montreal while [[Jagmeet Singh]] of the New Democratic Party joined a protest in Victoria, British Columbia. They are some of the party leaders for the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]].<ref name="MontrealGazette" /> Prime Minister Trudeau promised that if re-elected, his government would plant two billion trees in ten years. This will cost CAN$200 million per year but will be paid for by revenue from the [[Trans Mountain Pipeline]], he claimed. He also met Thunberg, who asserted he was "obviously not doing enough."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/federal-election-2019-roundup-trudeau-meets-with-teen-climate-activist-greta-thunberg|title=Federal election 2019 roundup: Protesters dog Justin Trudeau on climate march|last=Thomson|first=Stuart|date=27 September 2019|work=The National Post|access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, Trudeau's Liberal government declared a national climate emergency before approving the Trans Mountain pipeline extension project.<ref name=":7">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49804234|title=Is Trudeau doing enough on climate change?|last=Murphy|first=Jessica|date=28 September 2019|work=BBC News|access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref> [[Andrew Scheer]] of the Conservative Party and [[Maxime Bernier]] of the People's Party did not attend any events.<ref name="BBC Canada" /> Climate change is a major political issue for this federal election, alongside healthcare, the economy, and taxes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/Healthcare-Cost-of-Living-Climate-Change-Top-Voter-Issues|title=Healthcare (35%), Cost of Living (27%), Climate Change (25%) Top Voter Issues as Campaign Season Kicks Off|last=Bricker|first=Darrell|date=20 September 2019|website=Ipsos|access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref> Canada's current aim is to reduce carbon emissions by 30% compared to 2005 levels by 2030.<ref name="BBC Canada" /> Details are, however, lacking.

Moreover, environmental protection and energy are politically divisive issues in Canada.

While young activists demanded that the U.S. transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030, realizing this ambition is an immense challenge. As of 2019, only 17% of electricity in the U.S. is generated from renewable energy, of which, 7% is from hydroelectric dams, 6% from wind turbines, and 1% solar panels. The intermittency of wind and solar power poses the issue of storage, and there are no rivers for new dams.<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-transitioning-to-only-renewable-energy-will-be-difficult-for-the-u-s|title=Why transitioning to only renewable energy will be difficult for the U.S.|last=Brangham|first=William|date=20 September 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=13 October 2019|last2=O'Brien|first2=Miles}}</ref> For further information, see the [[Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump#Energy|energy policy of the Donald Trump administration]].

===Uruguay===
Protests were held in Uruguay's capital city of [[Montevideo]], [[Tacuarembó]], [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]], [[Treinta y Tres]], [[Trinidad, Uruguay|Trinidad]] and [[Rivera]]. Through its social networks movement, #ViernesPorElFuturoUy (#FridaysforFutureUy) ordered the public to act and spread the message on the awareness. In the message "We march and demand that Uruguay declare the state of climatic and ecological emergency. The earth is dying, and with it our future. In 11 years there will be no more time to think how to save it and make it habitable again, because we will enter a point of no return. Today we can still do something, so there is to go outside and demand that our authorities took action on the rapid climate change".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.montevideo.com.uy/Noticias/La-marcha-global-por-el-clima-se-realizara-tambien-en-Uruguay-este-viernes-uc730413 |title=La marcha global por el clima se realizará también en Uruguay este viernes |trans-title=The global climate march will also take place in Uruguay this Friday |language=es |publisher=Montevideo Portal |date=20 September 2019 |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>
