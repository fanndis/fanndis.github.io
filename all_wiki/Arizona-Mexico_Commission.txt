==History==
The Arizona-Mexico Commission was founded in March 1959 as the Arizona-Mexico West Trade Commission by Governor [[Paul Fannin|Paul J. Fannin]] and his Sonoran counterpart, Alvaro Obregon Tapia, at the [[University of Arizona|University of Arizona's]] first Arizona-Sonora International Conference on Regional Development.

In 1972, Arizona Governor [[Jack Richard Williams|Jack Williams]], announced the restructuring of the Arizona-Mexico West Coast Commission into the present-day AMC, establishing a formal mechanism under the Office of the Governor that promotes greater private sector involvement in the Arizona-Mexico relationship. With this transformation came the creation of six bilateral committees: Trade, Tourism, Banking and Finances, Health, Agriculture, and Livestock.

Two years later, in July 1974, in Guaymas, Sonora, these committees met formally at the first Plenary Session between the AMC and its sister organization, the Comisión Sonora-Arizona. (CSA). Since then, the AMC and the CSA have held bi-annual plenary sessions, alternating in location between Sonora and Arizona, to discuss and collaborate on programs targeting the vital relationships shared between the two states.

==Structure==
The Arizona-Mexico Commission is governed by a gubernatorial Board of Directors and chairs by the Governor of Arizona. The organization also has a membership base of approximately 400 members from the public and private sectors.

The work of the Arizona-Mexico Commission is driven by 16 binational working committees including: Agribusiness & Wildlife, Art and Culture, Community and Social Organizations, Economic Development; Education, Emergency Management, Energy, Environment & Water, Financial, and Legal Services, Health Services, Mining, Real Estate, Security, Tourism, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Ports, and Sports (Ad-Hoc). Each committee is led by both a private and a public co-chair.<ref>AMC Committees. {{cite web|url=http://www.azmc.org/committees/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422224933/http://www.azmc.org/committees |archivedate=2010-04-22 }}</ref>
