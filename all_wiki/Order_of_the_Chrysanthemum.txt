{{Nihongo|The '''Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum'''|大勲位菊花章|Dai-kun'i kikka-shō|literally Grand Order of the Chrysanthemums}} is [[Japan]]'s highest [[Order (decoration)|order]]. The Grand Cordon of the Order was established in 1876 by [[Emperor Meiji of Japan]]; the collar of the Order was added on 4 January 1888. Although technically the order has only one class, it can either be awarded "with collar", meaning on a chain, or "with grand cordon", accompanied by a sash. Unlike its [[Europe]]an counterparts, the order may be conferred posthumously.

Apart from the [[Imperial Family of Japan|Imperial Family]], only six Japanese citizens have ever been decorated with the collar in their lifetimes; the last such award was to former [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Saionji Kinmochi]] in 1928. Eight others have been posthumously decorated with the collar; the last such award was to former Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] in 2019. Today, only the reigning [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] holds this dignity as sovereign of the order; however, exceptions are made for foreign [[head of state|heads of state]], who can be awarded the collar in friendship.

The grand cordon is the highest possible [[Japanese honors system|honour]] a Japanese citizen can be awarded during his or her lifetime. Aside from members of the Imperial Family, 44 Japanese citizens have been decorated with the grand cordon; of these, only 23 were living at the time of receipt.

==Insignia==
The ''collar'' of the order is made of gold, and features the ''[[kanji]]'' for "Meiji", in classic form, indicating the era of the order's establishment. It is decorated with gold chrysanthemum blossoms and green-enamelled leaves.

The sash of the ''grand cordon'' of the order is red with dark blue border stripes. It is worn on the right shoulder.

The ''star'' of the order is similar to the badge, but in silver, without the chrysanthemum suspension, and with an eight-pointed [[Gilding|gilt]] medallion (with white-enamelled rays and red-enamelled sun disc) placed at the centre. It is worn on the left chest.

The ''badge'' of the order is a four-pointed [[Gilding|gilt]] badge with white-enamelled rays; the centre bears a red enamelled sun disc. On each of the four corners of the badge is a yellow-enamelled [[chrysanthemum]] blossom with green-enamelled chrysanthemum leaves. The badge is suspended on a yellow-enamelled chrysanthemum, either on the collar or on the grand cordon.
