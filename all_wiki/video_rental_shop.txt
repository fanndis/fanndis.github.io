A '''video rental shop/store''' is a [[Brick and mortar|physical]] [[retail]] business that rents [[home video]]s such as movies, prerecorded TV shows, [[video game]] discs and other content. Typically, a rental shop conducts business with customers under conditions and terms agreed upon in a [[rental agreement]] or [[contract]], which may be implied, explicit, or written. Many video rental stores also sell previously-viewed movies and/or new unopened movies. 

In the 1980s, video rental stores rented [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] tapes of movies, although most stores dropped Beta tapes when VHS won the [[Videotape format war|format war]] late in the decade. In the early 2000s, video rental stores began renting [[DVD]]s, a digital format with higher resolution than VHS. In the late 2000s, stores began selling [[Blu-ray]] discs, a format that supports [[High-definition television|High Definition]].

Widespread adoption of [[video on demand]] and [[video streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]] in the 2010s sharply reduced most major rental chains' revenue, leading to the closure of many locations. Due to significantly less demand, few rental shops have survived into the present day.

==History==
The world's oldest business that rents out copies of movies for private use was opened by [[Eckhard Baum]] in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]] in the summer of 1975. Baum collected movies on [[Super 8 film]] as a hobby and lent pieces of his collection to friends and acquaintances. Because they showed great interest in his films, he came up with the idea of renting out films as a sideline.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schmid |first1=Von Dorina |title=Meine Videothek ist ein Kulturerbe – Gespräch mit dem Erfinder der ersten Videothek der Welt: Eckhard Baum (WS 2013/14) |url=http://www.literaturbuero-nordhessen.de/meine-videothek-ist-ein-kulturerbe-gesprach-mit-dem-erfinder-der-ersten-videothek-der-welt-eckhard-baum-ws-201314/ |publisher=Literaturhaus Nordhessen |accessdate=21 June 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430173442/http://www.literaturbuero-nordhessen.de/meine-videothek-ist-ein-kulturerbe-gesprach-mit-dem-erfinder-der-ersten-videothek-der-welt-eckhard-baum-ws-201314/ |archivedate=30 April 2018 |date=14 February 2014}}</ref> Over the years, [[videotape]]s and [[optical disc]]s were added to the range. Baum still operates the business as of September 2015<ref>{{cite web |last1=Steinbach |first1=Jörg |title=Film-Shop feiert heute Geburtstag |url=https://www.kassel-live.de/2015/09/19/film-shop-feiert-heute-geburtstag/ |publisher=Kassel Live |accessdate=21 June 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029152021/https://www.kassel-live.de/2015/09/19/film-shop-feiert-heute-geburtstag/ |archivedate=29 October 2018 |date=19 September 2015}}</ref> and was portrayed in the June 2006 documentary film ''Eckis Welt'' by Olaf Saumer.<ref>Filmklasse Kassel: entry on ''[http://www.filmklassekassel.de/home/filme_filme.php?do=show_movie&mid=83 Eckis Welt]'',  Kunsthochschule Kassel</ref>

The first professionally managed video rental store in the U.S. was opened by [[George Atkinson (video rental businessman)|George Atkinson]] in December 1977 at 12011 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. After [[20th Century Fox]] had made an agreement with [[Magnetic Video]] founder [[Andre Blay]] to license him 50 of their titles for sale directly to consumers, amongst them ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King And I]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound Of Music]]'', Atkinson bought all the titles in both VHS and Beta formats, and offered them for rent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Khanna|first=Derek|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/27/how-the-content-industry-almost-killed-blockbuster-and-netflix/|title=A Look Back At How The Content Industry Almost Killed Blockbuster And Netflix (And The VCR)|date=27 December 2013|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228065907/https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/27/how-the-content-industry-almost-killed-blockbuster-and-netflix/|archive-date=28 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entmerch.org/press-room/industry-history.html|title=Industry History: entertainment merchants association|author=Jennifer Lane Burnell|publisher=Entertainment Merchants Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806054558/http://www.entmerch.org/press-room/industry-history.html|archive-date=6 August 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.entmerch.org/industry/1975---1979.html 1975 - 1979 | entertainment merchants association]</ref> Such stores led to the creation of video rental chains such as [[West Coast Video]], [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]], and [[Rogers Plus|Rogers Video]] in the 1980s.

Sony released their first commercially available video recorders in the United States on June 7, 1975,<ref>[https://www.edn.com/betamax-is-born-june-7-1975/ Betamax is born, June 7, 1975]</ref> and the following year, on October 25, 1976, Universal and Disney filed a lawsuit against Sony in the case known as [[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]. The two studios tried to ban the sales of VCRs, and later the rental of movies, which would have destroyed the video rental business in the US. Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] sided with the studios, while Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] ruled in Sony's favor. Eventually, on January 17, 1984, the Supreme Court overruled the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after Justice [[Sandra Day O’Connor]] changed her mind, leading to a 5-to-4 ruling.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/01/17/thirty-years-ago-today-sandra-day-oconnor-saved-the-future-of-video/ Thirty years ago today, Sandra Day O’Connor saved the future of video]</ref><ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/27/how-the-content-industry-almost-killed-blockbuster-and-netflix/ A Look Back At How The Content Industry Almost Killed Blockbuster And Netflix (And The VCR)]</ref><ref>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-xpm-2014-jan-17-la-ed-betamax-ruling-anniversary-20140117-story.html What the 1984 Betamax ruling did for us all]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/business/in-a-copyright-ruling-the-lingering-legacy-of-the-betamax.html Copyright Ruling Rings With Echo of Betamax]</ref>

[[File:Rakuten video rental (7745729916).jpg|thumb|right|150px|With the introduction of the thin, lightweight DVD disc, movie rental by mail services became feasible, introducing a new source of competition for brick and mortar stores.]]

In the 1980s, it was common for shops to rent equipment—typically VHS recorders—as well as tapes. Some video shops also had adults-only sections containing [[X-rated]] videos. To cope with the [[videotape format war]] of the 1970s and 1980s, some stores initially stocked both [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] cassettes, while others specialized in one format or the other. During the 1980s most stores eventually became all-VHS, contributing to the eventual demise of Beta. In the late 1990s, DVDs began appearing in video rental stores. Rogers Video was the first chain to provide [[DVD]] rentals in Canada. Other chains and independent stores later transitioned to the newer format. Similarly, many stores now rent [[Blu-ray Disc]] movies after the [[high definition optical disc format war]] was finished in the late 2000s decade.

The widespread availability of [[video on demand]] (VOD) on cable TV systems and VHS-by-mail services offered consumers a way of watching movies without having to leave their home. With the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], Internet services such as [[Netflix]] have become increasingly popular since the mid–2000s. All of these new ways of watching movies have greatly reduced the demand for video rental shops, and many have closed down as a result.<ref name="USAT" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Ragan |title=Video stores still making a go at attracting business (answer poll) |url=http://www.gastongazette.com/news/business-51015-stores-folks.html |accessdate=21 June 2020 |work=[[Gaston Gazette]] |date=24 September 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109021952/http://www.gastongazette.com/news/business-51015-stores-folks.html |archivedate=9 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dawson |first1=Jennifer |title=The incredible shrinking video stores! |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/04/24/story2.html |accessdate=21 June 2020 |work=[[Houston Business Journal]] |date=23 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109024019/https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/04/24/story2.html |archivedate=9 November 2010}}</ref> In 2000, there were 27,882 stores open,<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=4A8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA55&dq=27,882+video+rental+storefronts&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc2Zf6vYvaAhXJ3iwKHVUWCkUQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=27%2C882%20video%20rental%20storefronts&f=false Billboard 8.
