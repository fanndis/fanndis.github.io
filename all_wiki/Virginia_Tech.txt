==History==
[[File:VT Burruss Hall.jpg|thumb|200px|Virginia Tech's Burruss Hall]]
In 1872, with federal funds provided by the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], the [[Virginia General Assembly]] purchased the facilities of [[Preston and Olin Institute]], a small [[Methodist]] school for boys in Southwest Virginia's rural [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery County]]. That same year, {{convert|250|acre}} of the adjoining [[Solitude (Blacksburg, Virginia)|Solitude Farm]] including the house and several farm buildings on the estate were acquired for $21,250 from Robert Taylor Preston, a son of [[Governor of Virginia]], [[James Patton Preston]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Solitude |url=https://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/Solitude.html |website=Vt.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023052521/https://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/Solitude.html |archive-date=October 23, 2016 |access-date=October 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name="vaNRHPnom">{{Cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Solitude |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Montgomery/150-0100-0003_Solitude_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf |last=Worsham |first=Gibson |date=January 1988 |publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924122437/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Montgomery/150-0100-0003_Solitude_1989_Final_Nomination.pdf |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |access-date=September 11, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The commonwealth incorporated a new institution on the site, a state-supported [[land-grant]] [[military academy#Private academies|military institute]] named '''Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College'''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Short History of Virginia Tech, 1850–1974: Pre-Founding 1850–1872 |url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/125th/kinnear/prefound.htm |last=Kinnear |first=Duncan Lyle |website=Virginia Tech Special Collections |publisher=Virginia Tech |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20180522002019/http://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/125th/kinnear/prefound.htm |archive-date=May 22, 2018 |access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref>

Following the resolution there was a large demonstration in opposition to the removal of the Confederate flag.

===College reorganizations===
During Thomas Nelson Conrad's tenure as president, the college switched from semesters to the quarter system, which remained in place until the late 1980s. Under the 1891–1907 presidency of [[John McLaren McBryde]], the school organized its academic programs into a traditional four-year college and a graduate department was founded. The evolution of the school's programs led to a name change in 1896 to '''Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute'''. The "Agricultural and Mechanical College" portion of the name was popularly omitted almost immediately; in 1944, the name was officially changed to '''Virginia Polytechnic Institute''' ('''VPI''').<ref>{{Cite web |title=A School of Many Names |url=https://www.unirel.vt.edu/history/historical_digest/index.html |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234647/https://www.unirel.vt.edu/history/historical_digest/index.html |archive-date=March 14, 2014 |access-date=September 11, 2014}}</ref>

VPI admitted its first female students in 1921 as civilian [[day student]]s, they did not live on campus.  In 1923, VPI changed a policy of compulsory participation in the Corps of Cadets from four years to two years. In 1931, VPI began teaching classes at the Norfolk Division of the [[College of William and Mary]] (now [[Old Dominion University]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary |url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/exhibits/odu75thanniversary/norfolkdivision.htm |publisher=[[Old Dominion University]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313134227/http://www.lib.odu.edu/exhibits/odu75thanniversary/norfolkdivision.htm |archive-date=March 13, 2012 |access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> This program eventually developed into a two-year engineering program that allowed students to transfer to VPI for their final two years of degree work.

In 1943, VPI merged with Radford State Teachers College, in nearby [[Radford, Virginia|Radford]] which became VPI's women's division; the merger was dissolved in 1964. Today, [[Radford University]] is a co-educational research university and enrolls nearly 10,000 students and offers more than 150 undergraduate and graduate programs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who We Are, Radford University |url=http://radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/about.html |publisher=[[Radford University]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309112822/http://radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/about.html |archive-date=March 9, 2014 |access-date=March 9, 2014}}</ref>

===Post-World War II===

In 1953 under the leadership of President [[Walter Stephenson Newman]], VPI became the first historically white, four-year public institution among the 11 states in the former Confederacy to admit a black undergraduate. Three more black students were admitted in 1954. At the time Virginia still enforced [[Jim Crow laws]] and largely practiced [[racial segregation]] in public and private education, churches, neighborhoods, restaurants, and movie theaters and these first black students at VPI were not allowed to live in residence halls or eat in the dining halls on campus. Instead, they boarded with African American families in Blacksburg. In 1958 Charlie L. Yates made history as the first African American to graduate from VPI. Yates earned a bachelor's degree in [[mechanical engineering]], with honors, and was hailed as the first African American "to be graduated from any major Southern engineering institute," according to news reports at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=In memoriam: Charlie L.

The student body that had been approximately 5,682 in 1962 increased by roughly 1,000 students each year, new dormitories and academic buildings were constructed, faculty members were added – in 1966, for instance, more than 100 new professors joined the faculty – and research budgets were increased.<ref name="TH" /> During Hahn's tenure, not only did the university graduate its first [[Rhodes Scholar]], W.W.

Beginning in the fall 1973, women could participate in the Corps, making Virginia Tech among the nation's first senior military colleges to integrate women.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A History of the Corps of Cadets |url=https://www.vtcc.vt.edu/about/history.html |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234553/https://www.vtcc.vt.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=March 14, 2014 |access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

In 1970, the state legislature allowed VPI university status and gave it the present legal name, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In the early 1990s, university administration authorized the official use of "Virginia Tech" as equivalent to the full legal name; it has been used as the first-reference name for the school's athletic teams since the 1970s. However, diplomas and transcripts still spell out the formal name. Similarly, the abbreviation "VT" is far more common today than either VPI or VPI&SU.

===Vietnam War era===
During the [[Vietnam War]] students on college campuses across the nation protested [[conscription|the draft]] and U.S. involvement in the conflict. Despite its long history as a [[military school]], Virginia Tech was no exception. Most protests at Virginia Tech were small sit-ins and teach-ins, but In mid-April 1970 a group of anti-war protesters including students and faculty members disrupted a Corps of Cadets drill on campus. The Virginia Tech administration under Dr. Hahn took swift action. The students involved were suspended and the faculty members involved were fired from the university and the administration went to court and obtained an injunction to prevent them from repeating the act. This succeeded in calming tensions on campus, but only for a few weeks.<ref name="spec.lib.vt.edu">{{Cite web |title=Campus Unrest at Virginia Tech |url=https://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/unrest/intro.htm |date=1997 |publisher=Virginia Tech Special Collections |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20180521171706/https://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/unrest/intro.htm |archive-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref>

Tensions on campus reached the boiling point several days following the [[Kent State Shootings]] when on May 12, 1970, a large mob including students and a number of non-student anti-war protesters enraged by the Kent State incident and angered by the administration's disciplinary actions in response to a number of recent infractions by protesters including; vandalism of university property, a series of potentially dangerous fires set on campus, breaking and entering into a university building, and a sit-in in Cowgill Hill, seized Williams Hall and barricaded themselves inside.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hahn's statement on the Williams occupation |url=https://spec.lib.vt.edu/archives/unrest/hahnstmt.htm |last=Hahn |first=T.

Once inside the building the police discovered bomb making materials and determined that the students had apparently intended to build a [[Incendiary device|firebomb]]. The first few protesters were dragged out of the building; the rest left peacefully and were arrested and taken to the Montgomery County jail. The students involved in the seizure, were suspended from Virginia Tech and given twenty-four hours to remove their belongings from campus after being released from jail.

Several more anti-war protests occurred at Virginia Tech during the early 1970s but none turned violent.<ref name="spec.lib.vt.edu" />  

===Late 20th Century===

The University continued to expand through the last quarter of the 20th century. In 1975 [[William Edward Lavery|William E. Lavery]], who had joined the Virginia Tech faculty in 1966, took over as president when Dr. Hahn left the university to join [[Georgia Pacific Corporation]]. During his tenure as president, Lavery emphasized research, and expenditures in support of research totaled more than $70.2 million by fiscal year 1987, moving the university into the top 50 research institutions in the nation. He enhanced research opportunities by initiating the Corporate Research Center (CRC) and Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties (VTIP). During his 12-year term, the first two buildings were begun at the center and two more were planned. The CRC received an antenna to link Virginia Tech to the world via satellite, and the Extension division developed a series of 26 downlink sites throughout the state. Installation began on a new [[ROLM]] telecommunication system for the campus, the university purchased a [[supercomputer]], and the first proposal was developed for what later became the [[Blacksburg Electronic Village]].<ref name="Cox">{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Clara|title=In Memoriam: William Edward Lavery|url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2009/02/2009-114.html|access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> Lavery placed a high priority on alleviating shortages of classroom, laboratory, and office space, and during his term the total inventory of available space increased by 50.1 percent. A $108 million construction program during his presidency included additions to Newman Library and the War Memorial Gymnasium and construction of Litton Reaves Hall, Johnston Student Center and a new dormitory to house 333 students with an attached dining facility, Cochrane Hall. Another $17.5 million funded a complex to house the [[Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine]], which opened to students in 1980.<ref name="Cox"/>

Lavery hired the university’s first vice president for development, Charles Forbes, who launched a campaign to raise $50 million — then raised more than $118 million. Large contributions during his presidency included gifts from John Lee Pratt of $11 million to support engineering and agricultural programs and Marion Bradley Via of $3 million to establish the Harvey W. Peters Research Center and $5 million each to support the departments of civil engineering and electrical engineering. Robert B. Pamplin Sr. and Robert Pamplin Jr. gave $10 million to support the College of Business. Assets of the Virginia Tech Foundation grew from $6.2 million to $140.1 million during his term.<ref name="Cox"/>

Desperate for additional farmland for the support of teaching, research, and extension programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Virginia Tech acquired [[Kentland Farm Historic and Archeological District|Kentland Farm]] on December 31, 1986. Virginia Tech secretly traded about 250 acres of research orchards adjacent to a commercial area that would soon become [[Christiansburg, Virginia|Christiansburg]]'s main shopping district to a group of developers for the historic but long [[fallow]] 1,785-acre Kentland property. The developers on the other end of the swap, one of whom was a former Tech athletics official, quickly sold 40 acres of the former university farmland for $2.7 million. News of the land swap, and especially the fact that it was done behind closed doors, sparked outrage.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Kevin|url=http://ww2.roanoke.com/news/nrv/11960.html|title=University acquired plantation in land swap|date=October 10, 2004|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133348/http://ww2.roanoke.com/news/nrv/11960.html|archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref>

Also in 1986, Virginia Tech became embroiled in an athletic scandal sparked by allegations of illegal recruiting, the bitter departure of two athletic directors in less than a year and millions of dollars of debt run up by the university's sports program due to mismanagement of financial resources, million dollar coaching contracts, and lavish expense accounts for athletics officials that led to a rebuke from [[Governor of Virginia]], [[Gerald Baliles]] in 1987.  Baliles, the featured speaker at the Virginia Tech's 115th annual commencement exercises, scolded the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors for the scandal and warned other state-supported institutions in Virginia not to put athletics ahead of academics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/06/14/baliles-scolds-va-tech-on-athletic-scandal/f9d50063-48b6-4a4a-bf07-10a54ceff563/|title=BALILES SCOLDS VA. TECH ON ATHLETIC SCANDAL|first=R. H.|last=Melton|date=June 14, 1987|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> 

Lavery developed a reorganization plan for the troubled Athletic Department, and [[Frank Beamer]] was hired to replace [[Bill Dooley]] as head football coach, but with negative publicity continuing to swirl within and around the university, he announced his resignation on October 16, 1987, effective December 31, 1987, to prevent polarization of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unirel.vt.edu/history/historical_digest/lavery_years.html|title=The Lavery Years|website=[[Virginia Tech]]|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> He was succeeded as president by [[James Douglas McComas]] who served until 1994. 

Due to the unpopularity of [[US involvement in the Vietnam War]] enrollment in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets spiraled downward through the 1970s and 80s. In 1991 through the efforts of Harry Dekker (Class of 1944) The Corps of Cadets Alumni Inc. was created to save the corps, whose numbers had declined to only a few hundred students. In 1992 the alumni organization initiated Corps Review, a newsletter that was expanded to a magazine in 2004 and targeted corps alumni. During the mid 1990s, the corps alumni organization set an aggressive goal of “1000 in 2000” and initiated a major campaign to push the number of cadets to 1,000 by the turn of the century. Although the goal was not reached, membership in the corps did increase substantially by the end of the decade. <ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://history.unirel.vt.edu/content/history_unirel_vt_edu/en/corps/index.html|title=Corps of Cadets|website=history.unirel.vt.edu}}</ref>

===Twenty-first century===
The early decades of this century have seen expansion across the university's institutions in both physical and population sizes. In 2001 Virginia Tech acquired the 326 acre Heth Farm adjacent to the Virginia Tech campus increasing the College Farm to over 3000 acres.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Virginia Tech Off-Campus Properties |url=https://www.unirel.vt.edu/history/physical_plant/off_campus_properties.html |website=History and Historical Data of Virginia Tech |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507053842/http://www.unirel.vt.edu/history/physical_plant/off_campus_properties.html |archive-date=May 7, 2018 |access-date=2018-08-13}}</ref> The [[Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute]] was created with a strategic partnership with the [[Carilion Clinic]] and the Governor of Virginia. These years also brought about the rapid development of the university's professional schools of graduate education, and business programs. Virginia Tech brought in over a half-billion in research expenditures in 2014.<ref name="AboutVT">{{Cite web |title=About Virginia Tech |url=http://www.vt.edu/about/ |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025091228/http://www.vt.edu/about/ |archive-date=October 25, 2015 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

The establishment of scholarships for cadets and a resurgence of national patriotism after the events of [[September 11, 2001]] helped the corps to recruit new cadets increasing the ranks to 1127 by 2018 — the largest corps the university has seen since the mid 1960s.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vtcc.vt.edu/content/vtcc_vt_edu/en/alumni/corpsreview/cr-fall2018/fall18-recruiting.html|title=How Are We Doing With Recruiting?|website=vtcc.vt.edu}}</ref>The Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is poised to increase enrollment to 1400 cadets in coming years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vtnews.vt.edu/content/vtnews_vt_edu/en/articles/2019/08/corps-growth.html|title=Corps' resurgence includes new buildings and plans to reach 1,400 cadets|website=www.vtnews.vt.edu}}</ref>

Following [[Amazon (company)|Amazon's]] unveiling of their [[Amazon HQ2|second headquarters]] in [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City, VA]], Virginia Tech announced plans to build a $1 billion graduate research center adjacent to Amazon's facility. The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be housed at a 1 million-square-foot campus in Alexandria. It is expected to educate hundreds of graduate students. The Virginia Tech Innovation Campus will be focused on computer science and software engineering, with specializations in areas including artificial intelligence, cyber-security and data analytics.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Amazon arrival spurs Virginia Tech to build technology campus in Northern Virginia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/11/14/amazon-hq-arrival-spurs-virginia-tech-build-technology-campus-northern-virginia/ |last=Svrluga |first=Susan |date=November 13, 2018 |website=[[Washington Post]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216183433/https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/11/14/amazon-hq-arrival-spurs-virginia-tech-build-technology-campus-northern-virginia/ |archive-date=December 16, 2018}}</ref>

Due to rapid growth of incoming freshmen classes, the university announced in 2019 that it would offer 1,559 incoming, in-state freshmen financial incentives to skip the 2019–20 school year in Blacksburg.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Some incoming Virginia Tech freshmen offered money to delay start in effort to relieve enrollment strain |url=https://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/some-incoming-virginia-tech-freshmen-offered-money-to-delay-start/article_6ed2a7b2-3b31-500a-a810-e3f968866c3b.html |last=Korth |first=Robby |date=May 29, 2019 |website=[[Roanoke Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531165248/https://www.roanoke.com/news/education/higher_education/virginia_tech/some-incoming-virginia-tech-freshmen-offered-money-to-delay-start/article_6ed2a7b2-3b31-500a-a810-e3f968866c3b.html |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |access-date=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Expecting a larger-than-planned class size, the university budgeted $3.3 million for the endeavor.  Virginia Tech also eliminated the requirement that all freshmen live on campus for the 2019-20 school year and leased an off-campus [[Holiday Inn]], and converted its on-campus hotel to house students for the 2019-20 school year. 

====2007 shooting====
{{main|Virginia Tech shooting}}
On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech student [[Seung-Hui Cho]] fatally shot 32 faculty members and students and wounded 17 others in two locations on campus before killing himself as police breached the doors of [[Norris Hall]] which Cho had chained closed before starting his killing spree. The massacre is the deadliest [[mass shooting]] on a college campus, surpassing [[Charles Whitman]]'s rampage at the [[University of Texas]] in 1966. Although it was at the time the deadliest mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in U.S. history, it has since been surpassed by two shootings at [[Orlando nightclub shooting|an Orlando nightclub]] and [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fact File: Deadliest shootings in the U.S. |work=NBC News |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18140540 |url-status=live |access-date=September 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301061624/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18140540 |archive-date=March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ellis |first=Ralph |last2=Fantz |first2=Ashley |last3=Karimi |first3=Faith |last4=McLaughlin |first4=Eliott C. |title=49 killed in Florida nightclub terror attack |work=Cnn.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/index.html |url-status=live |access-date=November 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612081344/http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/index.html |archive-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Las Vegas shooting: At least 58 dead at Mandalay Bay Hotel |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41466116 |date=October 2, 2017 |website=[[BBC News]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002063912/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41466116 |archive-date=October 2, 2017 |access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> It is the second deadliest school massacre in U.S. history surpassed only by the [[Bath School disaster|Bath School bombing]] in 1927 that killed 44.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 1927 Bombing That Remains America's Deadliest School Massacre |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1927-bombing-remains-americas-deadliest-school-massacre-180963355/ |last=Boissoneault |first=Lorraine |date=May 18, 2017 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327212252/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1927-bombing-remains-americas-deadliest-school-massacre-180963355/ |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |access-date=March 27, 2019}}</ref>

The Virginia Tech massacre led to an intense nationwide debate over gun rights, gun safety and efficacy of gun free zones. The mass shooting prompted many states to introduce legislation to prohibit public colleges and universities from banning [[concealed weapons]] on campus for permit holders. In 2013, at least nineteen states introduced legislation to allow concealed carry on campus in some form and in the 2014 legislative session, at least fourteen states introduced similar legislation. [[Tennessee]] passed a bill in 2016, permitting faculty members to carry handguns on campus after notifying local law enforcement. In 2015, [[Texas]] became the eighth state to allow concealed weapons on college campuses. In December 2016, Governor [[John Kasich]] signed a bill into law which lifted Ohio's statewide ban on firearms on college campuses leaving the decision to individual institutions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guns on Campus: Overview |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx |website=www.ncsl.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216075451/http://www.ncsl.org/research/education/guns-on-campus-overview.aspx |archive-date=February 16, 2019 |access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref> In 2017 Georgia became the tenth state to prohibit colleges and universities from banning concealed weapons on campus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Campus Carry and the public history of the gun debate |url=https://ncph.org/history-at-work/campus-carry-and-the-public-history-of-the-gun-debate/ |website=National Council on Public History |language=en-US |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327212255/https://ncph.org/history-at-work/campus-carry-and-the-public-history-of-the-gun-debate/ |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |access-date=2019-03-28}}</ref> Although Virginia law allows individual institutions to make the decision regarding whether to allow concealed weapons on campus, Virginia Tech continues to ban concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns on campus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nightline |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline |website=ABC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121214222/https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline |archive-date=November 21, 2019 |access-date=March 27, 2019}}</ref>

====2009 on-campus murder of graduate student====

On January 21, 2009 Virginia Tech graduate student Xin Yang was murdered by fellow graduate student Haiyang Zhu in the Au Bon Pain cafe in the university's Graduate Life Center on campus. Zhu, 25 was pursuing a doctorate in agricultural and applied economics. Yang, 22, had just arrived at the university two weeks earlier to study for a master's degree in accounting.

{{Main|Virginia Tech campus}}

The [[Virginia Tech campus]] is located in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]]. The central campus is roughly bordered by Prices Fork Road to the northwest, Plantation Drive to the west, Main Street to the east, and US 460 Bypass to the south, though it has several thousand acres beyond the central campus.

In the center of the Blacksburg campus lies the Drillfield, a large oval field running northeast to southwest, encircled by a one-way street that is known as Drillfield Drive. The Drillfield's name, coined in 1926 after the completion of Virginia Tech's first real stadium, [[Miles Stadium]], stems from its use by the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]] to conduct military drills. A waterway, Stroubles Creek, runs beneath the Drillfield on the south side. A three-sided conduit for the creek that retains the natural bed of the creek was installed in 1934, and, in 1971, the first two asphalt walks were added. The urban legend that the Drillfield is sinking at the rate of an inch per year, however, has no basis in fact.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=Clara B. |date=Winter 2008 |title=The Drillfield: At the heart of campus |url=http://www.vtmag.vt.edu/winter08/feature1.html |url-status=live |journal=VirginiaTech Magazine |publisher=Virginia Tech |volume=30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314204313/http://www.vtmag.vt.edu/winter08/feature1.html |archive-date=March 14, 2014 |access-date=September 11, 2015 |number=2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Owens |first=Cody |date=February 11, 2013 |title=Sinking Drillfield rumors exposed |work=[[Collegiate Times]] |publisher=Virginia Tech |url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia_tech/article_9ec48152-572e-5c05-99b9-c7ee4e391b66.html |url-status=live |access-date=September 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106141844/http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia_tech/article_9ec48152-572e-5c05-99b9-c7ee4e391b66.html |archive-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref> In the summer of 2014, three dirt paths were paved as part of the university's master plan to improve the landscaping and pathways, add seating areas, and enhance path entrances around the Drillfield.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dirt paths on Drillfield to be paved |url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2014/08/080514-vpa-drillfieldpaths.html |last=Spieldenner |first=Bob |date=August 5, 2014 |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906163927/http://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2014/08/080514-vpa-drillfieldpaths.html |archive-date=September 6, 2015 |access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref>

On the northwestern side of the Drillfield stands the majority of the university's academic and administrative buildings, including Burruss and McBryde halls. On the southeastern side of the Drillfield stands the majority of the residential buildings, including students' residence halls, dining halls, and War Memorial Gym. Newman Library is located on the eastern side of campus and connects to Torgersen Bridge, which spans the main road into campus, Alumni Mall. North of the Drillfield and northwest of Alumni Mall lies the Upper Quad, known to many students as military campus. The Upper Quad is home to the Corps of Cadets' barracks.

On the main campus in Blacksburg, the majority of the buildings incorporate [[Hokie Stone]] as a building material. In the 1990s, a Virginia Tech Board of Visitors committee expressed an intent that henceforth Hokie Stone should be used in all buildings constructed on the central campus. In 2010, the board of visitors passed a resolution making that sentiment official university policy.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All About Hokie Stone |url=http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314091234/http://www.vt.edu/about/traditions/hokie-stone.html |archive-date=March 14, 2014 |access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

Hokie Stone is generally gray, shaded by hues of brown and pink. The limestone is mined from various quarries in Southwest Virginia, Tennessee, and Alabama – one of which has been operated by the university since the 1950s. However, while it is true that the majority of buildings on campus incorporate Hokie Stone into their design, there are a few notable exceptions. For example, several older buildings on the Upper Quad, including Lane Hall, are constructed of red brick as are Hillcrest Hall and Donaldson Brown. Also, a number of academic buildings were not constructed using Hokie Stone, as they were built before the institution of the rule mandating its use in all new university buildings.

The article indicates that the university plans for the Duck Pond to replace the Drillfield as the campus' center.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Duck Pond to replace Drillfield as center of campus in coming years |url=http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/duck-pond-to-replace-drillfield-as-center-of-campus-in/article_2253e89a-7a34-11e8-8426-cf3d97993e72.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717212720/http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/duck-pond-to-replace-drillfield-as-center-of-campus-in/article_2253e89a-7a34-11e8-8426-cf3d97993e72.html |archive-date=July 17, 2018 |access-date=July 17, 2018}}</ref> This finding was confirmed by President Sands on July 10, tweeting that "While the Duck Pond is becoming somewhat more central with respect to the flow of people (and ducks), the Drillfield will always be the cultural and historical center of campus, as well as the physical place that reminds all of us what it means to be a Hokie."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timothy D Sands on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/VTSandsman/status/1016681866378858497 |access-date=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

* Over 9,300 Virginia Tech students reside on campus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Student Life, Living on and off Campus |url=https://vt.edu/student_life.html |website=Vt.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512014234/https://vt.edu/student_life.html |archive-date=May 12, 2018 |access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref> 
* Currently, there are twenty-eight residence halls housing undergraduate and graduate students. Several more are either in the planning stages or under construction now.
* The university has on-campus housing for graduate and professional students who are single; the housing may not accommodate families and spouses.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Virginia Tech Graduate School: Living in Blacksburg |url=http://graduateschool.vt.edu/admitted/liveinbburg.html#housing |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219182209/http://graduateschool.vt.edu/admitted/liveinbburg.html |archive-date=February 19, 2012 |access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref>
* All freshmen are required to live on-campus. However, for the 2019 application year, first year students had the opportunity to live off-campus. This was the result of an unexpectedly large admission rate. In order to live on-campus, students must fill out the Virginia Tech Housing and Dining Contract, which requires students to purchase a major meal plan.<ref name="OCDining">{{Cite web |title=Major Dining Plans {{!}} Dining Services {{!}} Virginia Tech |url=http://dining.vt.edu/plans_policies/major_plans.html |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907184921/https://www.dining.vt.edu/plans_policies/major_plans.html |archive-date=September 7, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2016}}</ref>

===Corps of Cadets===
[[File:Virginia Tech Corps marching.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]] marching]]
{{Main|Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets}}

Until 1932, every able-bodied male was required to participate for four years in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets. The requirement was changed to two years until 1964, when participation became voluntary. Members of the ROTC program are required to participate in the Corps of Cadets. Virginia Tech remains one of three public universities in the United States with both an active corps of cadets and regular civilian students on its campus ([[Texas A&M University]] and the [[University of North Georgia]] are the other two).

=== Cadet Residential life ===
More than 1,000 cadets reside on the campus of Virginia Tech. The Corps of Cadets Community is located in the Upper Quad, which features some of the oldest buildings on campus. Cadet dorms are also known as "cadet barracks". Two new dormitories were constructed on the Upper Quad to house all of the cadets. Pearson Hall replaced Rasche Hall in November 2015, and in August 2017, Brodie Hall was replaced by the New Cadet Dorm (a.k.a. "New Brodie").<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brodie Hall demolition begins this week |url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/06/060815-vpa-brodiedemolition.html |last=Spieldenner |first=Bob |last2=Foy |first2=Bill |date=June 8, 2015 |publisher=Virginia Tech |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072245/http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/06/060815-vpa-brodiedemolition.html |archive-date=September 5, 2015 |access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Former cadet dorms, Thomas Hall and Monteith Hall were demolished in 2017. Their sites are planned to be used as [[Open space reserve|green space]] for the foreseeable future.

===Greek Life===
Virginia Tech hosts a number of fraternities and sororities across four governing councils. There are 23 IFC fraternities and 13 [[National Panhellenic Conference]] sororities recognized at Virginia Tech. The fraternity and sorority community currently encompasses more than 5,500 students which represents just about 20 percent of the undergraduate population.<ref name=":1" /> The Oak Lane Community<ref>{{Cite web |title=Oak Lane Community Guide |url=https://fsl.vt.edu/housing_information/Oak_Lane_Community_Guide.html |website=Fsl.vt.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412082139/https://fsl.vt.edu/housing_information/Oak_Lane_Community_Guide.html |archive-date=April 12, 2018 |access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref> houses those sororities and fraternities which have houses chartered on campus. A number of fraternities have chartered off-campus housing. There are also numerous other academic and service related sororities and fraternities at the school.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Fraternity and Sorority Life |url=https://fsl.vt.edu/ |website=Fsl.vt.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429014522/https://fsl.vt.edu/ |archive-date=April 29, 2018 |access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref> 

There are also a number of fraternities at Virginia Tech that are not officially recognized by the university.  These organizations have continued to operate off campus in Blacksburg despite being suspended for violations of university policies. These fraternities include: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], Center Club (formerly [[Sigma Chi]]), [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], Omicron Alpha Kappa (formerly [[Kappa Delta Rho]]), [[Theta Delta Chi]], and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]].<ref>https://www.wtvr.com/2019/07/12/eight-virginia-tech-fraternities-suspended-for-hazing-unsafe-cultures-continue-to-operate-on-campus/</ref> While several of these chapters are still chartered by their national organization they are not currently recognized by Virginia Tech.<ref>https://fsl.vt.edu/index/unrecognized_chapters.html</ref>

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Virginia Tech Hokies}}
[[File:Virginia Tech Hokies logo.svg|thumb|right|200px|Stylized "VT" logo]]
[[File:VirginiaTechWordmark.png|thumb|200x200px|Virginia Tech Athletic Font]]
Virginia Tech teams are known as the Hokies. The [[HokieBird]] is a [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]-like creature whose form has evolved from the original school mascot of the [[Fighting Gobbler]]. While the modern HokieBird still resembles a Fighting Gobbler, the word "Hokie" has all but replaced Fighting Gobbler in terms of colloquial use. The term originated from the ''[[Old Hokie]]'' spirit yell, in which there was no particular meaning indicated for the word.

They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports since the 2004–05 season. The Hokies previously competed in the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] from 2000–01 to 2003–04 (football program from 1991–92 to 1999–2000); the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (A-10) from 1995–96 to 1999–2000; and the [[Metro Conference]] from 1978–79 to 1994–95.

Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and wrestling. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field and volleyball.

The stylized "VT" (the abbreviation for "Virginia Tech") is used primarily by the athletic department as a symbol for Virginia Tech athletic teams. The "athletic VT" symbol is trademarked by the university and appears frequently on licensed merchandise.

During the early years of VPI, a rivalry developed between it and [[Virginia Military Institute]]. This long-standing rivalry lasted nine decades, from 1894 to 1984, and developed into the original [[Military Classic of the South]] an annual football game between VMI and VPI usually held on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] at [[Victory Stadium]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. That series ended after the 1984 season; VMI had elected to play at the [[Division I-AA]] level, now Division I FCS, after the NCAA's 1978 divisional split for football, and the schools' wide disparity in size after Virginia Tech's rapid expansion in the 1960s and 70s had led to a similar imbalance in results. Another long-standing and important rivalry is between Virginia Tech and the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]] strengthened in concurrence with both UVA's and Tech's growth during the 1960s and 1970s and this is now the Hokies' primary program-wide athletic rivalry. The two schools compete in football for the Governor's "Commonwealth Cup" each season.

Virginia Tech's [[fight song]], "[[Tech Triumph]]", was written in 1919 and remains in use today. The song is played at sporting events by both the Virginia Tech student band, [[The Marching Virginians]], and the regimental Corps of Cadets' band, the [[Highty Tighties]]. The "[[Old Hokie]]" spirit yell, written in 1896 and used to this day, is familiar to many Virginia Tech fans. This chant is also where the word "Hoki" (since modified to "Hokie") originally appeared.

Notable Virginia Tech athletes include [[Nickeil Alexander-Walker]], [[Frank Beamer]], [[Allan Bristow]], [[Kam Chancellor]], [[Bimbo Coles]], [[Dell Curry]], [[Ace Custis]], Renee Dennis, [[Bill Dooley]], [[Jim Druckenmiller]], [[Terrell Edmunds]], [[Tremaine Edmunds]], [[Bud Foster]], [[Kendall Fuller]], [[Kyle Fuller]], [[Chuck Hartman]], [[Sally Miles]], [[Charles Moir]], [[Johnny Oates]], [[Bruce Smith]], [[Tyrod Taylor]], [[DeAngelo Hall]], [[Isaiah Ford]], [[Angela Tincher O'Brien|Angela Tincher]], and [[Michael Vick]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Retired Numbers & Jerseys At Virginia Tech |url=https://hokiesports.com/sports/2018/4/19/retired-numbers-jerseys-at-virginia-tech.aspx |website=Virginia Tech Athletics |language=en |access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>

The most prominent athletic facilities are [[Lane Stadium]], [[Cassell Coliseum]], [[English Field]], Thompson Field, Tech Softball Park, Rector Field House, the Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility, and the Christiansburg Aquatic Center.
