'''Gilberto Eduardo Gerardo Cojuangco Teodoro Jr.''' {{post-nominals|county=PHL|unlinked=[[Philippine Legion of Honor|PLH]]}} (born on June 14, 1964 in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], [[Philippines]]), or more commonly known as '''Gilbert'''/'''Gibo''',<ref name=isite>[http://www.i-site.ph/Databases/Congress/13thHouse/personal/teodoro-personal.html Teodoro, Gilberto Jr | Personal Information]</ref> is the former secretary of the national defense of the Republic of the [[Philippines]], having assumed the post in August 2007 until November 15, 2009. He was a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], representing the [[Legislative districts of Tarlac#1st District|First District]] of [[Tarlac]] province, from 1998 to 2007. In March 2009, he announced his intention to run for [[President of the Philippines]] in the [[2010 Philippine general election|May 2010 elections]].

He is also known for his efforts as the Chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) when [[Mega Manila]] was hit by [[Typhoon Ketsana]] (Ondoy).<ref name="ondoy">[http://allgiboteodoro.blogspot.com/2010/01/typhoon-ondoy_29.html Gibo and Typhoon Ondoy].</ref>

==Educational background==
Born in [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]], [[Philippines]], Teodoro finished elementary in 1977 and high school in 1981 at [[Xavier School]], and obtained his undergraduate degree in [[commerce]] from [[De La Salle University]] in 1984. He then studied law at the [[University of the Philippines]] from 1985 to 1989, and finished at the top of his class. He was also awarded the Dean's Medal for Academic Excellence. He topped the 1989 Philippine Bar Examinations with an 86.18% bar rating.<ref>https://philippinebar.wordpress.com/tag/bar-exams-results/</ref> In 1997, he obtained his [[Master of Laws]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]] of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and he passed the State Bar of New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/botomo/05/13/09/profile-gilberto-eduardo-gilbert-cojuangco-jr-teodoro |last=San Jose |first=Denise |title=PROFILE: Gilberto "GIBO" Cojuangco Teodoro, Jr. |work=[[ABS-CBN Corporation]] |date=May 13, 2009 |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>

According to his classmates, Teodoro was "very intelligent", an unconventional nerd. They have also added that he is "very unassuming" and a "very cool" person. During his college days, he had not been involved in campus politics, and had been busy with his other commitments outside school, including being a member of the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] (Youth Council) in Tarlac and learning how to fly planes.<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/component/content/article/42-rokstories/16495-school-buddies-on-gibo-scary-brilliant-guy-with-zero-social-love-life School buddies on Gibo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503050345/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/component/content/article/42-rokstories/16495-school-buddies-on-gibo-scary-brilliant-guy-with-zero-social-love-life |date=2010-05-03 }}.</ref>

Teodoro had been a lawyer for seven years at the EP Mendoza Law firm.<ref>http://gibo.ph/index_ie.html Gibo Bio.</ref>

==Political career==

===Before Congress===
At the age of 16, in 1980, Teodoro was elected as the Kabataang Barangay (KB) President in Tarlac. He went on to lead [[Central Luzon]] and became a member of the Tarlac [[Sangguniang Panlalawigan]] at the time that his mother was the Tarlac representative in the National Assembly.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100502-267604/Gilbert-C-Teodoro-RP-deserves-to-be-among-worlds-vibrant-economies RP deserves to be among the world's vibrant economies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504054205/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100502-267604/Gilbert-C-Teodoro-RP-deserves-to-be-among-worlds-vibrant-economies |date=2010-05-04 }}.</ref>

===Congressman===
From 1998 to 2007 he was a House Representative for the [[Legislative districts of Tarlac#1st District|First District]] of [[Tarlac]] province. He assumed the position of Assistant Majority Leader in the [[11th Congress of the Philippines|11th Congress]] and head of the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]] House members. He was also a member of the House contingent to the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council. Teodoro was a part of the "[[Bright Boys]]" clique.

Following his three terms in office—the maximum number allowed by the constitution — he was succeeded by his wife, [[Monica Prieto-Teodoro]].

===Secretary of National Defense===
[[File:Arroyo Gates Pentagon2 080624.jpg|thumb|225px|President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] and Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro with U.S. Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] during a meeting in the Pentagon. ]]
Teodoro was appointed Secretary of the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]] in August 2007 at the age of 43, like the late [[Ramon Magsaysay]], he is also the youngest person to ever hold the position.

===Chairman of National Disaster Coordinating Council===
While serving as the Secretary of the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]], Teodoro concurrently headed the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC), a temporary organization that supports the relief efforts being done by the local government in times of natural disasters. When [[Typhoon Ketsana]] hit the country, Teodoro immediately issued an appeal for international aid through the [[United Nations]] and organized relief operations in the affected areas given the limitations in resources and the scale of the disaster.<ref name="ondoy"/> He mitigated the devastation wrought by the typhoon and prioritized the areas at risk of being wiped out.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20091011-229456/Typhoon-battered-RP-appeals-for-intl-help Typhoon-battered RP appeals for Int'l help] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014163414/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20091011-229456/Typhoon-battered-RP-appeals-for-intl-help |date=2009-10-14 }}.</ref>

Under the law (PD 1566), the NDCC's role as a temporary or [[ad hoc]] committee is very limiting because it places the budget and primary responsibility during natural disasters on the hands of local government officials. For this reason, Teodoro expressed the desire for bills that seek to replace PD 1566 with a permanent  Disaster Risk Reduction Council (DRRC) that will be given the right powers and resources to correct the weaknesses of the current law.<ref name="ondoy"/><ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1978/pd_1566_1978.html PD 1566].</ref>

==2010 presidential campaign==
{{main|2010 Philippine presidential election}}
[[File:Gibomania.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Teodoro during his party's Grand Rally at [[Rizal Memorial Stadium]] in Manila.]] 
In March 2009, Teodoro announced his intention to run for [[President of the Philippines]] in the May 2010 election.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090312-193663/Palace-cheers-Teodoros-plan-to-run-in-2010 Palace cheers Teodoro’s plan to run in 2010]</ref> Months earlier, he quit his old party [[Nationalist People's Coalition]] (NPC) to join the merged administration party [[Lakas Kampi CMD]] and cast his name in the ruling party's contenders for the 2010 elections.

On September 16, 2009, voting 42–5 through secret balloting, the executive committee of Lakas-Kampi officially selected Teodoro as their party's presidential standard bearer for the May 2010 elections, edging out the other nominee, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority|MMDA]] Chairman [[Bayani Fernando]].  The announcement was made by Lakas-Kampi Secretary General Gabriel Claudio after a deliberation that lasted for approximately an hour.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/09/16/09/lakas-kampi-picks-gibo Lakas-Kampi picks Gibô]</ref>

Teodoro's campaign platform includes encouraging political growth in the provinces and improving healthcare and education. He has also stated that he would not interfere if Arroyo were to be charged at a later date.<ref>[http://the-diplomat.com/philippines-election-2010/candidate-profiles/ Candidate Profiles: Gilberto 'Gibo' Teodoro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412115449/http://the-diplomat.com/philippines-election-2010/candidate-profiles/ |date=2010-04-12 }}</ref>

On November 20, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] resigned her post as the Chairman of the Lakas-Kampi-CMD and handed over the post to Teodoro.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8368139.stm ''Philippine President Arroyo quits as ruling party head'']</ref>

[[File:Supergibo.JPG|thumb|center|650px|A crowd estimate of 135,000 rallied behind Teodoro and his party during the grand rally in Manila.]]

Teodoro's campaign slogan was "Galing at Talino" ([[wikt:capability|capability]] and [[Skill|competence]]). According to him, public service does not only entail integrity, but ability and competence as well because people are looking for clear plans and not just mere promises and most of all positive campaigning. During the campaign, he shunned from mudslinging and encouraged other Presidentiables to do away with smear campaigning because it breeds disunity among Filipinos.<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/top-stories/16461-we-should-shun-mudslinging--teodoro 'We should shun mudslinging'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503050422/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/top-stories/16461-we-should-shun-mudslinging--teodoro |date=2010-05-03 }}.</ref>

On May 11, 2010, a day after the elections were held, Teodoro gracefully conceded defeat to the leading presidential candidate, Senator [[Noynoy Aquino]] of the Liberal Party. During a press conference he held in the Lakas-KAMPI-CMD national headquarters in Metro Manila, Teodoro wished Aquino well and also announced his decision to return to private life in order to take care of his wife and only son.

==Post-political life==
In April 2014, Teodoro was appointed as an independent director of [[BDO Unibank|Banco de Oro]], one of the Philippines' [[List of banks in the Philippines|largest bank]] which is owned by [[Teresita Sy-Coson]], the eldest daughter of [[SM Prime Holdings]] owner [[Henry Sy]].<ref>http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/04/25/14/gibo-teodoro-elected-bdo-director</ref> In August 2015, he was named board chairman of the Sagittarius Mines Incorporated (SMI).<ref name="smi">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/133258-gibo-teodoro-offer-defense|title=Gibo Teodoro: I will think about DND post offer|publisher=[[Rappler]]|date=May 16, 2016|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref>

Prior to the 2016 Philippine elections, Rodrigo Duterte advised Miriam Defensor-Santiago to make Teodoro her vice president, in return, Duterte will support the tandem. However, Santiago chose Bongbong Marcos as her running mate. Duterte then run for the presidency and won. In May 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] offered Teodoro to return to his post as Secretary of National Defense but said that he would consult his family first on his final decision as to whether he would accept it.<ref name="smi"/> In early June 2016, he declined Duterte's offer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/135137-gibo-teodoro-declines-dnd-post-duterte-cabinet |last=Ranada |first=Pia |title=Gibo Teodoro officially declines DND post |work=[[Rappler]] |date=June 2, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref> He was yet again offered by Duterte for the defense post on August 23, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/143962-duterte-offer-gibo-teodoro-defense-chief |last=Ranada |first=Pia |title=Duterte offers defense post to Gibo Teodoro again |work=[[Rappler]] |date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>
