'''Imperial Chemical Industries''' ('''ICI''') was a British [[Chemical industry|chemical]] company. It was, for much of its history, the largest manufacturer in Britain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4276592.ece |location=London |work=The Times |first1=David |last1=Smith |first2=Dominic |last2=O'Connell |first3=Iain |last3=Dey |first4=James |last4=Ashton |first5=Matthew |last5=Goodman |first6=Teena |last6=Lyons |first7=William |last7=Kay |title=Falling into the abyss |date=6 July 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120140310/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4276592.ece |archive-date=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
It was formed by the merger of four leading British chemical companies in 1926.
Its headquarters were at [[Millbank]] in [[London]]. ICI was a constituent of the [[FT 30]] and later the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] indices.

ICI made general chemicals, plastics, paints, pharmaceuticals and speciality products, including food ingredients, speciality [[polymer]]s, electronic materials, fragrances and flavourings.
In 2008, it was acquired by [[AkzoNobel]],<ref name="mergerdone">{{cite news |title=Akzo Nobel ICI merger completed |date=2 January 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7168348.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=24 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520055113/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7168348.stm |archive-date=20 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Development of the business (1926–1944) ===

[[File:Catalyst - ICI magazine volumes 1.jpg|thumb|1930s volumes of ''ICI'' magazine]]

The company was founded in December 1926 from the merger of four companies: [[Brunner Mond]], [[Nobel Enterprises|Nobel Explosives]], the [[United Alkali Company]], and [[British Dyestuffs Corporation]].<ref name=history>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ici.com/History |title=ICI: History |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017121139/http://www.ici.com/History |archive-date=17 October 2008 }}</ref> It established its [[Imperial Chemical House|head office]] at Millbank in London in 1928.<ref name=history/>
Competing with [[DuPont]] and [[IG Farben]], the new company produced [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], explosives, [[fertiliser]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[dyestuff]]s, [[non-ferrous]] metals, and paints.<ref name=history/>
In its first year turnover was £27&nbsp;million.<ref name=history/>

In the 1920s and 1930s, the company played a key role in the development of new chemical products, including the dyestuff [[phthalocyanine]] (1929), the acrylic plastic [[polymethyl methacrylate|Perspex]] (1932),<ref name=history/> [[Dulux]] paints (1932, co-developed with DuPont),<ref name=history/> [[polyethylene]] (1937),<ref name=history/> and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] fibre known as [[Terylene]] (1941).<ref name=history/>
In 1940, ICI started [[British Nylon Spinners]] as a joint venture with [[Courtaulds]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.akzonobel.com/system/images/AkzoNobel_Historybook_LoRes_tcm9-8568.pdf |title=Tomorrow's Answers Today – The History of AkzoNobel since 1646 |publisher=Akzo Nobel International |page=235 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117134913/https://www.akzonobel.com/system/images/AkzoNobel_Historybook_LoRes_tcm9-8568.pdf |archive-date=17 November 2015 |df=dmy-all |access-date=13 November 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |work=The Times |date=3 January 1940 |page=12}}</ref>

ICI also owned the [[Sunbeam Cycles|Sunbeam motorcycle]] business, which had come with Nobel Industries, and continued to build motorcycles until 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicglory.com/sunbeam.htm |title=Why the BSA badge?

During the [[Second World War]], ICI was involved with the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons programme codenamed [[Tube Alloys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/british/|title=British Mission - History of the Atomic Age|website=atomicarchive.com|access-date=29 April 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908001924/http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/british/|archive-date=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Postwar innovation (1945–1990) ===

[[File:ICI UK Works Map May 1955.png|thumb|Map showing Imperial Chemical Industries sales regions, offices and factories in the United Kingdom in May 1955]]
In the 1940s and 1950s, the company established its [[pharmaceutical]] business and developed a number of key products, including [[Proguanil|Paludrine]] (1940s, an anti-[[malaria]]l drug),<ref name=history/> [[halothane]] (1951, an [[Inhalational anesthetic|inhalational anaesthetic]] agent), [[propofol]] (1977, an [[General anesthetic|intravenous anaesthetic]] agent),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Max T.|last2=Naguib|first2=Mohamed|date=2005-10-01|title=Propofol: The Challenges of Formulation|url=https://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1926210|journal=Anesthesiology: The Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists|language=en|volume=103|issue=4|pages=860–876|issn=0003-3022}}</ref> [[Inderal]] (1965, a [[beta-blocker]]),<ref name=history/> [[tamoxifen]] (1978, a frequently used drug for breast cancer),<ref name="isbn0-471-89979-8">{{cite book |last=Sneader |first=Walter |title=Drug discovery: a history |publisher=Wiley |year=2005 |isbn=0-471-89979-8}}</ref>
and [[PEEK]] (1979, a high performance [[thermoplastic]]).<ref name=history/> ICI formed ICI [[Pharmaceuticals]] in 1957.

ICI developed a fabric in the 1950s known as [[Crimplene]], a thick [[polyester]] yarn used to make a fabric of the same name.
The resulting cloth is heavy and wrinkle-resistant, and retains its shape well.
The California-based fashion designer [[Edith Flagg]] was the first to import this fabric from Britain to the United States.
During the first two years, ICI gave Flagg a large advertising budget to popularise the fabric across America.

In 1960, [[Paul Chambers (industrialist)|Paul Chambers]] became the first chairman appointed from outside the company.<ref name="ODNB Chambers">{{Cite book |first=J. P. |last=Strudwick |last2=Mark Pottle |title=Chambers, Sir (Stanley) Paul (1904–1981) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30916 |access-date=23 August 2014}}</ref>
Chambers employed the consultancy firm [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] to help with reorganising the company.<ref name="ODNB Chambers"/>
His eight-year tenure saw export sales double, but his reputation was severely damaged by a failed takeover bid for [[Courtaulds]] in 1961–62.<ref name="ODNB Chambers"/> In 1962, ICI developed the controversial herbicide, [[paraquat]].

ICI was confronted with the nationalisation of its operations in [[Burma]] on 1 August 1962 as a consequence of [[Burmese Way to Socialism|the military coup]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The State of Myanmar |url=https://archive.org/details/stateinmyanmar0000tayl |url-access=registration |first=Robert |last=Taylor |year=2009 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stateinmyanmar0000tayl/page/297 297]}}</ref>

In 1964, ICI acquired British Nylon Spinners (BNS), the company it had jointly set up in 1940 with Courtaulds.
ICI surrendered its 37.5 per cent holding in Courtaulds and paid Courtaulds £2&nbsp;million a year for five years, "to take account of the future development expenditure of Courtaulds in the nylon field."
In return, Courtaulds transferred to ICI their 50 per cent holding in BNS.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Keesing's Record of World Events (formerly Keesing's Contemporary Archives) |volume=10 |date=July 1964 |location=United Kingdom |page=20162}}</ref>
BNS was absorbed into ICI's existing polyester operation, ICI Fibres.
The acquisition included BNS production plants in [[Pontypool]], [[Gloucester]] and [[Doncaster]], together with research and development in Pontypool.
Early pesticide development included [[Gramoxone]] (1962, a [[herbicide]]),<ref name=history/> the insecticides [[pirimiphos-methyl]] in 1967 and [[pirimicarb]] in 1970, [[brodifacoum]] (a [[rodenticide]]) was developed in 1974; in the late 1970s, ICI was involved in the early development of synthetic [[pyrethroid]] insecticides such as [[lambda-cyhalothrin]].

Peter Allen was appointed chairman between 1968 and 1971.<ref name="ODNB Allen">{{Cite book |first=Martin |last=Adeney |title=Allen, Sir Peter Christopher (1905–1993)' |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51414  |access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>
He presided over the purchase of [[Viyella]].<ref name="ODNB Allen"/>
Profits shrank under his tenure.<ref name="ODNB Allen"/> During his tenure, ICI created the wholly owned subsidiary [[Cleveland Potash Ltd]], for the construction of [[Boulby Mine]] in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire. The first shaft was dug in 1968, with full production from 1976. ICI jointly owned the mine with Anglo American, and then with De Beers, before complete ownership was transferred to [[Israel Chemicals|Israel Chemicals Ltd]] in 2002.

Jack Callard was appointed chairman from 1971 to 1975.<ref name="ODNB Callard">{{Cite book |first=Martin |last=Adeney |title=Callard, Sir (Eric) John (1913–1998) |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/70879 |access-date=24 August 2014}}</ref>
He almost doubled company profits between 1972 and 1974, and made ICI Britain's largest exporter.<ref name="ODNB Callard"/>
In 1971, the company acquired Atlas Chemical Industries Inc., a major American competitor.<ref name=history/>

In 1977, [[Imperial Metal Industries]] was divested as an independent quoted company.<ref name="Owen347">{{cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Owen |title=From Empire to Europe: The Decline and Revival of British Industry Since the Second World War |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-00-638750-3 |page=347}}</ref>
From 1982 to 1987, the company was led by the charismatic [[John Harvey-Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2008/01/12/from-bullying-to-the-top-of-industry-91466-20342758/ |title=From bullying to the top of industry |work=icWales |date=12 January 2008 |access-date=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118035703/http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2008/01/12/from-bullying-to-the-top-of-industry-91466-20342758/ |archive-date=18 January 2008 }}</ref>
Under his leadership, the company acquired the Beatrice Chemical Division in 1985 and Glidden Coatings & Resins, a leading [[paint]]s business, in 1986.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC113FF93AA35750C0A961948260 |title=New Chairman of ICI praises planned agenda |work=The New York Times |date=9 March 1987 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218161756/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC113FF93AA35750C0A961948260 |archive-date=18 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Reorganisation of the business (1991–2007) ===

In 1991, ICI sold the agricultural and merchandising operations of [[BritAg]] and [[Scottish Agricultural Industries]] to [[Norsk Hydro]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&A/Hydro_Fertilizers_Norsk_Hydro_acquires_Britag_Industries_Ltd_ICI_PLC_from_Akzo_Nobel_NV-211311040 |title=Norsk Hydro acquires Britag Industries |publisher=Alacrastore.com |date=5 September 1991 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001002431/https://www.alacrastore.com/ |archive-date=1 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
and fought off a hostile takeover bid from [[Hanson plc|Hanson]], who had acquired 2.8 percent of the company.<ref>{{cite news |last=Prokesch |first=Steven |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DC1E3DF93BA25756C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Often-ravenous Hanson takes a taste of ICI |work=The New York Times |date=18 May 1991 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218155044/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DC1E3DF93BA25756C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |archive-date=18 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
It also divested its [[soda ash]] products arm to [[Brunner Mond]], ending an association with the trade that had existed since the company's inception, one that had been inherited from the original Brunner, Mond & Co. Ltd.

In 1992, the company sold its nylon business to [[DuPont]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Capitalism |url=http://capitalism.columbia.edu/files/ccs/Geoffrey%20Owen.pdf |publisher=Columbia University |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221002117/http://capitalism.columbia.edu/files/ccs/Geoffrey%20Owen.pdf |archive-date=21 December 2012 }}</ref>
In 1993, the company de-merged its pharmaceutical bio-science businesses: pharmaceuticals, [[agrochemicals]], specialities, [[seed]]s and [[Biology|biological]] products were all transferred into a new and independent company called [[Zeneca]].<ref>{{Cite web| last1 = Owen| first1 = Geoffrey| last2 = Harrison| first2 = Trevor| title = Why ICI Chose to Demerge| work = Harvard Business Review| access-date = 2016-11-06| date = 1995-03-01| url = https://hbr.org/1995/03/why-ici-chose-to-demerge| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161107011051/https://hbr.org/1995/03/why-ici-chose-to-demerge| archive-date = 7 November 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref> Zeneca subsequently merged with [[Astra AB]] to form [[AstraZeneca]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Ipsen |first=Erik |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1993/02/25/ici_.php |title=Will bad timing spoil ICI's plan to split in two? |work=International Herald Tribune |date=25 February 1993 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217064643/http://www.iht.com/articles/1993/02/25/ici_.php |archive-date=17 February 2009}}</ref>

Charles Miller Smith was appointed CEO in 1994, one of the few times that someone from outside ICI had been appointed to lead the company, Smith having previously been a director at [[Unilever]].
Shortly afterwards, the company acquired a number of former Unilever businesses in an attempt to move away from its historical reliance on [[commodity]] chemicals.    
In 1995, ICI acquired the American paint company [[Grow Group]].<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Reuters| title = Imperial Acquires Grow Group As It Outbids Sherwin-Williams| work = The New York Times| access-date = 2018-08-30| date = 1995-05-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/23/business/imperial-acquires-grow-group-as-it-outbids-sherwin-williams.html}}</ref> In 1997, ICI acquired National Starch & Chemical, [[Quest International]], Unichema, and Crosfield, the [[speciality chemicals]] businesses of [[Unilever]] for $8&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19716641.html |title=National Starch sold to ICI |date=1 June 1997 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022221221/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19716641.html |archive-date=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
This step was part of a strategy to move away from cyclical bulk chemicals and to progress up the value chain to become a higher growth, higher margin business.<ref name=history/>
Later that year it went on to buy [[Rutz & Huber]], a Swiss paints business.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n9647314 |title=ICI buys Swiss Paints Group}}{{Dead link |date=September 2010}}</ref>

Having taken on some £4&nbsp;billion of debt to finance these acquisitions, the company had to sell off its commodity chemicals businesses:

Having sold much of its historically profitable commodities businesses, and many of the new speciality businesses which it had failed to integrate, the company consisted mainly of the Dulux paints business, which quickly found itself the subject of a takeover by AkzoNobel.

=== Takeover by AkzoNobel ===

[[File:Syngenta Chemical Plant - geograph.org.uk - 95239.jpg|thumb|right|A former ICI plant in [[Huddersfield]], West Yorkshire, now owned by [[Syngenta]].]]

Dutch firm [[AkzoNobel]] (owner of Crown Berger paints) bid £7.2&nbsp;billion (€10.66&nbsp;billion or $14.5&nbsp;billion) for ICI in June 2007.
An area of concern about a potential deal was ICI's British [[pension fund]], which had future liabilities of more than £9&nbsp;billion at the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dutch poised to clinch £8bn ICI takeover |date=5 August 2007 |work=The Times |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/industrials/article2198016.ece |access-date=5 January 2008 |location=London |first=Louise |last=Armitstead |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612091313/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/industrials/article2198016.ece |archive-date=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
Regulatory issues in the UK and other markets where [[Dulux]] and Crown Paints brands each have significant market share were also a cause for concern for the boards of ICI and AkzoNobel.

== Operations ==

ICI operated a number of chemical sites around the world.
In the UK, the main plants were as follows:
* [[Billingham]] (in [[Stockton-on-Tees]]) and [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]] (in present-day [[Redcar and Cleveland]]): ICI used the Billingham site to manufacture [[fertiliser]]s in the 1920s and went on to produce plastics at Billingham in 1934. During [[World War II]] it manufactured [[Synthonia]], a [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] [[ammonia]] for explosives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/chemical-industry/background.shtml |title=The white heat of new technology |publisher=BBC |date=14 September 1949 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113175929/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/chemical-industry/background.shtml |archive-date=13 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Wilton R&D site was built to support the plastics division with R&D and chemical engineering facilities. The ICI Billingham Division was split into the ICI Heavy Organic Chemicals Division and ICI Agricultural Division in the 1960s. From 1971 to 1988 ICI Physics and Radioisotopes Section (later known as Tracerco) operated a small [[General Atomics]] [[TRIGA]] Mark I [[nuclear reactor]] at its Billingham factory for the production of radioisotopes used in the manufacture of flow and level instruments, among other products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisstockton.co.uk/billingham/History_of_Billingham.asp |title=History of Billingham |publisher=Thisisstockton.co.uk |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229124955/http://www.thisisstockton.co.uk/billingham/History_of_Billingham.asp |archive-date=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Agricultural Division was noted for the development of the world's largest bioreactor at the time - the 1.5 million litre Pruteen Reactor, used for the cultivation of animal feed. This had limited economic success but was followed by the much more successful development of Quorn.
* [[Blackley]] (in [[Manchester]]) and Huddersfield: ICI used the sites to manufacture [[dyestuff]]s. The dye business, known as the ICI Dyestuffs Division in the 1960s, went through several reorganisations. Huddersfield was tied in with Wilton with the production of nitrobenzene and nitrotolulene. Huddersfield also produced insecticides. (Syngenta still manufacture insecticides at Huddersfield). Proxel [[Biocide]] was made at Huddersfield from the 80's onwards. Additives also made at Huddersield.  Huddersfield became Zeneca then AstraZeneca, in 2004 Huddersfield was Syngenta, Avecia, Arch and Lubrizol running what were all ICI plants at one time.    Through the years it was combined with other [[speciality chemicals]] businesses and became Organics Division. Then became ICI Colours and Fine Chemicals and then ICI Specialties.<ref>{{cite web |work=ColorantsHistory.Org |url=http://www.colorantshistory.org/BritishDyestuffs.html |title=British Dyestuffs Corporation and ICI |date=17 March 2006 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229171829/http://www.colorantshistory.org/BritishDyestuffs.html |archive-date=29 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* [[Runcorn]] (in [[Cheshire]]): ICI operated a number of separate sites within the Runcorn area, including Caster-Kellner site, where ICI manufactured [[chlorine]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] (caustic soda).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/248210.stm |title=ICI cuts 1,000 jobs |work=BBC News |date=4 January 1999 |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202193837/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/248210.stm |archive-date=2 December 2002 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Adjacent to Castner-Kellner site was Rocksavage works, where a variety of chemicals based on chlorine products were manufactured, including Chloromethanes, Arklone dry cleaning fluid, Trichloethylene degreasing fluid and the Arcton range of CFCs. Also on that site were PVC manufacture and HF (Hydrogen fluoride) manufacture. At Runcorn Heath Research Laboratories, technical support, research and development for Mond Division products was carried out, and the support sections included chemical plan design and engineering sections.  Just to the north of Runcorn, on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey could be found the Wigg Works, which had been erected originally for producing poison gas in wartime. In Widnes could also be found several factories producing weedkillers and other products. For many years it was known as ICI Mond Division but later became part of the ICI Chemicals and Polymers Division. The Runcorn site was also responsible for the development of the HiGEE and Spinning Disc Reactor concepts. These were originated by Professor Colin Ramshaw and led to the concept of [[Micro process engineering|Process Intensification]]; research into these novel technologies is now being pursued by the Process Intensification Group at [[Newcastle University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdcindia.com/index2.php?act=service&sub=1 |title=Process Intensification |publisher=Ccdcindia.com |access-date=27 September 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220011843/http://www.ccdcindia.com/index2.php?act=service&sub=1 |archive-date=20 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
* Winnington and Wallerscote (in [[Northwich]], Cheshire): It was here that ICI manufactured [[sodium carbonate]] (soda ash) and its various by-products such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] (bicarbonate of soda), and [[sodium sesquicarbonate]]. The Winnington site, built in 1873 by the entrepreneurs [[John Tomlinson Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]], was also the base for the former company Brunner, Mond & Co. Ltd. and, after the merger which created ICI, the powerful and influential Alkali Division. It was at the [[Winnington Laboratory|laboratories]] on this site that [[polythene]] was discovered by accident in 1933 during experiments into high pressure reactions.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Hundred Years of Alkali in Cheshire |first=W.F.L. |last=Dick |location=Birmingham |year=1973}}</ref> Wallerscote was built in 1926, its construction delayed by the First World War, and became one of the largest factories devoted to a single product (soda ash) in the world.<ref>{{Cite book |title=ICI Magazine, ''Kynoch Press'' |year=1963}}</ref> However, the decreasing importance of the soda ash trade to ICI in favour of newer products such as paints and plastics, meant that in 1984 the Wallerscote site was closed, and thereafter mostly demolished. The laboratory where polythene was discovered was sold off and the building became home to a variety of businesses including a go-kart track and paintballing, and the Winnington Works were divested to the newly formed company, [[Brunner Mond]], in 1991. It was again sold in 2006, to Tata (an Indian-based company) and in 2011 was re branded as Tata Chemicals Europe. The Winnington plant closed in February 2014, with the last shift on 2 February bringing to a close 140 years of soda ash production in this Northwich site.{{citation needed |date=April 2014}}
* [[Ardeer, Scotland|Ardeer]] (in [[Stevenston]], Ayrshire): ICI Nobel used the site to manufacture [[dynamite]] and other explosives and [[nitrocellulose]]-based products. For a time, the site also produced nylon and [[nitric acid]]. [[Nobel Enterprises]] was sold in 2002 to [[Inabata & Co., Ltd.|Inabata]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-977112/Japanese-firm-buys-ICI-s.html |title=Japanese firm buys ICI's nitrocellulose business |work=Chemical Week |date=22 January 2003}}</ref>

=== Argentina ===
An ICI subsidiary called Duperial operated in Argentine from 1928 to 1995, when it was renamed ICI.

Established in the city of [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe]],
it operates an integrated production site with commercial offices in [[Buenos Aires]]. Since 2009 it has made [[sulphuric acid]] with ISO certification under the company name Akzo Nobel Functional Chemicals S.A.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

It also had an operation at [[Palmira, Mendoza]],  for its Wine Chemicals Division, that manufactured [[tartaric acid]], wine alcohol and [[grapeseed oil]] from natural raw material coming from the wine industry in the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan. This operation held 10% world market share for tartaric acid. It was sold in 2008 and currently operates as Derivados Vínicos S.A. (DERVINSA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=DERVINSA - DERIVADOS VÍNICOS S.A.|url=http://dervinsa.com.ar/english/about-us.php|access-date=2020-10-19|website=dervinsa.com.ar}}</ref>

=== Australia ===
The subsidiary ICI Australia Ltd established the [[Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary|Dry Creek Saltfields]] at [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]] north of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], in 1940, with an associated [[soda ash]] plant at nearby [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]].
In 1989, these operations were sold to [[Penrice Soda Products]].<ref>{{citation |last=Hough |first=J.K. |url=http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/93803/mj50_salt_production.pdf |title=Salt production in South Australia |work=MESA Journal |volume=50 |date=September 2008 |access-date=8 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073548/http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/93803/mj50_salt_production.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
An ICI plant was built at [[Botany Bay]] in [[New South Wales]] in the 1940s and was sold to [[Orica]] in 1997.<ref name=SMH>{{cite web |issn=0312-6315 |first=Jano |last=Gibson |first2=John |last2=Huxley |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Botany-pollution-fears-grow/2005/03/31/1111862533886.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Botany pollution fears grow |date=1 April 2005 |access-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106140837/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Botany-pollution-fears-grow/2005/03/31/1111862533886.html |archive-date=6 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The plant once manufactured paints, plastics and industrial chemicals such as [[solvent]]s. It was responsible for the [[Botany Bay Groundwater Plume]] contamination of a local [[aquifer]].<ref name=SMH/>

=== New Zealand ===
The subsidiary ICI New Zealand provided substantial quantities of chemical products - including swimming pool chemicals, commercial healthcare products, herbicides and pesticides for use within [[New Zealand]] and the neighboring [[Pacific Islands]].

A [[Structure fire|fire]] at the ICI New Zealand store in [[Mount Wellington, New Zealand|Mount Wellington]], [[Auckland]], on 21 December 1984, killed an ICI employee and caused major health concerns. Over 200 firefighters were exposed to toxic smoke and effluents during the firefighting efforts. Six firefighters retired for medical reasons as a result of the fire. This incident was a major event in the history of the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] and subject to a formal investigation, led by future [[Chief Justice of New Zealand|Chief Justice]] [[Sian Elias]]. The fire was a trigger for major reforms of the service; direct consequences included improved protective clothing for firefighters, a standard safety protocol for major incidents, the introduction of dedicated fireground safety officers, and changes to occupational health regulations.<ref name=NZFIRE>{{cite web |first=Sian |last=Elias |first2=D R |last2=Bandaranayake | first3= I R | last3 = Edwards | first4 = W I | last4 = Glass
