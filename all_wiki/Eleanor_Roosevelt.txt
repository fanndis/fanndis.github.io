Roosevelt was a member of the prominent American [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelt]] and [[Livingston family|Livingston]] families and a niece of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref name=bioER/> She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents and one of her brothers at a young age. At 15, she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its headmistress [[Marie Souvestre]]. Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, [[Sara Roosevelt|Sara]], and after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with [[Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd|Lucy Mercer]] in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in leading a public life of her own. She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|stricken with a paralytic illness]] in 1921, which cost him the normal use of his legs, and began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. Following Franklin's election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf; and as First Lady, while her husband served as president, she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of First Lady.

Though widely respected in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady at the time for her outspokenness, particularly on [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] for African-Americans. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies.

She launched an experimental community at [[Arthurdale, West Virginia]], for the families of unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the [[civil rights]] of [[African Americans]] and [[Asian Americans]], and the rights of World War II refugees. Following her husband's death in 1945, Roosevelt remained active in politics for the remaining 17 years of her life. She pressed the United States to [[History of the United Nations|join and support]] the [[United Nations]] and became its [[United States Representative to the United Nations|first delegate]]. She served as the first chair of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Commission on Human Rights]] and oversaw the drafting of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Later, she chaired the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration's [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]]. By the time of her death, Roosevelt was regarded as "one of the most esteemed women in the world"; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called her "the object of almost universal respect" in an obituary.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1011.html |title=Mrs. Roosevelt, First Lady 12 Years, Often Called 'World's Most Admired Woman' |date=November 8, 1962 |work=The New York Times |access-date=December 7, 2012 |archive-date=March 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322023854/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1011.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Through her father, she was a niece of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Through her mother, she was a niece of tennis champions [[Valentine Hall|Valentine Gill "Vallie" Hall III]] and [[Edward L. Hall|Edward Ludlow Hall]]. Her mother nicknamed her "Granny" because she acted in such a serious manner as a child.<ref name="Graham">{{cite journal |url=http://www.vqronline.org/essay/paradox-eleanor-roosevelt-alcoholism%E2%80%99s-child |last=Graham |first=Hugh Davis |title=The Paradox of Eleanor Roosevelt: Alcoholism's Child |journal=Virginia Quarterly Review |date=Spring 1987 |access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> Anna was also somewhat ashamed of her daughter's plainness.<ref name="Graham"/>

Roosevelt had two younger brothers: Elliott Jr. and [[Hall Roosevelt|Hall]]. She also had a half brother, Elliott Roosevelt Mann, through her father's affair with Katy Mann, a servant employed by the family.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=42}} Roosevelt was born into a world of immense wealth and privilege, as her family was part of New York [[Socialite|high society]] called the "swells".<ref name=pulitzer>{{cite book|author=Lash, Joseph P. |title=Eleanor and Franklin|url=https://archive.org/details/eleanorfranklins00lash |url-access=registration |publisher=[[W.W.

Roosevelt boarded with her father, mother and aunt Tissie the ''[[SS Britannic (1874)|SS Britannic]]'' on May 19, 1887 when the ship collided with [[White Star Line]]r ''[[SS Celtic (1872)|SS Celtic]]''. She was lowered into a lifeboat and she and her parents were taken to the ''Celtic'' and returned to New York. After this traumatic event, Eleanor was afraid of ships and the sea all her life.<ref>Lash, J. (1971).

Her mother died from [[diphtheria]] on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. died of the same disease the following May.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=94}} Her father, an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium, died on August 14, 1894, after jumping from a window during a fit of [[delirium tremens]].

Roosevelt doted on Hall, and when he enrolled at [[Groton School]] in 1907, she accompanied him as a chaperone. While he was attending Groton, she wrote him almost daily, but always felt a touch of guilt that Hall had not had a fuller childhood. She took pleasure in Hall's brilliant performance at school, and was proud of his many academic accomplishments, which included a master's degree in engineering from [[Harvard University|Harvard]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=276–77}}

After the deaths of her parents, Roosevelt was raised in the household of her maternal grandmother, Mary Livingston Ludlow of the [[Livingston family]] in [[Tivoli, New York]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=95}} As a child, she was insecure and starved for affection, and considered herself the "ugly duckling".<ref name=pulitzer/> However, Roosevelt wrote at 14 that one's prospects in life were not totally dependent on physical beauty: "no matter how plain a woman may be if truth and loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/about/first-ladies/eleanorroosevelt |title=Anna Eleanor Roosevelt |publisher=The White House |year=2009 |author=Black, Allida |access-date=March 13, 2010 |archive-date=November 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103173314/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/first-ladies/eleanorroosevelt |url-status=live }}</ref>

At age 17 in 1902, Roosevelt completed her formal education and returned to the United States; she was presented at a debutante ball at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] hotel on December 14. She was later given her own "coming out party".<ref name="Gay">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Kathlyn|title=American Dissidents: An Encyclopedia of Activists, Subversives, and Prisoners of Conscience|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzQVpPvlVMcC&pg=PA508|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-764-2|page=508|chapter=Eleanor Roosevelt}}</ref> She said of her debut in a public discussion once, "It was simply awful.

Roosevelt was active with the New York [[Junior League]] shortly after its founding, teaching dancing and calisthenics in the East Side slums.<ref name=Gay /> The organization had been brought to Roosevelt's attention by her friend, organization founder [[Mary Harriman Rumsey|Mary Harriman]], and a male relative who criticized the group for "drawing young women into public activity".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Eleanor Roosevelt Encyclopedia |author1=Beasley, Maurine Hoffman |author2=Holly Cowan Shulman |author3=Henry R.

Roosevelt was a lifelong Episcopalian, regularly attended services, and was very familiar with the New Testament. Dr. Harold Ivan Smith states that she, "was very public about her faith. In hundreds of “My Day” and “If You Ask Me” columns, she addressed issues of faith, prayer and the Bible."<ref>See [https://www.trumanlibraryinstitute.org/faith-first-lady-eleanor-roosevelts-spirituality/ "The Faith of a First Lady: Eleanor Roosevelt's Spirituality" ''Truman Library Institute'' Dec 6, 2017]</ref><ref>Harold Ivan Smith, ''Eleanor: A Spiritual Biography: The Faith of the 20th Century's Most Influential Woman'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 2017) [https://www.amazon.com/Eleanor-Spiritual-Biography-Centurys-Influential-ebook/dp/B06XNWQ4TX/ excerpt].</ref>

===Marriage and family life===
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt wearing her wedding dress in New York City - NARA - 195393.jpg|thumb|right|Roosevelt in her wedding dress, 1905]]
In the summer of 1902, Roosevelt encountered her father's [[Cousin#Relationship charts|fifth cousin]], Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to [[Tivoli, New York]].<ref name=1884ER>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/abouteleanor/erbiography.cfm |title=1884–1920: Becoming a Roosevelt |publisher=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project via George Washington University |access-date=November 24, 2012 |archive-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116044011/http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/abouteleanor/erbiography.cfm |url-status=live}}</ref> The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=32}} Franklin's mother, [[Sara Roosevelt|Sara Ann Delano]], opposed the union and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. "I know what pain I must have caused you," he wrote to his mother of his decision. But, he added, "I know my own mind, and known it for a long time, and know that I could never think otherwise."{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=79}} Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=79}} The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled to be in New York City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.{{sfn|de Kay|2012|p=32}}

The couple were married on March 17, 1905, in a wedding officiated by [[Endicott Peabody (educator)|Endicott Peabody]], the groom's headmaster at [[Groton School]].<ref name=1884ER /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/peabody-endicott.cfm |title=Endicott Peabody (1857–1944) |publisher=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project |access-date=November 24, 2012 |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908032320/http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/peabody-endicott.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref> Her cousin Corinne Douglas Robinson was a bridesmaid. Theodore Roosevelt's attendance at the ceremony was front-page news in ''The New York Times'' and other newspapers. When asked for his thoughts on the Roosevelt–Roosevelt union, the president said, "It is a good thing to keep the name in the family." The couple spent a preliminary honeymoon of one week at Hyde Park, then set up housekeeping in an apartment in New York. That summer they went on their formal [[honeymoon]], a three-month tour of Europe.{{sfn|de Kay|2012|p=37}}

Returning to the U.S., the newlyweds settled in a New York City house that was provided by Franklin's mother, as well as in a second residence at the family's estate overlooking the [[Hudson River]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. From the beginning, Roosevelt had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother-in-law. The townhouse that Sara gave to them was connected to her own residence by sliding doors, and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage. Early on, Roosevelt had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that "I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine, one that I had done nothing about and which did not represent the way I wanted to live", but little changed.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=51}} Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren, and Roosevelt reflected later that "Franklin's children were more my mother-in-law's children than they were mine".{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=179}} Roosevelt's eldest son James remembered Sara telling her grandchildren, "Your mother only bore you, I am more your mother than your mother is."{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=179}}

[[File:Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt with Anna and baby James, formal portrait in Hyde Park, New York 1908.jpg|thumb|Eleanor and Franklin with their first two children, 1908]]
Roosevelt and Franklin had six children:

* [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1906–1975)
* [[James Roosevelt|James Roosevelt II]] (1907–1991)
* Franklin Roosevelt (1909–1909)
* [[Elliott Roosevelt]] (1910–1990)
* [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.]] (1914–1988)
* [[John Aspinwall Roosevelt|John Aspinwall Roosevelt II]] (1916–1981)

Roosevelt disliked having sex with her husband. She once told her daughter Anna that it was an "ordeal to be borne".{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=52}} She also considered herself ill-suited to motherhood, later writing, "It did not come naturally to me to understand little children or to enjoy them".{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=179}}

In September 1918, Roosevelt was unpacking one of Franklin's suitcases when she discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, [[Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd|Lucy Mercer]]. He had been contemplating leaving his wife for Mercer. However, following pressure from his political advisor, [[Louis Howe]], and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|pp=81–83}} Their union from that point on was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Roosevelt again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=20}}

In August 1921, the family was vacationing at [[Campobello Island]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada, when Franklin was diagnosed with a [[Franklin D.

This proved a turning point in Roosevelt and Sara's long-running struggle, and as Eleanor's public role grew, she increasingly broke from Sara's control.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=118}}{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=133}} Tensions between Sara and Roosevelt over her new political friends rose to the point that the family constructed a cottage at [[Val-Kill]], in which Roosevelt and her guests lived when Franklin and the children were away from Hyde Park.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|pp=134–136}}{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=209}} Roosevelt herself named the place Val-Kill, loosely translated as "waterfall-stream"<ref name=NT>{{cite web| url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/eastern-region/val-kill.html |title=Val-Kill in Hyde Park, a NY |access-date=December 10, 2013 |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation}}</ref> from the Dutch language common to the [[Dutchess County, New York#Early settlement|original European settlers]] of the area. Franklin encouraged his wife to develop this property as a place where she could implement some of her ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when Roosevelt held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter [[Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves]] assisted her. She was close to her grandmother throughout her life. Seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes Roosevelt began and supported.

In 1924, she campaigned for Democrat [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]] in his successful re-election bid as governor of New York State against the Republican nominee, her first cousin [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.]]{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=131}} Theodore Jr. never forgave her. Eleanor's aunt, [[Bamie Roosevelt|Anna "Bamie" Roosevelt Cowles]], publicly broke with her after the election. She wrote to her niece, "I just hate to have Eleanor let herself look as she does. Though never handsome, she always had to me a charming effect, but alas and lackaday! Since politics have become her choicest interest all her charm has disappeared..."{{sfn|Rowley|2011|p=128}} Roosevelt dismissed Bamie's criticisms by referring to her as an "aged woman".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, Bamie and Roosevelt eventually reconciled.

Theodore's elder daughter [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice]] also broke with Roosevelt over her campaign. Alice and her aunt reconciled after the latter wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.

Roosevelt and her daughter [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna]] became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Roosevelt desperately wanted to go with her husband to [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.

Roosevelt's son Elliott authored numerous books, including a mystery series in which his mother was the detective. However, these murder mysteries were researched and written by William Harrington. They continued until Harrington's death in 2000, ten years after Elliott's death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Hansen|title=Enfant Terrible: The Times and Schemes of General Elliott Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMCjMQEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Able Baker Press|isbn=978-0-615-66892-5}}</ref> With James Brough, Elliot also wrote a highly personal book about his parents called ''The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story'', in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father's relationships with mistress Lucy Mercer and secretary [[Marguerite LeHand|Marguerite ("Missy") LeHand]],<ref name=nyt>''The New York Times'', obituary, October 28, 1990.</ref> as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father. Published in 1973, the biography also contains valuable insights into FDR's run for vice president, his rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly with the help of Louis Howe. When Elliott published this book in 1973, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. led the family's denunciation of him; the book was fiercely repudiated by all Elliot's siblings. Another of the siblings, James, published ''My Parents, a Differing View'' (with [[Bill Libby]], 1976), which was written in part as a response to Elliot's book. A sequel to ''An Untold Story'' with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled ''A Rendezvous With Destiny'', carried the Roosevelt saga to the end of World War II. ''Mother R.: Eleanor Roosevelt's Untold Story'', also with Brough, was published in 1977. ''Eleanor Roosevelt, with Love: A Centenary Remembrance'', came out in 1984.

In the 1930s, Roosevelt had a very close relationship with legendary aviator [[Amelia Earhart]]. One time, the two snuck out from the White House and went to a party dressed up for the occasion. After flying with Earhart, Roosevelt obtained a student permit but did not further pursue her plans to learn to fly. Franklin was not in favor of his wife becoming a pilot. Nevertheless, the two women communicated frequently throughout their lives.<ref>Glines, C.V. "'Lady Lindy': The Remarkable Life of Amelia Earhart." Aviation History, July 1997. p. 47.</ref>

Roosevelt also had a close relationship with [[Associated Press]] (AP) reporter [[Lorena Hickok]], who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and "fell madly in love with her".{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=221}} During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=2}} The letters included such endearments as, "I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth,"<ref name="Faber">Doris Faber, ''The Life of Lorena Hickok: E.R.'s Friend'', New York: William Morrow, 1980, p. 111</ref> and, "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!"<ref name="Charms of Eleanor">{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/09/charms-eleanor-roosevelt/?pagination=false |title=The Charms of Eleanor |author=Baker, Russell |work=The New York Review of Books |date=June 9, 2011 |access-date=November 22, 2012 |archive-date=October 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025035252/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/09/charms-eleanor-roosevelt/?pagination=false |url-status=live }}</ref> At [[First inauguration of Franklin D.

In the same years, Washington gossip linked Roosevelt romantically with New Deal administrator [[Harry Hopkins]], with whom she worked closely.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=88}} Roosevelt also had a close relationship with [[New York State Police]] sergeant [[Earl Miller (bodyguard)|Earl Miller]], who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=246–247}} Roosevelt was 44 years old when she met Miller, 32, in 1929. He became her friend as well as her official escort, teaching her different sports, such as diving and riding, and coached her in tennis. Biographer [[Blanche Wiesen Cook]] writes that Miller was Roosevelt's "first romantic involvement" in her middle years.{{sfn|Cook|1992|p=429}} [[Hazel Rowley]] concludes, "There is no doubt that Eleanor was in love with Earl for a time&nbsp;... But they are most unlikely to have had an 'affair'."{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=163}}

Roosevelt's friendship with Miller occurred at the same time that her husband had a rumored relationship with his secretary, Marguerite "Missy" LeHand.

Eleanor and Franklin were strong-willed people who cared greatly for each other's happiness but realized their own inability to provide for it."{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=347–348}} Roosevelt and Miller's relationship is said to have continued until her death in 1962.

====Anti-Semitism====
Eleanor Roosevelt in private showed a revulsion against rich Jews in 1918, telling her mother-in-law the "Jew party [was] appalling....I never wish to hear money, jewels or sables mentioned again.".<ref>{{cite book|author=Doris Kearns Goodwin|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin & Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQcMDdFC1QEC&pg=PA102|date= 2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=102}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Burns|title=Someone to Watch Over Me: A Portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt and the Tortured Father Who Shaped Her Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NU2DgAAQBAJ&pg=PT131|year=2017|publisher=Pegasus Books|page=131}}</ref> When she became co-owner of the Todhunter school in New York City, a limited number of Jews were admitted. Most students were upper-class Protestants, and Roosevelt said that the spirit of the school "would be different if we had too large a proportion of Jewish children." She said the problem is not just quantity but quality, since Jews were "very unlike ourselves" and had not yet become American enough. Her anti-Semitism gradually declined, especially as her friendship with [[Bernard Baruch]] grew.<ref>{{cite book|author=Blanche Wiesen Cook|title=Eleanor Roosevelt Volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9GLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA316|year=2000|publisher=Penguin |pages=316–317}}</ref> After World War II she became a staunch champion of Israel, which she admired for its commitment to New Deal values.<ref>Michelle Mart, "Eleanor Roosevelt, Liberalism, and Israel."

In the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]], Franklin was nominated as the running mate of Democratic presidential candidate [[James M. Cox]]. Roosevelt joined Franklin in touring the country, making her first campaign appearances.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|pp=94–95}} Cox was defeated by Republican [[Warren G. Harding]], who won with 404 electoral votes to 127.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=95}}

Following the onset of Franklin's paralytic illness in 1921, Roosevelt began serving as a stand-in for her incapacitated husband, making public appearances on his behalf, often carefully coached by Louis Howe.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=128}} She also started working with the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTUL), raising funds in support of the union's goals: a 48-hour workweek, [[minimum wage]], and the abolition of [[child labor]].<ref name=pulitzer/> Throughout the 1920s, Roosevelt became increasingly influential as a leader in the New York State Democratic Party while Franklin used her contacts among Democratic women to strengthen his standing with them, winning their committed support for the future.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=128}} In 1924, she campaigned for Democrat [[Al Smith|Alfred E. Smith]] in his successful re-election bid as governor of New York State against the Republican nominee and her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=131}} Franklin had spoken out on Theodore's "wretched record" as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the [[Teapot Dome scandal]], and in return, Theodore said of him, "He's a maverick! He does not wear the brand of our family," which infuriated her. She dogged Theodore on the New York State campaign trail in a car fitted with a ''[[papier-mâché]]'' bonnet shaped like a giant teapot that was made to emit simulated steam (to remind voters of Theodore's supposed, but later disproved, connections to the scandal), and countered his speeches with those of her own, calling him immature.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/smith-al.cfm|title=Al Smith|publisher=[[George Washington University]]|access-date=May 27, 2008}}{{cite web|url=http://www.booknotes.org/FullPage.aspx?SID=58674-1|title=C-SPAN Booknotes: Peter Collier: The Roosevelts: An American Saga [program transcript]|date=August 7, 1994|access-date=September 18, 2014}}</ref> She would later decry these methods, admitting that they were below her dignity but saying that they had been contrived by Democratic Party "dirty tricksters." Theodore was defeated by 105,000 votes, and he never forgave her. By 1928, Roosevelt was promoting Smith's candidacy for president and Franklin's nomination as the Democratic Party's candidate for governor of New York, succeeding Smith. Although Smith lost the presidential race, Franklin won and the Roosevelts moved into the governor's mansion in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], New York.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|pp=147–51}} During Franklin's term as governor, Roosevelt traveled widely in the state to make speeches and inspect state facilities on his behalf, reporting her findings to him at the end of each trip.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=26}}

In 1927, she joined friends Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook in buying the [[Todhunter School]] for Girls, a finishing school which also offered college preparatory courses, in New York City. At the school, Roosevelt taught upper-level courses in American literature and history, emphasizing independent thought, current events, and social engagement. She continued to teach three days a week while FDR served as governor, but was forced to leave teaching after his election as president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/todhunter-school.cfm |title=Todhunter School |publisher=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project |access-date=November 26, 2012 |archive-date=February 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206181817/http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/todhunter-school.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=12}}

Also in 1927, she established Val-Kill Industries with Cook, Dickerman, and [[Caroline Love Goodwin O'Day|Caroline O'Day]], three friends she met through her activities in the Women's Division of the New York State Democratic Party. It was located on the banks of a stream that flowed through the Roosevelt family estate in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Roosevelt and her business partners financed the construction of a small factory to provide supplemental income for local farming families who would make furniture, pewter, and homespun cloth using traditional craft methods. Capitalizing on the popularity of the [[Colonial Revival]], most Val-Kill products were modeled on eighteenth-century forms. Roosevelt promoted Val-Kill through interviews and public appearances. Val-Kill Industries never became the subsistence program that Roosevelt and her friends imagined, but it did pave the way for larger [[New Deal]] initiatives during Franklin's presidential administration. Cook's failing health and pressures from the [[Great Depression]] compelled the women to dissolve the partnership in 1938, at which time Roosevelt converted the shop buildings into a cottage at [[Val-Kill]], that eventually became her permanent residence after Franklin died in 1945. Otto Berge acquired the contents of the factory and the use of the Val-Kill name to continue making colonial-style furniture until he retired in 1975. In 1977, Roosevelt's cottage at Val-Kill and its surrounding property of 181 acres (0.73 km2),<ref name=OldHouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldhouseweb.com/architecture-and-design/val-kill.shtml|title=Val-Kill|publisher=The Old House Web|access-date=December 30, 2015}}</ref> was formally designated by an act of Congress as the [[Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site]], "to commemorate for the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future generations the life and work of an outstanding woman in American history."<ref name=OldHouse/>

==First Lady of the United States (1933–1945)==
[[File:1940-05-22 Mrs Roosevelt In Red Cross Appeal.ogv|thumb|left|Roosevelt making an appeal for the [[Red Cross]], May 22, 1940]]
Roosevelt became [[First Lady of the United States]] when Franklin was inaugurated on March 4, 1933. Having known all of the twentieth century's previous First Ladies, she was seriously depressed at having to assume the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=89–91}} Her immediate predecessor, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], had ended her feminist activism on becoming First Lady, stating her intention to be only a "backdrop for [[Herbert Hoover|Bertie]]."{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=19}} Eleanor's distress at these precedents was severe enough that Hickok subtitled her biography of Roosevelt "Reluctant First Lady".{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=1}}

With support from Howe and Hickok, Roosevelt set out to redefine the position. According to her biographer [[Blanche Wiesen Cook]], she became "the most controversial First Lady in United States history" in the process.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=1}} Despite criticism of them both, with her husband's strong support she continued with the active business and speaking agenda she had begun before assuming the role of First Lady in an era when few married women had careers. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences and in 1940 became the first to speak at a national party convention.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=10, 133}} She also wrote a daily and widely syndicated newspaper column, "[[My Day]]", another first for a presidential spouse.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=10}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/eleanor-my-day/ |title=Primary Resources: My Day, Key Events |work=American Experience |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028040828/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/eleanor-my-day/ |url-status=live }}</ref> She was also the first First Lady to write a monthly magazine column and to host a weekly radio show.<ref name="firstladies1">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/facinatingfacts.aspx |title=Little-known facts about our First Ladies |publisher=Firstladies.org |access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref>

In the first year of her husband's administration, Roosevelt was determined to match his presidential salary, and she earned $75,000 from her lectures and writing, most of which she gave to charity.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=3}} By 1941, she was receiving lecture fees of $1,000,{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=209}} and was made an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] at one of her lectures to celebrate her achievements.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brody|first=J.

Roosevelt maintained a heavy travel schedule in her twelve years in the White House, frequently making personal appearances at labor meetings to assure Depression-era workers that the White House was mindful of their plight. In one famous cartoon of the time from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine (June 3, 1933), satirizing a visit she had made to a mine, an astonished coal miner, peering down a dark tunnel, says to a co-worker, "For gosh sakes, here comes Mrs. Roosevelt!"<ref name="amex-1">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/eleanor-transcript/ |title=Transcript: Eleanor Roosevelt |work=American Experience |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-date=October 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026003056/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/eleanor-transcript/ |url-status=live |quote=Eleanor's visit to a mine was satirized in a famous cartoon.

In early 1933, the "[[Bonus Army]]", a protest group of World War I veterans, marched on Washington for the second time in two years, calling for their veteran bonus certificates to be awarded early. The previous year, President Hoover had ordered them dispersed, and the US Army cavalry charged and bombarded the veterans with tear gas.<ref name="SM">{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/marching.html?c=y&story=fullstory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126010101/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history%2Darchaeology/marching.html?c%3Dy%26story%3Dfullstory|title=Marching on History |author1=Dickson, Paul |author2=Allen, Thomas B. |date=February 2003 |work=Smithsonian Magazine |access-date=November 26, 2012 |archive-date=November 26, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> This time, Roosevelt visited the veterans at their muddy campsite, listening to their concerns and singing army songs with them.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=46}} The meeting defused the tension between the veterans and the administration, and one of the marchers later commented, "Hoover sent the Army.

===American Youth Congress and National Youth Administration===
The [[American Youth Congress]] was formed in 1935 to advocate for [[youth rights]] in U.S. politics, and it was responsible for introducing the ''American Youth Bill of Rights'' to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC eventually led to the formation of the [[National Youth Administration]], a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/119.html |title=Records of the National Youth Administration [NYA&#93; |publisher=Archives.gov |date= August 15, 2016|access-date=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA014.html |title=OHS Publications Division |publisher=Digital.library.okstate.edu |access-date=August 31, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102040611/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA014.html |archive-date=January 2, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/american-youth-congress.htm|title=American Youth Congress|date=October 19, 2007|website=Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019032029/http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/american-youth-congress.htm|archive-date=October 19, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=August 23, 2019}}</ref> The NYA was headed by [[Aubrey Willis Williams]], a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and [[Harry Hopkins]]. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/nya.cfm|title=National Youth Administration|website=Teaching Eleanor Roosevelt Glossary}}</ref> In 1939 the [[HUAC|Dies Committee]] subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the [[Young Communist League]]. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. [[Joseph P. Lash]] was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] but all [[dictatorship]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15918|title=Franklin D.

===Arthurdale===
Roosevelt's chief project during her husband's first two terms was the establishment of a [[planned community]] in [[Arthurdale, West Virginia]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=85}}{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=132}} On August 18, 1933, at Hickok's urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], who had been [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklisted]] following union activities.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=130–31}} Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by [[subsistence farming]], handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=132}} She hoped the project could become a model for "a new kind of community" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=137}} Her husband enthusiastically supported the project.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=132}}

After an initial, disastrous experiment with [[Prefabricated home|prefab houses]], construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt's specifications, this time with "every modern convenience", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=85}}{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=135–136}} Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white [[Christians]]. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and [[Jewish]] miners.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=139–140}} The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of [[racial discrimination]].{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=152}}

Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=141}} However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a "communist plot", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=143–144}} [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=135}} Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss.<ref name="A">{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/arthurdale.cfm |title=Arthurdale |publisher=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project |access-date=November 26, 2012 |archive-date=September 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907164728/http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/arthurdale.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=151}} Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=85–86}} However, the residents considered the town a "[[utopia]]" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency.<ref name=A /> Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, "I don't know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars. But I do."{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=151}}

===Civil rights activism===
[[File:ChiefAnderson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Roosevelt flying with [[Tuskegee Airman]] Charles "Chief" Anderson in March 1941]]
During Franklin's administration, Roosevelt became an important connection to the African-American population in the era of segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Roosevelt was vocal in her support of the [[civil rights movement]]. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief money. Roosevelt became one of the only voices in her husband's administration insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=162–163}}

Roosevelt also broke with tradition by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=163}} In 1936 she became aware of conditions at the National Training School for Girls, a predominantly black reform school once located in the [[The Palisades, Washington, D.C.|Palisades]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C. {{sfn|Cook|1999|p=358}} She visited the school, wrote about it in her "My Day" column, lobbied for additional funding, and pressed for changes in staffing and curriculum. Her White House invitation to the students became an issue in Franklin's 1936 re-election campaign.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media: A Public Quest for Fulfillment|last=Beasley|first=Maureen Hoffman|year=1987|pages=102}}</ref> When the black singer [[Marian Anderson]] was denied the use of Washington's [[Constitution Hall]] by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] in 1939, Roosevelt resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]].<ref name="amex-1"/> Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner.{{sfn|Beasley|1986|p=68}} Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the [[Federal Council of Negro Affairs|Division of Negro Affairs]] of the [[National Youth Administration]].{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=159}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/eleanor-bethune/ |title=Mary McLeod Bethune |publisher=American Experience |access-date=November 28, 2012 |archive-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121121003/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/eleanor-bethune/ |url-status=live }}</ref> To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House, Roosevelt would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=161}}

She was involved by being "the eyes and the ears"<ref>{{cite book|last1=DuBois|first1=Ellen Carol|title=Through Women Eyes|date=2012|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-67607-0|page=566|edition=2}}</ref> of the New Deal. She looked to the future and was committed to social reform. One of those programs helped working women receive better wages. The New Deal also placed women into less machine work and more white-collar work. Women did not have to work in the factories making war supplies because men were coming home so they could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts. Roosevelt brought unprecedented activism and ability to the role of the First Lady.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dumenil|first1=Lynn|title=Through Women's Eyes|date=2012|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-67607-0|edition=2}}</ref>

In contrast to her usual support of African-American rights, the "[[sundown town]]" [[Eleanor, West Virginia|Eleanor]], in West Virginia, was named for her and was established in 1934 when she and Franklin visited the county and developed it as a test site for families. As a "sundown town", like other Franklin Roosevelt towns around the nation (such as [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]], [[Greenhills, Ohio|Greenhills]], [[Greendale, Wisconsin|Greendale]], [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], or [[Norris, Tennessee|Norris]]), it was for whites only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/us/25eleanor.html|title=From New Deal to New Hard Times, Eleanor Endures|last=Barry|first=Dan|work=The New York Times|date=December 24, 2009|access-date=November 28, 2011}}</ref> It was established as a New Deal project.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kenny|first=Hamill|title=West Virginia Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning, Including the Nomenclature of the Streams and Mountains|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015009099824;view=1up;seq=252;size=125|year=1945|publisher=The Place Name Press|location=Piedmont, WV|page=224}}</ref>

Roosevelt lobbied behind the scenes for the 1934 [[Costigan-Wagner Bill]] to make [[lynching]] a federal crime, including arranging a meeting between Franklin and [[NAACP]] president [[Walter Francis White]].{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=179–181, 243–247}} Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=188, 245}} In 1942, Roosevelt worked with activist [[Pauli Murray]] to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of [[sharecropper]] [[Odell Waller]], convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin sent a letter to Virginia Governor [[Colgate Darden]] urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=351–354}}

Roosevelt's support of African-American rights made her an unpopular figure among whites in the South. Rumors spread of "Eleanor Clubs" formed by servants to oppose their employers and "Eleanor Tuesdays" on which African-American men would knock down white women on the street, though no evidence has ever been found of either practice.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=370–71, 522}} When [[Detroit race riot of 1943|race riots broke out in Detroit in June 1943]], critics in both the North and South wrote that Roosevelt was to blame.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=445–46}} At the same time, she grew so popular among African-Americans, previously a reliable Republican voting bloc, that they became a consistent base of support for the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=164–65}}

Following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt spoke out against [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|Japanese-American prejudice]], warning against the "great hysteria against minority groups."{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=296}} She also privately opposed her husband's [[Executive Order 9066]], which required Japanese-Americans in many areas of the U.S. to enter [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=323}} She was widely criticized for her defense of Japanese-American citizens, including a call by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that she be "forced to retire from public life" over her stand on the issue.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=297}}

===Norvelt===
On May 21, 1937, Roosevelt visited Westmoreland Homesteads to mark the arrival of the community's final homesteader. Accompanying her on the trip was the wife of [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], the president's [[Secretary of the Treasury]].<ref name="Pittsburgh Trib2">{{cite news| url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_461850.html| work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review| title=Homesteaders' Descendants Recall 'Old' Norvelt| date=July 14, 2006| access-date=February 17, 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> "I am no believer in paternalism.

But cooperative communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, she went on, offered an alternative to "our rather settled ideas" that could "provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [depression] in the future." Residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor. (The new town name, [[Norvelt, Pennsylvania|Norvelt]], was a combination of the last syllables in her names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.)<ref name="explorepahistory.com">{{cite news| url=http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-2D6| work=explorepahistory.com | title=Norvelt Historical Marker| access-date=February 17, 2012}}</ref> The Norvelt firefighter's hall is also named Roosevelt Hall in honor of her.<ref name="Pittsburgh Trib2"/>

Roosevelt was an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady who made far more use of the media than her predecessors; she held 348 press conferences over the span of her husband's 12-year presidency.{{sfn|Beasley|1986|p=67}} Inspired by her relationship with Hickok, Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them. She relaxed the rule only once, on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip.<ref name="NFFL">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=33 |title=First Lady Biography: Eleanor Roosevelt |publisher=The National First Ladies Library |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113073022/http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=33 |url-status=live }}</ref> Because the [[Gridiron Club]] banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which she called "Gridiron Widows". {{sfn|Cook|1999|p=47}} She was interviewed by many newspapers; the [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] journalist [[Iris Kelso]] described Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.wpcf.org/oralhistory/kelsoint.html|title=Iris Turner Kelso: Introduction|publisher=beta.wpcf.org|access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref> In the early days of her all-female press conferences, she said they would not address "politics, legislation, or executive decision",<ref>"Press Conferences for Mrs. Roosevelt." ''Trenton (NJ) Daily Times'', February 26, 1933, p. 7.</ref> since the role of the First Lady was expected to be non-political at that time. She also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures. Still, the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with the First Lady, access that had been unavailable in previous administrations.<ref>"First Lady Charms Women News Writers, Says Visitor."

[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Shirley Temple - NARA - 195615.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt with [[Shirley Temple]] in 1938]]
Just before Franklin assumed the presidency in February 1933, Roosevelt published an editorial in the ''Women's Daily News'' that conflicted so sharply with his intended public spending policies that he published a rejoinder in the following issue.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=11}} On entering the White House, she signed a contract with the magazine ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' to provide a monthly column, in which she answered mail sent to her by readers; the feature was canceled in 1936 as another presidential election approached.{{sfn|Beasley|1986|p=71–72}} She continued her articles in other venues, publishing more than sixty articles in national magazines during her tenure as First Lady.{{sfn|Beasley|1986|p=72}} Roosevelt also began a syndicated newspaper column, titled "My Day", which appeared six days a week from 1936 to her death in 1962.{{sfn|Cook|1999|p=47}} In the column, she wrote about her daily activities but also her humanitarian concerns.{{sfn|Beasley|1986|p=69}} Hickok and [[George T.

Beasley has argued that Roosevelt's publications, which often dealt with women's issues and invited reader responses, represented a conscious attempt to use journalism "to overcome social isolation" for women by making "public communication a two-way channel".{{sfn|Beasley|1986|p=66, 73}}

Roosevelt also made extensive use of radio. She was not the first First Lady to broadcast—her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had done that already. But Hoover did not have a regular radio program, whereas Roosevelt did. She first broadcast her own programs of radio commentary beginning on July 9, 1934.<ref>"Movies Discussed by Mrs. Roosevelt." ''New York Times'', July 10, 1934, p. 19.</ref> On that first show, she talked about the effect of movies on children, the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence, and her opinion about the recent [[1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star baseball game]]. She also read a commercial from a mattress company, which sponsored the broadcast. She said she would not accept any salary for being on the air, and that she would donate the amount ($3,000) to charity.<ref>"Unofficially, Mrs. Roosevelt Discusses Sundry Subjects.

On May 10, 1940, [[Battle of Belgium|Germany invaded Belgium]], [[Invasion of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], marking the end of the relatively conflict-free "[[Phoney War]]" phase of [[World War II]]. As the U.S. began to move toward war footing, Roosevelt found herself again depressed, fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs. She briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the [[Red Cross]], but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the president's wife be captured as a [[prisoner of war]].{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=82–83}} She soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=98–101}} She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of [[fifth column]]ists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=102–103}} Roosevelt successfully secured political refugee status for eighty-three Jewish refugees from the [[SS Quanza|S.S.

Roosevelt was also active on the [[United States home front during World War II|home front]]. Beginning in 1941, she co-chaired the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] (OCD) with New York City Mayor [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia]], working to give civilian volunteers expanded roles in war preparations.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=280–81}} She soon found herself in a power struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while she saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=323–24}} Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941, Roosevelt was forced to resign following anger in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] over high salaries for several OCD appointments, including two of her close friends.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=324–326}}

Also in 1941, the short film ''[[Women in Defense]]'', written by Roosevelt, was released. It was produced by the [[Office of Emergency Management]] and briefly outlines the way in which women could help prepare the country for the possibility of war. There is also a segment on the types of costumes women would wear while engaged in war work. At the end of the film, the narrator explains women are vital to securing a healthy American home life and raising children "which has always been the first line of defense".

In October 1942, Roosevelt toured England, visiting with American troops and inspecting British forces. Her visits drew enormous crowds and received almost unanimously favorable press in both England and America.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=379–84}} In August 1943, she visited American troops in the South Pacific on a morale-building tour, of which Admiral [[William Halsey Jr.]] later said, "she alone accomplished more good than any other person, or any groups of civilians, who had passed through my area."{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=465}} For her part, Roosevelt was left shaken and deeply depressed by seeing the war's carnage.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=467–68}} A number of Congressional Republicans criticized her for using scarce wartime resources for her trip, prompting Franklin to suggest that she take a break from traveling.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=467}}

Roosevelt supported increased roles for women and African-Americans in the war effort, and began to advocate for women to be given factory jobs a year before it became a widespread practice.<ref>Herman, Arthur. ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II,'' pp. 260, 272, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-6964-4}}</ref>{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=364}} In 1942, she urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades, saying: "if I were of a debutante age I would go into a factory–any factory where I could learn a skill and be useful."{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=365}} Roosevelt learned of the high rate of absenteeism among working mothers, and she campaigned for government-sponsored day care.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=413–16}} She notably supported the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] in their successful effort to become the first black combat pilots, visiting the [[Tuskegee Army Air Field|Tuskegee Air Corps Advanced Flying School]] in [[Alabama]]. She also flew with African-American chief civilian instructor [[C. Alfred "Chief" Anderson]]. Anderson had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots; he took her on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redtail.org/the-tuskegee-airmen/silver-wings-civil-rights/|title=Mrs. Roosevelt Goes for a Ride – Red Tail Squadron|work=Red Tail Squadron|access-date=July 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917062006/http://www.redtail.org/the-tuskegee-airmen/silver-wings-civil-rights/|archive-date=September 17, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> After landing, she cheerfully announced, "Well, you can fly all right."<ref name="Moye pp. 52–54">Moye, J.

==Years after the White House==
Franklin died on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the [[Little White House]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]]. Roosevelt later learned that her husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd) had been with him when he died,<ref name=Lash929>Lash, pp. 929–930.</ref> a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd.{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=632}} It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Rutherfurd when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from his wife. After the funeral, Roosevelt temporarily returned to Val-Kill.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=288}} Franklin left instructions for her in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After Franklin's death, she moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at the Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to the Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=289}} The [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum]] opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future [[presidential libraries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/library/history.html |title=History of the FDR Library and Museum |publisher=Franklin D.

In December 1945, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appointed Roosevelt as a delegate to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=294}} In April 1946, she became the first chairperson of the preliminary [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=31}} Roosevelt remained chairperson when the commission was established on a permanent basis in January 1947.{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=33}} Along with [[René Cassin]], [[John Peters Humphrey]] and others, she played an instrumental role in drafting the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).

In a speech on the night of September 28, 1948, Roosevelt spoke in favor of the Declaration, calling it "the international [[Magna Carta]] of all men everywhere".{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=170}} The Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948. The vote was unanimous, with eight abstentions: six [[Soviet Bloc]] countries as well as South Africa and Saudi Arabia. Roosevelt attributed the abstention of the Soviet bloc nations to Article 13, which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries.{{sfn|Glendon|2001|p=169–70}}

Roosevelt supported reformers trying to overthrow the Irish machine [[Tammany Hall]], and some Catholics called her [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States#Eleanor Roosevelt|anti-Catholic]].

She was an early supporter of the [[Encampment for Citizenship]], a non-profit organization that conducts residential summer programs with year-round follow-up for young people of widely diverse backgrounds and nations. She routinely hosted encampment workshops at her Hyde Park estate, and when the program was attacked as "socialistic" by [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] forces in the early 1950s, she vigorously defended it.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In 1954, Tammany Hall boss [[Carmine DeSapio]] led the effort to defeat Roosevelt's son, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.]], in the election for [[New York Attorney General]]. Roosevelt grew increasingly disgusted with DeSapio's political conduct through the rest of the 1950s. Eventually, she would join with her old friends [[Herbert Lehman]] and [[Thomas Finletter]] to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.<ref>Beasley, ''Eleanor Roosevelt Encyclopedia'', p. 276.</ref>

Roosevelt was disappointed when President Truman backed New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]]—a close associate of DeSapio—for the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination. She supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956, and urged his renomination in 1960.{{sfn|Rowley|2010|p=297}} She resigned from her UN post in 1953, when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] became president. She addressed the [[Democratic National Convention]] in 1952 and 1956. Although she had reservations about [[John F. Kennedy]] for his failure to condemn [[McCarthyism]], she supported him for president against [[Richard Nixon]]. Kennedy later reappointed her to the United Nations, where she served again from 1961 to 1962, and to the National Advisory Committee of the [[Peace Corps]].<ref name=NFFL/>

By the 1950s, Roosevelt's international role as spokesperson for women led her to stop publicly criticizing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, [[Esther Peterson]], proposed a new [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]]. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position.<ref>A portion of a verbal presentation by Judith Nies on [[Book TV]] June 19, 2008 concerning her autobiography, ''The Girl I Left Behind''</ref> She died just before the commission issued its report.

''Eleanor Roosevelt Encyclopedia'' pp. 164–65.</ref>

Throughout the 1950s, Roosevelt embarked on countless national and international speaking engagements. She continued to pen her newspaper column and made appearances on television and radio broadcasts. She averaged one hundred fifty lectures a year throughout the 1950s, many devoted to her activism on behalf of the United Nations.<ref>Critical Lives: Eleanor Roosevelt p. 242</ref>

===Recognition and awards===
[[File:Eleanor-Roosevelt-WH-Portrait.jpg|thumb|This 1949 portrait of Roosevelt by Douglas Chandor was purchased by the White House in 1966.]]

Roosevelt lived in a stone cottage at Val-Kill, which was two miles east of the Springwood Estate. The cottage had been her home after the death of her husband and was the only residence she had ever personally owned.<ref name=OldHouse/> In 1977, the home was formally designated by an act of Congress as the [[Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site]], "to commemorate for the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future generations the life and work of an outstanding woman in American history."<ref name=OldHouse/> In 1998, [[Save America's Treasures]] (SAT) announced Val-Kill cottage as a new official project. SAT's involvement led to the Honoring Eleanor Roosevelt (HER) project, initially run by private volunteers and now a part of SAT. The HER project has since raised almost $1&nbsp;million, which has gone toward restoration and development efforts at Val-Kill and the production of ''Eleanor Roosevelt: Close to Home'', a documentary about Roosevelt at Val-Kill. Due in part to the success of these programs, Val-Kill was given a $75,000 grant and named one of 12 sites showcased in ''Restore America: A Salute to Preservation'', a partnership between SAT, the [[National Trust]] and [[HGTV]].<ref name="NT"/> The [[Roosevelt Study Center]], a research institute, conference center, and library on twentieth-century American history located in the twelfth-century [[Abbey of Middelburg]], the Netherlands, opened in 1986.
