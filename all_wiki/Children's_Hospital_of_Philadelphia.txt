==History==

=== First hospital 1855–66 ===
In 1855, [[Philadelphia]] had a population of about 460,000, and recorded 10,507 deaths. Leading causes of death were [[smallpox]], [[typhoid]], and [[scarlet fever]]. In the worst month of 1855, 300 children under 12 years old died, primarily of [[infectious disease]]s. A Philadelphia physician, Dr. Francis West Lewis, inspired by a visit to the new [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]]<ref name=":1" /> for Sick Children in [[London]] (founded 1852), enlisted Drs. T. Hewson Bache and R. A. F. Penrose Sr. to found the first [[children's hospital]] in North America.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Records, 1855 - 2006|url=http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/pacscl/detail.html?id=PACSCL_CPP_MSS601401|access-date=2020-11-20|website=dla.library.upenn.edu}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chop.edu/about-us/about|title=About the About Children's Hospital of Philadelphia|last=Philadelphia|first=The Children's Hospital of|website=www.chop.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14|archive-date=2019-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509065529/https://www.chop.edu/about-us/about|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 23, 1855, the following small advertisement appeared in the ''[[Philadelphia Public Ledger]]'':<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Bell|first=Madeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXscCgAAQBAJ&q=The+Children%27s+Hospital%E2%80%94located+on+Blight+Street%2C+running+from+Pine+to+Lombard%2C+below+Broad%2C+is+now+open+for+the+reception+of+Patients.+Children+suffering+from+Acute+Diseases+and+Accidents+will+be+received+free+of+charge.+A+dispensary%2C+for+sick+children%2C+is+also+attached+to+the+Hospital+and+will+be+open+at+the+same+place+every+day%2C+%28Sundays+excepted+from+11+to+12+o%27clock%2C+when+advice+and+medicine+will+be+given+free+of+charge.%29&pg=PA9|title=The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia|date=2015-07-13|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-4396-5220-6|language=en}}</ref>

<blockquote>The Children's Hospital—located on Blight Street, running from Pine to Lombard, below Broad, is now open for the reception of Patients. Children suffering from Acute Diseases and Accidents will be received free of charge. A [[dispensary]], for sick children, is also attached to the Hospital and will be open at the same place every day, (Sundays excepted from 11 to 12 o'clock, when advice and medicine will be given free of charge.)</blockquote>

The first location of the original Children's Hospital was a small building on Blight Street (now Watts St). The hospital consisted of 12 beds and a [[dispensary]]. That year they recorded 67 inpatient admissions and 306 outpatient visits.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Athreya|first=Balu|date=2014-10-11|title=History of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)|url=https://aap.confex.com/aap/2014/webprogrampress/Paper23878.html|language=en|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

===Second hospital 1866–1916===
Children's Hospital was relocated to 22nd Street between Locust and Walnut Sts after the [[American Civil War]]. This hospital consisted of 35 beds and a [[dispensary]]. The second hospital was the site of the first surgery at CHOP which was first performed by 1870. In addition, the first [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] physician at CHOP was appointed in 1873 and formal medical teaching in medical and surgical clinics began in 1877.<ref name=":5" />

Early on in CHOP's history, a long-term care ("convalescent") facility was opened as a County Branch near Overbrook. In 1899 the County Branch convalescent facility was closed and the program and patients transferred to the Seashore House near Atlantic City, New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Children's Seashore House {{!}} CHOP Research Institute|url=https://www.research.chop.edu/about/locations/childrens-seashore-house|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926060447/https://www.research.chop.edu/about/locations/childrens-seashore-house|archive-date=2020-09-26|access-date=2020-02-14|website=www.research.chop.edu}}</ref> CHOP later underwent an expansion and capacity was increased to 94 beds by 1892.
* A nursing school, the Ingersoll Training School, was opened in 1894.
* In 1900 the Catherwood Milk Laboratory was established.
* In 1914 the first Department for the Prevention of Disease in the nation was established.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bell|first=Madeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6X0CQAAQBAJ&q=In+1914+the+first+Department+for+the+Prevention+of+Disease+in+the+nation+was+established.&pg=PA75|title=Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The|date=2015|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-1-4671-2284-9|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14|archive-date=2020-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926060438/https://books.google.com/books?id=q6X0CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=In+1914+the+first+Department+for+the+Prevention+of+Disease+in+the+nation+was+established.&source=bl&ots=_sWH6pUkZT&sig=ACfU3U2RHZ3JG4bOcGuLTCYyGezJ1LE-xQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjbmJ_4w9HnAhVKMt8KHf8LA5AQ6AEwC3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=In%201914%20the%20first%20Department%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Disease%20in%20the%20nation%20was%20established.&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Third hospital 1916–74===
Construction adjacent to the second hospital began in 1913 and the first unit was opened in 1916 extending toward 18th and Bainbridge Streets.

In 1919 the hospital became affiliated with the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]. The affiliation became steadily closer over the next 17 years, with the Children's Hospital becoming identical to the pediatric department of the school of medicine, with most of the attending physicians appointed jointly to both institutions.
* In 1925 the hospital became affiliated with the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic.
* Whooping cough ([[pertussis]]) vaccine was first developed.
* The first formal allocation of funds to research was recorded in 1937.
* The first closed incubator for newborns was used.
* The nursing school was disbanded in 1945 and converted into an affiliate training center.
* A six-story research building next to the hospital was dedicated in 1954.
* In 1962 under Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]] (later to be [[Surgeon General]]), the first [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU) in the nation was opened, along with a new neonatal surgical unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chop.edu/news/chop-community-saddened-c-everett-koops-death|title=CHOP Community Saddened by C.

* In 1965 the first home care program for children was established.
* A Clinical Research Center under the auspices of the [[National Institutes of Health]] was opened in 1965.
In 1967, after years of lobbying hospital physician and anesthesiologist, Dr. John Downes finally opened up a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at CHOP, the first of its kind in the United States. Downes was inspired by pediatric and adult intensive care units in Europe and wanted to open a state-of-the-art unit in Philadelphia to care for the sickest of children. Before the creation of a PICU at CHOP, children who required advanced care were often cared for on the surgery wards and recovery rooms. Most of these children were cared for by anesthesiologists in the recovery room.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mai|first1=Christine L.|last2=Schreiner|first2=Mark S.|last3=Firth|first3=Paul G.|last4=Yaster|first4=Myron|date=2013|title=The development of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: an interview with Dr. John J.

===Fourth hospital 1974–present===
Construction of the new hospital at a new site on the west side of the [[Schuylkill River]] at 34th Street and Civic Center Boulevard, adjacent to the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], was begun in 1969 and the first building was opened in 1974.  This present Children's Hospital complex occupies part of the site of the old Philadelphia General Hospital and [[Blockley Almshouse]].
* A helicopter transport system for critically ill and injured children was inaugurated in 1973.
* CHOP celebrated its 150th anniversary on November 18, 2005.

Milestones and advances in pediatric care pioneered at CHOP include the first formal medical training in [[pediatrics]], techniques for the correction of [[Congenital heart disease|congenital heart malformations]], [[Incubator (neonatal)|incubators]] for [[NICU|newborn intensive care]], home [[ventilator]] care, and [[vaccine]] development.

The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is in Philadelphia's University City neighborhood, and since 2001 has been undergoing a $1.5 billion expansion that has doubled the hospital's size, while also building more than one million square feet of new research and outpatient facilities on a large, eight-acre site south of the main hospital on Civic Center Boulevard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://structuretone.com/projects/the-childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-master-plan-expansion/|title=The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Master Plan Expansion|website=Structure Tone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14|archive-date=2020-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926060423/https://structuretone.com/projects/childrens-hospital-philadelphia-expansion/|url-status=live}}</ref>  The South Campus expansion includes the eleven-story Colket Translational Research Building, which provides lab space for the Center for Childhood Cancer Research and the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedp.com/article/2001/05/chop_announces_plans_for_650_million_expansion|title=CHOP announces plans for $650 million expansion|last=Richards|first=Gregory|website=www.thedp.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-14|archive-date=2020-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926060424/https://www.thedp.com/article/2001/05/chop_announces_plans_for_650_million_expansion|url-status=live}}</ref> The new South Campus also includes an underground parking garage and an ambulatory care building with outpatient services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=159681&TICK=CHOP&STORY=/www/story/09-17-2008/0004887394&EDATE=Sep+17,+2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813141106/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/micro_stories.pl?ACCT=159681&TICK=CHOP&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F09-17-2008%2F0004887394&EDATE=Sep+17%2C+2008|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 August 2011|title=Children's Hospital - Press Room|date=13 August 2011|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref>

This South Campus expansion adjoins the University of Pennsylvania Health System's construction of the [[Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine]] and Roberts Proton Therapy Center.

On July 1, 2015, Madeline Bell, previously CHOP's president and chief operating officer, became president and chief executive officer. She succeeded Steven M. Altschuler, MD, who retired after 15 years as CEO. The board of trustees of Children's Hospital made the announcement on May 14.<ref>{{cite web|title=Madeline Bell is CHOP's New CEO|url=http://www.chop.edu/news/madeline-bell-chops-new-ceo|website=CHOP.edu|publisher=The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia|access-date=1 Jul 2015|archive-date=2 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002184606/http://www.chop.edu/news/madeline-bell-chops-new-ceo|url-status=live}}</ref>
