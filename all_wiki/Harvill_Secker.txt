'''Harvill Secker''' is a British publishing company formed in 2005 from the merger of '''Secker & Warburg''' and the '''Harvill Press'''.

==History==

===Secker & Warburg===
Secker & Warburg was formed in 1935 from a takeover of [[Martin Secker]], which was in receivership, by [[Fredric Warburg]] and [[Roger Senhouse]]. The firm became renowned for its political stance, being both [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] and [[anti-communist]], a position that put them at loggerheads with the ethos of many intellectuals of the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} 

When [[George Orwell]] parted company with [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]] sympathizer [[Victor Gollancz]] over his editing of ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' (1937), he took his next book ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' to Secker & Warburg, who published it in 1938. They also published, after 18 months of rejections and setbacks, ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945), and Orwell's subsequent books.<ref name="In Front of Your Nose">Orwell, Sonia, and Ian Angus (eds), ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 4: In Front of Your Nose (1945–1950)''. Penguin, 1970.</ref> Orwell and Warburg later became intimate friends.

Secker & Warburg published other books by key figures of the [[anti-Stalinist left]], such as ''[[Minty Alley]], [[World Revolution (book)|World Revolution]]'', and ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' by [[C. L. R. James]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/james/wrevintr.htm|author=Al Richardson| title=Introduction to 'World Revolution 1917–1936' by C.L.R. James|work=marxists.org}}</ref> [[Rudolf Rocker]] and [[Boris Souvarine]],<ref>[http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~hou00034#hou00034f2735 Harvard University Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901141829/http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~hou00034#hou00034f2735 |date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref> as well as works by [[Lewis Mumford]].

In February 1941 the company launched a series of "long pamphlets" or "short books" called [[Searchlight Books]], edited by George Orwell and [[T. R. Fyvel]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Searchlight Books and the Quest for a 'People's War', 1941–42 |author=David R. Costello |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=24 |issue=2 |date=April 1989 |pages=257–276 |jstor=260823 |doi=10.1177/002200948902400204}}</ref> The series was originally planned to include 17 books, but was discontinued after the publication of 10 when bombing destroyed paper stocks.

With its financial position devastated by paper shortages during and after the war, Secker & Warburg were forced to join the [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann group of publishers]] in 1951. During the 1950s and 1960s Secker & Warburg published the works of, among others, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Colette]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Günter Grass]], [[Angus Wilson]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Melvyn Bragg]] and [[Julian Gloag]], as well as the British Buddhist [[Lobsang Rampa]].

Heinemann was purchased by the [[Octopus Publishing Group]] in 1985; Octopus was purchased by [[Reed International]] (now [[Reed Elsevier]]) in 1987. [[Random House]] bought the adult trade division of Reed Books in February 1997.

[[Tom Rosenthal (publisher)|Tom Rosenthal]] (1935–2014), chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], was head of Secker & Warburg from 1971 to 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=162700&sectioncode=6|author=Tom Rosenthal|title=... in black, white, red and green – George Orwell|work=Times Higher Education|date=24 July 1998}}</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10590405/Tom-Rosenthal-obituary.html "Tom Rosenthal – obituary"], ''The Telegraph'', 22 January 2014.</ref>

===Harvill Press===
The Harvill Press was founded in 1946 by [[Manya Harari]] and Marjorie Villiers.<ref>[[Christopher MacLehose]], [https://www.brunel.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/110703/Christopher-MacLehose-pdf,-A-Publishers-Vision.pdf "A Publisher’s Vision"], ''EnterText'' 4.3 Supplement.</ref>  The imprint was later acquired by the Glasgow-based publishing firm [[William Collins, Sons|William Collins and Sons]], which in 1989 merged with the American publishers Harper & Row to form [[HarperCollins]].

In 1996 Harvill Press became independent following a management buyout.  The firm was bought by Random House in 2002, and was merged with 
Secker & Warburg in 2005 to become Harvill Secker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308070031/http://www.booktrade.info/index.php/showarticle/4318|title=Secker and Harvill to Merge|date=13 February 2004|work=booktrade.info}}</ref>
