[[Turkey]] is negotiating its accession to the [[European Union]] (EU) as a member state, following its application to accede to the European Economic Community, the predecessor of the EU, on 14 April 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678 |access-date=26 August 2008 |title=EU-Turkey relations |work=European Information on Enlargement & Neighbours |publisher=EurActiv.com |date=23 September 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080706153600/http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678 |archive-date=6 July 2008}}</ref> After the ten founding members, Turkey was one of the first countries to become a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949.

Turkey signed a [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union|Customs Union agreement]] with the EU in 1995 and was officially recognised as a candidate for full membership on 12 December 1999, at the [[Helsinki]] summit of the [[European Council]].

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Council of Europe Palais de l'Europe aerial view.JPG|thumb|[[Palace of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]], seat of the [[Council of Europe]], which Turkey joined on [[Member states of the Council of Europe|9 August 1949]] ]]

After the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire's collapse]] following [[World War I]], [[Turkish revolutionaries]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] emerged victorious in the [[Turkish War of Independence]], establishing the modern Turkish Republic as it exists today. Atatürk, [[President of Turkey]], implemented [[Atatürk's Reforms|a series of reforms]], including secularisation and industrialisation, intended to "Europeanise" or Westernise the country.<ref name="embassyhistory">{{cite web |publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Turkey (Washington, DC) |title=Turkey and EU |url= http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=57&Itemid=235 |access-date=4 July 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211417/http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=57&Itemid=235 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> During [[World War II]], Turkey [[Second Cairo Conference|remained neutral until February 1945]], when it joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

The Turkish expert Meltem Ahıska outlines the Turkish position vis-à-vis Europe, explaining how "Europe has been an object of desire as well as a source of frustration for Turkish national identity in a long and strained history".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ahiska |first=Meltem |title=Occidentalism: The Historical Fantasy of the Modern |journal=South Atlantic Quarterly |date=1 April 2003 |volume=102 |issue=2–3 |pages=351–379 |doi=10.1215/00382876-102-2-3-351|s2cid=144132845 }}</ref>

===1950s–1990s===
Turkey first applied for [[Member State of the European Union#Related states|associate membership]] in the [[European Economic Community]] in 1959, and on 12 September 1963 signed the "Agreement Creating An Association Between The Republic of Turkey and the European Economic Community", also known as the [[Ankara Agreement]]. This agreement came into effect the following year on 12 December 1964. The Ankara Agreement sought to integrate Turkey into a customs union with the EEC whilst acknowledging the final goal of membership.<ref name="embassyhistory"/> In November 1970, a further protocol called the "Additional Protocol" established a timetable for the abolition of tariffs and quotas on goods traded between Turkey and the EEC.<ref name="embassyhistory"/>

On 14 April 1987, Turkey submitted its application for formal membership into the European Economic Community. The [[European Commission]] responded in December 1989 by confirming Ankara's eventual membership but also by deferring the matter to more favourable times, citing Turkey's economic and political situation, as well its [[Greece–Turkey relations|poor relations with Greece]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|conflict with Cyprus]] as creating an unfavourable environment with which to begin negotiations.<ref name="embassylondon">{{cite web|publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Turkey in London|url= http://www.turkishembassylondon.org/canon/aboutturkey_eu.htm|title=About Turkey and the EU|access-date=4 July 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205928/http://www.turkishembassylondon.org/canon/aboutturkey_eu.htm|archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}<!-- do not substitute the article in the other embassy's as they do not mention the deferral --></ref> This position was confirmed again in the Luxembourg European Council of 1997 in which accession talks were started with central and eastern European states and Cyprus, but not Turkey. During the 1990s, Turkey proceeded with a closer integration with the European Union by agreeing to a [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union|customs union]] in 1995. Moreover, the Helsinki European Council of 1999 proved a milestone as the EU recognised Turkey as a candidate on equal footing with other potential candidates.

===2000s===
The next significant step in Turkey–EU relations came with the December 2002 Copenhagen European Council.<ref name=EuropeanCouncilCopenhagen2002>{{cite web|url= http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/73842.pdf |title=European Council: EU would open accession negotiations with Turkey|access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref> According to it, "the EU would open negotiations with Turkey 'without delay' if the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfills the Copenhagen political criteria."<ref name=EuropeanCouncilCopenhagen2002/>

The [[European Commission]] recommended that the negotiations should begin in 2005, but also added various precautionary measures. The EU leaders agreed on 16 December 2004 to start accession negotiations with Turkey from 3 October 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.independentcommissiononturkey.org/oped_20050831.html|title=Independent Commission on Turkey|access-date=7 June 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160109202339/http://www.independentcommissiononturkey.org/oped_20050831.html |archive-date=9 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> While [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] initially wanted to leave open the possibility that negotiations with Turkey would lead to a [[privileged partnership]], less than full membership, accession negotiations were ultimately launched with the "shared objective" of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=24900 |title=Today's Zaman: Turkey Starts Full Membership Negotiations with EU}}</ref>

Turkey's accession talks have since been stalled by a number of domestic and external problems. Both Austria and France have said they would hold a referendum on Turkey's accession. In the case of France, a change in its Constitution was made to impose such a referendum, but later another constitutional change has enabled the parliament (if a large majority of its members agrees) to prevent such a referendum.<ref name=AustriaRef>[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1239805023.06 Turkey, with eye on EU, says determined to reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417223231/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1239805023.06 |date=17 April 2009 }}, ''EUbusiness'', 15 March 2009</ref> The issue of Cyprus continues to be a major obstacle to negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/9/23008|title=Cyprus threatens to block EU deal on Turkey talks|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> European officials have commented on the slowdown in Turkish reforms which, combined with the Cyprus problem, led the EU's Enlargement Commissioner [[Olli Rehn]] in March 2007 to warn of an impending ‘train crash’ in the negotiations.<ref name="economist2">{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2007/03/17/the-ins-and-outs |title=The ins and outs: The EU's most effective foreign-policy instrument has been enlargement.

In December 2009, the [[Republic of Cyprus]] blocked 6 chapters of Turkish accession negotiations, including those on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Energy and Education and Culture, arguing that Turkey needs to first normalise relations with Cyprus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.pseka.net/index.php?module=article&id=12350|title=Cyprus won't open EU accession chapters for Turkey|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://famagusta-gazette.com/fule-urges-turkey-to-implement-additional-protocol-p18332-69.htm|title=Fule urges Turkey to implement Additional Protocol|access-date=7 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111213307/http://famagusta-gazette.com/fule-urges-turkey-to-implement-additional-protocol-p18332-69.htm|archive-date=11 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> As a result, no chapters have been opened since June 2010.<ref>http://www.epc.eu/documents/uploads/pub_3021_turkey-eu_relations.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.todayszaman.com/news-232531-turkey-tells-eu-it-may-postpone-competition-chapter-if-needed.html|title=Turkey tells EU it may postpone competition chapter if needed|work=TodaysZaman|access-date=7 June 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715013128/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-232531-turkey-tells-eu-it-may-postpone-competition-chapter-if-needed.html |archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-267358-turkey-sees-bleak-future-for-eu-accession-talks-in-2012.html|title=Turkey sees bleak future for EU accession talks in 2012|work=TodaysZaman|access-date=7 June 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715025052/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-267358-turkey-sees-bleak-future-for-eu-accession-talks-in-2012.html|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Hence, there is no chapter Turkey can open other than the difficult and economically detrimental chapters Competition Policy, Social Policy and Employment, and Public Procurement that most candidate countries open at the end of accession as all other chapters are blocked. In February 2013, Turkish Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry for EU Affairs, Burak Erdenir, claimed that the EU had yet to communicate to Turkey the benchmark criteria for opening chapters 23 and 24, Judiciary & Fundamental Rights and Justice, Freedom & Security, which was to be done after screening of the chapters was completed in 2006, thus making it impossible to comply with them. He also suggested this was a deliberate attempt to slow their accession process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/enlargement/got-necessary-eu-benchmarks-turk-news-517614|title=Turkey: EU political benchmarks 'were never given to us'|date=7 February 2013|access-date=9 February 2013|publisher=eurActiv}}</ref>

===Positive Agenda===
After over 2 years of no chapter openings, the European Commission set up a "Positive agenda" designed to focus on common EU-Turkey interests. EU Commissioner for expansion Stefan Füle describes that the goal was "to keep the accession process alive and put it properly back on track after a period of stagnation which has been a source of frustration for both sides."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/51799--s|title=EU Commissioner Fule: Positive Agenda to put EU process back on track|website=Anadolu Agency |access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref> The EU Commission mentioned a broad range of areas as the main elements of the Agenda such as “intensified dialogue and cooperation on political reforms”, “visa”, “mobility and migration”, “energy”, “fight against terrorism”, “further participation of Turkey in Community programmes”, “town twinning”, “trade and the Customs Union” and “supporting efforts to align with the acquis, including on chapters where accession negotiations cannot be opened for the time being”. The proposal was considered favorably on the condition that it serves as an instrument in support of and complementary to the negotiation process with the EU.

In the framework of “Positive Agenda”, Working Groups were established on 8 chapters (“3-Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services”, “6-Company Law”, “10-Information Society and Media”, “18-Statistics”, “23-Judiciary and Fundamental Rights”, “24-Justice, Freedom and Security”, “28-Consumer and Health Protection” and “32-Financial Control”). The "Positive Agenda" kick-off meeting was held on 17 May 2012 in Ankara with the participation of Stefan Füle, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy. As a result of the Working Groups meetings held so far, a total of four closing benchmarks were confirmed to have been met by Turkey in three chapters (Company Law, Consumer and Health Protection and Financial Control chapters).<ref name="ifri"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.euractiv.com.tr/ab-ve-turkiye/article/bagis-dort-fasilda-kapanis-kriterlerini-yerine-getirdigimizin-teyidini-aldik-026701 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140111210633/http://www.euractiv.com.tr/ab-ve-turkiye/article/bagis-dort-fasilda-kapanis-kriterlerini-yerine-getirdigimizin-teyidini-aldik-026701|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 January 2014|title=Bağış: 'Dört fasılda kapanış kriterlerini yerine getirdiğimizin teyidini aldık'|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref>

The crackdown following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]] by President Erdoğan damaged relations with the EU.

Erdoğan stated in November 2016 that he was considering putting Turkey's continued negotiations with the EU on membership to a referendum in 2017.<ref name=referendum>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu-erdogan-idUSKBN1391H4 |title=Turkey could put EU talks to a referendum next year: Erdogan|date=14 November 2016|access-date=22 November 2016 |publisher=Reuters}}</ref> In November 2016, the European Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution to request that the European Commission temporarily suspend membership negotiations due to the "disproportionate repressive measures" of the government to the coup.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38090121|title=Euro MPs vote to freeze Turkey EU membership talks |date=24 November 2016|access-date=24 November 2016|publisher=BBC}}</ref> On 13 December, the [[European Council]] (comprising the heads of state or government of the member states) resolved that it would open no new areas in Turkey's membership talks in the "prevailing circumstances";<ref name="Yahoo">{{Cite news|url= https://www.yahoo.com/news/eu-says-wont-open-turkey-membership-chapters-165121377.html |title=EU says won't expand Turkey membership talks|publisher=Yahoo|date=13 December 2016}}</ref> Turkey's path toward autocratic rule makes progress on EU accession impossible.<ref name="Marc Pierini">{{cite news|url= http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/66408 |title=Turkey's Impending Estrangement From the West |first=Marc |last=Pierini |publisher=Carnegie Europe |date=12 December 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, EU officials expressed that planned Turkish policies violate the [[Copenhagen criteria]] of eligibility for an EU membership.<ref name="Al-Monitor"/>

In April 2017, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) voted to reopen its monitoring procedure against Turkey. This vote is widely understood to deal a major blow to Turkey's perspective of eventual [[European Union|EU]] membership, as exiting that process was made a precondition of EU accession negotiations back in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/turkeys-eu-bid-in-jeopardy-after-council-of-europe-vote/|title=Turkey's EU bid in jeopardy after Council of Europe vote|publisher=Euractiv|date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

The European Commission's long-term budget proposal for the 2021-2027 period released in May 2018 included pre-accession funding for a Western Balkan Strategy for further enlargement, but omitted Turkey.<ref name=cut>{{cite news|url=https://ahvalnews.com/eu-turkey/eu-plans-cut-financial-assistance-turkey|title=EU plans to cut financial assistance to Turkey|publisher=Ahval|date=6 May 2018}}</ref>

On 26 June 2018, the EU's [[General Affairs Council]] stated that "the Council notes that Turkey has been moving further away from the European Union. Turkey’s accession negotiations have therefore effectively come to a standstill and no further chapters can be considered for opening or closing and no further work towards the modernisation of the [[European Union–Turkey Customs Union|EU-Turkey Customs Union]] is foreseen." The Council added that it is "especially concerned about the continuing and deeply worrying backsliding on the rule of law and on fundamental rights including the freedom of expression."<ref name=end1>{{cite web|url=https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/06/26/eu-council-issues-strong-message-about-turkeys-obligations/|title=EU Council issues strong message about Turkey's obligations|date=26 June 2018|publisher=Cyprus Mail}}</ref><ref name=end2>{{cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2018-06/recep-tayyip-erdogan-wahl-eu-zollunion-erklaerung|title=EU will Zollunion mit der Türkei nicht ausbauen|date=27 June 2018|publisher=Die Zeit|language=de}}</ref><ref name=council>{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/35863/st10555-en18.pdf|title=Enlargement and Stabilisation and Association Process Council conclusions|date=26 June 2018|work=Council of the European Union}}</ref>

On 20 February 2019, a European parliament committee voted to suspend the accession talks, sparking criticism from the government of Turkey.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu-idUSKCN1QA0MJ|title=Turkey condemns European parliament committee call to suspend...|date=21 February 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-02-21/turkey-faces-crucial-vote-on-eu-accession-before-local-ballot|title=Turkey Faces Crucial Vote on EU Accession Before Local Ballot|website=bloomberg.com|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1090402/EU-news-turkey-membership-eu-turkey-accession-latest-news|title='Change it now!'

==Negotiation progress==
===Table of chapters===
To accede to the EU, Turkey must successfully complete negotiations with the [[European Commission]] on 33 of the 35 chapters of the [[acquis communautaire]], the total body of EU law. (Two chapters do not require negotiation.) Afterwards, the member states must unanimously agree on granting Turkey membership to the European Union.

===Pre-accession support to Turkey===
{{see also|European Union–Turkey relations#EU pre-accession support to Turkey}}

Until the accession process is terminated, Turkey receives payments from the EU budget as pre-accession support, currently 4.5 billion allocated budget for the 2014–2020 period (about 740 million Euros per year).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/instruments/funding-by-country/turkey_en|title=Turkey - financial assistance under IPA II|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=23 April 2017|date=6 December 2016}}</ref>

In June 2017, the EU's financial watchdog, the European Court of Auditors, announced that it would investigate the effectiveness of the pre-accessions funds which Turkey has received since 2007 to support rule of law, civil society, fundamental rights, democracy and governance reforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/foreign/138290|title=Turkey received €1bn in EU money to develop democracy|publisher=EU Observer|date=20 June 2017}}</ref> Turkish media commented that "perhaps it can explain why this money apparently failed to have the slightest effect on efforts to prevent the deterioration of democracy in this country."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/where-did-all-the-money-from-the-eu-to-turkey-go.aspx?pageID=449&nID=115062&NewsCatID=416|title=Where did all the money from the EU to Turkey go?|publisher=Hurriyet Daily News|date=4 July 2017}}</ref>

The problem of Turkey's membership of the EU is compounded by conflicting views as to what the EU should ultimately become.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdu.de/en/doc/Friends_of_Europe_Turkey.pdf:|title=International|work=Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> This has played a significant role in the debate, due in part to the [[Eurozone crisis]] and the fact that as a result of this the [[eurozone]] and the EU overall is more federalised on both [[European Stability Mechanism|fiscal]], [[european arrest warrant|legal]] and political levels than it was at the time of Turkey's application or at the time that Turkey was accepted as a candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/page-not-found|website=The Economist|access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref> Generally those members of the EU who support a rights-based free trade bloc do not oppose Turkey as adamantly as those who support a broader political union.

Upon joining the EU, Turkey's 83 million inhabitants would bestow the second-largest number of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] in the [[European Parliament]].<ref name="economist2"/> Demographic projections indicate that Turkey would surpass Germany by 2020.<ref name="economist2"/> However, as a single country can only hold a maximum of 96 seats in the European Parliament, this would not give Turkey an advantage in the European Parliament.

Turkey's membership would also affect future enlargement plans, especially the number of nations seeking EU membership,<ref name="economist2"/> grounds on which [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] has opposed Turkey's admission. Giscard has suggested that it would lead to demands for accession by [[Morocco]]. [[Morocco and the European Union|Morocco's application]] is already rejected on geographic grounds; Turkey, unlike Morocco, has 3% of its [[Eastern Thrace|territory in Europe]]. The vast majority of its population lives in the Asian side of the country. On the other hand, the country's largest city, [[Istanbul]], lies mostly in Europe. On the other hand, [[Cyprus]], which is geographically located in Asia, joined the European Union in 2004. Former [[President of France|French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] stated in January 2007 that "enlarging Europe with no limit risks destroying European political union, and that I do not accept ... I want to say that Europe must give itself borders, that not all countries have a vocation to become members of Europe, beginning with Turkey which has no place inside the European Union."<ref name="sarkozyquote">{{Cite web|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=159133|title=Turkey has no place in EU: Sarkozy|access-date=13 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706021958/http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=159133|archive-date=6 July 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

EU member states must unanimously agree on Turkey's membership for the Turkish accession to be successful. In December 2011, a poll showed that as much as 71% of the participants surveyed in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom were opposed to Turkey's membership in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/216662.html|title=PressTV|website=presstv.ir|access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref> A number of nations may oppose it; notably [[Austria]];{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} [[Germany]] (chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] has long rejected Turkey's accession bid, and has proposed a "[[privileged partnership]]" instead);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/world/29-03-2010/112764-merkel-0/|title=Germany's Merkel Opposed to Turkey's Full EU Membership|work=English pravda.ru|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> and [[France]] (where some{{who|date=December 2017}} are anxious at the prospect of a new wave of Muslim immigrants, given the country's already large Muslim community).<ref>Islam is the religion of 5% to 10% of French citizens; see for instance Molly Moore, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/28/AR2008042802560.html "In France, Prisons Filled With Muslims"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (29 April 2008), retrieved 29 March 2018.</ref>

Negotiations to remove the French constitutional requirement for a compulsory referendum on all EU accessions after Croatia resulted in a new proposal to require a compulsory referendum on the accession of any country with a population of more than 5% of the EU's total population; this clause would mainly apply to [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/french-parliament-strikes-blow-turkish-eu-bid/article-172867|title=French Parliament strikes blow to Turkish EU bid|work=EurActiv – EU News & policy debates, across languages|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> The French Senate, however, blocked the change in the French constitution, in order to maintain good relations with Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turkofile.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/french-senate-ends-sarkozy-plan-to-block-turkey/|title=WordPress.com|access-date=5 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010135626/http://turkofile.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/french-senate-ends-sarkozy-plan-to-block-turkey/|archive-date=10 October 2008}}</ref> The current situation according to the French constitution is as follows: if {{frac|3|5}} of the delegates (from the Senate and the Parliament) agree to the accession of Turkey, there will be no referendum.

Free movement of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to migrate to other parts of Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. However, there have been problems concerning irregular transit migration through Turkey to the EU.<ref>{{cite document |last=Icduygu |first=Ahmet |title=The Irregular Migration Corridor between the EU and Turkey: Is it Possible to Block it with a Readmission Agreement? |work= Cadmus, European University Institute Research Repository |date=2011 |volume=14 |hdl=1814/17844 }}</ref>

Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey.

The Turkish invasion in 1974 and the resulting movement of [[Cypriot refugees|refugees]] along both sides of the [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]], and the establishment of the self-declared [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] in 1983, form the core issues which surround the ongoing [[Cyprus dispute]].

Turkey and the [[Turkish Cypriots]] backed the 2004 [[Annan Plan for Cyprus]] aimed at the reunification of the island, but the plan was subsequently rejected by Greek Cypriots on the grounds that it did not meet their needs. According to Greek Cypriots, the latest proposal included maintained residence rights for the many Anatolian Turks who moved to Cyprus after the invasion (and their descendants who were born on the island after 1974), while the Greek Cypriots who lost their property after the Turkish invasion would be granted only a restricted right of return to the north following the island's proposed reunification.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Although the outcome received much criticism in the EU as well, the Republic of Cyprus was admitted into the EU a week after the referendum.

Cultural differences between Muslim majority Turkey and predominantly Christian Europe play an important part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the [[European Union]]. In an analysis, based on the [[World Values Survey]], the social scientists [[Arno Tausch]] and [[Almas Heshmati]] came to the conclusion that a robust measurement scale of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a [[promax]] [[factor analysis]] of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would be well advised to continue to support civil society and [[secular democracy]] in Turkey.<ref>Tausch, Arno and Almas Heshmati (2013).

===Armenian Genocide recognition===
{{main|Armenian Genocide recognition#Position of Turkey}}
In 2004, the French Foreign Minister [[Michel Barnier]] stated that Turkey must recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey 'must admit Armenia dead'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4092933.stm|access-date=26 March 2013|newspaper=British Broadcasting Network (BBC)|date=13 December 2004}}</ref> However, he insisted that although France did not set a precondition for European Union entry regarding the matter, he stated that France would raise the issue during negotiations. The President of the European Parliament, [[Martin Schulz]], stated that it must be a precondition for Turkey to recognise the systematic massacres of Armenians in 1915 as genocide.<ref>{{cite news|title=Genocide Recognition Precondition to Turkey's EU Bid, Says Euro-Parliament President|url= http://asbarez.com/105486/ |access-date=26 March 2013|newspaper=Asbarez|date=18 September 2012}}</ref>

The government of Turkey rejects such a precondition for EU membership and does not accept it as a part of the [[Copenhagen criteria|EU membership criteria]].

In 2006, the [[European Parliament]] voted against a proposal to formally add the issue as a membership criterion for Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&reference=20060922IPR10896&language=EN|title=European Parliament critical of slowdown in Turkey's reform process|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> A similar proposal by Greek and Greek Cypriot MEPs was also rejected by the European Parliament in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.armenianow.com/genocide/28146/spain_armenian_genocide_bill |title=Spain Says No: Genocide bill rejected - Genocide - ArmeniaNow.com |access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref>

===Article 301===
{{Main|Censorship in Turkey|Article 301}}

Article 301 states that "a person who publicly insults the Turkish nation, the State of the Republic of Turkey, or the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]], shall be punishable by imprisonment of between six months and two years" and also that "expressions of thought intended to criticise shall not constitute a crime."

The EU was especially critical of this law during the September 2005 trial of novelist [[Orhan Pamuk]] over comments that recognised the deaths of thirty thousand Kurds [[Armenian Genocide|and a million Armenians]]. Enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn and members of the European Parliament called the case "regrettable", "most unfortunate", and "unacceptable".<ref name="bbc3">{{Cite news|last=Dymond |first=Jonny|title=EU blasts Turkish author's trial|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4243102.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=13 September 2005|access-date=6 July 2007}}</ref> After the case was dropped three months later, Turkey's Foreign Minister [[Abdullah Gül]] indicated that Turkey may abandon or modify Article 301, stating that "there may be need for a new law".<ref name="gul301">{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4565466.stm|title=Turkey insult law 'may be dumped'|work=BBC News |date=28 December 2005|access-date=6 July 2007}}</ref> In September 2006, the European Parliament called for the abolition of laws, such as Article 301, "which threaten European free speech norms".<ref name="bbc2">{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5385954.stm |title=New EU warning on Turkey reforms|work=[[BBC News]]|date=27 September 2006|access-date=8 July 2007}}</ref> On 30 April 2008, the law was reformed.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7375327.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Europe – EU hails Turkey free speech move|access-date=7 June 2015}}</ref> According to the reform, it is now a crime to explicitly insult the "Turkish nation" rather than "Turkishness"; opening court cases based on Article 301 require the approval of the Justice Minister; and the maximum punishment has been reduced to two years in jail.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>

===Women's rights===
{{further|Women in Turkey}}
[[File:First female MPs of the Turkish Parliament (1935).jpg|thumb|220px|Eighteen female [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] joined the [[Turkish Parliament]] with the 1935 general elections, at a time when women in a significant number of other European countries had [[Timeline of women's suffrage|voting rights]] for the local municipal elections, but not for the national parliamentary elections. In 1993 [[Tansu Çiller]] became the first female [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister of Turkey]].]]

Turkey gave women [[Timeline of women's suffrage|the right to vote]] in 1930 for municipal elections. In 1934 this right was expanded for the national elections, while women were also given the right to become elected as [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] in the [[Turkish Parliament]], or for being appointed as [[Minister (government)|Minister]]s, [[Prime Minister]], [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the Parliament]] and [[President of Turkey|President of the Republic]]. In 1993 [[Tansu Çiller]] became the first female [[List of Prime Ministers of Turkey|Prime Minister of Turkey]].

In its second report on women's role in social, economic and political life in Turkey, the [[European Parliament]] emphasised that respecting human rights, including women's rights, is an essential condition for Turkey's membership of the EU. According to the report, Turkey's legal framework on women's rights "has in general been satisfactory, but its substantive implementation remains flawed."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=EN&type=IM-PRESS&reference=20070208IPR02887|title=Women's rights in Turkey: MEPs say improvements still needed|access-date=13 April 2007|publisher=European Parliament|date=13 February 2007}}</ref>

===Conscientious objectors===
Turkey is one of two states (along with [[Azerbaijan]]) among the 47 members of the Council of Europe which refuse to recognise the status of [[conscientious objector]]s or give them an alternative to military service, other than a reduction of service by paying a tax.<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/leading-turkish-writer-faces-jail-after-incurring-wrath-of-military-481368.html |title=Leading Turkish writer faces jail after incurring wrath of military|access-date=13 April 2007 |work=Independent|first=Peter|last=Popham|date=7 June 2006|location=London}}</ref>

==Public reactions==

===In the EU===
Public opinion in EU countries generally opposes Turkish membership, though with varying degrees of intensity. The [[Eurobarometer]] September–October 2006 survey<ref name="eurobarometer_66">{{Cite web|title=European Commission: ''Eurobarometer 66 – Public Opinion in the European Union'', Sep–Oct 2006, p.223|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb66/eb66_en.pdf|access-date=1 September 2007}}</ref> shows that 59% of EU-27 citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about [[human rights]] as the leading cause. In the earlier March–May 2006 [[Eurobarometer]], citizens from the new member states were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was [[Austria]] (con: 81%), while [[Romania]] was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support comes from the [[Turkish Cypriot|Turkish Cypriot Community]] (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as a sovereign state and is ''de facto'' not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities are even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%).<ref name="special_eurobarometer_255">{{cite web|title=European Commission: Special Eurobarometer 255 – Attitudes towards EU Enlargement |date=July 2006 |page=72 |url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_255_en.pdf |access-date=5 September 2006| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060823004033/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_255_en.pdf |archive-date=23 August 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> Opposition in [[Denmark]] to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government's support for Turkey's EU bid.<ref name="copenhagen post 1">{{cite news|title=Disagreement over Turkish EU membership |publisher=Copenhagen Post |date=22 October 2007 |url= http://www.cphpost.dk/get/103964.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20070810190926/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/103964.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 August 2007 |access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref>

There is a trend in declining support since 2000 that has continued during the [[2016–present purges in Turkey]]. In the past support for Turkish accession came especially from left-wing parties, but more recently both sides of the political spectrum in Europe have been highly critical of Turkey's human rights record. Opposition to Turkish accession is higher in countries such as Bulgaria and Germany which have a high population of [[Turkish diaspora]] or [[Muslims in Europe]].<ref>FEUTURE Online Paper No. 25: "EU Public Opinion on Turkish EU Membership: Trends and Drivers" Jakob Lindgaard 2018 https://feuture.uni-koeln.de/sites/feuture/user_upload/Online_Paper_No_25_final.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phinnemore |first1=David |last2=İçener |first2=Erhan |title=Holding the door half (?) open: the EU and Turkey 10 years on |journal=Journal of Contemporary European Studies |date=2016 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=446–462 |doi=10.1080/14782804.2016.1178104 |quote=The last decade has seen this opposition not only increase, but also manifest itself more prominently in party political rhetoric.

===In Turkey===
{{Wikinews|EU sets date for membership talks with Turkey}}

His response: "There are 5 million Turks in Europe and 3 million [[Turks in Germany]] alone. We are a natural member of the European Union. Germany invited Turkish workers 50 years ago, however 50 years have passed and we have waited at the [[European Union]]'s doorstep. No other country has experienced such a thing.

At the same time, Turkey issued a declaration stating that signature of the Additional Protocol did not amount to recognition of the Republic of Cyprus. On 21 September, the EU adopted a counter-declaration indicating that Turkey’s declaration was unilateral, did not form part of the Protocol and had no legal effect on Turkey’s obligations under the Protocol. The EU declaration stressed that recognition of all Member States was a necessary component of the accession process.
