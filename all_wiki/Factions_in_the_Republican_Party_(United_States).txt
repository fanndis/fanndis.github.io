{{short description|Ideological and political wings of the Republican Party}}
The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[United States]] includes several [[Political faction|factions]],<ref name="pew2014"/> or wings.

== Conservative wing ==
{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}
{{See also|List of American conservatives}}
The [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] wing grew out of the 1950s and 1960s in response to the growth and national prominence of the moderate wing, with its initial leaders being U.S. Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], [[Russell Kirk]], and [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] Its central tenets include the promotion of individual liberty and [[free-market economics]] and opposition to [[labor union]]s, high [[taxes]], and excessive [[government regulation]].<ref name="Critchlow"/>

In economic policy, conservatives call for a large reduction in [[government spending]], [[free trade]], less regulation of the economy, and personalized accounts for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. Supporters of [[supply-side economics]] predominate, but there are [[deficit hawk]]s within the faction as well. Before 1930, the Northeastern pro-manufacturing faction of the GOP was strongly committed to [[Tariff History of the United States|high tariffs]], but since 1945 it has been more supportive of [[free-market]] principles and treaties for open trade.<ref name="Aberbach"/> The conservative wing supports [[social conservatism]] (often termed [[family values]]) and [[anti-abortion]] positions.<ref name="Martin"/>

Conservatives generally oppose [[affirmative action]], arguing that it too often turns into quotas. They tend to support a strong military and are opposed to [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]]. They oppose [[illegal immigration]] and support stronger law enforcement, often disagreeing with strict libertarians. On the issue of [[school voucher]]s, conservative Republicans split between supporters who believe that "[[big government]] education" is a failure and opponents who fear greater government control over private and church schools. Parts of the conservative wing have been criticized for being [[Anti-environmentalism|anti-environmentalist]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shabecoff|first1=Philip|title=Earth Rising: American Environmentalism in the 21st Century|date=2000|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781597263351|page=[https://archive.org/details/earthrisingameri00phil/page/125 125]|url=https://archive.org/details/earthrisingameri00phil|url-access=registration|quote=republican party anti-environmental.|access-date=9 November 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hayes|first1=Samuel P.|title=A History of Environmental Politics Since 1945|date=2000|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822972242|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jG5IwgEFSYQC&pg=PA119|access-date=9 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220081610/https://books.google.com/books?id=jG5IwgEFSYQC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119#v=onepage&q=republican%20party%20anti-environmentalist|archive-date=20 February 2018|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sellers|first1=Christopher|title=How Republicans came to embrace anti-environmentalism|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/4/22/15377964/republicans-environmentalism|website=Vox|access-date=9 November 2017|date=7 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102175137/https://www.vox.com/2017/4/22/15377964/republicans-environmentalism|archive-date=2 November 2017|df=}}</ref> and promoting [[climate change denial]]<ref name="Dunlap 2010">{{cite journal|last1=Dunlap|first1=Riley E.|last2=McCright|first2=Araon M.|title=A Widening Gap: Republican and Democratic Views on Climate Change|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|date=7 August 2010|volume=50|issue=5|pages=26–35|doi=10.3200/ENVT.50.5.26-35|s2cid=154964336}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Båtstrand|first=Sondre|title=More than Markets: A Comparative Study of Nine Conservative Parties on Climate Change|journal=[[Politics and Policy]]|volume=43|issue=4|pages=538–561|doi=10.1111/polp.12122|issn=1747-1346|year=2015|quote=The U.S. Republican Party is an anomaly in denying anthropogenic climate change.}}</ref><ref name="chait">{{cite news|title=Why Are Republicans the Only Climate-Science-Denying Party in the World?|authorlink=Jonathan Chait|first=Jonathan|last=Chait|date=September 27, 2015|access-date=September 20, 2017|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/09/whys-gop-only-science-denying-party-on-earth.html|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|quote=Of all the major conservative parties in the democratic world, the Republican Party stands alone in its denial of the legitimacy of climate science.

There are several subcategories within conservative Republicanism.

=== Christian right ===
[[File:Mike Huckabee by Gage Skidmore 6.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Governor of Arkansas [[Mike Huckabee]]]]
{{main|Christian right}}
The Christian right is a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Christianity and politics|Christian]] [[political faction]] characterized by strong support of [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies. Christian conservatives principally seek to apply their understanding of the teachings of Christianity to politics and to public policy by proclaiming the value of those teachings or by seeking to use those teachings to influence law and public policy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&pg=PA469 Sociology: understanding a diverse society], Margaret L.

In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholics]], as well as a large number of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints (Mormons)]].<ref name="Deckman2004">{{cite book|last= Deckman|first= Melissa Marie|author-link=Melissa Deckman|title= School Board Battles: The Christian Right in Local Politics|url= https://archive.org/details/schoolboardbattl0000deck|url-access= registration|access-date= April 10, 2014|year= 2004|publisher= Georgetown University Press|isbn= 9781589010017|page= [https://archive.org/details/schoolboardbattl0000deck/page/48 48]|quote= More than half of all Christian right candidates attend evangelical Protestant churches, which are more theologically liberal.

=== Neoconservatives ===
[[File:George-W-Bush.jpeg|thumb|upright|President [[George W. Bush]]]]
{{main|Neoconservatism}}
[[Neoconservatism|Neoconservatives]] promote an [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]] to promote democracy. Many neoconservatives were in earlier days identified as liberals or were affiliated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Neoconservatives have been credited with importing into the Republican Party a more active international policy. Neoconservatives are amenable to unilateral military action when they believe it serves a morally valid purpose (such as the spread of democracy).<ref name="Ehrman"/><ref name="Vaïsse"/> Many of its adherents became politically famous during the Republican presidential administrations of the late 20th century, and neoconservatism peaked in influence during the administration of [[George W. Bush]], when they played a major role in promoting and planning the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wanting War: Why the Bush Administration Invaded Iraq|last=Record|first=Jeffery|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=47–50}}</ref> Prominent neoconservatives in the George W. Bush administration included [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Elliott Abrams]], [[Richard Perle]], and [[Paul Bremer]]. While not identifying as neoconservatives, senior officials Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel and the promotion of American influence in the Middle East.

Traditionalists base their ideology upon the political philosophies of [[Aristotle]], [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Russell Kirk]].

== Historical factions ==

=== Half-Breeds ===
{{main|Half-Breeds (politics)}}
The [[Half-Breeds (politics)|Half-Breeds]] were a reformist faction of the 1870s and 1880s. The name, which originated with rivals claiming they were only "half" Republicans, came to encompass a wide array of figures who did not all get along with each other. Generally speaking, politicians labeled Half-Breeds were moderates or progressives who opposed the machine politics of the Stalwarts and advanced civil services reforms.<ref name="Peskin1984"/>

=== Progressive Republicans ===
[[File:President Roosevelt - Pach Bros.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]]]
{{further|Progressive Era}}
Historically, the Republican Party included a [[progressivism|progressive]] wing that advocated using government to improve the problems of modern society. [[Theodore Roosevelt]], an early leader of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], advanced a "[[Square Deal]]" domestic program as president (1901–09) that was built on the goals of controlling corporations, protecting consumers, and conserving natural resources.<ref>{{cite web| last=Milkis| first=Sidney| title=Theodore Roosevelt: Domestic Affairs| date=October 4, 2016| url=https://millercenter.org/president/roosevelt/domestic-affairs| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> After splitting with his successor, [[William Howard Taft]], in the aftermath of the [[Pinchot–Ballinger controversy]],<ref>{{cite web| last=Arnold| first=Peri E.| title=William Taft: Domestic Affairs| date=October 4, 2016| url=https://millercenter.org/president/taft/domestic-affairs| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> Roosevelt sought to block Taft's re-election, first by challenging him for the [[1912 Republican Party presidential primaries|1912 Republican presidential nomination]], and then when that failed, by entering the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential contest]] as a [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidate, running on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]] ticket. He succeeded in depriving Taft of a second term, but came in second behind [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Woodrow Wilson]].

After Roosevelt's 1912 defeat, the progressive wing of the party went into decline. Progressive Republicans in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] held a "[[last stand]]" protest in December 1923, at the start of the [[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]], when they refused to support the [[United States House of Representatives Republican Conference|Republican Conference]] nominee for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], [[Frederick H. Gillett]], voting instead for two other candidates. After eight ballots spanning two days, they agreed to support Gillett in exchange for a seat on the [[House Rules Committee]] and pledges that subsequent rules changes would be considered. On the ninth ballot, Gillett received 215 votes, a majority of the 414 votes cast, to win the election.<ref>{{cite web| last=Wolfensberger| first=Don| title=Opening day of new Congress: Not always total joy| work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]| date=December 12, 2018| url=https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/420984-opening-day-of-new-congress-not-always-total-joy| access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref>

In addition to Theodore Roosevelt, leading early progressive Republicans included [[Robert M. La Follette]], [[Charles Evans Hughes]], [[Hiram Johnson]], [[William Borah]], [[George W. Norris]] and [[Fiorello La Guardia]].<ref>Michael Wolraich. ''Unreasonable Men: Theodore Roosevelt and the Republican Rebels Who Created Progressive Politics'' (2014).</ref>

=== Radical Republicans ===
{{main|Radical Republicans}}
The [[Radical Republicans]] were a major factor of the party from its inception in 1854 until the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] in 1877. The Radicals strongly opposed [[slavery in the United States|slavery]], were hard-line [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]], and later advocated equal rights for the [[freedmen]] and women. They were often at odds with the moderate and conservative factions of the party. During the [[American Civil War]], Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as too lenient on the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]]. After the war's end and Lincoln's assassination, the Radicals clashed with [[Andrew Johnson]] over Reconstruction policy. After winning major victories in the [[United States elections, 1866|1866 congressional elections]], the Radicals took over Reconstruction, pushing through new legislation protecting the civil rights of African Americans. [[John C. Frémont]] of Michigan, the party's first nominee for President in 1856, was a Radical Republican. Upset with Lincoln's politics, the faction split from the Republican to form the short-lived [[Radical Democracy Party (United States)|Radical Democracy Party]] in 1864 and again nominated [[John C. Frémont|Frémont]] for president. They supported [[Ulysses S. Grant]] for President in 1868 and 1872. As [[Southern Democrats]] retook control in the South and enthusiasm for continued Reconstruction declined, their influence within the GOP waned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Radical-Republican|title=Radical Republican|access-date=November 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106101556/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Radical-Republican|archive-date=November 6, 2017|df=}}</ref>

=== Reagan coalition ===
[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Ronald Reagan]], namesake of the [[Reagan coalition]]]]
{{main|Reagan Coalition}}
According to historian George H. Nash, the [[Reagan coalition]] in the Republican Party, which centered around [[Ronald Reagan]] and his administration throughout all of the 1980s (continuing in the late 1980s with the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration), originally consisted of five factions: the libertarians, the traditionalists, the [[anti-communist]]s, the neoconservatives, and the religious right (which consisted of Protestants, Catholics, and some Jewish Republicans).<ref name="Critchlow"/><ref name="Woolridge-Micklethwait"/>

=== Stalwarts ===
{{main|Stalwarts (politics)}}
The [[Stalwarts (politics)|Stalwarts]] were a traditionalist faction that existed from the 1860s through the 1880s. They represented "traditional" Republicans who favored [[machine politics]] and opposed the [[civil service]] reforms of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and the more progressive [[Half-Breeds (politics)|Half-Breeds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stalwart|title=Stalwart|access-date=November 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201050827/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stalwart|archive-date=December 1, 2017|df=}}</ref> They declined following the elections of Hayes and [[James A. Garfield]]. After Garfield's assassination, his Stalwart Vice President [[Chester A. Arthur]] assumed the presidency and rather than pursuing Stalwart goals he took up the reformist cause, which curbed the faction's influence.<ref name="Peskin1984">{{cite journal|last=Peskin|first=Allan|title=Who Were the Stalwarts?
