'''23andMe''' is a privately held [[personal genomics]] and [[biotechnology]] company based in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. It is best known for providing a [[direct-to-consumer genetic testing]] service in which customers provide a [[saliva testing|saliva sample]] that is laboratory analysed, using [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping]],<ref name=Wired2007/> to generate reports relating to the customer's ancestry and genetic predispositions to health-related topics. The company's name is derived from the fact that there are 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in a normal human [[cell (biology)|cell]].<ref name=Facts>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet|url=http://mediacenter.23andme.com/fact-sheet/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119085732/http://mediacenter.23andme.com/fact-sheet/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013|publisher=23andMe|access-date=November 27, 2013}}</ref>

In April 2017, the FDA approved the applications for ten tests: late-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]], [[Thrombophilia|hereditary thrombophilia]], [[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], early-onset of [[dystonia]], [[Haemophilia C|factor XI deficiency]], and [[Gaucher's disease]].<ref name=FDA10>{{cite web|title= FDA allows marketing of first direct-to-consumer tests that provide genetic risk information for certain conditions|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm551185.htm|publisher=FDA|language=en|date=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolata|first1=Gina|title=F.D.A.

23andMe began offering direct-to-consumer genetic testing in November 2007.

After the sample is received by the lab, the DNA is extracted from the saliva and [[DNA amplification|amplified]] so that there is enough to be [[genotype]]d. The DNA is then cut into small pieces, and applied to a glass [[Microarray analysis techniques|microarray chip]], which has many microscopic beads applied to its surface. Each bead has a [[gene probe]] on it that matches the DNA of one of the many variants the company test for. If the sample has a match in the microarray, the sequences will [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]], or bind together, letting researchers know that this variant is present in the customer's genome by a [[Fluorescent tag|fluorescent label]] located on the probes. Tens of thousands of variants are tested out of the 10 to 30 million located in the entire genome. These matches are then compiled into a report that is supplied to the customer, allowing them to know if the variants associated with certain diseases, such as Parkinson's, celiac and Alzheimer's, are present in their own genome.<ref>Madara, Jason.

==Accuracy concerns==
Some customers comparing 23andMe results to other genomic and ancestry testing companies have received differing results, possibly due to human error, or the differing analysis of the extracted DNA due to overrepresentation of one country or region over another in the database.<ref>O'Rourke,Tanya.

Retrieved April 28, 2018.</ref> Ancestry results are based on the amount of confidence the company has that the DNA is from a specific region, leading to both specific countries when the confidence is high, and broad regions when the confidence is low. This can lead to surprising results due to specific countries getting masked by low confidence in the DNA.<ref>Baron, Ethan.

The company collects not only genetic and personal information from customers who order DNA tests, but also data about other web behavior information that 23andMe captures through the use of its website, products, software, [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], and through its smartphone app.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.23andme.com/about/privacy/|title=Privacy Policy|date=17 July 2018|website=23andMe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dna-privacy-at-home-tests-23andme-ancestrydna-sell-data-to-third-parties/|title=Behind at-home DNA testing companies sharing genetic data with third parties|date=2 August 2018|work=CBS News}}</ref> A combination of several individual policies within the terms of service and privacy policy (cookies, disclosure of aggregate data, targeted advertising) makes 23andMe a valuable [[data mine]] for third parties such as [[Health insurance company|health insurance companies]], [[pharmaceutical companies]], [[Advertising company|advertising companies]], [[biotechnology companies]], law enforcement, or other interested parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/23andme-is-selling-your-data-but-not-how-you-think-1794340474|title=23andMe Is Selling Your Data, But Not How You Think|last=Brown|first=Kristen|date=17 April 2017|website=Gizmodo|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Drabiak |first1=Katherine |title=Read the Fine Print Before Sending Your Spit to 23andMe |url=https://www.thehastingscenter.org/response-to-call-for-essays-read-the-fine-print-before-sending-your-spit-to-23andme-r/ |work=The Hastings Center |date=February 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dna-testing-ancestry-23andme-share-data-companies-2018-8|title=DNA-testing companies like 23andMe sell your genetic data to drugmakers and other Silicon Valley startups|last=Brodwin|first=Erin|date=3 August 2018|website=Business Insider}}</ref> People may not actually be aware of how the company uses the data, and there are always risks of [[data breach]]es.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schulson |first1=Michael |title=Spit and Take |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/12/direct_to_consumer_genetic_testing_has_tons_of_privacy_issues_why_is_the.html |work=Slate |date=December 29, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/02/15/the-privacy-delusions-of-genetic-testing/#5d0a7c431bba|title=The Privacy Delusions Of Genetic Testing|last=Pitts|first=Peter|date=15 February 2017|website=Forbes}}</ref>

===United States===
Depending on which state an individual resides in, 23andMe must follow that state's laws regarding privacy and disclosing information. Since 23andMe is not a medical provider the company does not have to abide by standard privacy policies that must be followed at a doctor's office, such as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).<ref name=":2" /> Research has shown that only 9% of consumers actually read the terms and conditions, which suggests that consent to be included in research may have been given without full knowledge of the permissions being given.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dnatestingchoice.com/en-us/news/23andme-sell-your-data-should-you-be-worried |title=23andMe sell your data – should you be worried? |last=Wisgard |first=Alex |date=25 January 2019 |website=dnatestingchoice.com }}</ref> In addition, 23andMe's privacy policy can be confusing for consumers to understand.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-you-re-giving-away-those-home-dna-tests-n824776 |title=What you're giving away with those home DNA tests |last=Fox |first=Maggie |date=29 November 2017 |work=NBC News }}</ref> Several sections of the privacy policy allows data to be disclosed to third parties, regardless whether the consent is signed:
<blockquote>
Section 4(b) "We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web-Behavior Information regarding the use of our Services to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements ("ads") to you."<ref name=":0" />
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Section 4(c): "Regardless of your consent status, we may also include your data in aggregate data that we disclose to third-party research partners who will not publish that information in a scientific journal."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/202907870-Will-the-information-I-provide-be-shared-with-third-parties- |title=Will the information I provide be shared with third parties? |website=23andMe |access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> </blockquote>
<blockquote>
Section 4(d): "We may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user experience."<ref name=":0" />
</blockquote>
The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA) protects a person against discrimination based on genetic information by their employer(s) or insurance companies in ''most'' situations. However, GINA does not extend to discrimination based on genetic information for long-term care or disability-insurance providers.

=== European Union ===
Effective as of 25 May 2018, 23andMe must abide by the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.23andme.com/gdpr/|title=Data Protection - GDPR|website=23andMe}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/data-protection-overview-citizens_en.pdf|title=It's your Data - Take Control: Data Protection in the EU|date=2018|website=European Commission|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> The GDPR is a set of rules/regulations that helps an individual take control of their data information that is collected, used and stored digitally or in a structured filing system on paper, and restricts a company's use of personal data.<ref name=":3" />  The regulation also applies to companies who offer products/services outside of the EU.<ref name=":3" />

===Medical research===
Aggregated customer data is studied by scientific researchers employed by 23andMe for research on inherited disorders; rights to use customers' data is also sold to [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] companies for use in their research.<ref name="Pollack" /><ref name="Jeffries" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Ryan|title=23andMe sets stage for stronger ties with pharma|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/23andme-sets-stage-stronger-ties-pharma/2012-11-29|access-date=July 17, 2014|work=FierceBiotech|date=November 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808172154/http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/23andme-sets-stage-stronger-ties-pharma/2012-11-29|archive-date=August 8, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The company also collaborates with academic and government scientists.<ref name="Wired2010">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff_sergeys_search/all/1|title=Sergey Brin's Search for a Parkinson's Cure |issue=7 |last=Goetz|first=Thomas|date=June 22, 2010|access-date=April 5, 2012|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|volume=18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717095539/http://www.wired.com/2010/06/ff_sergeys_search/all/1|archive-date=July 17, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Kiss" /> In July 2012, 23andMe acquired the startup CureTogether, a crowdsourced treatment ratings website with data on over 600 medical conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/23andme-first-acquisition//|title = 23andMe Makes First Acquisition, Nabs CureTogether To Double Down On Crowdsourced Genetic Research = Jul 11, 2012|access-date = Feb 18, 2015|website = TechCrunch}}</ref>  23andMe has an optional consent that enables the individual's genetic information to be included in medical research that may be published in a scientific journal.  However, if an individual chooses not to consent for their 'personal information' to be used, their 'genetic information' and 'self-reported information' may still be used and shared with the company's third party service providers.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In 2010, 23andMe said that it was able to use its database to validate work published by the NIH: identifying mutations in the gene that codes for [[glucocerebrosidase]] as a risk factor for Parkinson's disease.<ref name="Wired2010" />

In 2015, 23andMe made a business decision to pursue [[drug discovery]] themselves, under the direction of former [[Genentech]] executive [[Richard Scheller]].<ref name=Pollack/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Herper|first1=Matthew|title=In Big Shift, 23andMe Will Invent Drugs Using Customer Data|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/03/12/23andme-enters-the-drug-business-just-as-apple-changes-it/|access-date=October 28, 2015|work=Forbes|date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> One of their main focuses is Parkinson's disease, and they are utilizing the 23andMe database to search for rare variants associated with Parkinson's in the hope of developing a drug for the disease. The company also set up research agreements with the pharmaceutical company [[Pfizer]] to explore the genetic causes of [[inflammatory bowel disease]], namely [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Herper|first1=Matthew|title=Surprise!

In 2016, a project that the company was developing to provide customers with next generation sequencing was ended, because of the fear that the results would be too complicated or vague to fit into the company's goal of providing useful information, both quickly and precisely, directly to consumers, according to Wojcicki.<ref>Pressman, Aaron. [http://fortune.com/2016/10/27/23andme-killed-next-generation-gene-sequencing/ "Why 23andme Killed Its Next Generation Gene Sequencing Project"], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', October 27, 2016. Retrieved April 17, 2018.</ref> Also in 2016, 23andMe used self-reported data from customers to locate 17 genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] that seem to be associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=N|last2=Lewis|first2=CM|title=Genetics of Depression: Progress at Last.|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=August 2017|volume=19|issue=8|pages=43|doi=10.1007/s11920-017-0803-9|pmid=28608123|pmc=5486596}}</ref>

In 2017, 23andMe, the [[Lundbeck]] pharmaceutical company, and the [[Milken Institute]] think tank started collaborations to focus on psychiatric disorders, such as [[bipolar disorder]] and [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]]. Their goals are to determine the genetic roots of such disorders, as well as pursue drug discovery in those areas.<ref name=Fortune2017>{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Sy|title=23andMe Raises Another $250 Million – And Wants to Use Your Genetic Data to Make Drugs|url=http://fortune.com/2017/09/12/23andme-250-million-sequoia-drugs/?iid=sr-link9|work=Fortune|date=September 12, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Use by law enforcement===
23andMe does not have a history of allowing its genetic profiles to be used by law enforcement to solve crimes, believing that it violates users' privacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2019/02/01/genetic-testing-consumer-dna-familytreedna-fbi/ |title=A Major DNA-Testing Company Is Sharing Some of Its Data With the FBI.
