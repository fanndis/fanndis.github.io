The '''Senate''' is the [[upper house]] of the bicameral [[Parliament of Australia]], the [[lower house]] being the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]]. The composition and powers of the Senate are established in Chapter I of the [[Constitution of Australia]]. There are a total of 76 Senators: 12 are elected from each of the six [[states and territories of Australia|Australian states]] regardless of population and 2 from each of the two autonomous internal [[states and territories of Australia|Australian territories]] (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]). Senators are popularly elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[proportional representation]].

Unlike upper houses in other [[Westminster system|Westminster-style parliamentary systems]], the Senate is vested with significant powers, including the capacity to reject all bills, including budget and appropriation bills, initiated by the government in the House of Representatives, making it a distinctive hybrid of British [[Westminster system|Westminster bicameralism]] and United States-style [[bicameralism]]. As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party or coalition, which has to maintain the confidence of the lower house, has not held a majority in the Senate since 2005-2007 (and before that since 1981) and usually needs to negotiate with other parties and independents to get legislation passed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=George|last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian constitutional law and theory : commentary and materials|date=2014|publisher=Federation Press|location=Annandale, NSW|isbn=9781862879188|page=415|edition=6th}}</ref>

==Origins and role==
[[File:Australian Senate 1923.jpg|thumb|The Australian Senate in 1923]]
The [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imp.)]] of 1900 established the Senate as part of the system of [[dominion]] government in newly [[Federation of Australia|federated Australia]]. From a comparative governmental perspective, the Australian Senate exhibits distinctive characteristics. Unlike upper Houses in other [[Westminster system]] governments, the Senate is not a vestigial body with limited legislative power. Rather it was intended to play – and does play – an active role in legislation. Rather than being modeled solely after the [[House of Lords]], as the [[Senate of Canada]] was, the Australian Senate was in part modeled after the [[United States Senate]], by giving equal representation to each state and equal powers with the lower house.<ref name="Part V">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/link.aspx?_id=AFF6CA564BC3465AA325E73053DED4AA&_z=z#chapter-01_part-05_53|title=Part V - Powers of the Parliament|language=en-AU|access-date=13 May 2017}}</ref> The Constitution intended to give less populous states added voice in a Federal legislature, while also providing for the revising role of an upper house in the Westminster system.

Although the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and [[Treasurer of Australia]], by convention, are members of the House of Representatives (after [[John Gorton]] was appointed prime minister in 1968, he resigned from the Senate and was elected to the House), other members of the [[Cabinet of Australia]] may come from either house,<ref name="senatebrief14">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief14 |title=No. 14 - Ministers in the Senate |date=December 2016 |website=Senate Briefs |publisher=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> and the two Houses have almost equal legislative power.<ref name="Part V"/> As with most upper chambers in [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]]s, the Senate cannot introduce or amend [[appropriation bill]]s (bills that authorise government expenditure of public revenue) or bills that impose taxation, that role being reserved for the lower house; it can only approve, reject or defer them. That degree of equality between the Senate and House of Representatives reflects the desire of the Constitution's authors to address smaller states' desire for strong powers for the Senate as a way of ensuring that the interests of more populous states as represented in the House of Representatives did not totally dominate the government. The Australian constitution was enacted before the confrontation in 1909 in Britain between the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]], which ultimately resulted in the restrictions placed on the powers of the House of Lords by the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]].

In practice, however, most legislation (except for [[private member's bill]]s) in the Australian Parliament is initiated by the Government, which has control over the lower house. It is then passed to the Senate, which has the opportunity to amend the bill, pass or reject it. In the majority of cases, voting takes place along [[Party line (politics)|party lines]], although there are occasional [[conscience vote]]s.

The senate is also known for its "[[Australian senate committees|senate committees]]", bodies that engage in a wide variety of inquiries. The results have no direct legislative power, but are valuable forums that raise many points of view that would otherwise not receive government or public notice.

==Electoral system==
{{see also|Electoral system of Australia}} 
The system for electing senators has changed several times since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]]. The original arrangement involved a [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] and [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] or "winner takes all" system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by [[preferential block voting]]. Block voting tended to produce [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majorities and even "wipe-outs". For instance, from 1920 to 1923 the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]] held all but one of the 36 seats, and from 1947 to 1950, the [[Australian Labor Party]] held all but three.

In 1948, [[single transferable vote]] with [[proportional representation]] on a state-by-state basis became the method for electing senators. At this time the number of Senators was expanded from 36 to 60 and it was argued that a move to proportional representation was needed to even up the balance between both major parties in the chamber. The change in voting systems has been described as an "institutional revolution" that has had the effect of limiting the government's ability to control the chamber, as well as helping the rise of Australian minor parties.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Sawer, Marian  |author2=Miskin, Sarah |name-list-style=amp| title =Papers on Parliament No. 34 Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate | publisher = Department of the Senate | year = 1999 | url = https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/senate/pubs/pops/pop34/pop34.pdf | isbn = 0 642 71061 9 }}</ref><ref name = "electing" />

From the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]] onwards, [[group voting tickets in Australia|group ticket voting]] was introduced, in order to reduce a high rate of informal voting that arose from the requirement that each candidate be given a preference, and to allow small parties and independent candidates a reasonable chance of winning a seat. This allowed voters to select a single party "Above the Line" to distribute their preferences on their behalf, but voters were still able to vote directly for individual candidates and distribute their own preferences if they wished "Below the Line" by numbering every box.<ref name="Antony Green">{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-23/the-origin-of-senate-group-ticket-voting-and-it-didnt-come-from-/9388658 |title=The Origin of Senate Group Ticket Voting, and it didn't come from the Major Parties |author=[[Antony Green]] |date=23 September 2015 |publisher=ABC |access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref>

In [[2016 Australian federal election|2016]], group tickets were abolished to avoid undue influence of preference deals amongst parties that were seen as distorting election results<ref name="ABC">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-26/aec-advertising-campaign-on-way-senators-are-elected/7356308|title=Senate voting changes explained in AEC advertisements|date=26 April 2016|website=abc.net.au|access-date=9 August 2018}}</ref> and  a form of [[optional preferential voting]] was introduced. As a result of the changes, voters may assign their preferences for parties above the line (numbering as many boxes as they wish), or individual candidates below the line, and are not required to fill all of the boxes. Both above and below the line voting now use [[optional preferential voting]]. For above the line, voters are instructed to number at least their first six preferences; however, a "savings provision" is in place to ensure that ballots will still be counted if less than six are given. For below the line, voters are required to number at least their first 12 preferences. Voters are free to continue numbering as many preferences as they like beyond the minimum number specified. Another savings provision allows ballot papers with at least 6 below the line preferences to be formal. The voting changes make it more difficult for new small parties and independent candidates to be elected to the Senate, but also allow a voter to voluntarily "exhaust" preferences — that is, to ensure their vote cannot flow to specific candidates or parties — in the event that none of the voter's candidates preferences are elected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-does-preferential-voting-work-in-the-senate-116347 |title=Explainer: how does preferential voting work in the Senate? |author=Stephen Morey |date=2 May 2019 |publisher=The Conversation |access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

The changes were subject to a challenge in front of [[High Court of Australia]] by sitting South Australian Senator [[Bob Day]] of the [[Family First Party]]. The senator argued that the changes meant the senators would not be "directly chosen by the people" as required by the constitution. The High Court rejected Day's challenge unanimously, deciding that both above the line and below the line voting were consistent with the constitution.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/13/high-court-rejects-bob-day-appeal-and-finds-senate-voting-changes-are-legal High court rejects Bob Day appeal and finds Senate voting changes are legal], [[The Guardian]], 13 May 2016</ref><ref name=2016DAY>''Day v Australian Electoral Officer for the State of South Australia'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|20|2016}}</ref>

===Ballot paper===
The Australian Senate voting paper under the single transferable vote proportional representation system resembles the following example (shown in two parts), which shows the candidates for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] senate representation in the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]].

[[File:Victorian-senate-paper-folded-01.png|640x640px|thumb|center|Senate ballot paper used in Victoria for 2016]]

To vote correctly, electors must either:
* Vote for at least six parties above the thick black line, by writing the numbers 1-6 in party boxes. Votes with less than six boxes numbered are still admitted to the count through savings provisions.
* Vote for at least twelve candidates below the thick black line, by writing the numbers 1-12 in the individual candidates' boxes. Votes with between six and twelve boxes numbered are still admitted to the count through savings provisions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_Vote/Voting_Senate.htm |title=Voting in the Senate |date=4 January 2019 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

Because each state elects six senators at each half-Senate election, the quota for election is only one-seventh or 14.3% (one third or 33.3% for territories, where only two senators are elected). Once a candidate has been elected with votes reaching the quota amount, any votes they receive in addition to this may be distributed to other candidates as preferences.

With an odd number of seats in a half-Senate election (3 or 5), 50.1% of the vote wins a majority (2/3) or (3/5).

With an even number of seats in a half-Senate election (6), 57.1% of the vote is needed to win a majority of seats (4/6).

The ungrouped candidates in the far right column do not have a box above the line. Therefore, they can only get a primary (number 1) vote from electors who vote below the line.  For this reason, some independents register as a group, either with other independents or by themselves, such as group B in the above example.

Names of parties can be shown only if the parties are registered, which requires, among other things, a minimum of 500 members.

=== Order of parties ===
The order of parties on the ballot papers and the order of ungrouped candidates are determined by a random ballot conducted by the Electoral Commission.

=== Deposit ===
Candidates, parties and groups pay a deposit of $2,000 per candidate, which is forfeited if they fail to achieve 4% of the primary vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/candidates/ |title=Candidate information |date=17 October 2019 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Public subsidy ===
Candidates, parties and groups earn a public subsidy if they gain at least 4% of the primary vote.  At the 2019 federal election, funding was $2.756 per formal first preference vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/public_funding/index.htm |title=Election funding |date=11 June 2019 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

==Membership==
Under sections 7 and 8 of the Australian Constitution:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/odgers/chap0402.htm |title=Chapter 4, Odgers' Australian Senate Practice |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date=2 February 2010 |access-date=17 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321210201/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/odgers/chap0402.htm |archive-date=21 March 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>
* The Senate must comprise an equal number of senators from each original state,
* each original state shall have at least six senators, and
* the Senate must be elected in a way that is not discriminatory among the states.

These conditions have periodically been the source of debate, and within these conditions, the composition and rules of the Senate have varied significantly since federation.

===Size and nexus===
Under [[Section 24 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 24 of the Constitution]], the number of members of the House of Representatives has to be "as nearly as practicable" double the number of senators.

The reasons for the nexus are twofold: a desire to maintain a constant influence for the smaller states, and maintain a constant balance of the two Houses in the event of a joint sitting after a double dissolution. A [[1967 Australian referendum (Parliament)|referendum]] in 1967 to eliminate the nexus was rejected.

The size of the Senate has changed over the years. The Constitution originally provided for six senators for each state, resulting in a total of 36 senators.

The Constitution permits the Parliament to increase the number of senators, provided that equal numbers of senators from each original state are maintained; accordingly, in 1948, Senate representation was increased from 6 to 10 senators for each state, increasing the total to 60.

In 1975, the two territories, the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], were given an entitlement to elect two senators each for the first time, bringing the number to 64.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/ |title=Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973. No. 39, 1974 |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |access-date=22 March 2017}}</ref> The senators from the Northern Territory also represent constituents from Australia's Indian Ocean Territories ([[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]), while the senators from the Australian Capital Territory also represent voters from the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and since 1 July 2016, [[Norfolk Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Enrolling_to_vote/special_category/Norfolk_Island_electors.htm |title=Norfolk Island Electors |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=2016 |access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>

The latest expansion in Senate numbers took place in 1984, when the number of senators from each state was increased from 10 to 12, resulting in a total of 76 senators.<ref name = "electing">Department of the Senate, ''Senate Brief'' No. 1, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief01.htm 'Electing Australia's Senators'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829204046/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief01.htm |date=29 August 2007 }}. Retrieved August 2007.</ref>

===Term===
Senators normally serve fixed six-year terms (from 1 July to 30 June). At most federal elections, the seats of 40 of the 76 Senators (half of the 72 Senators from the six states and all four of the Senators from the territories) are contested, along with the entire House of Representatives; such an election is sometimes known as a half-Senate election. The seats of Senators elected at a half-Senate election are not contested at the next election, provided it is a half-Senate election. However, under some circumstances, the entire Senate (and the House of Representatives) is dissolved early, in what is known as a [[double dissolution]]. Following a double dissolution, half the Senators representing states serve terms ending on the third 30 June following the election (two to three years) and the rest serve a five to six-year term. [[Section 13 of the Constitution of Australia#Allocation of terms|Section 13 of the Constitution]] requires the Senate to allocate long and short terms amongst its members. The term of Senators representing a territory expires at the same time as there is an election for the House of Representatives. While there is no constitutional requirement for the election of Senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives.

Section 13 of the Constitution requires that in half-Senate elections, the election of State senators shall take place within one year before the places become vacant. The actual election date is determined by the Governor of each State, who acts on the advice of the State Premier. The Governors almost always act on the recommendation of the Governor-General, with the last independent Senate election writ being issued by the Governor of Queensland during the [[Gair Affair]] in 1974.

Slightly more than half of the Senate is contested at each general election (half of the 72 state senators, and all four of the territory senators), along with the entire House of Representatives. Except in the case of a [[double dissolution]], senators for the states are elected for fixed terms of six years, commencing on 1 July following the election, and ceasing on 30 June six years later.

The term of the four senators from the territories is not fixed, but is defined by the dates of the general elections for the House of Representatives, the period between which can vary greatly, to a maximum of three years and three months. Territory senators commence their terms on the day that they are elected. Their terms expire the day prior to the following general election day.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/sota1973408/s6.html ''Section 6 of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973'']. Retrieved August 2010.</ref>

While there is no constitutional requirement for the election of Senators to take place at the same time as those for members of the House of Representatives, the government usually synchronises the dates of elections for the Senate and House of Representatives. However, because their terms do not coincide, the incoming Parliament will for some time comprise the new House of Representatives and the old Senate, except for the senators representing the territories, until the new senators start their term on the next 1 July.

Following a double dissolution, all 76 senators face re-election. If there is an early House election outside the 12-month period in which Senate elections can occur, the synchronisation of the election will be disrupted, and there can be half-Senate elections without a concurrent House election. The last time this occurred was on [[1970 Australian Senate election|21 November 1970]].

===Quota Size===
The number of votes that a candidate must receive to be elected to the senate is referred to as a 'Quota'. The quota is worked out by dividing the number of formal votes by one more than the number of vacancies to be filled and then adding one to the result.<ref name = "count">https://aec.gov.au/Voting/counting/files/senate-count-process.pdf</ref> The 2019 senate election was a half senate election, so 6 senate vacancies were contested in each state. At this election, the quotas in each state were:

===Issues with equal representation===
Each state elects the same number of senators, meaning there is equal representation for each of the Australian states, regardless of population, so the Senate, like many upper Houses, does not adhere to the principle of "[[one vote one value]]". [[Tasmania]], with a population of around 500,000, elects the same number of senators as [[New South Wales]], which has a population of over 7 million. Because of this imbalance, governments favoured by the more populous states are occasionally frustrated by the extra power the smaller states have in the Senate, to the degree that former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] famously referred to the Senate's members as "unrepresentative swill".<ref>[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1992-11-04%2F0030%22 Question without Notice: Loan Council Arrangements] House Hansard,</ref> The proportional election system within each state ensures that the Senate incorporates more political diversity than the lower house, which is basically a [[Two-party system|two party]] body. The elected membership of the Senate more closely reflects the first voting preference of the electorate as a whole than does the composition of the House of Representatives, despite the large discrepancies from state to state in the ratio of voters to senators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|date=1 November 1999|title=Australian Democracy: Modifying Majoritarianism?|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|volume=34|issue=3|pages=313–326|doi=10.1080/10361149950254|issn=1036-1146}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/pops/pop34/a01.pdf|title=Overview: Institutional Design and the Role of the Senate|last1=Sawer|first1=Marian|conference=Representation and Institutional Change: 50 Years of Proportional Representation in the Senate|volume=34|editor=Marian Sawer |editor2=Sarah Miskin|date=1999|pages=1–12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117111841/http://aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/pops/pop34/a01.pdf|archive-date=17 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/just-how-representative-are-the-houses-of-parliament-of-how-australians-vote-62160|title=Just how representative are the houses of parliament of how Australians vote?|last=Trudgian|first=Tim|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref> This often means that the composition of the Senate is different from that of the House of Representatives, contributing to the Senate's function as a [[Upper house|house of review]].

With proportional representation, and the small majorities in the Senate compared to the generally larger majorities in the House of Representatives, and the requirement that the number of members of the House be "nearly as practicable" twice that of the Senate, a joint sitting after a double dissolution is more likely than not to lead to a victory for the House over the Senate. When the Senate had an odd number of Senators retiring at an election (3 or 5), 51% of the vote would lead to a clear majority of 3 out of 5 per state. With an even number of Senators retiring at an election, it takes 57% of the vote to win 4 out of 6 seats, which may be insurmountable. This gives the House an unintended extra advantage in joint sittings but not in ordinary elections, where the Senate may be too evenly balanced to get House legislation through.

The Government does not need the support of the Senate to stay in office; however, the Senate can block or defer supply, an action that precipitated a [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis in 1975]]. However, if the governing party does not have a majority in the Senate, it can often find its agenda frustrated in the upper house. This can be the case even when the government has a large majority in the House.

===Parties===
The overwhelming majority of senators have always been elected as representatives of political parties. Parties which currently have representation in the Senate are:
* [[Coalition (Australia)|The Coalition]] – [[Liberal Party of Australia]], [[National Party of Australia]]
* [[Australian Labor Party]]
* [[Australian Greens]]
* [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]]
* [[Centre Alliance]]
* [[Jacqui Lambie Network]]

Other parties that have achieved Senate representation in the past include the [[Australian Conservatives]], [[United Australia Party (2013)|United Australia]], [[Derryn Hinch's Justice Party]], [[Family First Party]], [[Australian Democrats]], [[Palmer United Party]], [[Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party]], [[Nuclear Disarmament Party]], [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labour Party]].

Due to the need to obtain votes statewide, [[Independent politicians in Australia|independent candidates]] have difficulty getting elected. The exceptions in recent times have been elected in less populous States—the former Tasmanian Senator [[Brian Harradine]] and the former South Australian Senator [[Nick Xenophon]]. It is less uncommon for a senator initially elected representing a party to become an independent, most recently in the cases of Senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] not joining the Conservatives following its merger with Family First, Senators [[Rod Culleton]] and [[Fraser Anning]] resigning from One Nation, and Senator [[Steve Martin (Australian politician)|Steve Martin]] being expelled from the Jacqui Lambie Network.

The Australian Senate serves as a model for some politicians in Canada, particularly in the Western provinces, who wish to reform the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] so that it takes a more active legislative role.<ref>Ted Morton, [http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/morton 'Senate Envy: Why Western Canada Wants What Australia Has'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514175438/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/morton |date=14 May 2013 }}, ''Senate Envy and Other Lectures in the Senate Occasional Lecture Series, 2001–2002'', Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref>

There are also small factions in the United Kingdom (both from the right and left) who wish to the see the House of Lords take on a structure similar to that of the Australian Senate.<ref>{{cite book| last = Renwick| first = Alan| title = House of Lords Reform: A Briefing Paper | publisher = Political Studies Association| year = 2011| url = https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HL%20Reform%20briefing%20paper.pdf}}</ref>

===Casual vacancies===
{{see also|Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|List of Australian Senate appointments}}
Section 15 of the Constitution provides that a [[Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|casual vacancy]] of a State senator shall be filled by the State Parliament. If the previous senator was a member of a particular political party the replacement must come from the same party, but the State Parliament may choose not to fill the vacancy, in which case Section 11 requires the Senate to proceed regardless. If the State Parliament happens to be in recess when the vacancy occurs, the Constitution provides that the State Governor can appoint someone to fill the place until fourteen days after the State Parliament resumes sitting.

== Procedure ==
[[File:Senate panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Australian Senate]]

=== Work ===
The Australian Senate typically sits for 50 to 60 days a year.{{efn|Figures are available for each year on the Senate StatsNet.}} Most of those days are grouped into 'sitting fortnights' of two four-day weeks. These are in turn arranged in three periods: the autumn sittings, from February to April; the winter sittings, which commence with the delivery of the budget in the House of Representatives on the first sitting day of May and run through to June or July; and the spring sittings, which commence around August and continue until December, and which typically contain the largest number of the year's sitting days.

The senate has a regular schedule that structures its typical working week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/work/routineofbus.htm |title=Senate weekly routine of business |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=Australian Senate |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126125039/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/work/routineofbus.htm |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref>

====Dealing with legislation====
All [[bill (law)|bills]] must be passed by a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before they become law. Most bills originate in the House of Representatives, and the great majority are introduced by the government.

The usual procedure is for notice to be given by a government minister the day before the bill is introduced into the Senate. Once introduced the bill goes through several stages of consideration. It is given a [[reading (legislature)|first reading]], which represents the bill's formal introduction into the chamber.

<blockquote>The first reading is followed by debate on the principle or policy of the bill (the second reading debate). Agreement to the bill in principle is indicated by a second reading, after which the detailed provisions of the bill are considered by one of a number of methods (see below). Bills may also be referred by either House to their specialised standing or select committees. Agreement to the policy and the details is confirmed by a third and final reading. These processes ensure that a bill is systematically considered before being agreed to.<ref>Australian Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief08.htm 'The Senate and Legislation'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924114919/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief08.htm |date=24 September 2008 }}, ''Senate Brief'', No. 8, 2008, Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref></blockquote>
The Senate has detailed rules in its standing orders that govern how a bill is considered at each stage.<ref>Australian Senate, [http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/guides/briefno09.htm 'Consideration of legislation'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926083250/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/guides/briefno09.htm |date=26 September 2008 }}, ''Brief Guides to Senate Procedure'', No. 9, Department of the Senate, Canberra.</ref> This process of consideration can vary greatly in the amount of time taken. Consideration of some bills is completed in a single day, while complex or controversial legislation may take months to pass through all stages of Senate scrutiny. The Constitution provides that if the Senate vote is equal, the question shall pass in the negative.

====Committees====
{{Main|Australian Senate committees}}
[[Image:AustralianSenateCommitteeRm.JPG|thumb|alt=A meeting room containing a large horseshoe-shaped desk, with red leather office chairs surrounding its outside edge, a microphone mounted in the desk in front of each chair|A Senate committee room in Parliament House, Canberra]]
[[File:Australian Parliament Parliamentary Committees.webm|thumb|left|A short video on Australian Parliamentary Committees]]
In addition to the work of the main chamber, the Senate also has a large number of [[Australian Senate committees|committees]] which deal with matters referred to them by the Senate. These committees also conduct hearings three times a year in which the government's budget and operations are examined. These are known as estimates hearings. Traditionally dominated by scrutiny of government activities by non-government senators, they provide the opportunity for all senators to ask questions of ministers and public officials. This may occasionally include government senators examining activities of independent publicly funded bodies, or pursuing issues arising from previous governments' terms of office. There is however a convention that senators do not have access to the files and records of previous governments when there has been an election resulting in a change in the party in government. Once a particular inquiry is completed the members of the committee can then produce a report, to be tabled in Parliament, outlining what they have discovered as well as any recommendations that they have produced for the Government to consider.<ref name = "odgcom">{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Odgers_Australian_Senate_Practice/Chapter_16 |title=Odgers' Australian Senate Practice Fourteenth Edition Chapter 16 - Committees|date=2017 |access-date=19 March 2017}}</ref>

The ability of the Houses of Parliament to establish committees is referenced in Section 49 of the Constitution, which states that, "''The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth.''"<ref name="con49">[[Constitution of Australia]], section 49.</ref><ref name = "odgcom"/>

Parliamentary committees can be given a wide range of powers. One of the most significant powers is the ability to summon people to attend hearings in order to give evidence and submit documents. Anyone who attempts to hinder the work of a Parliamentary committee may be found to be in [[contempt of Parliament]]. There are a number of ways that witnesses can be found in contempt, these include; refusing to appear before a committee when summoned, refusing to answer a question during a hearing or to produce a document, or later being found to have lied to or misled a committee. Anyone who attempts to influence a witness may also be found in contempt.<ref name="com">{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_4_-_Committees |title=Infosheet 4 - Committees |publisher=aph.gov.au |access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> Other powers include the ability to meet throughout Australia, to establish subcommittees and to take evidence in both public and private hearings.<ref name = "odgcom"/>

Proceedings of committees are considered to have the same legal standing as proceedings of Parliament. They are recorded by [[Hansard]], except for private hearings, and also operate under [[Parliamentary privilege]]. Every participant, including committee members and witnesses giving evidence, is protected from being prosecuted under any civil or criminal action for anything they may say during a hearing. Written evidence and documents received by a committee are also protected.<ref name="com"/><ref name = "odgcom"/>

====Holding governments to account====
One of the functions of the Senate, both directly and through its [[Australian Senate committees|committees]], is to scrutinise government activity. The vigour of this scrutiny has been fuelled for many years by the fact that the party in government has seldom had a majority in the Senate. Whereas in the House of Representatives the government's majority has sometimes limited that chamber's capacity to implement executive scrutiny, the opposition and minor parties have been able to use their Senate numbers as a basis for conducting inquiries into government operations. When the [[Howard Government]] won control of the Senate in 2005, it sparked a debate about the effectiveness of the Senate in holding the government of the day accountable for its actions. Government members argued that the Senate continued to be a forum of vigorous debate, and its committees continued to be active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_432006.html |title=Media Release 43/2006 – Senate remains robust under Government majority |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=30 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927145249/http://www.financeminister.gov.au/media/2006/mr_432006.html |archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref> The Opposition leader in the Senate suggested that the government had attenuated the scrutinising activities of the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chrisevans.alp.org.au/news/1105/senatespeeches10-01.php |title=Senator Chris Evans, The tyranny of the majority (speech) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 November 2005 |quote="Labor has accused the Government of 'ramming' bills through the Senate – but Labor "guillotined" Parliamentary debate more than twice the number of times in their 13 years in Government than the Coalition has over the last decade.

===Voting===
Senators are called upon to vote on matters before the Senate. These votes are called ''divisions'' in the case of Senate business, or ''ballots'' where the vote is to choose a senator to fill an office of the Senate (such as the [[President of the Senate (Australia)|President]]).<ref>''Senate Standing Orders'', numbers 7, 10, 98–105, 163</ref>

Party discipline in [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]] is extremely tight, so divisions almost always are decided on party lines. Nevertheless, the existence of minor parties holding the balance of power in the Senate has made divisions in that chamber more important and occasionally more dramatic than in the House of Representatives.

When a division is to be held, bells ring throughout the parliament building for four minutes, during which time senators must go to the chamber. At the end of that period the doors are locked and a vote is taken, by identifying and counting senators according to the side of the chamber on which they sit (ayes to the right of the chair, noes to the left). The whole procedure takes around eight minutes. Senators with commitments that keep them from the chamber may make arrangements in advance to be 'paired' with a senator of the opposite political party, so that their absence does not affect the outcome of the vote.

The Senate contains an even number of senators, so a tied vote is a real prospect (which regularly occurs when the party numbers in the chamber are finely balanced). [[Section 23 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 23 of the Constitution]] requires that in the event of a tied division, the question is resolved in the negative. The system is however different for ballots for offices such as the President. If such a ballot is tied, the [[Clerk of the Australian Senate|Clerk of the Senate]] decides the outcome by the drawing of lots. In reality, conventions govern most ballots, so this situation does not arise.

====Political parties and voting outcomes====
The extent to which party discipline determines the outcome of parliamentary votes is highlighted by the rarity with which members of the same political party will find themselves on opposing sides of a vote. The exceptions are where a [[conscience vote]] is allowed by one or more of the political parties; and occasions where a member of a political party [[crossing the floor|crosses the floor]] of the chamber to vote against the instructions of their [[whip (politics)|party whip]]. Crossing the floor very rarely occurs, but is more likely in the Senate than in the House of Representatives.<ref>Deirdre McKeown, Rob Lundie and Greg Baker, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2005-06/06rn11.pdf 'Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003132418/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2005-06/06rn11.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }}, ''Research Note'', No. 11, 2005–06, Department of Parliamentary Services, Canberra.</ref>

One feature of the government having a majority in both chambers between 1 July 2005 and the 2007 elections was the potential for an increased emphasis on internal differences between members of the government coalition parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au/papers/20050630_uhr.pdf |title=How Democratic is Parliament?

== Where the Houses disagree ==
=== Double dissolutions and joint sittings ===
If the Senate rejects or fails to pass a proposed law, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months the Senate refuses to pass the same piece of legislation, the government may either abandon the bill or continue to revise it, or, in certain circumstances outlined in section 57 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], the Prime Minister can advise the Governor-General to dissolve the entire parliament in a [[double dissolution]]. In such an event, the entirety of the Senate faces re-election, as does the House of Representatives, rather than only about half the chamber as is normally the case. After a double dissolution election, if the bills in question are reintroduced, and if they again fail to pass the Senate, the Governor-General may agree to a ''joint sitting'' of the two Houses in an attempt to pass the bills. [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|Such a sitting]] has only occurred once, in 1974.

The double dissolution mechanism is not available for bills that originate in the Senate and are blocked in the lower house.

On 8 October 2003, the then Prime Minister [[John Howard]] initiated public discussion of whether the mechanism for the resolution of deadlocks between the Houses should be reformed. High levels of support for the existing mechanism, and a very low level of public interest in that discussion, resulted in the abandonment of these proposals.<ref>{{cite web

=== Allocating terms after a double dissolution ===

After a double dissolution election, section 13 of the Constitution requires the Senate to divide the senators into two classes, with the first class having a three-year "short term", and the second class a six-year "long term". The Senate may adopt any approach it wants to determine how to allocate the long and short terms, however two methods are currently 'on the table':
* "elected-order" method, where the Senators elected first attain a six-year term. This approach tends to favour minor party candidates as it gives greater weight to their first preference votes;<ref name="whichones">{{cite web

The Senate applied the "elected-order" method following the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 double dissolution election]].<ref name=longnshort /> Since that time the Senate has passed resolutions on several occasions indicating its intention to use the re-count method to allocate seats at any future double dissolution, which Green describes as a fairer approach but notes could be ignored if a majority of Senators opted for the "elected-order" method instead.<ref name=longnshort /> In both double dissolution elections since 1987, the "elected order" method was used.

==Blocking supply==
{{quote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government. Because of the principles of responsible government a Prime Minister who cannot obtain supply, including money for carrying on the ordinary services of government, must either advise a general election or resign. If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary. But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important aspect – if he cannot get supply he must resign or advise an election.|author=Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]|source=Statement (dated 11 November 1975)<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|access-date=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223060041/http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

The constitutional text denies the Senate the power to originate or amend appropriation bills, in deference to the conventions of the classical [[Westminster system]]. Under a traditional Westminster system, the [[executive (government)|executive]] government is responsible for its use of public funds to the lower house, which has the power to bring down a government by [[Loss of supply|blocking its access to supply]]&nbsp;– i.e. [[revenue]] appropriated through taxation. The arrangement as expressed in the Australian Constitution, however, still leaves the Senate with the power to reject supply bills or defer their passage&nbsp;– undoubtedly one of the Senate's most powerful abilities.

The ability to block supply was exercised in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. The [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] used its numbers in the Senate to defer supply bills, refusing to deal with them until an election was called for both Houses of Parliament, an election which it hoped to win. The [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the day, [[Gough Whitlam]], contested the legitimacy of the blocking and refused to resign. The crisis brought to a head two Westminster conventions that, under the Australian constitutional system, were in conflict&nbsp;– firstly, that a government may continue to govern for as long as it has the support of the [[lower house]], and secondly, that a government that no longer has access to supply must either resign or be dismissed. The crisis was resolved in November 1975 when Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] dismissed Whitlam's government and appointed a caretaker government on condition that elections for both Houses of parliament be held.<ref name=kerr/> This action in itself was a source of controversy and debate at that time on the proper usage of the Senate's ability to block supply.

The blocking of supply alone cannot force a double dissolution. There must be legislation repeatedly blocked by the Senate which the government can then choose to use as a trigger for a double dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=An Early Double Dissolution?

===2016 election===
