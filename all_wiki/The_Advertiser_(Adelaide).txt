===''The South Australian Advertiser''===
An early major daily colonial newspaper, ''[[Adelaide Times|The Adelaide Times]]'', ceased publication on 9 May 1858. Shortly afterwards, [[John Henry Barrow|Reverend John Henry Barrow]], a former editor of the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' founded the morning newspaper ''The South Australian Advertiser'' and a companion weekly ''[[The Chronicle (South Australia)|The South Australian Weekly Chronicle]].'' The original owners were Barrow and [[Charles Henry Goode]], and the first issues were published on 12 July 1858 and 17 July 1858 respectively.<ref name="SAAdvertiser" /><ref>C. M.

In 1863 the company started an afternoon newspaper ''[[The Express (Adelaide)|The Express]]'' as a competitor to ''[[The Telegraph (Adelaide)|The Telegraph]]'', an afternoon/evening daily paper independent of both ''The Advertiser'' and the ''South Australian Register''.<ref name="ATS">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article73374925 |author=[[A.

In December 1866, the syndicate bought the now defunct ''The Telegraph'' (by this time renamed ''The Daily Telegraph'' with a morning edition and a weekend ''Weekly Mail'') at auction, and incorporated it with ''The Express'' to form ''[[The Express and Telegraph]]''.<ref name="ATS" />

In 1871, when the shareholders were Barrow, Goode, Robert Stuckey, Thomas Graves, [[William Parkin]], Thomas King, James Counsell, and George Williams Chinner, the partnership was dissolved and the business was carried on by Barrow and King.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28606478 |title=Dissolution of Partnership: Special Notice |newspaper=The South Australian Advertiser |location=Adelaide |date=2 December 1871 |accessdate=4 April 2013 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> J. H. Barrow died on 22 August 1874, and Thomas King ran the papers for himself and Mrs. Barrow for about five years.<ref name="ATS" /> In 1879 a new firm was created, consisting of Thomas King, [[Fred Burden]] (son of P. H. Burden and adopted son of J. H. Barrow), and [[John Langdon Bonython]]. In July 1884, Thomas King dropped out, and the firm of Burden & Bonython was formed to run the paper.<ref name="ATS" />

On 1 April 1889, the main publication was re-branded with an abbreviated title, ''The Advertiser''.<ref name="SAAdvertiser" /> In December 1891, Burden retired, and sold his share of the company to Bonython,<ref name="langdon">W.

As well as being a talented newspaper editor, he also supported the movement towards the [[Federation of Australia]]. Later, in 1923, after a run of 60 years, ''The Express'' was stopped just as its renamed rival, ''The News'', was starting. On 12 January 1929, ''The Mail'' announced that Bonython had sold ''The Advertiser'' for £1,250,000 to a group of Melbourne financiers<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59855083|title=Sir Langdon Bonython Sells 'The Advertiser' for More Than £1,000,000|date=12 January 1929|work=The Mail|accessdate=17 June 2012|publisher=Trove (trove.nla.gov.au)|page=1}}</ref> ''[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]'', an external media company, now had the controlling stake, but Bonython still retained a 48.7% interest.

=== News Corp Australia ===
On the death of [[Keith Murdoch]] in 1952, ownership of ''The News'' and ''The Mail'' passed to his son [[Rupert Murdoch]] via [[News Limited]]. Following the handover, and in response to suggestions of external influences from Victoria made by competing newspaper ''The Mail'', the Chairman of ''The Advertiser's'' board published its policy in ''The Advertiser'' as follows:
<blockquote>"It is the same today as when the late Sir Langdon Bonython was in sole control. It is based upon a profound pride and belief in South Australia, and the system of private enterprise which has made this State what it is."<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48923949 "The Newspapers of South Australia"] ''The Advertiser'' (24 November 1953). Retrieved 2 January 2014.</ref></blockquote>

On 24 October 1953 the company launched the ''Sunday Advertiser'' in direct competition to News Limited's ''The Mail'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nla.gov.au/anplan/heritage/1951-2005.html|author=Rod Kirkpatrick|publisher=Australian Newspaper History Group|title=Press Timeline|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref> but failed to outreach its rival,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47622793 |title=Company Meeting |newspaper=The Advertiser (Adelaide) |volume=97 |issue=29,942 |location=South Australia |date=1 October 1954 |accessdate=1 June 2016 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> though no doubt affecting its profitability. It ceased publication five years or so later, after which the by then renamed ''Sunday Mail'' advertised itself as a joint publication of Advertiser Newspapers and News Ltd., and incorporated many of the ''Sunday Advertiser'' regular features. It had also introduced colour graphics on the comics page (rather primitive by today's standards), but this was dropped shortly after joint publication commenced.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In addition, ''[[Messenger Newspapers|The Messenger]]'', published since 1951 was partially purchased in 1962, and fully owned by 1983. When Murdoch acquired ''The Herald and Weekly Times'' in 1987, he also acquired the remaining 48.7% share of ''The Advertiser''.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122119582 "News Corp moves to 'tie up a few loose ends'"] ''The Canberra Times ''(2 September 1987)''. ''Retrieved 2014-01-02.</ref> He sold ''The News'' in 1987, and it was closed in 1992. Murdoch then changed the format of ''The Advertiser'' from a broadsheet to a tabloid in November 1997, and the [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]] and content [[font]] and layout was modernised in September 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inma.org/article/index.cfm/37879-page-masthead-re-design-revitalises-a-newspaper-brand|title=Page, masthead re-design revitalises a newspaper brand|last=Evans|first=Matt|work=INMA|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}</ref>

==Circulation==
''The Advertiser'' is available for purchase throughout [[South Australia]] and some towns and regions in [[New South Wales]], Victoria and the [[Northern Territory]] located near or adjacent to the South Australia state border such as [[Broken Hill]], [[Mildura]], [[Nhill, Victoria|Nhill]] and [[Alice Springs]]. According to ''The Advertiser'''s website, the newspaper is read by over 580,000 people each weekday, and by more than 740,000 people each Saturday.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Circulation figures reported in May 2016 by [[Roy Morgan Research]] showed a continuing decline in readership, of 324,000 on weekdays, and 371,000 on Saturdays.<ref>[https://indaily.com.au/news/business/2016/05/06/messenger-newspapers-to-reduce-home-deliveries/ Messenger newspapers to reduce home deliveries] ''InDaily'', 6 May 2016.
