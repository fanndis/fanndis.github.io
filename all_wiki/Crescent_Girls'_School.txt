'''Crescent Girls' School (CGS)''' is a premier autonomous girls' school in [[Singapore]]. Founded in 1956, it is one of the schools under the Worldwide Microsoft Innovative Schools Programme.

== History==
Crescent's story began in 1955 when the then Alexandra Estate Secondary School was founded with an intake of 117 boys and 53 girls. A year later the boys were transferred to Pasir Panjang Secondary School. Miss [[Evelyn Norris]] took over as Principal from Col. S.C. Thong and Crescent Girls' School came into being in 1956.

The crest, motto and school song date from the school's early history. The yellow and peacock blue uniforms were very much as they are today. Crescent's Brass Band, which later became the Symphonic Band, won its first gold medal two years later. 

Many buildings were added or acquired over the years from 1973 to 1990 at the Prince Charles Square. In December 1990, the school moved to temporary premises at Queensway to enable the rebuilding of Crescent Girls' School on its old site.

From January 1994, the school functioned from the old site with a brand new school building and a new address: 357 Tanglin Road, Singapore 247961. The latest addition to the school building is the Arts Conservatory, which was launched by the previous Minister of Education, Mr. [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]], in July 2006.

The school was declared by [[Bill Gates]] at the 2007 Global Leaders Forum (January 31, 2007) as mentor school for schools of the future around the world.<ref>"Innovative Schools program participating members" [http://www.microsoft.com/education/pil/ISc_members.aspx List of members and mentor schools.]</ref> Crescent now mentors schools in 12 countries under the Worldwide Microsoft Innovative Schools Programme.

On 26 January 2010, the Hewlett-Packard-Crescent Girls' School Green Lab@CGS was officially launched by RADM Ronnie Tay, CEO of IDA. The Green Lab@CGS, a collaboration between Hewlett-Packard and Crescent, was initiated due to rising concerns about the environment and [[global warming]].

On 17 May 2010, Crescent set a new record in the Singapore Book of Records for the most people wearing Friendship Bands at one location with 1295 participants. The Friendship Bands, made by the students and staff, are part of Crescent's contribution to the first-ever Youth Olympic Games. The Friendship Bands would be presented to the YOG athletes from around the world.

Crescent Girls' School was awarded the School Excellence Award, the highest award in the MOE Masterplan of Awards. {{Fact|date=June 2013}}.
