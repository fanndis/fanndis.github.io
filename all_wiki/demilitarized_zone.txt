A '''demilitarized zone''', '''DMZ''' or '''DZ'''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oren|first1=Michael|title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|date=June 3, 2003|publisher=Presidio Press|isbn=978-0345461926|page=7}}<!--|accessdate=28 August 2014--></ref> is an area in which treaties or agreements between nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. A DMZ often lies along an established frontier or boundary between two or more military powers or alliances. A DMZ may sometimes form a ''de facto'' international border, such as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|38th parallel between North and South Korea]]. Other examples of demilitarized zones are a {{convert|120|mi|km|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Iraq-Kuwait barrier|area between Iraq and Kuwait]], [[Politics of Antarctica|Antarctica]] (preserved for scientific exploration and study) and [[Politics of outer space|outer space]] (space more than {{convert|100|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}} from the earth's surface).

Many demilitarized zones are considered [[neutral territory]] because neither side is allowed to control it, even for non-combat administration. Some zones remain demilitarized after an agreement has awarded control to a state which (under the DMZ terms) had originally ceded its right to maintain military forces in the disputed territory. It is also possible for powers to agree on the demilitarization of a zone without formally settling their respective territorial claims, enabling the dispute to be resolved by peaceful means such as diplomatic dialogue or an international court.

Several demilitarized zones have also unintentionally become [[wildlife preserve]]s because their land is unsafe for construction or less exposed to human disturbances (including hunting). Examples include the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Cypriot Demilitarized Zone]] ([[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|The Green Line]]), and the former [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]] which divided Vietnam into two countries ([[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]) from 21 July 1954 to 2 July 1976.

==Former demilitarized zones==
[[File:Gibraltar map.png|thumb|right|alt=Old map of the Gibraltar peninsula|Historical map of the [[promontory]] of Gibraltar.]]
* A neutral territory was established between the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]] and [[Spain]] after the end of the [[Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar|1727 siege]]. A strip of land 600 [[toise]]s (about {{convert|1.2|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on|disp=or}}) long,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} more than two cannon shots' distance between the British and Spanish guns, was called "the neutral ground" and shown as such on older maps. In 1908, the British built a fence in a portion claimed to be the British half of the neutral territory. Spain [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|does not recognize]] British sovereignty over the isthmus (including the border), asserting it is Spanish soil. Although both the United Kingdom and Spain used to be part of the [[European Union]] (before the United Kingdom's exit), the border was a ''[[de facto]]'' international frontier with customs and immigration checks; Spain does not formally recognize it as a "frontier", referring to it as a "fence". Whatever its name, Gibraltar opted out of the [[European Union Customs Union]] and is not part of the [[Schengen Area]]; the border is open 24 hours a day, with [[customs]] duties payable on designated goods entering Spain or Gibraltar.
*[[Rhineland]] – The [[Treaty of Versailles]] designated the Rhineland as a demilitarized zone after [[World War I]], prohibiting the [[Weimar Republic]] from deploying its [[Reichswehr|military]] there. It was [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|re-occupied and re-militarized]] in 1936 by [[Nazi Germany]] in violation of international treaties.
*[[Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone]] – The Uqair Protocol established a demilitarized zone between the [[Sultanate of Nejd]] and the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], which at the time was a [[League of Nations mandate]] administered by the [[British Empire]]. Nejd was later incorporated into the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]]. The zone was partitioned in 1981 but the treaty was not filed with the [[United Nations]]. The zone was finally officially abolished during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], when Iraq and Saudi Arabia cancelled all international agreements with each other. 
*[[Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone]] – The Uqair Protocol established a neutral zone between the Sultanate of Nejd and the [[British protectorate]] of [[Kuwait]] in 1922. It was partitioned by mutual agreement in 1970.
*Israel and Egypt:
**Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], a DMZ (the [[El Auja Zone]]) was created by the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] between Israel and Egypt.
*Israel and Jordan:
**The Israeli enclave and Jordanian area on [[Mount Scopus#Modern era|Mt. Scopus]] was designated as a DMZ.
**The area around the [[Latrun]] salient.
*Israel and Syria: Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, three DMZs were created by the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] between Israel and Syria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MAPS/newpdf/Israel-Syria-demilitarized.pdf |title=Palestine Maps |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215180052/http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/MAPS/newpdf/Israel-Syria-demilitarized.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2006 |access-date=9 October 2018 |work=[[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]]}}</ref>
*China – The Imperial Japanese Army conquered [[Manchuria]] between September 1931 and February 1932, when they proclaimed the region the state of [[Manchukuo]]. In May 1933, the [[Tanggu Truce]] between China and Japan was concluded, establishing a demilitarized zone between Manchukuo and China. In 1937 Japan violated this truce with an invasion of the remainder of China. In 1945, after the fall of the Japanese empire at the end of the [[Pacific War|Asia-Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]], Manchuria was re-incorporated into China.
*[[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]] – The demilitarized zone between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] was established in July 1954 as a result of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] ending the war between the [[Viet Minh]] and [[France]]. The DMZ in Vietnam officially lay at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]] and ended in 1976; in reality, it extended about {{cvt|1|mi|km|0|order=flip}} on either side of the [[Bến Hải River]] and west to east from the [[Laos|Lao]] border to the [[South China Sea]].
*Norway and Sweden established a demilitarized zone of 1&nbsp;km (1,100 yards) on each side of their border after the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]] in 1905. The zone was abolished by mutual agreement in 1993.
*[[El Caguán DMZ]] – A demilitarized zone was established in southern [[Colombia]] between 1999 and 2002, during the failed [[1999–2002 FARC–Government peace process|peace process]] that involved the Government of [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Andrés Pastrana]] and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC).
