== History ==

==={{anchor|Spinoffs & name}}Name===
In 1995, [[Lucent Technologies]] was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[[Avaya#cite note-CNN-7|<sup>[7]</sup>]]

Avaya was then spun off from Lucent as its own company in 2000 (Lucent would merge with Alcatel SA in 2006, becoming [[Alcatel-Lucent]], in turn being purchased by [[Nokia]] in 2016). It remained a public company from 2000 to 2007, when it was purchased by [[private equity firm]]s.

In 2001, Avaya Interaction Center - software for customer relationship management - was released, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role that applications would play in making communications improve business performance.

On December 15, 2017, it once again became a public company, trading under the stock ticker AVYA.<ref name="2018listing" />

=== Management ===
In August 2020, Avaya announced Simon Vatcher 's appointment as Managing Director for Australia and New Zealand as the company seeks to drive long-term digital strategies and accelerate operational recovery for regional organizations and businesses.<ref>{{Cite web|date=20 August 2020|title=Avaya appoints new managing director for A/NZ, refines channel program|url=https://channellife.com.au/story/avaya-appoints-new-managing-director-for-a-nz-refines-channel-program|access-date=21 August 2020|website=ChannelLife}}</ref>
