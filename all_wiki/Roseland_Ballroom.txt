The '''Roseland Ballroom''' <!--(also referred to as '''Roseland Dance City'''){{cn}}--> was a multipurpose hall, in a converted [[ice skating]] rink, with a colorful ballroom dancing pedigree, in [[New York City]]'s [[Theater District, New York|theater district]], on [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] in [[Manhattan]].

The venue, according to its website, accommodated 3,200 standing (with an additional 300 upstairs), 2,500 for a dance party, between 1,300 and 1,500 in theatre style, 800-1,000 for a sit-down dinner, and 1,500 for a buffet and dancing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roselandballroom.com/floor-plans/ |title=Roseland Ballroom: Floor Plans |publisher=Roselandballroom.com |accessdate=2013-05-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416233709/http://www.roselandballroom.com/floor-plans |archive-date=2013-04-16 }}</ref>

The venue hosted a wide range of events, from a [[Hillary Clinton]] birthday party, to annual gay [[circuit party|circuit parties]], to movie premieres, to musical performances of all genres, including [[Beyoncé]]'s [[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé|Elements of 4]] show and internet stars [[StarKid Productions|Team StarKid's]] [[Apocalyptour|Apocalyptour National Concert Tour]]. It was also known as the place American singer [[Fiona Apple]] broke down during a concert in 2000.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.billboard.com/news/fiona-apple-breaks-down-at-nyc-concert-871408.story#/news/fiona-apple-breaks-down-at-nyc-concert-871408.story | title = Fiona Apple Breaks Down At NYC Concert | date= March 1, 2000 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | archive-date= March 6, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306221700/http://www.billboard.com/news/fiona-apple-breaks-down-at-nyc-concert-871408.story}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/06/19/fiona-apple-jimmy-fallon-meltdown/ |title=Fiona Apple tells Jimmy Fallon about famous meltdown |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first= Ray | last=Rahman |date= June 19, 2012 |accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>

==History==

===Broadway at 51st Street location===
Roseland was founded initially in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1917 by Louis Brecker with financing by [[Frank D. Yuengling|Frank Yuengling]] of the [[D. G. Yuengling & Son]] beer family.

In 1919, to escape Philadelphia's [[blue laws]],<ref name=officialsitehistory /> Brecker and Yuengling moved the venue to 1658 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] at [[51st Street (Manhattan)|51st Street]] in [[Manhattan]],<ref name="Pareles">{{Cite news|last1=Pareles|first1=Jon|last2=Holcomb-Holland|first2=Lori|date=2014-03-27|title=Taxi Dancers to Gaga: Roseland's Life and Death|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/arts/music/taxi-dancers-to-gaga-roselands-life-and-death.html|access-date=2020-09-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> on the second floor of that five-story building, opening on December 31, 1919.<ref name=officialsitehistory>{{cite web | url = http://www.roselandballroom.com/histofroseland.htm | title = The History of Roseland | publisher = RoselandBallroom.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19991005040609/http://www.roselandballroom.com/histofroseland.htm | archive-date= October 5, 1999}}</ref> It was a "whites only" dance club called the "home of refined dancing," famed for the "society orchestra" groups that played there, starting with [[Sam Lanin]] and his [[Ipana Troubadours]].<ref name="Pareles"/>
[[File:Roseland Ballroom New York City 1945.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Postcard promoting the club's "Fall Opening" of October 9, 1945]]
The all-white, ballroom-dancing atmosphere of the club gradually changed with the ascendance in popularity of [[Dixieland|hot jazz]], as played by [[African American]] bands on the New York nightclub scene. [[Armand J. Piron|Piron's New Orleans Jazz Orchestra]] played the ballroom in 1924. Often, two or more orchestras alternated with one another in order to have continuous dance music.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brothers|first=Thomas|title=Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-06582-4|location=New York, NY|pages=130}}</ref> The [[Fletcher Henderson]] band played at Roseland in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Count Basie]] (with his "Roseland Shuffle"), and [[Chick Webb]] followed with their orchestras. Other major-name bandleaders who played the venue included [[Vincent Lopez]], [[Harry James]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], and [[Glenn Miller]]. Many big-band performances were broadcast live from Roseland by radio networks; recordings survive of several [[NBC]] broadcasts of 1940, featuring the young [[Ella Fitzgerald]] fronting the Chick Webb band.

Brecker popularized such stunts as [[marathon dancing]] (until it was banned), staged female prizefights, [[yo-yo]] exhibitions, sneezing contests, and dozens of highly publicized jazz weddings with couples who met at the club.<ref name=time>{{cite news |title=Romp at the Met |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808924-2,00.html |quote=When a public dance hall named Roseland opened on Broadway in 1919, smart young people had recently deserted the [[waltz]] for the [[foxtrot]], were just beginning to master the delicate nuances of the [[shimmy]]. Sam Lanin and his Ipana Troubadours were on the bandstand, thumping out such Ziegfeld Follies hits as "Mandy" and "You Cannot Make Your Shimmy Shake on Tea". Since that distant New Year's Eve, generations of stag-line Romeos and their girls have bunny-hugged, Lindy-hopped, Charlestoned, big-appled, black-bottomed and jitterbugged under Roseland's star-studded ceiling. At 1 o'clock one morning last week the stars winked out for the last time; the following night Roseland reopened in glittering new quarters, billed as 'a magnificent metropolis of melody and merriment.' |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 7, 1957 |accessdate=2007-06-21 }}</ref>

As the club grew older, Brecker attempted to formalize the dancing more by having [[Taxi dancer|hostesses dance for a fee]], with tuxedoed bouncers (politely known as "housemen") keeping order.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1949-01-27|title=Roseland (Sans Liquor, Taxi Girls, Rows) Will Mark Its 30th Anniversary Tonight|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/01/27/archives/roseland-sans-liquor-taxi-girls-rows-will-mark-its-30th-anniversary.html|access-date=2020-09-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name="Pareles"/> It was to work its way into stories by [[Ring Lardner]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[F.

===52nd Street location===
The original New York Roseland was torn down in 1956 and it moved to its new venue on West 52nd, a building that Brecker earlier had converted from an ice-skating rink to a roller-skating rink. It had been built in 1922 at a cost of $800,000 by the Iceland ice-skating franchise. A thousand skaters showed up on opening night at the 80-by-200-foot rink on November 29, 1922. Iceland went bankrupt in 1932 and the rink opened as the Gay Blades Ice Rink. Brecker took it over in the 1950s and converted it to roller-skating.

''Time'' magazine described the new Roseland's opening interior as a "purple-and-[[cerise (color)|cerise]] tentlike décor that creates a definite [[harem]] effect."<ref name=time/> Brecker attempted to maintain its ballroom dancing style, banning [[rock and roll]] and [[disco]]. In 1974 Brecker told ''The New York Times'', "Cheek-to-cheek dancing, that's what this place is all about."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Severo|first=Richard|date=1977-07-09|title=Louis J.

Brecker sold the building in 1981 to Albert Ginsberg.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/nyregion/notes-on-people-it-s-on-with-the-dance.html | title=Notes on People; It's On With the Dance | first1= Albin | last1=Krebs |first2= Robert McG. Jr. | last2=Thomas | work= [[The New York Times]] | date=October 27, 1981 | accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref> Under the new owners the Roseland began regularly scheduled "disco nights", which gave rise to a period when it was considered a dangerous venue and neighborhood menace. In 1984, a teenager was shot to death on the dance floor.<ref>{{cite news |title=18-Year-Old Is Killed In Roseland Ballroom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/11/nyregion/18-year-old-is-killed-in-roseland-ballroom.html |quote= A [[Staten Island]] teen-ager was fatally shot yesterday morning at the Roseland ballroom in midtown Manhattan, the police said.

In 1990, after Utah tourist Brian Watkins was killed in the subway, four of the eight suspects (members of the [[Flushing Top Society|FTS]] gang) were found partying at Roseland. As a result, Roseland discontinued the "disco nights".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientitian.com/articles.html |title=Discoterror |publisher=Scientitian.com |accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>

Its low-rise three-story structure on top of the quarter-acre dance floor in the middle of midtown Manhattan has stirred concerns over its being torn down for redevelopment. In 1996, a new owner, Laurence Ginsberg, filed plans to tear down the venue and replace it with a 42-story, 459-unit apartment building. A spokesman for Ginsberg said the filing was to "beat a deadline for new, more stringent earthquake codes, which went into effect earlier" in 1996. The interior space has been subsequently renovated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/13/realestate/an-old-fashioned-dance-to-the-music-of-time.html |title=An Old-Fashioned Dance to the Music of Time |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 13, 1996 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>
