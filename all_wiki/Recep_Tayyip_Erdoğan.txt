He founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) in 2001, leading it to election victories in [[2002 Turkish general election|2002]], [[2007 Turkish general election|2007]], and [[2011 Turkish general election|2011]] before being required to stand down upon his [[2014 Turkish presidential election|election as President]] in 2014. He later returned to the AKP leadership in 2017 following the [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] that year.

In the [[1994 Istanbul mayoral election|1994 election]] as the candidate of the Islamist [[Welfare Party]], he was elected Mayor of [[Istanbul]]. He was later stripped of his position, banned from political office, and imprisoned for four months for inciting religious hatred, due to his recitation of a poem by [[Ziya Gökalp]].<ref name="erdogan-imprisoned">{{cite journal|title=A Tale of Two Mayors: Courts and Politics in Iran and Turkey |first=Hootan|last=Shambayati|date=May 2004|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=36|issue=2|pages=253–275|doi=10.1017/S0020743804362057|hdl=11693/24287|hdl-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Turkey's Most Eluded Prime Minister" /> Erdoğan subsequently abandoned openly Islamist politics, establishing the moderate conservative AKP in 2001, which he went on to lead to a [[2002 Turkish general election|landslide victory]] in 2002. With Erdoğan still technically prohibited from holding office, the AKP's co-founder, [[Abdullah Gül]], instead became Prime Minister, and later annulled Erdoğan's political ban. After winning a [[2003 Siirt Province by-election|by-election]] in [[Siirt (electoral district)|Siirt]] in 2003, Erdoğan replaced Gül as Prime Minister, with Gül instead becoming the AKP's candidate for the presidency.<ref name="Kumbaracibasi2009">{{cite book|author=Arda Can Kumbaracibasi|title=Turkish Politics and the Rise of the AKP: Dilemmas of Institutionalization and Leadership Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZLL9cg--u0C&pg=PA2|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-87629-9|pages=1–2}}</ref> Erdoğan led the AKP to two more election victories in [[2007 Turkish general election|2007]] and [[2011 Turkish general election|2011]], before being [[2014 Turkish presidential election|elected President]] in 2014, and [[2018 Turkish presidential election|re-elected]] in 2018.

The early years of Erdoğan's tenure as prime minister saw advances in [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|negotiations for Turkey's membership]] of the [[European Union]], an economic recovery following a [[2001 Turkish economic crisis|financial crash in 2001]] and investments in infrastructure including [[List of highways in Turkey|roads]], [[List of airports in Turkey|airports]], and a [[High-speed rail in Turkey|high-speed train network]]. He also won two successful constitutional referendums in [[2007 Turkish constitutional referendum|2007]] and [[2010 Turkish constitutional referendum|2010]]. However, his government remained controversial for its close links with [[Fethullah Gülen]] and his [[Gülen movement|Gülen Movement]] (since designated as a terrorist organisation by the Turkish state) with whom the AKP was accused of orchestrating purges against secular bureaucrats and [[Civil–military relations during the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government|military officers]] through the ''[[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Balyoz]]'' and ''[[Ergenekon trials|Ergenekon]]'' trials.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/18/us-turkey-constitution-idUSBRE91H0C220130218|title=Erdogan's ambition weighs on hopes for new Turkish constitution|author=Nick Tattersall|date=28 February 2013|publisher=Stratejik Boyut|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrogroup.de/internet/site/ts_turkey/print/234842/Len/index.html |title=Growing consumption|date=24 November 2011 |work=Metro Group|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> In late 2012, his government began [[Solution process|peace negotiations]] with the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) to end the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)]]. The ceasefire broke down in 2015, leading to a [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|renewed escalation in conflict]]. Erdoğan's [[Foreign policy of the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government|foreign policy]] has been described as [[Neo-Ottomanism|Neo-Ottoman]] and has led to the [[Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War]], with its focus on preventing the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] from gaining ground on the [[Syria–Turkey border]] during the [[Syrian Civil War]].

In 2011, Erdogan was diagnosed with [[colon cancer]], for which he underwent treatment and surgery.<ref>https://www.nordicmonitor.com/2020/05/turkeys-president-erdogan-operated-for-cancer-suffers-from-epilepsy/</ref>

=== Education ===
Erdoğan graduated from Kasımpaşa Piyale primary school in 1965, and [[İmam Hatip school]], a religious vocational high school, in 1973. The same educational path was followed by other co-founders of the AKP party.<ref>{{cite publication | author = [[Martin van Bruinessen]] | url = https://journals.openedition.org/ejts/5964#tocto1n1 | title = The Governance of Islam in Two Secular Polities: Turkey's Diyanet and Indonesia's Ministry of Religious Affairs | journal = European Journal of Turkish Studies | issn =  1773-0546 | oclc = 7999641981 | doi = 10.4000/ejts.5964 | year = 2018 | number = 27 | archive-url = http://archive.is/eylMH | archive-date = 12 May 2019 | url-status = live}} on [[Revues.org]] website (at n. 55 of the paper).</ref> One quarter of the curriculum of İmam Hatip schools involves study of the [[Quran|Qurʼān]], the life of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], and the [[Arabic language]]. Erdoğan studied the Qurʼān at an İmam Hatip, where his classmates began calling him "''hoca''" ("Muslim teacher").

Erdoğan attended a meeting of the nationalist student group National Turkish Student Union (''Milli Türk Talebe Birliği)'', who sought to raise a conservative cohort of young people to counter the rising movement of leftists in Turkey. Within the group, Erdoğan was distinguished by his oratorical skills, developing a penchant for public speaking and excelling in front of an audience. He won first place in a poetry-reading competition organized by the Community of Turkish Technical Painters, and began preparing for speeches through reading and research. Erdoğan would later comment on these competitions as "enhancing our courage to speak in front of the masses".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=David |title=An uncertain ally : Turkey under Erdoğan's dictatorship |date=20 April 2017 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Jersey |isbn=9781412865456}}</ref>

Erdoğan wanted to pursue advanced studies at [[Faculty of Political Science, Ankara University|Mekteb-i Mülkiye]], but Mülkiye accepted only students with regular high school diplomas, and not İmam Hatip graduates. Mülkiye was known for its political science department, which trained many statesmen and politicians in Turkey. Erdoğan was then admitted to Eyüp High School, a regular state school, and eventually received his high school diploma from Eyüp.

According to his official biography, he subsequently studied [[Business Administration]] at the Aksaray School of Economics and Commercial Sciences ({{lang-tr|Aksaray İktisat ve Ticaret Yüksekokulu}}), now known as [[Marmara University]]'s Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences.<ref name="bbcerdogan">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6900616.stm|title=Profile: Recep Tayyip Erdogan|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 August 2008|date=18 July 2007}}</ref> Several Turkish sources dispute that he graduated, or even attended at all.<ref name="oda TV">{{cite web |url=http://www.odatv.com/n.php?n=erdoganin-diplomasi-aslinda-hangi-okuldan-2504141200|title=Erdoğan'ın diploması aslında hangi okuldan |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |publisher=odaTV |language=tr |trans-title=Which school is Erdoğan's diploma from}}</ref><ref name="sozcu.com.tr">{{cite news |url=http://sozcu.com.tr/2014/gunun-icinden/erdoganin-diplomasi-mecliste-497279/ |title=Erdoğan'ın diploması Meclis'te |language=tr |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |newspaper=Sözcü |author=Cengiz Aldemir |trans-title=Erdoğan's diploma in parliament}}</ref><ref name="Zaman">{{cite news |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_rektorluk-diplomasini-yayinladi-halacoglu-yeni-belge-gosterdi_2213158.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426110759/http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_rektorluk-diplomasini-yayinladi-halacoglu-yeni-belge-gosterdi_2213158.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 April 2014 |title=Rektörlük, diplomasını yayınladı; Halaçoğlu yeni belge gösterdi |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |newspaper=Zaman |language=tr |trans-title=Rectorate issues diploma: Halaçoğlu shown the new document}}</ref>

== Early political career ==

{{Main|Electoral history of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan}}
In 1976, Erdoğan engaged in politics by joining the National Turkish Student Union, an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] action group. In the same year, he became the head of the [[Beyoğlu]] youth branch of the Islamist [[National Salvation Party]] (MSP),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=the-making-of-tayyip-erdogan-2010-10-31|title=The making of Turkey's prime minister|work=Hürriyet Daily News|author=Mustafa Akyoldate=31 October 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> and was later promoted to chair of the Istanbul youth branch of the party.

Holding this position until 1980, he served as consultant and senior executive in the private sector during the era following the [[1980 Turkish coup d'etat|1980 military coup]] when political parties were closed down.

In 1983, Erdoğan followed most of [[Necmettin Erbakan]]'s followers into the [[Islamic revival|Islamist]] [[Welfare Party]]. He became the party's Beyoğlu district chair in 1984, and in 1985 he became the chair of the Istanbul city branch. He was elected to parliament in 1991, but was barred from taking his seat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jun/05/observer-profile-recep-erdogan-turkey|title=Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Is 'Papa' still a father figure to Turks? {{!}} Observer profile|last=Beaumont|first=Peter|date=2011-06-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

=== Mayor of Istanbul (1994–1998) ===

In the [[1994 Turkish local elections|local elections of 27 March 1994]], Erdoğan was elected [[Mayor of Istanbul]] with 25.19% of the popular vote. Erdoğan was a 40-year-old dark horse candidate who had been mocked by the mainstream media and treated as a country bumpkin by his opponents.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Akdogan |first1=Yalcin |title=Political leadership and Erdoğan |date=27 February 2018 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing; Unabridged edition edition |isbn=978-1527506275 |page=9}}</ref>

He was pragmatic in office, tackling many chronic problems in Istanbul including [[water shortage]], pollution and [[traffic|traffic chaos]]. The water shortage problem was solved with the laying of hundreds of kilometers of new pipelines. The garbage problem was solved with the establishment of state-of-the-art recycling facilities. While Erdoğan was in office, air pollution was reduced through a plan developed to switch to natural gas. He changed the [[Transit bus|public buses]] to environmentally friendly ones. The city's traffic and transportation jams were reduced with more than fifty bridges, viaducts, and highways built. He took precautions to prevent corruption, using measures to ensure that municipal funds were used prudently. He paid back a major portion of Istanbul [[Metropolitan Municipality]]'s two billion dollar debt and invested four billion dollars in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/participants/recep-tayyip-erdo%C4%9F|title=Recep Tayyip Erdoğan participated in the World Leaders Forum event, Turkey's Role in Shaping the Future, in November 2008|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609035001/http://www.worldleaders.columbia.edu/participants/recep-tayyip-erdo%C4%9F|archive-date=9 June 2010}}</ref>

Erdoğan initiated the first roundtable of mayors during the [[Habitat II|Istanbul conference]], which led to a global, organized movement of mayors. A seven-member international jury from the United Nations unanimously awarded Erdoğan the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-Habitat]] award.<ref name="unhabitat3" />

=== Imprisonment ===

In 1998, the [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Welfare Party]] was declared unconstitutional on the grounds of threatening the [[Secularism in Turkey|secularism of Turkey]] and was shut down by the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Turkish constitutional court]]. Erdoğan became a prominent speaker at demonstrations held by his party colleagues.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubin|editor1-first=Barry M.|editor2-last=Heper|editor2-first=Meten|title=Political Parties in Turkey|date=3 April 2002|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B71dAgAAQBAJ&q=Barry+M.+Rubin.+Political+Parties+in+Turkey&pg=PP5|publisher=Routledge|last=Yesilada|first=Birol A.|chapter=The Virtue Party|page=68|isbn=978-0714682471|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Justice and Development Party  ===

[[File:Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during a visit in Copenhagen (2002-11-26).jpg|thumb|Erdoğan during a visit in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] in 2002]]
Erdoğan was member of political parties that kept getting banned by the army or judges. Within his [[Virtue Party]], there was a dispute about the appropriate discourse of the party between traditional politicians and pro-reform politicians. The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like [[National Order Party]], [[National Salvation Party]] and [[Welfare Party]]. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary [[conservatism|conservative party]] following the example of the European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.

When the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of [[Necmettin Erbakan]] founded the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) and the reformers founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) under the leadership of [[Abdullah Gül]] and Erdoğan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like [[Ali Babacan]] and [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]]), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program. This turned out to be successful as the new party won 34% of the vote in the [[2002 Turkish general election|general elections of 2002]]. Erdoğan became prime minister in March 2003 after the Gül government ended his political ban.<ref>{{cite news |title=Erdogan's Towering Role in the AKP |url=https://www.turkeyanalyst.org/publications/turkey-analyst-articles/item/115-erdogans-towering-role-in-the-akp.html |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=turkeyanalyst.org |date=12 March 2008 |language=en}}</ref>

=== General elections ===

[[File:RTE seçim pankartı.jpg|thumb|left|An election campaign poster featuring Erdoğan: "Istanbul is Ready, Target 2023", [[Taksim Square]], [[Istanbul]].]]
[[2002 Turkish general election|The elections of 2002]] were the first elections in which Erdoğan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as [[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]], [[Devlet Bahçeli|Bahceli]], [[Mesut Yılmaz|Yılmaz]] and [[Tansu Çiller|Çiller]], resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdoğan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gül became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and [[2003 Siirt Province by-election|scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003]]. By this time, party leader Erdoğan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdoğan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gül handed over the post.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/03/11/turkey.elections/|title=Turkish PM quits for Erdogan|date=11 March 2003|publisher=CNN|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>

On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in [[Ankara]] to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdoğan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as president, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6554851.stm|title=Secular rally targets Turkish PM|work=BBC News|date=14 April 2007|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated [[Abdullah Gül]] as the AKP candidate in the presidential election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/articles/139006/turkish-foreign-minister-to-stand-for-presidency|title=Turkish foreign minister to stand for presidency|publisher=Al-Jazeera|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul,<ref name=Reuters29>{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2910950920070429|title=One million Turks rally against government|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=30 April 2007|date=29 April 2007|last=De Bendern|first=Paul}}</ref> tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in [[Manisa]] and [[Çanakkale]],<ref name="Milliyet">{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2007/05/04/guncel/axgun01.html|title=Saylan: Manisa mitingi önemli|work=[[Milliyet]]|language=tr|trans-title=Saylan: Important rally in Manisa|last=Avci|first=Ümran|accessdate=4 May 2007|date=4 May 2007}}</ref> and one million in [[İzmir]] on 13 May.<ref name="swissinfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Turks_protest_ahead_of_early_elections.html?siteSect=143&sid=7813908&cKey=1179061645000|title=Turks protest ahead of early elections|work=[[Swissinfo]]|date=13 May 2007|accessdate=13 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222218/http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/international/ticker/detail/Turks_protest_ahead_of_early_elections.html?siteSect=143&sid=7813908&cKey=1179061645000|archive-date=30 September 2007|last=De Bendern|first=Paul}}</ref>

The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdoğan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mesajı anladık |author=Turan Yılmaz |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/secim/6942407.asp |newspaper=Hürriyet |language=tr|trans-title=Message understood |date=23 July 2007 |place=Ankara |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdoğan's governing party.<ref name="akptrial1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7482793.stm|title=Turkish ruling party put on trial|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2009|date=1 July 2008}}</ref> The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.<ref name="akptrial2">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7533414.stm|title=Turkey's ruling party escapes ban|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2009|date=30 July 2008}}</ref>

In the June 2011 elections, Erdoğan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdoğan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/116073/turkey-39-s-ruling-ak-party-wins-elections-with-49-83-percent-vote.html|title=Turkey's Ruling AK Party Wins Elections with 49.83 Percent Vote|work=The journal of Turkish Weekly|accessdate=6 December 2014|date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209195647/http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/116073/turkey-39-s-ruling-ak-party-wins-elections-with-49-83-percent-vote.html|archive-date=9 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Referendums ===

After the opposition parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AKP proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by president Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The Turkish constitutional court did not find any problems in the packet and 68.95% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.<ref name="official results">{{cite web | title = Official Results – 21 October 2007 Constitutional Referendum | publisher = Supreme Election Board (YSK) | accessdate = 12 September 2010 | url = http://www.ysk.gov.tr/ysk/docs/2007Referandum/Sonuc/sonucgrafik.pdf|language=tr}}</ref>
The reforms consisted of: electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament, reducing the presidential term from seven years to five, allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term, holding general elections every four years instead of five and reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.

Reforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign. The main opposition party CHP was not interested in altering the Constitution on a big scale, making it impossible to form a [[Constitutional Commission]] (''Anayasa Uzlaşma Komisyonu'').<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/475685.asp|title=AKP'nin Anayasa hedefi 15 madde|language=tr|trans-title=AKP targets article 15 of the Constitution|work=NTVMSNBC|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=17 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090218223617/http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/475685.asp|archive-date=18 February 2009}}</ref> The amendments lacked the two-thirds majority needed to instantly become law, but secured 336 votes in the 550 seat parliament – enough to put the proposals to a referendum. The reform package included a number of issues such as the right of individuals to appeal to the highest court, the creation of the [[ombudsman]]'s office, the possibility to negotiate a nationwide labour contract, gender equality, the ability of civilian courts to convict members of the military, the right of civil servants to go on strike, a privacy law, and the structure of the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]].

[[File:Monument to Humanity by Mehmet Aksoy in Kars, Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|250px|In 2011, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ordered the Monument to Humanity, a statue dedicated to fostering Armenian and Turkish relations, to be destroyed.]]
In 2011, Erdoğan ordered the tearing-down of the [[Statue of Humanity]], a Turkish–Armenian friendship monument in [[Kars]], which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdoğan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a "monument to humanity" but "humanity itself". The demolition was not unopposed; among its detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of them, the painter Bedri Baykam and his associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=turkish-painter-stabbed-at-meeting-for-8216humanity-movement8217-2011-04-18|title=Turkish painter stabbed in Istanbul after 'humanity monument' meeting|date=18 April 2011|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=Hürriyet Daily News}}</ref>

On 23 April 2014, Erdoğan's office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. The statement described the mass killings as the two nations' shared pain and said: "Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among one another".<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey offers condolences to Armenia over WWI killings|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27131543|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=3 June 2014|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The Ottoman Parliament of 1915 had previously used the term "relocation" to describe the purpose of the [[Tehcir Law]], which resulted in the deaths of anywhere between 800,000 and over 1,800,000 Armenian civilians in what is commonly referred to as the Armenian Genocide.<ref>{{Cite book|title=America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915|last=Winter|first=Jay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|pages=94–95}}</ref>

[[Pope Francis]] in April 2015, at a special [[Mass in the Catholic Church|mass]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] marking the centenary of the events, described atrocities against Armenian civilians in 1915–1922 as "the first genocide of the 20th century". In protest, Erdoğan recalled the Turkish ambassador from the Vatican, and summoned the Vatican's ambassador, to express "disappointment" at what he called a discriminatory message. He later stated "we don’t carry a stain or a shadow like genocide". US President [[Barack Obama]] called for a "full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts", but again stopped short of labelling it "genocide", despite his campaign promise to do so.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Ian Black Rosie Scammell in|last1=Rome |accessdate=2019-03-13 |title=Pope boosts Armenia's efforts to have Ottoman killings recognised as genocide |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/12/pope-boosts-armenias-efforts-to-have-ottoman-killings-recognised-as-genocide |newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 April 2015 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/15/turkey-cannot-accept-armenia-genocide-label-erdogan|title=Turkey cannot accept Armenian genocide label, says Erdoğan|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2015-04-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-03-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Associated|last1=Press|accessdate=2019-03-13|title=Barack Obama will not label 1915 massacre of Armenians a genocide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/22/barack-obama-will-not-label-1915-massacre-of-armenians-a-genocide |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 April 2015 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In 2003, Erdoğan's government pushed through the Labor Act, a comprehensive reform of Turkey's labor laws. The law greatly expanded the rights of employees, establishing a 45-hour workweek and limiting overtime work to 270 hours a year, provided legal protection against discrimination due to sex, religion, or political affiliation, prohibited discrimination between permanent and temporary workers, entitled employees terminated without "valid cause" to compensation, and mandated written contracts for employment arrangements lasting a year or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossborderemployer.com/post/2012/11/28/Turkey-Continues-Its-Reform-Of-Labor-And-Employment-Laws-Despite-Waning-Enthusiasm-For-EU-Membership.aspx|title=Turkey Continues Its Reform of Labor And Employment Laws Despite Waning Enthusiasm For EU Membership|author=Roland De Monte|work=crossborderemployer.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/investmentguide/investorsguide/employeesandsocialsecurity/Pages/TermsOfEmployment.aspx|title=Terms of Employment – Invest in Turkey|work=invest.gov.tr}}</ref>

==== Education ====

Erdoğan increased the budget of the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of Education]] from 7.5&nbsp;billion lira in 2002 to 34&nbsp;billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bir numaralı bütçe Eğitim'e|author=Haberi Yazdir|url=http://www.yenisafak.com.tr/politika/bir-numarali-butce-egitime-151265|newspaper=Yeni Şafak|language=tr|trans-title=The number one budget to education|date=31 August 2008|accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> Before his prime ministership the military received the highest share of the national budget.

The Prime Minister kept his campaign promises by starting the [[Fatih project]] in which all state schools, from preschool to high school level, received a total of 620,000 smart boards, while tablet computers were distributed to 17&nbsp;million students and approximately one million teachers and administrators.<ref>{{cite news|title=PM Erdoğan realizes a world's first in education|url=http://www.usasabah.com/EnglishNews/2012/02/08/pm-erdogan-realizes-a-worlds-first-in-education|newspaper=Sabah|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

In June 2017 a draft proposal by the ministry of education was approved by Erdoğan, in which the curriculum for schools excluded the teaching of the theory of [[Darwinism|evolution of Charles Darwin]] by 2019.

==== Justice ====

In March 2006, the [[Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors]] (HSYK) held a press conference to publicly protest the obstruction of the appointment of judges to the high courts for over 10 months. The HSYK said Erdoğan wanted to fill the vacant posts with his own appointees. Erdoğan was accused of creating a rift with Turkey's highest court of appeal, the ''[[Yargıtay]]'', and high administrative court, the ''[[Danıştay]]''. Erdoğan stated that the constitution gave the power to assign these posts to his elected party.<ref name="erdogancourtelection">{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_rift-deepens-between-govt-top-court-with-pms-heavy-criticism_344553.html|title=Rift deepens between government, top court with PM's heavy criticism|date=13 April 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|newspaper=Today's Zaman|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052922/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_rift-deepens-between-govt-top-court-with-pms-heavy-criticism_344553.html|archive-date=8 December 2014}}</ref>

In May 2007, the head of Turkey's High Court asked prosecutors to consider whether Erdoğan should be charged over critical comments regarding the election of [[Abdullah Gül]] as president.<ref name="erdogancourtelection"/> Erdoğan said the ruling was "a disgrace to the justice system", and criticized the [[Constitutional Court]] which had invalidated a presidential vote because a boycott by other parties meant there was no [[quorum]]. Prosecutors investigated his earlier comments, including saying it had fired a "bullet at democracy". [[Tülay Tuğcu]], head of the Constitutional Court, condemned Erdoğan for "threats, insults and hostility" towards the justice system.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6705241.stm|title=Turkish court condemns PM Erdoğan|work=BBC News|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

==== Civil–military relations ====

{{Main|Civil–military relations during the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government}}
[[File:Visita del Presidente de Turquía a la Cancillería del Perú (24663516722).jpg|thumb|Erdogan during an official visit to [[Peru]], with a member of the [[Turkish army|Turkish Army]] behind him]]
The Turkish military has had a record of intervening in politics, having removed elected governments [[:Category:Military coups in Turkey|four times in the past]]. During the Erdoğan government, civil–military relationship moved towards normalization in which the influence of the military in politics was significantly reduced.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Edroos |first1=Faisal |title=Why Turkey's military is not what it used to be |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/turkey-military-180527105359421.html |accessdate=10 January 2020 |work=aljazeera.com |date=5 June 2018}}</ref> The ruling Justice and Development Party has often faced off against the military, gaining political power by challenging a pillar of the country's laicistic establishment.

The most significant issue that caused deep fissures between the army and the government was the midnight [[e-memorandum]] posted on the military's website objecting to the selection of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Foreign Minister]] [[Abdullah Gül]] as the ruling party's [[2007 Turkish presidential election|candidate for the Presidency]] in 2007. The military argued that the election of Gül, whose wife wears an Islamic headscarf, could undermine the laicistic order of the country.
Contrary to expectations, the government responded harshly to former Chief of General Staff Gen. [[Yaşar Büyükanıt]]'s e-memorandum, stating the military had nothing to do with the selection of the presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200704/s1909091.htm |agency=Reuters |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |title=Turkish govt slams army threat |date=28 April 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>

==== Health care ====

After assuming power in 2003, Erdoğan's government embarked on a sweeping reform program of the Turkish healthcare system, called the Health Transformation Program (HTP), to greatly increase the quality of healthcare and protect all citizens from financial risks. Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system. As part of the reforms, the "Green Card" program, which provides health benefits to the poor, was expanded in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Transforming Turkey's Health System – Lessons for Universal Coverage|volume=373|issue=14|pages=1285–1289|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1410433|pmid=26422719|year=2015|last1=Atun|first1=Rifat|s2cid=11495611|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/042e12de1c2f9da048a14f5d0216cfff59e9a6e1}}</ref> The reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state-run healthcare, which, along with long queues in state-run hospitals, resulted in the rise of private medical care in Turkey, forcing state-run hospitals to compete by increasing quality.

In April 2006, Erdoğan unveiled a social security reform package demanded by the [[International Monetary Fund]] under a loan deal. The move, which Erdoğan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=19 April 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archive-date=8 December 2014}}</ref>

In January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places. Erdoğan is outspokenly anti-smoking.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2010/turkiye/02/04/erdogan.sigara.terorden.tehlikeli/562365.0/|accessdate=24 October 2011|trans-title=Erdoğan: Smoking is more dangerous than terror|publisher=CNN Türk|date=4 February 2010|language=tr|title=Erdoğan: "Sigara terörden tehlikeli"}}</ref>

=== Foreign policy ===

{{Main|Foreign policy of the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan government}}
[[File:Erdogan foreign trips as prime minister.png|thumb|[[List of prime ministerial trips made by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Countries visited by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] as prime minister]]

Turkish foreign policy during Erdoğan's tenure as prime minister has been associated with the name of [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]]. Davutoğlu was the chief foreign policy advisor of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan before he was appointed foreign minister in 2009. The basis of Erdoğan's foreign policy is based on the principle of "don't make enemies, make friends"<ref>{{cite news |title=Erdoğan'dan dış politika dersi |url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/siyaset/erdogandan-dis-politika-dersi-1194456 |accessdate=10 January 2020 |work=Milliyet |date=3 February 2010}}</ref> and the pursuit of "zero problems" with neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkish foreign policy: from status quo to soft power |url=https://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&id=281&story_ID=25&slide_ID=2 |website=www.esiweb.org |accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref>

Erdoğan is co-founder of [[United Nations]] [[Alliance of Civilizations]] (AOC). The initiative seeks to galvanize international action against [[extremism]] through the forging of international, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and cooperation.

==== European Union ====
{{See also|European Union–Turkey relations}}
When Erdoğan came to power, he continued Turkey's long ambition of joining the [[European Union]]. On 3 October 2005 negotiations began for Turkey's accession to the [[European Union]].<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7529707.stm|title=EU enlargement past, present and future|work=BBC News|date=6 November 2008|accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref> Erdoğan was named "The European of the Year 2004" by the newspaper [[European Voice]] for the reforms in his country in order to accomplish the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]]. He said in a comment that "Turkey's accession shows that [[Europe]] is a continent where civilisations reconcile and not clash."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/298717.asp?cp1=1|title=Erdoğan named European of the Year|work=[[NTV-MSNBC]]|date=1 December 2004|accessdate=2 December 2004}}</ref> On 3 October 2005, the negotiations for Turkey's accession to the EU formally started during Erdoğan's tenure as Prime Minister.<ref name="BBC News"/>

The [[European Commission]] generally supports Erdoğan's reforms, but remains critical of his policies. Negotiations about a possible [[European Union|EU]] membership came to a standstill in 2009 and 2010, when Turkish ports were closed to Cypriot ships. The Turkish government continues its refusal to recognize [[EU member state]] [[Cyprus]].

Relations between [[Greece]] and Turkey were normalized during Erdoğan's tenure as prime minister. In May 2004, Erdoğan became the first Turkish Prime Minister to visit [[Greece]] since 1988, and the first to visit the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish minority]] of [[Thrace]] since 1952.

==== Armenia ====
{{See also|Armenia–Turkey relations}}
[[Armenia]] is Turkey's only neighbor which Erdoğan has not visited during his premiership. The Turkish-Armenian border has been closed since 1993 because of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] with Turkey's close ally [[Azerbaijan]].

Diplomatic efforts resulted in the [[Armenia–Turkey relations|signing of protocols]] between Turkish and Armenian Foreign Ministers in [[Switzerland]] to improve relations between the two countries. One of the points of the agreement was the creation of a joint commission on the issue. The [[Constitutional Court of Armenia|Armenian Constitutional Court]] decided that the commission contradicts the [[Constitution of Armenia|Armenian constitution]]. Turkey responded saying that Armenian court's ruling on the protocols is not acceptable, resulting in a suspension of the rectification process by the Turkish side.<ref>{{cite news |title=Turkey says Armenian top court's ruling on protocols not acceptable |url=https://www.yenisafak.com/eslesmemis/turkey-says-armenian-top-courts-ruling-on-protocols-not-acceptable-236595 |accessdate=10 January 2020 |work=Yeni Şafak |date=20 January 2010 |language=tr-TR}}</ref>

Erdoğan has said that Armenian President [[Serzh Sargsyan]] should apologize for calling on school children to re-occupy eastern Turkey. When asked by a student at a literature contest ceremony if Armenians will be able to get back their "western territories" along with Mt. Ararat, Sarksyan said, "This is the task of your generation".  Armenians attach great historical and cultural importance to Mt. Ararat on the eastern border of modern-day Turkey, around where Armenians are believed to have first adopted Christianity as an official religion in 301 A.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-251864-erdogan-urges-sarksyan-to-apologize-for-occupation-remarks.html |title=Erdoğan urges Sarksyan to apologize for occupation remarks |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref>

In December 2004, [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] visited Turkey, making it the first presidential visit in the history of Turkish-Russian relations besides that of the Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], [[Nikolai Podgorny]] in 1972. In November 2005, Putin attended the inauguration of a jointly constructed [[Blue Stream]] natural gas pipeline in Turkey. This sequence of top-level visits has brought several important bilateral issues to the forefront. The two countries consider it their strategic goal to achieve "multidimensional co-operation", especially in the fields of energy, transport and the military. Specifically, Russia aims to invest in Turkey's fuel and energy industries, and it also expects to participate in tenders for the modernisation of Turkey's military.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/foreign-affairs/turkey-russia-relations/article-134083|work=euractiv.com|title=Turkey-Russia relations|date=17 November 2005}}</ref> The relations during this time is described by President [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] as "Turkey is one of our most important partners with respect to regional and international issues.

In May 2010, Turkey and Russia signed 17 agreements to enhance cooperation in energy and other fields, including pacts to build Turkey's first nuclear power plant and further plans for an oil pipeline from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The leaders of both countries also signed an agreement on visa-free travel, enabling tourists to get into the country for free and stay there for up to 30 days.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

=== Referendum ===

In April 2017, a [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|constitutional referendum]] was held, where the voters in Turkey (and Turkish citizens abroad) voted on a set of 18 proposed amendments to the Constitution of Turkey. The amendments include the replacement of the existing [[parliamentary system]] with a [[presidential system]]. The post of [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] would be abolished, and the presidency would become an [[executive president|executive post]] vested with broad executive powers. The parliament seats would be increased from 550 to 600 and the [[age of candidacy]] to the parliament was lowered from 25 to 18. The referendum also called for changes to the [[Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38883556 |title=Why is Turkey holding a referendum? |work=BBC News |date=10 February 2017 |accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>

==== Local elections ====

{{main|2019 Turkish local elections}}
In the [[2019 Turkish local elections|2019 local elections]], the ruling party AKP lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 25 years, as well as 5 of Turkey's 6 largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to Erdoğan's mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as the alleged government inaction on the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey|Syrian refugee crisis]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> Soon after the elections, [[Supreme Electoral Council (Turkey)|Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey]] ordered a [[June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|re-election in Istanbul]], cancelling [[Ekrem İmamoğlu|Ekrem İmamoğlu's]] mayoral certificate.

Ak Saray was originally designed as a new office for the Prime Minister. However, upon assuming the presidency, Erdoğan announced that the palace would become the new Presidential Palace, while the [[Çankaya Mansion]] will be used by the Prime Minister instead. The move was seen as a historic change since the [[Çankaya Mansion]] had been used as the iconic office of the presidency ever since its inception. The [[Presidential Complex|Ak Saray]] has almost 1,000 rooms and cost $350&nbsp;million (€270&nbsp;million), leading to huge criticism at a time when mining accidents and workers' rights had been dominating the agenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_ak-saray-alman-basininda_2254265.html|title='Ak-Saray' Alman basınında|language=tr|trans-title=Ak Saray in the German press|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=Zaman|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201150226/http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_ak-saray-alman-basininda_2254265.html|archive-date=1 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/turkey-erdogan-white-palace-presidential-residence.html##ixzz3GQJqZp00|title=Erdogan's $350m presidential palace|work=Al-Monitor|author=Kadri Gursel|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref>

On 29 October 2014, Erdoğan was due to hold a [[Republic Day (Turkey)|Republic Day]] reception in the new palace to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] and to officially inaugurate the [[Presidential Complex|Presidential Palace]]. However, after most invited participants announced that they would boycott the event and a mining accident occurred in the district of [[Ermenek]] in [[Karaman]], the reception was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/27477903.asp|title=29 Ekim resepsiyonu iptal|language=tr|trans-title=29 October reception cancelled|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

After the coup attempt, over 200 journalists were arrested and over 120 media outlets were closed.

===== Diaspora =====

In March 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated to the Turks in Europe "Make not three, but five children. Because you are the future of Europe. That will be the best response to the injustices against you." This has been interpreted as an imperialist call for demographic warfare.<ref>{{cite news|title='You Are the Future of Europe,' Erdogan Tells Turks |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-future-of-europe.html|last= Goldman |first=Russell|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

Over time, Turkey began to look for ways to buy its own missile defense system and also to use that procurement to build up its own capacity to manufacture and sell an air and missile defense system. Turkey got serious about acquiring a missile defense system early in the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|first Obama administration]] when it opened a competition between the Raytheon Patriot PAC 2 system and systems from Europe, Russia, and even China.<ref>{{cite news |title=Turkey Cancels T-Loramids Program After Eight Years |url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/168852/more-on-turkey%E2%80%99s-cancellation-of-t_loramids-program.html |accessdate=10 January 2020 |work=defense-aerospace.com |date=16 November 2015}}</ref>

Taking advantage of the new low in U.S.-Turkish relations, Putin saw his chance to use an [[S-400 missile system|S-400]] sale to Turkey, so in July 2017, he offered the air defense system to Turkey. In the months that followed, the United States warned Turkey that a S-400 purchase jeopardized Turkey's [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II procurement|F-35 purchase]]. Integration of the Russian system into the NATO air defense net was also out of the question. Administration officials, including [[Mark Esper]], warned that Turkey had to choose between the S-400 and the F-35. That they couldn't have both.

The S-400 deliveries to Turkey began on 12 July. On 16 July, Trump mentioned to reporters that withholding the F-35 from Turkey was unfair. Said the president, "So what happens is we have a situation where Turkey is very good with us, very good, and we are now telling Turkey that because you have really been forced to buy another missile system, we’re not going to sell you the F-35 fighter jets".<ref>{{cite web |title=Lawmakers say Trump is locked into Turkey sanctions |url=https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/07/16/trump-cuts-off-f-35-for-turkey-and-lawmakers-say-sanctions-are-coming/ |website=Defense News |accessdate=10 January 2020 |date=19 July 2019}}</ref>

{{Main|Public image of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan}}

Early during his prime ministership, Erdoğan was praised as a role model for emerging Middle Eastern nations due to several reform packages initiated by his government which expanded religious freedoms and minority rights as part of [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|accession negotiations]] with the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/has-recep-tayyip-erdogan-gone-from-model-middle-east-strongman-to-tinpot-dictator-9252366.html|title=Has Recep Tayyip Erdogan gone from model Middle East 'strongman' to tin-pot dictator?|last=Fisk|first=Robert|date=10 April 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=The Independent}}</ref> However, his government underwent several crises including the [[Sledgehammer (coup plan)|Sledgehammer coup]] and the [[Ergenekon trials]], corruption scandals, accusations of media intimidation, as well as the pursuit of an increasingly polarizing political agenda; the opposition accused the government of inciting political hatred throughout the country.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gülen acquitted of trying to overthrow secular government |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/gulen-acquitted-of-trying-to-overthrow-secular-government.aspx?pageID=438&n=gulen-acquitted-of-trying-to-overthrow-secular-government-2006-05-06 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=6 May 2006 |accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref> Critics say that Erdoğan's government legitimizes [[homophobia]], as Erdoğan has said that empowering [[LGBT rights in Turkey|LGBT people in Turkey]] was "against the values of our nation".<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news |title='It's just the start': LGBT community in Turkey fears government crackdown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/its-just-the-start-lgbt-community-in-turkey-fears-government-crackdown |work=The Guardian |date=23 November 2017}}</ref>

Several judicial officials removed from their posts said that they had been removed due to their secularist credentials. The political opposition accused Erdoğan of not only attempting to remove Gülen supporters, but supporters of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s principles as well, in order to pave the way for increased politicisation of the judiciary. Several family members of Erdoğan's ministers who had been arrested as a result of the 2013 corruption scandal were released, and a judicial order to question Erdoğan's son Bilal Erdoğan was annulled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haberfedai.com/haber/12792/bilal-erdogan-artik-yakalanmayacak|title=Bilal Erdoğan artık 'yakalanmayacak'|language=tr|trans-title=Bilal Erdogan is no longer under arrest|date=16 January 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=haberfedai|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113150045/http://www.haberfedai.com/haber/12792/bilal-erdogan-artik-yakalanmayacak|archive-date=13 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Controversy erupted when it emerged that many of the newly appointed judicial officials were actually AKP supporters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/37959/Hakim_ve_savcilar_AKP_li_cikti_.html|title=Hakim ve savcılar AKP'li çıktı!|language=tr|trans-title=Judges and prosecutors outed as AKP|work=cumhuriyet|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> İslam Çiçek, a judge who ejected the cases of five ministers' relatives accused of corruption, was accused of being an AKP supporter and an official investigation was launched into his political affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samanyoluhaber.com/gundem/Reza-Zarrabi-tahliye-eden-hakimin-Facebook-bilgileri-sasirtti/1042852/|title=Tahliye kararı veren hakim İslam Çiçek, Facebook'ta Uzun Adam hayranı çıktı!

Erdoğan has been criticised for his politicisation of the media, especially after the 2013 protests. The opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) alleged that over 1,863 journalists lost their jobs due to their anti-government views in 12 years of [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] rule.<ref name="hurriyetdailynews.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/1863-turkish-journalists-fired-during-akp-rule-opposition-report-says.aspx?pageID=238&nID=73547&NewsCatID=339|title=1,863 Turkish journalists fired during AKP rule, opposition report says|work=Hürriyet Daily News|date=27 October 2014|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> Opposition politicians have also alleged that intimidation in the media is due to the government's attempt to restructure the ownership of private media corporations.

Notable cases of media censorship occurred during the 2013 anti-government protests, when the mainstream media did not broadcast any news regarding the demonstrations for three days after they began. The lack of media coverage was symbolised by [[CNN International]] covering the protests while [[CNN Türk]] broadcast a documentary about penguins at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/turkey-mainstream-media-penguins-protests|title=Why Turkey's mainstream media chose to show penguins rather than protests|work=The Guardian|first=Kerem|last=Oktem|date=10 June 2013|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> The [[RTÜK|Radio and Television Supreme Council]] (RTÜK) controversially issued a fine to pro-opposition news channels including [[Halk TV]] and [[Ulusal Kanal]] for their coverage of the protests, accusing them of broadcasting footage that could be morally, physically and mentally destabilising to children.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/23486445.asp|title=RTÜK'ten Halk TV ve Ulusal Kanal'a ceza|language=tr|trans-title=Penalties for public TV and national channel RTUK|date=12 June 2013|last=Özgenç|first=Meltem|work=Hürriyet|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> Erdoğan was criticised for not responding to the accusations of media intimidation, and caused international outrage after telling a female journalist ([[Amberin Zaman]] of ''[[The Economist]]'') to know her place and calling her a 'shameless militant' during his [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan presidential campaign, 2014|2014 presidential election campaign]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/know-your-place-you-shameless-militant-turkish-prime-minister-tells-female-journalist-9656896.html|title=Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan tells female journalist: 'Know your place, you shameless militant'|date=8 August 2014|last=Dearden|first=Lizzie|work=The Independent|accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> While the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|2014 presidential election]] was not subject to substantial electoral fraud, Erdoğan was again criticised for receiving disproportionate media attention in comparison to his rivals.

=== Erdoğanism ===
{{Main|Erdoğanism}}

Erdoğan has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as Erdoğanisms. The term Erdoğanism first emerged shortly after Erdoğan's [[2011 Turkish general election|2011 general election]] victory, where it was predominantly described as the AKP's [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic]] and [[Conservative democracy|conservative democratic]] ideals fused with Erdoğan [[demagoguery]] and cult of personality.<ref>{{cite web|last=Awiti |first=Alex |url=http://intpolicydigest.org/2011/10/02/erdoganism-a-word-of-caution/ |title=Erdoganism: A Word of Caution |website=Intpolicydigest.org |date=2011-10-02 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}</ref>

===Views about minorities===
In 2002, Erdoğan said that "homosexuals must be legally protected within the framework of their rights and freedoms. From time to time, we do not find the treatment they get on some television screens humane", he said.<ref>{{cite news |title=LGBT Initiative from Prime Minister Erdoğan! |url=https://www.kaosgl.org/en/single-news/lgbt-initiative-from-prime-minister-erdogan |accessdate=21 May 2020 |work=[[KAOS GL]] |date=28 May 2012 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lepeska |first1=David |title=Turkish officials bash gays to counter rising LGBT support |url=https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-lgbti/turkish-officials-bash-gays-counter-rising-lgbt-support |accessdate=21 May 2020 |work=Ahval |date=30 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Notaro |first1=Pier Cesare |title=Turkey: What Erdoğan's Homophobia Shows Us about His Power |url=https://www.ilgrandecolibri.com/en/turkey-what-erdogans-homophobia-shows-us-about-its-power/ |accessdate=21 May 2020 |work=Il Grande Colibrì |date=16 December 2019}}</ref> However, in 2017 Erdoğan has said that empowering [[LGBT rights in Turkey|LGBT people in Turkey]] was "against the values of our nation".<ref name="The Guardian"/>
