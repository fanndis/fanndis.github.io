'''Aleksandar Vučić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Александар Вучић}}, {{IPA-sh|aleksǎːndar ʋǔtʃitɕ|pron}}; born 5 March 1970)<ref name=istinomer /> is a Serbian politician who has been serving as the [[President of Serbia]]<ref>https://freedomhouse.org/country/serbia/nations-transit/2020</ref> since 2017. After leaving the [[Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] [[Serbian Radical Party]] in 2008, he became one of the founders of the [[Populism|populist]] conservative [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS) and he has been the party's president since 2012.

Vučić served as the [[prime minister of Serbia]] in two terms, from 2014 to 2016 and from 2016 until 2017, as well as the deputy prime minister from 2012 until 2014. Furthermore, Vučić served as a [[National Assembly (Serbia)#Members|member of the Serbian parliament]], [[Ministry of Information (Serbia)|Minister of Information]] from 1998 to 2000, and later as [[Minister of Defence (Serbia)|Minister of Defence]] from 2012 to 2013. In April 2017, Vučić was [[2017 Serbian presidential election|elected]] president with over 55% of the vote in the first round, thus avoiding a second round. He formally assumed office on 31 May 2017, succeeding [[Tomislav Nikolić]]. His ceremonial inauguration ceremony was held on 23 June 2017.

As Minister of Information under the [[Slobodan Milošević]] administration, he introduced restrictive measures against journalists, especially during the [[Kosovo War]].<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/europe-has-a-troublingly-short-memory-over-serbia-s-aleksander-vucic-a7029221.html|title=Europe has a troublingly short memory over Serbia's Aleksander Vucic|first=Robert|last=Fisk |year=2016|work=The Independent|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/286fadc4-5444-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec|title=Interview: Serbia's Vucic insists 'I'm obsessed with Kosovo'|first=Lionel|last=Barber |date=15 May 2018|work=Financial Times|accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref> In the period after the [[Bulldozer Revolution]], Vučić was one of the most prominent figures of the opposition. Since the establishment of the new party in 2008, he shifted away from his original far-right and [[hard Eurosceptic]] platform toward [[pro-European]], conservative and [[populist]] political positions. The [[Let's Get Serbia Moving|SNS-led coalition]] won the [[2012 Serbian parliamentary election|2012 election]] and the Serbian Progressive Party became part of the government for the first time, leading to the establishment of the [[dominant-party system]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Orlović|first1=Slaviša|title=The Influence of Electoral System on Party Fragmentation in Serbian Parliament  |journal=Serbian Political Thought |year=2015|volume=7|issue=11|pages=91–106|doi=10.22182/spt.1112015.5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Atlagić|first1=Siniša|last2=Vučićević|first2=Dušan |title=Thirty Years of Political Campaigning in Central and Eastern Europe|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, Cham|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-27693-5_21|isbn=978-3-030-27693-5|year=2019|p=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/288113/Mandat-dominantne-stranke|title=Mandat dominantne stranke |date=25 March 2014|publisher=Politika|accessdate=18 November 2019|language=sr}}</ref> After Vučić became the head of government in 2014, he promised to continue to follow the [[Accession of Serbia to the European Union|accession process]] to the [[European Union]] (EU) by [[privatizing]] state businesses and [[Economic liberalization|liberalizing the economy]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Serbia/Independent-Serbia|title=Independent Serbia|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref> 

In December 2015, the EU opened first [[Acquis communautaire|chapters]] during the accession conference with Serbian delegation led by Vučić. He is one of the crucial figures in [[Kosovo–Serbia relations|cooperation]] and EU-mediated [[Belgrade-Pristina negotiations|dialogue]] between the governments of [[Kosovo]] and Serbia, advocating the implementation of the [[Brussels Agreement (2013)|Brussels Agreement]] on the normalization of their relations. Following United States-mediated negotiations, Vučić signed an [[Kosovo and Serbia Economic Normalization agreements (2020)|agreement]] in September 2020 to normalize economic relations with Kosovo, but also to move the [[Israel–Serbia relations|Serbian embassy in Israel]] to [[Jerusalem]]. He is one of the initiators of [[Mini Schengen Zone]], an economic zone of the Western Balkans countries intended to guarantee "[[European Single Market|four freedoms]]". Observers have described Vučić's rule as an authoritarian, [[autocratic]] or [[Illiberal democracy|illiberal democratic]] regime, citing [[#The media|curtailed press freedom]].<ref>

===Radical Party to Progressive Party===
[[File:Nikolić & Vučić.jpg|thumb|left|Aleksandar Vučić and Tomislav Nikolić on the founding congress of the [[Serbian Progressive Party]], Belgrade, 2008]]
[[Tomislav Nikolić]], deputy leader of the Radical Party and de facto interim leader due to absence of [[Vojislav Šešelj]], resigned on 6 September 2008 because of disagreement with Šešelj over the party's support for Serbia's EU membership. With some other well-known Radical Party members he formed a new parliamentary club called "''Napred Srbijo!''" (''Forward Serbia!''). On 12 September 2008 Nikolić and his group were officially ejected from the Radical Party on the session of SRS leadership. Vučić, as secretary-general was called to attend this session, but he did not appear. Tomislav Nikolić announced he would form his own party and called Vučić to join. Vučić, one of the most popular figures among SRS supporters, resigned from Radical Party on 14 September 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=109484 |title=Nikolić: I Vučić napustio radikale |publisher=Mondo |language=Serbian |date=14 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915040105/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=109484 |archivedate=15 September 2008 }}</ref> The next day, Vučić announced his temporary withdrawal from politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=109568 |title=Vučić napušta politiku (za sada) |publisher=Mondo |language=Serbian |date=15 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916015430/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=109568 |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}</ref>

On 6 October 2008, Vučić confirmed in a TV interview that he was to join the newly formed Nikolić's [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS) and that he would be the Deputy President of the party. He then seemed to change his positions. In 2010 he made statements such as a "horrible crime was committed in Srebrenica", saying he felt "ashamed" of the Serbs who did it.  "I do not hide that I have changed... I am proud of that," he told AFP in an interview in 2012.  "I was wrong, I thought I was doing the best for my country, but I saw the results and we failed, We need to admit that."<ref>[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140313/aleksandar-vucic-nationalist-hawk-devout-europeanist Aleksandar Vucic: from nationalist hawk to devout Europeanist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322015540/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140313/aleksandar-vucic-nationalist-hawk-devout-europeanist |date=22 March 2014 }}, GlobalPost.com, 13 March 2014.</ref>

Nikolić stepped down as party leader on 24 May 2012 following his [[2012 Serbian presidential election|election]] as [[President of Serbia]]. Vučić assumed leadership until the next party congress is held to elect a new leader. On 29 September 2012 Vučić was elected as party leader, with [[Jorgovanka Tabaković]] as his deputy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Minister of Defence and First Deputy Prime Minister (2012–2014) ===

Vučić briefly served as [[Minister of Defence (Serbia)|Minister of Defence]] and First Deputy Prime Minister from July 2012 to August 2013, when he stepped down from his position of Defence Minister in a [[cabinet reshuffle]]. Although the Prime Minister, [[Ivica Dačić]] Deba, held formal power as head-of-government, many analysts thought that Vučić had the most influence in government as head of the largest party in the governing coalition and parliament.<ref name="De Launey"/>

Vučić announced his candidacy in the presidential election on 14 February 2017, despite earlier statements that he would not run.<ref>[http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/ci/story/1/politika/2631324/predsednistvo-sns-a-vucic-kandidat-za-predsednika.html Председништво СНС-а: Вучић кандидат за председника (Serbian)] ''RTS'' 14 February 2017.

After initial speculations that the incumbent president, Tomislav Nikolić, would also run, he backed Vučić and his ruling SNS party. Vučić won the election in the first round, having obtained 56.01 percent of the vote. The independent candidate, [[Saša Janković]] was second with 16.63 percent, ahead of satirical politician [[Ljubiša Preletačević|Luka Maksimović]] and former Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Vuk Jeremić]].<ref>[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/vucic-wins-serbian-presidential-elections-04-02-2017-1 Vucic Wins Serbian Presidential Elections] ''Balkan Insight'' 2 April 2017.

The election result sparked [[2017 Serbian protests|protests]] around Serbia. Thousands of protesters accused Vučić of leading the country towards authoritarianism. Protesters organised the rallies through [[social network]]s and insist they are not linked to any party or politician, and demand a total overhaul of what they call "corrupt political, business and media systems that serve an elite led by Mr Vučić".<ref>{{cite web|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Daniel|title=Young Serbs vow to stop 'dictatorship' of president-elect Vucic|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/young-serbs-vow-to-stop-dictatorship-of-president-elect-vucic-1.3038906|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref> Vučić maintained that the protests were organized by his political opponents who expected "the dictator would bring the police into the streets."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bogović|first1=Nataša|title=PM Vucic: Opposition thought that the "dictator" will bring the police into the streets|url=https://insajder.net/en/site/focus/4091/PM-Vucic-Opposition-thought-that-the-%E2%80%9Cdictator%E2%80%9D-will-bring-the-police-into-the-streets.htm|website=Insajder|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>

After becoming president, Vučić disbanded the traditional police security service responsible for President's protection, and replaced it with members of the [[Military Police Battalion Cobra|Cobras]], military police unit which contrary to the law, protected him while he served as the Prime Minister from 2014 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vučić nema poverenja u policiju|url=http://danas.rs/drustvo.55.html?news_id=355349&title=Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87+nema+poverenja+u+policiju|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=danas.rs|publisher=Danas|date=2 September 2017|language=Serbian}}</ref>

After his election as Prime Minister in 2014, Vučić promoted austerity-based economic policies, whose aim was to reduce Serbia's budget deficit. Vučić's policy of fiscal consolidation was primarily aimed at cuts in the public sector. One of the measures was the reduction of pensions and salaries in the public sector as well as a ban on further employment in the public sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2014&mm=09&dd=19&nav_id=91665|title=PM: Salaries, pensions, subsidies to be cut - - on B92.net|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> Vučić announced that his reform based policies have reduced country's deficit, and contributed to financial stability. However, criticism of Vučić's economic policy stated that his measures have not overall contributed to economic recovery, but have instead caused a further decline in living standard.

During the 2015 – 2016 [[European migrant crisis]], Vučić strongly aligned himself with the policies of the German Chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], and publicly praised German migration policy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Vučić also stated that Serbia will cooperate with the EU in solving the migrant stream going from the Middle East to EU member countries through the Balkan route, and that Serbia will be ready to take some portion of the migrants. "Serbia will receive a certain number of migrants. This makes us more European than some member states.

=== Relations with Croatia ===

In 2007 Vučić stated that the [[Democratic League of Croats in Vojvodina]] is a branch of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/svijet/clanak/art-2007,5,8,sr_parlament,73422.jl|title=Šešeljevac vodi Skupštinu, a Vuk Drašković Vijeće Europe|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> In 2008, with the establishment of the [[Serbian Progressive Party]], Vučić said that the goal of a [[Greater Serbia]] taking Croatian territory up to the proposed [[Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line]] "is unrealistic and silly".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/politika.php?id=63178|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204011331/http://www.blic.rs/politika.php?id=63178|url-status=dead|title=Vučić sad nije za veliku Srbiju|archivedate=4 December 2008}}</ref> The Croatian newspaper [[Jutarnji list]] claimed in a reportage that none of his family members had been killed during World War II, upon which he replied that these were "brutal lies and attacks on his family".<ref name=Novosti-289-571605/>

During 2015 and 2016, relations between Croatia and Serbia were further affected by to the ongoing migrant crisis, when Croatia decided to close its border with Serbia. In September 2015, Croatia barred all cargo traffic from Serbia,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-croatia-serbia-idUSKCN0RM14Y20150922|title=Road traffic halted between Serbia and Croatia in migrants row|date=22 September 2015|accessdate=11 September 2016|agency=Reuters}}</ref> due to the migrant influx coming from Serbia in a move which further eroded the fragile relations between the two countries. 
In response to these actions, Vučić announced that counter measures will be enacted if an agreement with Croatia is not reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&mm=09&dd=22&nav_id=95514|title=Serbia to wait for deal with Croatia until Sept. 24 - - on B92.net|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> 
The dispute was eventually resolved through the mediation of the [[EU Commission]], yet the relations between the two neighboring countries remain fragile. 
On 31 March 2016, Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian Radical Party, was acquitted of War Crime charges in the Hague Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia. The verdict has caused controversy in Croatia. Vučić distanced himself from Šešelj and his policy, but stated that the verdict should not be used as a tool for political pressure on Serbia.

On 7 April 2016 Croatia refused to endorse the EU Commission opinion to open Chapter 23, a part of Serbia's EU accession negotiations, thus effectively blocking Serbia’ EU integration process. Serbia accused Croatia of obstructing its EU membership, and Vučić said that his government was: ''"Stunned by Croatia's decision not to support Serbia's European path."''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-serbia-croatia-idUSKCN0X529T|title=Serbia accuses Croatia of obstructing its EU membership talks|date=8 April 2016|accessdate=11 September 2016|agency=Reuters}}</ref>
Croatia has not agreed for Serbia to open negotiations of Chapter 23. 
On 14 April 2016, the EU Commission rejected Croatian arguments in its dispute with Serbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/11392-european-commission-rejects-croatia-s-arguments-in-its-dispute-with-serbia|title=European Commission Rejects Croatia's Arguments in Its Dispute with Serbia|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref> However, on 7 July 2016, Croatian Foreign Minister [[Miro Kovač]] announced that five conditions set by Croatia have been incorporated in the common position of the EU member states for negotiations with Serbia which will be the basis on which Serbia's progress in Chapter 23, concerning the judiciary and fundamental rights, will be assessed. These five conditions are: Serbia has to: 1. steer clear of conflicts of jurisdiction concerning war crimes, 2. cooperate with neighboring countries in search and identification of missing persons or their remains, 3. strengthen its investigative, prosecution, and judicial authorities, 4. strengthen protection of (Croatian) minority, and 5. fully cooperate with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/otkrivamo-pet-uvjeta-postavljenih-pred-srbiju-uoci-otvaranja-poglavlja-23-1097505|title=Otkrivamo pet uvjeta postavljenih pred Srbiju uoči otvaranja poglavlja 23!|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>

===Relations with Russia===
[[File:Путин - Вучич (23-06-20).jpg|thumb|left|President Aleksandar Vučić during his bilateral meeting with [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow Kremlin]] 2020.]]
Vučić has maintained traditional good relations between Serbia and Russia, and his government refused to enact sanctions on Russia, following the crisis in Ukraine and the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea|Annexation of Crimea]]. Vučić has repeatedly announced that Serbia will remain committed to its European integration, but also maintain historic relations with Russia. 
"We have proven our sincere and friendly attitude to Russia by being one of the European countries that refused to impose sanctions on Russia," Vučić said after meeting with Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]]. "Serbia will continue pursuing this policy in the future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/serbia-vucic-rejecting-eu-sanctions-on-russia-visits-with-putin/27332899.html|title=Serbia's Vucic, Rejecting EU Sanctions On Russia, Visits With Putin|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=11 September 2016|via=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty}}</ref>

During Vučić’s mandate, Serbia has continued to expand its economic ties with Russia, especially by increasing Serbian exports to Russia. In early 2016, after a meeting with the Russian Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Rogozin]], Vučić announced the possibility of Serbia boosting its military cooperation with Russia by purchasing Russian missile systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbth.com/defence/2016/01/15/serbia-plans-to-buy-air-defense-systems-mig-29-fighters-from-russia_559549|title=Serbia plans to buy air defense systems, MiG-29 fighters from Russia|last=Kommersant|date=15 January 2016|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>

=== Relations with the United States ===

In July 2017 Vučić visited the United States and met with U.S. Vice President [[Mike Pence]], where they discussed U.S. support for Serbia's efforts to join the European Union, the need for continued reforms, and further progress in normalizing the relationship with Kosovo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/readout-vice-presidents-meeting-president-serbia-aleksandar-vucic/|title=Readout of the Vice President's Meeting with President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic|date=17 July 2018|website=White House}}</ref> Referencing the proposed land swap arrangement between Serbia and Kosovo, U.S. national security advisor [[John R.

Some have compared Vučić to other strongmen in European politics and, as noted above, accused him of being an autocrat. Many believe he has successfully taken over the center ground of Serbian politics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} He has built a reputation for technocratic efficiency, ideological flexibility, and political pragmatism while retaining a base of center-right and right-wing electoral support.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In 2007, while Mladić was still at large in Serbia, Vučić was distributing posters stating "Safe house for general Mladić". During a parliament session he stated that the Serbian Parliament will always protect and be a safe house for the general and that any house in Serbia that bears the last name of Vučić will protect and shelter Mladić.<ref name="pressonline.rs">{{cite web|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/info/politika/11934/vucic-lepio-plakate-sa-natpisom-bulevar-ratka-mladica.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302212259/http://www.pressonline.rs/info/politika/11934/vucic-lepio-plakate-sa-natpisom-bulevar-ratka-mladica.html|url-status=dead|title=Press Online :: Politika :: Vučić lepio plakate sa natpisom Bulevar Ratka Mladića|archivedate=2 March 2014}}</ref>
