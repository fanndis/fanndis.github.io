In February 2014, Flipkart partnered with [[Motorola Mobility]] to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its [[Moto G (1st generation)|Moto G]] smartphone.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/launch-flipkart-brings-motorolas-moto-g-to-india-prices-it-at-rs-12499/|title=Launch: Flipkart brings Motorola’s ‘Moto G’ to India, prices it at Rs 12,499|date=5 February 2014|work=The Indian Express|access-date=11 May 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Motorola also partnered with Flipkart on the [[Moto E (1st generation)|Moto E]]—a phone targeted primarily towards emerging markets such as India.

In March 2015, Flipkart blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the site's [[mobile app]] instead. The following month, [[Myntra]] went further and discontinued its website on all platforms, in favour of operating exclusively through its app. The "app-only" model, however, proved to be unsuccessful for Myntra (reducing sales by 10%), and its main website was reinstated in February 2016. The experiment with Myntra led to suggestions that Flipkart itself would perform a similar move, but this did not occur. In November 2015, Flipkart launched a new mobile website branded as "Flipkart Lite", which provides an experience inspired by Flipkart's app that runs within smartphone web browsers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/myntra-to-shut-down-website-go-app-only-on-may-15-690713|title=Myntra to Shut Down Website, Go App-Only on May 15|work=NDTV Gadgets360.com|access-date=13 May 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Karrishma Modhy|title=Will Myntra’s move away from desktop cause its downfall? apart from this they have a strong appeal amongst smartphone users with this new approach |url=http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/will-myntras-move-away-from-desktop-cause-its-downfall-267514.html|website=Tech.firstpost.com/|publisher=FirstPost|access-date=21 May 2015|date=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Besta Shankar|title=Myntra Sees 10% Drop in Sales After Moving to App-only Format|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/myntra-sees-10-drop-sales-after-moving-app-only-format-33160|access-date=21 May 2015|work=International Business Times|date=21 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Flipkart-drops-its-plan-to-go-app-only/articleshow/49751060.cms|title=Flipkart drops its plan to go app-only|work=The Times of India|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Myntra no longer app only, brings back mobile site to woo customers|url = http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/myntra-no-longer-app-only-brings-back-mobile-site-to-woo-customers/articleshow/51002673.cms|website = The Economic Times|access-date = 16 February 2016}}</ref>
