{{Politics of Scotland}}
'''Scotland''' ({{lang-sco|Scotland}}, {{lang-gd|[[Alba]]}} {{IPA-gd|ˈal̪ˠapə||Alba-gd.ogg}}) was a [[constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]] created in 1999. It elected between eight and six [[Members of the European Parliament|MEPs]] using the [[D'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]] every 5 years from 1999 until 2020, when the constituency was abolished after the United Kingdom [[Brexit|left the European Union]] on 31 January 2020.

== Boundaries ==
The constituency's boundaries were the same as those of [[Scotland]], one of the four countries of the United Kingdom.

== History ==
The constituency was formed as a result of the [[European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999]], replacing a number of single-member constituencies. These were [[Glasgow (European Parliament constituency)|Glasgow]], [[Highlands and Islands (European Parliament constituency)|Highlands and Islands]], [[Lothians (European Parliament constituency)|Lothians]], [[Mid Scotland and Fife (European Parliament constituency)|Mid Scotland and Fife]], [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]], [[South of Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|South of Scotland]], [[Strathclyde East (European Parliament constituency)|Strathclyde East]], and [[Strathclyde West (European Parliament constituency)|Strathclyde West]].

The number of MEPs returned by the constituency was eight in 1999, seven in 2004, and six in 2009, 2014 and 2019.

After the result of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] vote to leave the [[European Union]] in 2016, this constituency was abolished on 31 January 2020 following completion of the [[Article 50]] withdrawal process.
