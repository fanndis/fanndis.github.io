==Early life and education==
Wojcicki was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], the son of [[Janina Wójcicka Hoskins|Janina Wanda Wójcicka]] (née Kozłowska), a bibliographer, and {{ill|Franciszek Wójcicki|pl}}, a lawyer.<ref name=bookref1/><ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TG9pAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Bom+Janina+Wanda+Ewa+Kozlow%22&dq=%22Bom+Janina+Wanda+Ewa+Kozlow%22| title=The Polish Review| publisher=Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America| year=1997| volume=42| page=123}}</ref> He and his brother fled from [[Poland]] to [[Sweden]] with his mother at the age of 12, when [[People's Republic of Poland|communists]] came to power.<ref name="sfgate2013">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Area-s-Wojcicki-family-honored-4415518.php |title=Bay Area's Wojcicki family honored |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=April 6, 2013 |first=Julian |last=Guthrie |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}</ref> They eventually arrived in the United States. His father remained in Poland, and was soon imprisoned for five years for being a member of the government's main opposition party. He was never able to gain a visa to come to the United States.<ref name="sfgate2013"/>

Wojcicki and his brother were sent to a boarding school run by the Franciscan order near [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name="sfgate2013"/> He excelled in mathematics and had thought of pursuing either engineering or medicine, but decided to study physics. He attended [[Harvard University]] on a scholarship and graduated with a BA. He later attended [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he earned a PhD.<ref name=endowed>[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/physics/people/endow.html#wojcicki Stanford Department of Physics: "Endowed Chairs and Professorships: Stanley G.

==Career==
Wojcicki worked at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at [[CERN]] and the [[Collège de France]]. In 1966, he joined the [[Stanford University]] physics faculty where he headed the Department of Physics from 1982–85 and 2004–2007.<ref name=endowed />

Wojcicki has served as an advisor to government funding agencies (US and foreign) as well as to several high energy physics laboratories. He also headed the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel, which advises the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the National Science Foundation on particle physics matters.<ref name=endowed />

==Personal life==
Stanley Wojcicki is the husband of fellow educator [[Esther Wojcicki]], whom he met at UC Berkeley. They have three children and nine grandchildren.<ref name=huffington>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/esther-wojcicki# Esther Wojcicki] retrieved September 21, 2012</ref>
