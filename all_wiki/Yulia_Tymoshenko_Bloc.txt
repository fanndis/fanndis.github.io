==Overview==

Founded for the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2002 parliamentary elections]], the alliance attracted most of its voters from western Ukrainian ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] speaking) provinces ([[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblasts]]) and from central Ukraine.<ref name=supporty>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/66496/ Poll: Political forces of Tigipko, Yatseniuk, Communist Party in Top 5&nbsp;of April rating of parties], ''Kyiv Post'' (12 May 2010)</ref> The alliance had low support in the east and the south of Ukraine (where the [[Russian language]] is dominant).<ref name=supporty/> though they did recruit several politicians from these [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russian-speaking provinces]] like [[Crimea]] ([[Lyudmyla Denisova]]<ref>[http://news.mediaport.info/ukraine/2007/47857.shtml Новый состав Кабмина принят единогласно] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624061344/http://news.mediaport.info/ukraine/2007/47857.shtml |date=24 June 2008 }}, news.mediaport.ua{{in lang|ru}}</ref>) and [[Luhansk Oblast]] ([[Natalia Korolevska]]<ref>{{in lang|uk}}[http://www.gpu.ua/index.php?&id=154882 Народна депутатка з Луганська від БЮТу раніше підтримувала Віктора Януковича], Gazeta.ua (23 March 2007)</ref>).

BYuT had intended to include more representatives from the [[education in Ukraine|education sector]] into its voting lists. According to Tymoshenko: "Certain branches and sectors have powerful lobbies.

==History==

===Creation===
In January 2001, [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] dismissed Tymoshenko from the post of Deputy Prime Minister for fuel and energy sector in the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet]] of [[Viktor Yushchenko]].  Following this, and during the ''[[Ukraine without Kuchma]]''-protests, Tymoshenko began the loose organisation the [[National Salvation Committee (Ukraine)|National Salvation Committee]]<ref name=Europe/> on 9 February 2001.<ref name=Tymo/> This organisation later merged into the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (BYuT) in November 2001.<ref name=Europe>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP_-8rXzQs8C&pg=PA4295 Europa World Year Book 2], [[Routledge]], 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-85743-255-8}}, page 4295</ref><ref name=Tymo>[http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/page/about About Tymoshenko] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926143302/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/page/about |date=26 September 2009 }}, Official website of Yulia Tymoshenko</ref>

At the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on 30 March 2002, the alliance comprised the following liberal and nationalist member parties:<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vd2002/webproc0v Виборчий блок політичних партій "Виборчий блок Юлії Тимошенко"], [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]] (22 December 2001)</ref><ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2002/01/25/2986569/ Вони – Блок Юлії Тимошенко], ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' (25 January 2002)</ref>

The alliance supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[Ukrainian presidential election of 2004]], and played an active role in the widespread acts of civil non-violent protest that became known as the Ukrainian [[Orange Revolution]].

In January 2005, Tymoshenko became [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] under Yushchenko's presidency.<ref name="tymoshenko.com.ua">[http://www.rferl.org/content/Tymoshenko_Profile/1291005.html Ukraine's Gold-Plaited Comeback Kid], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (23 September 2008)</ref><ref>{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=[[President of Ukraine|Presidential decree]]|number=144/2005|law=144/2005|name=On the recognition of Y.

The BYuT entered the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on 26 March 2006, with only [[Fatherland Party (Ukraine)|Fatherland]] and [[Ukraine – Forward!|Ukrainian Social Democratic Party]] after both republican parties left the alliance. Nonetheless BYuT moved into second place with 22.27%<ref name=DATA/> of the vote behind [[Party of Regions]] with 33% and ahead of [[People's Union "Our Ukraine"|Our Ukraine]] with less than 14% support. BYuT won 129 seats out of 450.

Note that after the 2002 merger of the [[Ukrainian Republican Party "Sobor"]] and the [[Ukrainian Republican Party]] – which then became known as the [[Ukrainian Republican Party "Sobor"]] (URP Sobor)<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2002/04/21/2988348/ Злилися УРП і "Собор": Матвієнко – голова партії, Лук'яненко – голова ради старійшин], ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' (21 April 2002)</ref> – the party went through a schism before the 2006 elections.  The majority of the party led by Anatoliy Mativienko aligned with [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine Bloc]], while others left the party and stayed with BYuT.  After the 2006 elections, [[Levko Lukyanenko]] managed to reinstate the original Ukrainian Republican Party.

It was widely expected that a coalition between supporters of the [[Orange Revolution|Orange Movement]] would form Ukraine's next government, but after three months of negotiations and a failure to reach an agreement the proposed coalition collapsed following the decision of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] to support the formation of the "anti-crisis coalition" with [[Party of Regions]] and the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]].

During the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]], the BYuT consisted of:
*[[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]]
*[[Ukraine – Forward!|Ukrainian Social Democratic Party]]
*[[Reforms and Order Party]]

The [[Ukrainian Republican Party "Sobor"]] was part of the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] in this election.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.da-ta.com.ua/mon_mainnews/805.htm Українська республіканська партія „Собор"], Database DATA</ref>

*Justice – The bloc advocated raising salaries for judges and abolishing the requirement for them to hear specific cases. They proposed legal aid schemes for poor citizens so that income would not be the final determinant of judicial representation and consideration.
*Media – The bloc advocated for the creation of public broadcast television, greater transparency and disclosure of ownership of media interests, the establishment of agreements between owners of media outlets and journalists in order to facilitate open and honest editorial policy, and increased Internet availability.
*Corruption – The bloc proposed implementing a systematic program to combat corruption.
*Social reform – The bloc proposed to improve social welfare services while encouraging an expansion of the population. Specific plans included obligatory medical insurance, free state medical services for those in need, affordable medication, a rural doctor program, and increased payments for each newborn child. In addition, there were proposals for increased baby-care allowances and long-term low interest loans for young families.
*Education – The bloc proposed to restore the status and raise the standards of the education system to stop the brain drain problem. Measures included incentives for investment in professional and higher education and in research and development.
*Transit – The bloc proposed to build new oil and gas pipelines and expand public-private partnership investments to improve roads, railways and airports. They advocated a liberalization of the transit system.
*Business – The bloc wished to address the imbalance between large enterprises, which dominate the business sector, and small enterprises by encouraging the growth of wealth-creating small- and medium-sized enterprises. They advocated a new tax code while expanding assessment, minimizing tax remissions, abolishing VAT, and overall simplifying the process to set up and administer businesses. They advocated lower business lending rates in line with European levels, and measures to liberalize banking and insurance services and encourage longer-term lending. Shareholder rights will be protected, the permit system reformed, and the governmental bureaucracy reduced.
*Energy – The bloc sought to overturn the nation's dependence on monopolies for importing energy while strengthening collaboration and coordination of energy policy with the EU. Specific policies included integration with the European market for the supply and consumption of electricity, measures to reduce oil and gas consumption, an increase in utilization of brown coal and the production of synthetic fuel. They wished to complete the Odessa–Brody–Plotsk (Gdańsk) transit pipeline, build a gas transit pipeline linking the [[Caspian Sea]] (running through [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and the [[Black Sea]], and encourage domestic production both onshore and offshore in the Black and [[Azov Sea]]s.
*Investment – The bloc encouraged domestic and foreign investment by removing legal barriers and streamlining procedures, particularly for the technology and energy sectors. Other proposals included transparent and open privatization and tender processes and the establishment of a network of regional ombudsman to simplify processes for obtaining import certificates. All new legislation was to be in accordance with WTO practices.
*Construction – BYuT proposed a system of mortgage lending with lower interest rates for house purchases along with government targets for public housing projects. Decentralization to the regional level would facilitate these targets for both housing and commercial facilities. Special tax incentives were envisioned for industrial projects to complement planning for investment described above.
*Agriculture – The bloc advocated a stronger, more profitable and environmentally responsible agricultural sector. Crucial measures included the availability of development funds, agricultural exchanges, insurance funds and land-banks. Other initiatives involved the promotion of agricultural products to overseas markets. To facilitate a functioning land market, agricultural producers would have access to low-interest loans, with incentives for the development of cooperative banks and credit unions in rural areas.

Although unrelated to these developments,{{relevance inline|date=July 2018}}  American analyst Ryan Renicker asserted that allegations of Tymoshenko's alleged wrongdoings are unsubstantiated and misguided. Official documents from both the European Union and the United States suggest Tymoshenko's prosecution and imprisonment were politically motivated.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmnFExEBrUC&pg=PA207&dq=Our+Ukraine+ally+Yulia+Tymoshenko&hl=en&ei=UaYKTfnhMsqCOuTU_a8J&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=Our%20Ukraine%20ally%20Yulia%20Tymoshenko&f=false Design for a New Europe] by [[John Gillingham]] and [[Wang Yuanhe]], [[Cambridge University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-86694-4}} (page 205)</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ciKIBazTof8C&pg=PA354&dq=Our+Ukraine+ally+Yulia+Tymoshenko&hl=en&ei=uaMKTZPpCMPpOYT7pYIJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q&f=false Central and East European Politics: From Communism to Democracy] by [[Sharon Wolchik]] and [[Jane Curry]], [[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]], 2007, {{ISBN|0-7425-4068-5}} (page 355)</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck7j26KuoKcC&pg=PA34&dq=Our+Ukraine+ally+Yulia+Tymoshenko&hl=en&ei=EaMKTcqoOcKAOq-C6YIJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Our%20Ukraine%20ally%20Yulia%20Tymoshenko&f=false The Colour Revolutions in the Former Soviet Republics: Successes and Failures (Routledge Contemporary Russia and Eastern Europe Series)] by [[Donnacha Ó Beacháin]] and [[Abel Polese]], [[Routledge]], 2010, {{ISBN|0-415-58060-9}} (page 35)</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&pg=PA116&dq=Our+Ukraine+ally+Yulia+Tymoshenko&hl=en&ei=EaMKTcqoOcKAOq-C6YIJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Our%20Ukraine%20ally%20Yulia%20Tymoshenko&f=false Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, And Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], [[M.E.
