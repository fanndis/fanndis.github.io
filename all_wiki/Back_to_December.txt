===Synopsis===
[[File:Taylor Swift - Back To December.jpg|thumb|Swift writing a letter to her ex-boyfriend in a room filled with snow.]]
The video begins with a young man seen walking alone in a small town to the snowy football field in a winter morning. The video cuts to Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her house. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through the video, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers of the snowy football field, reading her apology letter.<ref name="Newsroom"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etonline.com/music/106457_WATCH_Taylor_Swift_Goes_Back_to_December/ |title=WATCH: Taylor Swift Goes 'Back to December' |last=Willis |first=Jackie |date=January 13, 2011 |work=[[Entertainment Tonight]] |accessdate=January 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630205143/http://www.etonline.com/music/106457_WATCH_Taylor_Swift_Goes_Back_to_December/ |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Reception===
Critical receptions towards the music video were positive. Jillian Mapes of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' believed that the video is "appropriately understated" considering the fact that the song is all about making an apology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/473654/taylor-swift-braves-breakup-in-back-to-december-video|title=Taylor Swift Braves Breakup in 'Back To December' Video|last=Mapes |first=Jillian|date=January 13, 2011 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Improper Bostonian|The Improper]]'' noticed that the video has "the look and feel of a [[Hallmark Channel|Hallmark]] movie and is almost as maudlin,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theimproper.com/music/2283/taylor-swift-melancholy-in-back-to-december-video-watch|title=Taylor Swift Melancholy in Back to December Video |last= |first= |date=January 13, 2011 |work=[[The Oxonian Review]] |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> while Amos Barshad of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine felt that the video was "terrible."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/01/taylor_swift_makes_a_boring_br.html|title=Taylor Swift Makes a Boring Breakup Video Featuring Magic Snow|last=Barshad |first=Amos |date=January 13, 2011 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> Tamar Anitai of [[MTV]] described the video as "a bummer", writing "[It] isn't just about a girl with her calendar permanently stuck on the twelfth month of the year.
