'''Lake Washington''' is a large freshwater [[lake]] adjacent to the city of [[Seattle]]. It is the largest lake in [[King County, Washington|King County]] and the second largest natural lake in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], after [[Lake Chelan]]. It borders the cities of Seattle on the west, [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]] on the east, [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] on the south and [[Kenmore, Washington|Kenmore]] on the north, and encloses [[Mercer Island, Washington|Mercer Island]]. The lake is fed by the [[Sammamish River]] at its north end and the [[Cedar River (Washington)|Cedar River]] at its south.

Lake Washington received its present name in 1854 after [[Thomas Mercer]] suggested it be named after [[George Washington]], as the new [[Washington Territory]] had been named the year before.<ref>{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3 |page= 156}}</ref> Prior names for Lake Washington have included the [[Duwamish tribe|Duwamish]] name ''Xacuabš'' ([[Lushootseed]]: literally ''great-amount-of-water''),<ref>{{cite book |last= Thrush |first= Coll |title= Native Seattle: Histories from the Crossing-Over Place |year= 2007 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-98700-6 |page= 245}},</ref> as well as Lake Geneva, Lake Duwamish, and the Chinook jargon name, "Hyas Chuck," meaning, "Big Lake."<ref name="gis.ess.washington.edu">[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr811182 Historical Changes to Lake Washington and Route of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, King County, Washington], Michael Chrzastowski, United States Geological Survey, Department of the Interior</ref>

The lake provides sport fishing opportunities. Some species found in this lake are Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Rainbow Trout, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/washington/37/|title=Lake Washington – Fish Washington |publisher= Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife}}</ref>

==Geography==
A [[ribbon lake]], Lake Washington is long, narrow and finger-like. Ribbon lakes are excavated by glaciers. As the Puget lobe of the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet]] flowed south near the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]], it met bands of harder and softer rock. Erosion of the softer rock was faster and a linear depression was created in the flow direction. When the glacier melted, the lake filled with the meltwater, which was retained by [[moraine]] deposits. A dam can also be created by the bands of harder rock either side of the softer rock. There is usually a river at both ends of a ribbon lake, one being the inlet, and the other, the outlet—though in the case of present-day Lake Washington, inlet rivers are located at both ends, with a man-made outlet in the middle. Two [[seaplane base]]s, [[Kenmore Air Harbor]] and [[Will Rogers – Wiley Post Memorial Seaplane Base]], <!-- maybe clarify is this "in" Renton Airport, part of Renton Airport? Or just adjacent to it? --> have air travel passenger terminals.

==Creeks and rivers==
[[Image:LakeWashington-watershed.png|thumb|left|Lake Washington watershed]]
The main inflowing rivers are the [[Sammamish River|Sammamish]] and [[Cedar River (Washington)|Cedar]] Rivers, with the Cedar supplying most of the water.  Seasonal changes in the flow of the Sammamish are moderated by a [[weir]] at the Lake Sammamish inlet.<ref name="gis.ess.washington.edu"/>

The lake is drained by the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]].

In addition, there are numerous small creeks and rivers which feed the lake, including:<ref name=Friends_geog>{{citation|url=http://www.cedarriver.org/the-watershed |title=The Watershed: the geography |publisher=Friends of the Cedar River Watershed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214152353/http://www.cedarriver.org/the-watershed |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Historically, construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal drastically changed the inflow and outflow of the lake.  Before construction of the canal 1916, Lake Washington's outlet was the [[Black River (Duwamish River)|Black River]], which joined the [[Duwamish River]] and emptied into [[Elliott Bay]]. When the canal was opened the level of the lake dropped nearly nine feet (2.7 m).<ref>[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=1444 Lake Washington Ship Canal], HistoryLink.org</ref> The canal became the lake's sole outlet, causing the Black River to dry up and disappear.  Before construction, the Sammamish River was the primary source of water for Lake Washington. The lowering of the lake slightly increased the flow of the Sammamish.  As part of the ship canal project, the Cedar River was diverted into Lake Washington, to become the primary source of water for Lake Washington.

==Canals and bridges==
[[File:Cutting cofferdam Montlake Cut.jpg|thumb|left|Cutting the [[cofferdam]] at Montlake in 1913, draining Lake Washington over the next three months until it was level with Lake Union]]
The [[Montlake Cut]], part of the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]], connects the lake to Lake Union and ultimately [[Puget Sound]].

Concrete floating bridges are employed to span the lake because Lake Washington's depth and muddy bottom prevented the emplacement of the pilings or towers necessary for the construction of a [[causeway]] or [[suspension bridge]]. The bridges consist of hollow concrete pontoons that float atop the lake, anchored with cables to each other and to weights on the lake bottom. The roadway is constructed atop these concrete pontoons. Three floating bridges cross Lake Washington: the [[Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (2016)|Evergreen Point Floating Bridge]] (officially the SR 520 [[Albert D. Rosellini]] Evergreen Point Floating Bridge) carries [[Washington State Route 520|State Route 520]] from Seattle's [[Montlake, Seattle|Montlake]] neighborhood to [[Medina, Washington|Medina]] while the [[Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Third Lake Washington Bridge]] (officially the [[Homer M. Hadley]] Memorial Bridge) carry [[Interstate 90 (Washington)|Interstate 90]] from Seattle's [[Mount Baker, Seattle|Mount Baker]] neighborhood to [[Mercer Island, Washington|Mercer Island]]. The [[East Channel Bridge]] carries [[Interstate 90 (Washington)|Interstate 90]] from Mercer Island to [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]]. The Evergreen Point, Lacey V. Murrow, and Third Lake Washington [[bridge]]s are the longest, second longest, and fifth longest [[pontoon bridge|floating bridges]] in the world, respectively.

Many questioned the wisdom of concrete floating bridge technology after the sinking of a portion of the Lacey V. Murrow bridge on November 25, 1990. However, a Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) investigation revealed that the incident resulted from the improper handling of [[hydrodemolition]] water being used during bridge renovations, rather than in any basic flaw in the bridge's concept or design. Concrete floating bridges continue to remain a viable means for the conveyance of vehicle traffic over Lake Washington.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dorpat |first= Paul |author2=Genevieve McCoy  |title= Building Washington: A History of Washington State Public Works |year= 1998 |publisher= Tartu Publications |isbn= 0-9614357-9-8 |page= 124}}</ref>

In 1950, approximately one year after the [[Toll bridge|tolls]] were removed from the Murrow bridge, the [[Lake Washington ferries|inland ferry system]] on the lake came to an end, having operated since the 1880s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dorpat |first= Paul |author2=Genevieve McCoy  |title= Building Washington: A History of Washington State Public Works |year= 1998 |publisher= Tartu Publications |isbn= 0-9614357-9-8 |page= 36}}</ref>

==Shoreline cities and towns==
The cities and towns bordering the lake, going clockwise from the west, are [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Lake Forest Park, Washington|Lake Forest Park]], [[Kenmore, Washington|Kenmore]], [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Yarrow Point, Washington|Yarrow Point]], [[Hunts Point, Washington|Hunts Point]], [[Medina, Washington|Medina]], [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], [[Beaux Arts Village, Washington|Beaux Arts Village]], and [[Renton, Washington|Renton]]. The city of [[Mercer Island, Washington|Mercer Island]] occupies the island of the same name, in the southern half of the lake.

==Water purity==
Around 1900, Seattle began discharging sewage into Lake Washington. During the 1940s and 1950s, eleven sewage treatment plants were sending state-of-the-art treated water into the lake at a rate of 20 million gallons per day. At the same time, phosphate-based detergents came into wide use. The lake responded to the massive input of nutrients by developing unpleasant blooms of noxious blue-green algae. The water lost its clarity, the desirable fish populations declined, and masses of dead algae accumulated on the shores of the lake. After significant pollution, the October 5, 1963 issue of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|Post Intelligencer]]'' referred to the lake as "Lake Stinko". Citizen concern led to the creation of a system that diverted the treatment-plant effluents into nearby Puget Sound, where tidal flushing would mix them with open-ocean water. The diversion was complete by 1968, and the lake responded quickly. The algal blooms diminished, the water regained its clarity, and by 1975, recovery was complete. Careful studies by a group of [[limnologist]]s from the [[University of Washington]] showed that phosphate was the culprit. Since then, Lake Washington has undergone major improvements, drastically improving the ecology and water quality, making the water twice as clear as it was in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1955c.html|title=Rescue of "Lake Stinko"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227021541/http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1955c.html|archivedate=2009-02-27}}</ref>
