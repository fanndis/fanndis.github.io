==Plot==
<!--- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Please keep rewrites within this range! (It's a summary, not a competition to see who can remember the most detail.) --->
[[Jay Baruchel]] arrives in [[Los Angeles]] to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor [[Seth Rogen]], who invites him to a housewarming party hosted by [[James Franco]]. There, Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party, so Seth accompanies him to a [[convenience store]] for [[cigarette]]s. When beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky, Seth and Jay flee back to James' house and find the party unharmed. An [[earthquake]] strikes and the crowd rushes outside, witnessing a [[sinkhole]] opening up in James' yard. Several celebrities and party guests are killed as Seth, Jay, James, [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] run back inside the house, where Jay tells the remaining partygoers that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They then take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help.

The next morning, [[Danny McBride]], who crashed the party and fell asleep, wakes up first and wastes much of the group's food and water due to his ignorance of the crisis. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen creature. Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the [[Apocalypse]] predicted in the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''. [[Emma Watson]] makes her way back to James' house, but due to a misunderstanding, she believes the group is planning to [[rape]] her and leaves with the group's remaining drinks.

Craig goes for water stored in James' cellar, but he encounters an unknown being, causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite and the others kick him out of the house. Before leaving, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months prior, but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship. That night, Jonah prays for Jay to die and is [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a [[demon]]. Seth and James are attacked by the possessed Jonah, but Jay and Craig subdue Jonah and tie him up. During an [[exorcism]] attempt, Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle, starting a fire that engulfs Jonah and the house and forces the others outside.

James suggests driving to his home in [[Malibu, California]], but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into [[Heaven]] when the plan succeeds; the others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. On the way to Malibu, the three encounter [[cannibalism|cannibals]] led by Danny and his [[Gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]], [[Channing Tatum]]. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny, the beam vanishes and Danny and the other cannibals eat James alive while Seth and Jay escape and encounter [[Satan]]. Jay apologizes to Seth for his wrongdoings while Satan attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand, but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven; Seth forces Jay to leave him behind whereupon another beam appears around Seth. The pair finally arrive in Heaven where they are reunited with Craig, who tells them that any wish comes true. After Jay wishes for the [[Backstreet Boys]], the band performs "[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]" as everyone in Heaven dances.

==Production==
Regarding why they made the film, Rogen and Goldberg told interviewers that "We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and [[Busta Rhymes]] were filming a [[music video]] and a film respectively, on the [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gd6yr/we_are_seth_rogen_and_evan_goldberg_ask_us/caj3yuv?context=3|title=We are Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg - Ask Us Anything|work=[[Reddit]]|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2013|author1=Rogen, Seth|author2=Goldberg, Evan}}</ref> The film is also based on ''[[Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse]]'', a [[short film]] created by Rogen, Goldberg and Jason Stone in 2007.<ref name="Chitwood">{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Aziz Ansari Joins Seth Rogen in THE APOCALYPSE|url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013|date=April 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815165409/http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660|archivedate=August 15, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Goldberg commented on influences contributing to the film, "If you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of [[Charlie Kaufman]]. Seth and I always loved ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''  too. And the popularity of [[reality television]] now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real. We thought working with our friends in that situation would be awesome because they're all comedians willing to take stabs at themselves."<ref>{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Gilbey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/06/this-is-the-end-actors-play-themselves|title=''This is the End'': why actors love to play themselves|date=June 6, 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref> The actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, with only James Franco having no objections to doing what the script wanted him to do.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/06/10/this-is-the-end-stars-talk-reuniting-for-new-apocalypse-comedy/2406015/ Good friends made 'This Is the End' into a real party], USA Today</ref>

The film was rated [[MPAA rating system#Ratings|R]] for "crude and sexual content throughout, brief graphic nudity, pervasive language, drug use and some violence" by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]; this rating shocked both Rogen and Goldberg, who expected an NC-17 rating for the film. Goldberg stated: "All the ratings stuff doesn’t make sense in the first place, but this is like ludicrous," Rogen then commented: "We actually made it even a little worse than we wanted and that [original] version got approved. Insanely, [we] didn’t have a ratings issue."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2013-jun-05-la-et-mn-this-is-the-end-mpaa-rating-20130604-story.html|title='This Is the End' filmmakers: We expected NC-17, not R, rating|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref>

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 224 reviews with an average rating of 7.14/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Energetic, self-deprecating performances and enough guffaw-inducing humor make up for the flaws in ''This Is the End'''s loosely written script."<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|this_is_the_end|This Is the End}} [[Fandango Media]]. Retrieved December 21, 2019</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{metacritic film|this-is-the-end|This Is the End}} [[CBS Interactive]]. Retrieved July 6, 2013</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a [[Academic grading in the United States|letter grade]] of "A", saying, "You could sit through a year's worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything that's genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But ''This Is the End'' . . truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest."<ref>{{cite web |first= Owen |last= Gleiberman |author-link= Owen Gleiberman |url= https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,20687779,00.html |title= Movie Review: This Is the End |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= June 8, 2013 |accessdate= June 11, 2013 }}</ref> Brian D. Johnson of ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "There could be worse ways to experience the apocalypse than with a party of stoned celebrities at James Franco's house. For one thing, his epic art collection can be used to board up the cracking walls against demons and zombies. That's the [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] scenario of ''This Is the End''...The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz parody. But with perfect timing, it also sends up a genre that has recently gone viral at the multiplex: the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apoca]]-[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/06/07/was-armageddon-always-this-complicated/|title=Was Armageddon always this complicated?|work=Maclean's|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref>

Rick Groen of Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of five, comparing the film to the interminable wait for a cancelled bus and referring to the actors in the film as "the lazy, the privileged and the mirthless".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/summer-entertainment/this-is-the-end-leaves-viewers-asking-when-will-it-be-over/article12469461/#dashboard/follows/|title=This Is the End leaves viewers asking: When will it be over?|work=The Globe and Mail|last=Groen|first=Rick D.|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Unproduced sequel==
When [[Evan Goldberg]] was asked whether a sequel to the film was probable, he said, "If you ask me, I'd say there's a pretty good chance of a sequel. If you ask Seth Rogen, he'd say no." In June 2013, Goldberg announced some ideas for a sequel in which the apocalypse occurs at the [[premiere]] of the first film. "Seth's a cokehead in this version, Michael Cera is a calm dude with a boyfriend, Rihanna and The Backstreet Boys are back," Goldberg said in an interview. "We have a lot of ideas: a heaven and [[hell]] for example and a [[Garden of Eden]] version where Danny [McBride] is [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/evan-goldberg-thinks-this-is-the-end-sequel-is-entirely-possible/|title=Evan Goldberg Thinks 'This is The End' Sequel is Entirely Possible|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref> Despite this, Goldberg has also stated that it would be difficult to recreate the casting conditions from the first film due to different schedules, believing them to be a stroke of luck by saying: "I honestly don't know if we could get the guys together [again]." In May 2014, Rogen posted a status of the sequel, saying: "I don't think we'll make a sequel to ''This Is the End'', but if we did, it would be called ''No, THIS Is the End''."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sethrogen/status/472174283360567296|title=Seth Rogen on Twitter|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>

==Attraction==
''This Is the End'' was adapted into a [[three-dimensional space|3D]] [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|maze]] titled ''This Is the End 3D'' for [[Halloween Horror Nights]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in 2015. The maze served as the event's first horror/comedy-based attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenhorrornights.com/hollywood/2015/att-this-is-the-end.php|title=Halloween Horror Nights Event in Los Angeles|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>
