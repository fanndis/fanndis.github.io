She was the wife of a former [[President of Bangladesh]] [[Ziaur Rahman]]. She is the current chairperson and leader of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) which was founded by Rahman in the late 1970s.

After a military coup in 1982, led by Army Chief General [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], Zia helped lead the movement for democracy until the fall of Ershad in 1990. She became the prime minister following the BNP party win in the [[1991 Bangladeshi general election|1991 general election]]. She also served briefly in the short-lived government in 1996, when other parties had boycotted [[February 1996 Bangladeshi general election|the first election]]. In the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|next round of general elections of 1996]], the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] came to power. Her party came to power again in 2001. She has been elected to five separate parliamentary constituencies in the general [[Elections in Bangladesh|elections]] of 1991, [[1996 Bangladeshi general election|1996]] and [[2001 Bangladeshi general election|2001]].

In its list of the [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|100 Most Powerful Women in the World]], ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked Zia at number 14 in 2004,<ref>{{cite web |year=2004 |title=#14: Begum Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister of Bangladesh |url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/11/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=11&passYear=2004&passListType=Person&uniqueId=JSK7&datatype=Person |work=Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women in the World |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614063040/http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/11/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=11&passYear=2004&passListType=Person&uniqueId=JSK7&datatype=Person |archive-date=14 June 2012 |access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref> number 29 in 2005,<ref>{{cite web |year=2005 |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/11/JSK7.html |title=#29 Khaleda Zia, Prime minister, Bangladesh |work=The 100 Most Powerful Women |accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref> and number 33 in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |work=The 100 Most Powerful Women |title=#33 Khaleda Zia, Prime Minister, Bangladesh |date=31 August 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/11/06women_Khaleda-Zia_JSK7.html |accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>

Following her government's term end in 2006, the scheduled January 2007 elections were delayed due to political violence and in-fighting, resulting in a bloodless military takeover of the caretaker government. During its interim rule, it charged Zia and her two sons with corruption.<ref name=jazeera/><ref name=corruption/><ref name=detained/>

Since the 1980s, Zia's chief rival has been Awami League leader [[Sheikh Hasina]].

==Prime Minister==
===First term===
[[File:Khaleda Clinton.JPG|thumb|Zia with US President [[Bill Clinton]].]]
A neutral caretaker government in Bangladesh oversaw [[1991 Bangladeshi general election|elections on 27 February 1991]]<ref name=bit/> following eight years of Ershad presidency. BNP won 140 seats - 11 short of simple majority.<ref name=bit>{{cite book |author1=Dieter Nohlen |author1-link=Dieter Nohlen |author2=Florian Grotz |author3=Christof Hartmann |year=2001 |title=Elections in Asia: A data handbook |volume=Volume I |page=537 |isbn=978-0-19-924958-9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/01/world/general-s-widow-wins-bangladesh-vote.html|title=General's Widow Wins Bangladesh Vote|last1=Crossette|first1=Barbara|date=1991-03-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-24|last2=Times|first2=Special To the New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Zia was sworn in as the country's first female prime minister on 20 March 1991 with the support of a majority of the deputies in parliament. With a unanimous vote, the parliament passed the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Bangladesh#Twelfth Amendment|12th amendment]] to the constitution in August 1991. The acting president [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] granted Zia nearly all of the powers that were vested in the president at the time, effectively returning Bangladesh to a parliamentary system in September.

Zia's administration abolished the Upazila system in November 1991. It formed the Local Government Structure Review Commission, which recommended a two-tier system of local government, district and union councils. Also the Thana Development and Coordination Committee was formed to coordinate development activities at the thana level.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Decentralisation}}</ref>

===Second term===
When the opposition boycotted the [[February 1996 Bangladeshi general election|15 February 1996 election]], Zia's party BNP had a landslide victory in the 6th [[Jatiya Sangshad]].<ref name=Nohlen2001p525>{{cite book |author1=Dieter Nohlen |author1-link=Dieter Nohlen |author2=Florian Grotz |author3=Christof Hartmann |year=2001 |title=Elections in Asia: A data handbook |volume=Volume I |page=525 |isbn=978-0-19-924958-9}}</ref> Other major parties demanded a neutral [[caretaker government]] to be appointed to oversee the elections. The short-lived [[Parliament of Bangladesh|parliament]] hastily introduced the caretaker government by passing the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|13th amendment]] to the constitution. The parliament was dissolved to pave the way for parliamentary elections within 90 days.

In the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|12 June 1996 elections]], BNP lost to Sheikh Hasina's [[Awami League]]. Winning 116 seats,<ref name=Nohlen2001p525/> BNP emerged as the largest opposition party in the country's parliamentary history.

===Third term===
[[File:LulaZia.jpg|thumb|Zia with the President of Brazil [[Lula da Silva]] (2004)]]
[[File:The Leader of Opposition Shri L.K. Advani calls on the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Ms Khaleda Zia, in New Delhi on March 22, 2006.jpg|thumb|Zia with the Indian Leader of Opposition [[L. K. Advani]] in New Delhi (2006)]]
The BNP formed a four-party alliance<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578373.stm |title=Analysis: Challenges ahead for Bangladesh |date=4 October 2001 |work=BBC News |author=Alastair Lawson}}</ref> on 6 January 1999 to increase its chances to return to power in the next general elections. These included its former political foe the [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]], founded by President Ershad after he led a military government, and the Islamic parties of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]] and the [[Islami Oikya Jot]]. It encouraged protests against the ruling Awami League.

Many residents{{according to whom|date=August 2019}} strongly criticized Zia and BNP for allying with Jamaat-e-Islami,<ref>{{cite news |title=Analysis: Challenges ahead for Bangladesh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578373.stm |work=BBC News |access-date=25 February 2015}}</ref> which had opposed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. The four-party alliance participated in the 1 October 2001 general elections, winning two-thirds of the seats in parliament and 46% of the vote (compared to the principal opposition party's 40%). Zia was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

She worked on a 100-day programme to fulfill most of her election pledges to the nation. During this term, the share of domestic resources in economic development efforts grew. Bangladesh began to attract a higher level of international investment for development of the country's infrastructure, energy resources and businesses, including from the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. Restoration of law and order was an achievement during the period.

Zia promoted neighbourly relations in her foreign policy. In her "look-east policy," she worked to bolster regional cooperation in South Asia and adherence to the UN Charter of Human Rights. She negotiated settlement of international disputes, and renounced the use of force in international relations. Bangladesh began to participate in United Nations international peacekeeping efforts. In 2006, ''Forbes'' magazine featured her administration in a major story praising her achievements. Her government worked to educate young girls (nearly 70% of Bangladeshi women were illiterate) and distribute food to the poor (half of Bangladesh's 135 million people live below the poverty line). Her government promoted strong GDP growth (5%) based on economic reforms and support of an entrepreneurial culture.

When Zia became prime minister for the third time, the GDP growth rate of Bangladesh remained above 6 percent. The Bangladesh per capita national income rose to 482 dollars. Foreign exchange reserve of Bangladesh had crossed 3 billion dollars from the previous 1 billion dollars. The foreign direct investments of Bangladesh had risen to 2.5 billion dollars. The industrial sector of the GDP had exceeded 17 percent at the end of Zia's office.<ref name=bpedia/>

On 29 October 2006, Zia's term in office ended. In accordance with the constitution, a caretaker government would manage in the 90-day interim before general elections.
