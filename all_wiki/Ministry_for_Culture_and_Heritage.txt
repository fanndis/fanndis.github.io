The '''Ministry for Culture and Heritage'''  ('''MCH'''; {{Lang-mi|Te Manatū Taonga}}) is the department of the [[New Zealand Government]] responsible for supporting the [[Creative New Zealand|arts]], [[Culture of New Zealand|culture]], [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust|built heritage]], [[Sport New Zealand|sport and recreation]], and [[Public broadcasting in New Zealand|broadcasting]] sectors in New Zealand and advising government on such. 

==History==
The Ministry of Cultural Affairs had been created in 1991; prior to this, the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]] (DIA) had provided oversight and support for arts and culture functions.<ref name="history" />

MCH was founded in 1999 with the merger of the former Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the history and heritage functions of the DIA, as well as some functions from the [[Department of Conservation]] and [[Ministry of Commerce (New Zealand)|Ministry of Commerce]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/about-ministry/overview/history-government-involvement-culture|title=History of Government involvement in culture|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref><ref name="PR">{{cite press release|author=Marie Hasler|date=28 July 1999|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/cultural-and-heritage-sector-some-relevant-questions-and-answers|title=Cultural and Heritage sector – some relevant questions and answers|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> The purpose of the merger of functions and departments was to create a coherent, non-fragmented overview of the cultural and heritage sector, rather than spreading services and functions across several departments.<ref name="PR" />

Minister for Cultural Affairs [[Marie Hasler]] oversaw the transition of functions into the new agency.<ref name="PR"/> Opposition Labour MP [[Judith Tizard]], who would later serve as an Associate Minister for the ministry in the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]], accused the restructure of being "all hype, no substance," lacking the funding and human resource necessary to be effective.<ref>{{cite press release|author=Judith Tizard|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA9907/S00546/all-hype-no-substance.htm|title=All hype, no substance|date=28 July 1999|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>

At the time of its establishment, the minister responsible for the ministry was the Minister for Culture and Heritage. This position is now titled the [[Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage]].

== Functions ==
The ministry advises the government on policies and issues relating to the arts, culture, heritage, sport and recreation, and broadcasting sectors. It funds 17 other agencies which also support these sectors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/funding-nz-culture/agencies-we-fund|title=Agencies we fund|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> looks after [[war monument]]s and memorials and [[war graves]] throughout New Zealand, and is involved in a number of projects promoting and documenting New Zealand history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/what-we-do/our-projects|title=Our projects|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>

David Green, a historian working for the ministry, discovered that significantly more New Zealand personnel were engaged in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] than had been recorded in [[Fred Waite (politician)|Fred Waite]]'s official history, ''The New Zealanders at Gallipoli''. Waite's number of some 8,500 men was corrected to approximately 13,000 in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=New research: How many New Zealanders served on Gallipoli? |url= http://www.gallipoli2015.govt.nz/new-research-how-many-new-zealanders-served-on-gallipoli |publisher=[[New Zealand Defence Force]] |date=3 September 2013|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>

Landmarks Whenua Tohunga is a partnership between MCH, the [[Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai]], [[Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga]] and the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]].
