'''Rosa Louise McCauley Parks''' (February 4, 1913&nbsp;– October 24, 2005) was an American [[activist]] in the [[civil rights movement]] best known for her pivotal role in the [[Montgomery bus boycott]]. The [[United States Congress]] has called her "the first lady of civil rights" and "the mother of the freedom movement".<ref>{{USPL|106|26}}. Retrieved November 13, 2011.

On December 1, 1955, in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Parks rejected bus driver [[James F. Blake]]'s order to vacate a row of four seats in the "[[colored]]" section in favor of a white passenger, once the "white" section was filled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/rosa-parks |title=An Act of Courage, The Arrest Records of Rosa Parks |date=15 August 2015 |access-date=1 December 2020 |website=National Archives}}</ref> Parks wasn't the first person to resist bus segregation, but the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for [[civil disobedience]] in violating Alabama segregation laws, and she helped inspire the black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. The case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' resulted in a November 1956 decision that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Other Rosa Parks: Now 73, Claudette Colvin Was First to Refuse Giving Up Seat on Montgomery Bus |series=[[Democracy Now!]] |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2013/3/29/the_other_rosa_parks_now_73 |publisher=[[Pacifica Radio]] |last1=González |first1=Juan |last2=Goodman |first2=Amy |date=March 29, 2013 |minutes=25 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Branch">{{cite web |title=Parting the Waters: America in the King Years |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1988 |first=Taylor |last=Branch |url=http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/branch4.htm |accessdate=February 5, 2013| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130523192706/http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/branch4.htm| archive-date= May 23, 2013| url-status=dead }}</ref>

Parks' act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement. She became an international icon of resistance to [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including [[Edgar Nixon]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]. At the time, Parks was employed as a seamstress at a local department store and was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. She had recently attended the [[Highlander Folk School]], a [[Tennessee]] center for training activists for workers' rights and racial equality. Although widely honored in later years, she also suffered for her act; she was fired from her job, and received death threats for years afterwards.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Commentary: Rosa Parks' Role In The Civil Rights Movement |date=June 13, 1999 |work=Weekend Edition Sunday |publisher=NPR |id={{ProQuest|190159646}}}}</ref> Shortly after the boycott, she moved to [[Detroit]], where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988, she served as secretary and receptionist to [[John Conyers]], an African-American [[US Representative]]. She was also active in the [[Black Power]] movement and the support of [[political prisoners]] in the US.

After retirement, Parks wrote her autobiography and continued to insist that the struggle for justice was not over and there was more work to be done.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/12/01/how-history-got-the-rosa-parks-story-wrong/ |title=How History Got Rosa Parks Wrong |last=Theoharis |first=Jeanne |date=December 1, 2015 |website=The Washington Post }}</ref> Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 [[Spingarn Medal]], the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's [[National Statuary Hall]]. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman to [[State funerals in the United States#List of lying in state and honor recipients|lie in honor]] in the [[Capitol Rotunda]], becoming the thirty-first person to receive this honor. [[California]] and [[Missouri]] commemorate [[Rosa Parks Day]] on her birthday, February 4, while [[Ohio]] and [[Oregon]] commemorate the occasion on the anniversary of the day she was arrested, December 1.

==Early life==
Rosa Parks was born '''Rosa Louise McCauley''' in [[Tuskegee, Alabama]], on February 4, 1913, to Leona (née Edwards), a teacher, and James McCauley, a [[carpenter]]. In addition to African ancestry, one of Parks' great-grandfathers was [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and one of her great-grandmothers a part-[[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] slave.<ref name="Remembering Rosa Parks on Her 100th Birthday">{{cite web |last1=Gilmore |first1=Kim |title=Remembering Rosa Parks on Her 100th Birthday |url=https://www.biography.com/news/remembering-rosa-parks-on-her-100th-birthday-21114273 |website=Biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC. |accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>Douglas Brinkley, ''Rosa Parks'', Chapter 1, excerpted from the book published by Lipper/Viking (2000), {{ISBN|0-670-89160-6}}.

When her parents separated, she moved with her mother to [[Pine Level, Montgomery County, Alabama|Pine Level]], just outside the state capital, [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. She grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester. They all were members of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME), a century-old independent [[Black church|black denomination]] founded by free blacks in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the early nineteenth century.

McCauley attended rural schools<ref name="NYT2" /> until the age of eleven. Before that, her mother taught her "a good deal about sewing." She started piecing quilts from around the age of six, as her mother and grandmother were making quilts,  She put her first quilt together by herself around the age of ten, which was unusual, as quilting was mainly a family activity performed when there was no field work or chores to be done.  She learned more sewing in school from the age of eleven; she sewed her own "first dress [she] could wear."<ref name="Quilts">{{cite book|editor-last=MacDowell|editor-first=Marsha L. |chapter=An Interview with Rosa Parks, The Quilter |last1=Barney |first1=Deborah Smith |title=African American Quiltmaking in Michigan |date=1997 |publisher=Michigan State University Press|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/African_American_Quiltmaking_in_Michigan/R63YAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 | oclc=36900789 |location=East Lansing, MI |isbn=0870134108 |pages=x, 133–138 |accessdate=October 12, 2020}}</ref>  As a student at the [[Industrial School for Girls]] in Montgomery, she took academic and vocational courses. Parks went on to a laboratory school set up by the [[Alabama State University|Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes]] for secondary education, but dropped out in order to care for her grandmother and later her mother, after they became ill.<ref name="shraff">{{cite book |title=Rosa Parks: Tired of Giving In |publisher=Enslow |last=Shraff |first=Anne |year=2005 |pages=23–27 |isbn=978-0-7660-2463-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J37vgZvCI78C&pg=PA23}}</ref>

Around the turn of the 20th century, the former Confederate states had adopted new constitutions and electoral laws that effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] black voters and, in Alabama, many poor white voters as well. Under the white-established [[Jim Crow laws]], passed after Democrats regained control of southern legislatures, racial segregation was imposed in public facilities and retail stores in the [[Southern United States|South]], including public transportation. Bus and train companies enforced seating policies with separate sections for blacks and whites. School bus transportation was unavailable in any form for black schoolchildren in the South, and black education was always underfunded.

Parks recalled going to elementary school in Pine Level, where school buses took white students to their new school and black students had to walk to theirs:

<blockquote>I'd see the bus pass every day ... But to me, that was a way of life; we had no choice but to accept what was the custom. The bus was among the first ways I realized there was a black world and a white world.<ref name="The Henry Ford">

Although Parks' autobiography recounts early memories of the kindness of white strangers, she could not ignore the [[Racism in the United States|racism]] of her society. When the [[Ku Klux Klan]] marched down the street in front of their house, Parks recalls her grandfather guarding the front door with a shotgun.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1995-11-08/html/CREC-1995-11-08-pt1-PgE2135-2.htm |publisher=republished in Congressional Record Volume 141, Number 176; November 8, 1995 |first=Walt |last=Harrington |title=A Person Who Wanted To Be Free |work=[[The Washington Post Magazine]] |date=October 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 19, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170805101606/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1995-11-08/html/CREC-1995-11-08-pt1-PgE2135-2.htm|archive-date= August 5, 2017|url-status= dead}}</ref> The Montgomery Industrial School, founded and staffed by white northerners for black children, was burned twice by arsonists. Its faculty was ostracized by the white community.

Repeatedly bullied by white children in her neighborhood, Parks often fought back physically. She later said: "As far back as I remember, I could never think in terms of accepting physical abuse without some form of retaliation if possible."<ref name="rebellious mrs.">{{cite book |title=The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks |first=Jeanne |last=Theoharis |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780807076927 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9_YCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA208 |access-date=July 19, 2016}}</ref>{{rp|208}}

At her husband's urging, she finished her high school studies in 1933, at a time when fewer than 7% of African Americans had a high-school diploma.

In December 1943, Parks became active in the [[civil rights movement]], joined the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, and was elected secretary at a time when this was considered a woman's job.

In the 1940s, Parks and her husband were members of the [[League of Women Voters]]. Sometime soon after 1944, she held a brief job at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], which, despite its location in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], did not permit racial segregation because it was [[federal government of the United States|federal]] property. She rode on its integrated trolley. Speaking to her biographer, Parks noted, "You might just say Maxwell opened my eyes up." Parks worked as a housekeeper and seamstress for [[Clifford Durr|Clifford]] and [[Virginia Foster Durr|Virginia Durr]], a white couple. Politically [[American liberalism|liberal]], the Durrs became her friends. They encouraged—and eventually helped sponsor—Parks in the summer of 1955 to attend the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]], an education center for activism in workers' rights and racial equality in [[Monteagle, Tennessee]]. There Parks was mentored by the veteran organizer [[Septima Clark]].<ref name="rebellious mrs." /> In 1945, despite the Jim Crow laws and discrimination by registrars, she succeeded in registering to vote on her third try.<ref name="Whitaker 2011" />{{Rp|690}}

==Parks arrest and bus boycott==
[[File:Rosaparks busdiagram.jpg|thumb|Seat layout on the bus where Parks sat, December 1, 1955]]

===Montgomery buses: law and prevailing customs===
In 1900, Montgomery had passed a city ordinance to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats to achieve that goal. According to the law, no passenger would be required to move or give up their seat and stand if the bus was crowded and no other seats were available. Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers adopted the practice of requiring black riders to move when there were no white-only seats left.<ref>''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'', 142 F. Supp. 707 (1956)</ref>

The first four rows of seats on each Montgomery bus were reserved for whites. Buses had "colored" sections for black people generally in the rear of the bus, although blacks composed more than 75% of the ridership. The sections were not fixed but were determined by placement of a movable sign. Black people could sit in the middle rows until the white section filled; if more whites needed seats, blacks were to move to seats in the rear, stand, or, if there was no room, leave the bus. Black people could not sit across the aisle in the same row as white people. The driver could move the "colored" section sign, or remove it altogether. If white people were already sitting in the front, black people had to board at the front to pay the fare, then disembark and reenter through the rear door.<ref>Garrow, David J. ''Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.'' (1986) {{ISBN|0-394-75623-1}}, p. 13.</ref>

For years, the black community had complained that the situation was unfair. Parks said, "My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. I did a lot of walking in Montgomery."<ref name="NYT2" />

One day in 1943, Parks boarded a bus and paid the fare. She then moved to a seat, but driver [[James F. Blake]] told her to follow city rules and enter the bus again from the back door. When Parks exited the vehicle, Blake drove off without her.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/27/guardianobituaries |title=James F.

Near the middle of the bus, her row was directly behind the ten seats reserved for white passengers. Initially, she did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded. Blake noted that two or three white passengers were standing, as the front of the bus had filled to capacity. He moved the "colored" section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit.

===Montgomery bus boycott===
{{Main|Montgomery bus boycott}}
Nixon conferred with [[Jo Ann Robinson]], an [[Alabama State College]] professor and member of the [[Women's Political Council]] (WPC), about the Parks case. Robinson believed it important to seize the opportunity and stayed up all night [[mimeograph machine|mimeographing]] over 35,000 handbills announcing a bus boycott. The Women's Political Council was the first group to officially endorse the boycott.

On Sunday, December 4, 1955, plans for the Montgomery bus boycott were announced at black churches in the area, and a front-page article in the ''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' helped spread the word. At a church rally that night, those attending agreed unanimously to continue the boycott until they were treated with the level of courtesy they expected, until black drivers were hired, and until seating in the middle of the bus was handled on a first-come basis.

The next day, Parks was tried on charges of [[disorderly conduct]] and violating a local ordinance. The trial lasted 30 minutes. After being found guilty and fined $10, plus $4 in court costs (combined total {{Inflation|US|14|1955|fmt=eq}}),<ref name="CNN obit" /> Parks appealed her conviction and formally challenged the legality of racial segregation. In a 1992 interview with [[National Public Radio]]'s Lynn Neary, Parks recalled:

{{quote|I did not want to be mistreated, I did not want to be deprived of a seat that I had paid for.

On the day of Parks' trial—December 5, 1955—the WPC distributed the 35,000 leaflets. The handbill read,

<blockquote>We are ... asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial ... You can afford to stay out of school for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk. But please, children and grown-ups, don't ride the bus at all on Monday.

It rained that day, but the black community persevered in their boycott. Some rode in carpools, while others traveled in black-operated cabs that charged the same fare as the bus, 10 cents ({{Inflation|US|.1|1955|r=2|fmt=eq}}). Most of the remainder of the 40,000 black commuters walked, some as far as {{convert|20|mi|sigfig=1}}.

That evening after the success of the one-day boycott, a group of 16 to 18 people gathered at the Mt. Zion [[AME Zion]] Church to discuss boycott strategies. At that time, Parks was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; when she asked if she should say something, the reply was, "Why, you've said enough."<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwVbfvfYEZkC&pg=PA408 |title=Civil Rights History from the Ground Up |isbn=9780820338651 |last1=Crosby |first1=Emilye |year=2011}}</ref>

The group agreed that a new organization was needed to lead the boycott effort if it were to continue. Rev.

That Monday night, 50 leaders of the African-American community gathered to discuss actions to respond to Parks' arrest. [[Edgar Nixon]], the president of the NAACP, said, "My God, look what segregation has put in my hands!"<ref name="Autobiography p125">{{Cite book |title=Rosa Parks: My Story |page=[https://archive.org/details/rosaparksmystory00park_0/page/125 125] |last1=Parks |first1=Rosa |first2=James |last2=Haskins |publisher=Dial Books |year=1992 |isbn=0-8037-0673-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/rosaparksmystory00park_0/page/125}}</ref> Parks was considered the ideal plaintiff for a test case against city and state segregation laws, as she was seen as a responsible, mature woman with a good reputation.

Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company's finances, until the city repealed its law requiring segregation on public buses following the US Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that it was unconstitutional.

Parks played an important part in raising international awareness of the plight of African Americans and the civil rights struggle. King wrote in his 1958 book ''Stride Toward Freedom'' that Parks' arrest was the catalyst rather than the cause of the protest: "The cause lay deep in the record of similar injustices."<ref name="Testament" />{{rp|437}} He wrote, "Actually, no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, 'I can take it no longer.'"<ref name="Testament" />{{rp|424}}

==Detroit years==
===1960s===
[[File:Rosaparks bus.jpg|thumb|left|Parks on a Montgomery bus on December 21, 1956, the day Montgomery's public transportation system was legally integrated. Behind Parks is Nicholas C. Chriss, a [[United Press International|UPI]] reporter covering the event.]]

After her arrest, Parks became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement but suffered hardships as a result. Due to economic sanctions used against activists, she lost her job at the department store. Her husband quit his job after his boss forbade him to talk about his wife or the legal case. Parks traveled and spoke extensively about the issues.

In 1957, Raymond and Rosa Parks left Montgomery for [[Hampton, Virginia]]; mostly because she was unable to find work. She also disagreed with King and other leaders of Montgomery's struggling civil rights movement about how to proceed, and was constantly receiving death threats.<ref name="rebellious mrs." /> In Hampton, she found a job as a hostess in an inn at [[Hampton Institute]], a [[historically black college]].

Later that year, at the urging of her brother and sister-in-law in [[Detroit]], Sylvester and Daisy McCauley, Rosa and Raymond Parks and her mother moved north to join them. The City of Detroit attempted to cultivate a progressive reputation, but Parks encountered numerous signs of discrimination against African-Americans. Schools were effectively segregated, and services in black neighborhoods substandard. In 1964, Parks told an interviewer that, "I don't feel a great deal of difference here ... [[Housing segregation]] is just as bad, and it seems more noticeable in the larger cities." She regularly participated in the movement for open and [[fair housing]].<ref name="wasn't">{{cite journal |first=Jeanne |last=Theoharis |title='The northern promised land that wasn't': Rosa Parks and the Black Freedom Struggle in Detroit |url=http://www.virginia.edu/lifetimelearning/civilrights/articles/Rosa%20Parks%20and%20the%20Black%20Freedom%20Struggle%20in%20Detroit.pdf |journal=OAH Magazine of History |volume=26 |number=1 |pages=23–27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207061017/http://www.virginia.edu/lifetimelearning/civilrights/articles/Rosa%20Parks%20and%20the%20Black%20Freedom%20Struggle%20in%20Detroit.pdf |archive-date=December 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |doi=10.1093/oahmag/oar054 |year=2012}}</ref>

Parks rendered crucial assistance in the first campaign for Congress by [[John Conyers]]. She persuaded Martin Luther King (who was generally reluctant to endorse local candidates) to appear with Conyers, thereby boosting the novice candidate's profile.<ref name="wasn't" /> When Conyers was elected, he hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit.

Parks participated in activism nationally during the mid-1960s, traveling to support the [[Selma-to-Montgomery March]]es, the Freedom Now Party,<ref name="rebellious mrs." /> and the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]]. She also befriended [[Malcolm X]], who she regarded as a personal hero.<ref name="10 Things">{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeanne-theoharis/rosa-parks-100th-birthday_b_2614678.html |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Rosa Parks |first=Jeanne |last=Theoharis |date=March 2, 2013 |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref>

Like many Detroit blacks, Parks remained particularly concerned about housing issues. She herself lived in a neighborhood, Virginia Park, which had been compromised by highway construction and [[urban renewal]]. By 1962, these policies had destroyed 10,000 structures in Detroit, displacing 43,096 people, 70 percent of them African-American. Parks lived just a mile from the center of [[1967 Detroit riot|the riot]] that took place in Detroit in 1967, and she considered housing discrimination a major factor that provoked the disorder.<ref name="wasn't" />

In the aftermath Parks collaborated with members of the [[League of Revolutionary Black Workers]] and the [[Republic of New Afrika]] in raising awareness of police abuse during the conflict. She served on a "people's tribunal" on August 30, 1967, investigating the killing of three young men by police during the 1967 Detroit uprising, in what came to be known as the [[Algiers Motel incident]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rosaparksbiography.org/bio/the-peoples-tribunal-on-the-algiers-motel-killings/ |title=The People's Tribunal on the Algiers Motel Killings {{!}} The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks|website=rosaparksbiography.org|date=May 18, 2016|access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref> She also helped form the Virginia Park district council to help rebuild the area.

The 1970s were a decade of loss for Parks in her personal life. Her family was plagued with illness; she and her husband had suffered stomach ulcers for years and both required hospitalization. In spite of her fame and constant speaking engagements, Parks was not a wealthy woman. She donated most of the money from speaking to civil rights causes, and lived on her staff salary and her husband's pension. Medical bills and time missed from work caused financial strain that required her to accept assistance from church groups and admirers.

Her husband died of throat cancer on August 19, 1977, and her brother, her only sibling, died of cancer that November. Her personal ordeals caused her to become removed from the civil rights movement. She learned from a newspaper of the death of [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], once a close friend. Parks suffered two broken bones in a fall on an icy sidewalk, an injury which caused considerable and recurring pain. She decided to move with her mother into an apartment for senior citizens. There she nursed her mother Leona through the final stages of cancer and geriatric dementia until she died in 1979 at the age of 92.

===1980s===
In 1980, Parks—widowed and without immediate family—rededicated herself to civil rights and educational organizations. She co-founded the [[Rosa L. Parks Scholarship Foundation]] for college-bound high school seniors,<ref>[http://www.madisonet.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=15486990&BRD=1302&PAG=461&dept_id=181987&rfi=8 "Editorial: Rosa Parks' legacy: non-violent power"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715141805/http://www.madisonet.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=15486990&BRD=1302&PAG=461&dept_id=181987&rfi=8 |date=July 15, 2009}}, ''[[Madison Daily Leader]]'', October 31, 2005.

In February 1987, she co-founded, with Elaine Eason Steele, the [[Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development]], an institute that runs the "Pathways to Freedom" bus tours which introduce young people to important civil rights and [[Underground Railroad]] sites throughout the country. Parks also served on the Board of Advocates of [[Planned Parenthood]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/rosa-parks-9433715?page=4 |title=Rosa Parks |website=Biography.com}} {{Full citation needed|date=March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcxqzal4bEYC&pg=PA969 |title=Parks, Rosa |first=Andrea |last=O'Reilly |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Motherhood, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE Publishing |year=2010 |page=969 |isbn=9781412968461}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/09/gop-candidates-who-hate-planned-parenthood-want-put-rosa-parks-planned-parenthood-board |first=Hannah |last=Levintova |title=Republicans Hate Planned Parenthood But Want to Put One of Its Backers on the $10 Bill |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=September 17, 2015}}</ref> Though her health declined as she entered her seventies, Parks continued to make many appearances and devoted considerable energy to these causes.

===1990s===
[[File:Rosa Parks MLK 30th anniversary.jpg|thumb|left|Parks in 1993]]

In 1992, Parks published ''Rosa Parks: My Story'', an autobiography aimed at younger readers, which recounts her life leading to her decision to keep her seat on the bus. A few years later, she published ''Quiet Strength'' (1995), her memoir, which focuses on her faith.

At age 81, Parks was robbed and assaulted in her home in central Detroit on August 30, 1994. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down the door but claimed he had chased away an intruder. He requested a reward and when Parks paid him, he demanded more. Parks refused and he attacked her. Hurt and badly shaken, Parks called a friend, who called the police. A neighborhood manhunt led to Skipper's capture and reported beating. Parks was treated at [[Detroit Receiving Hospital]] for facial injuries and swelling on the right side of her face. Parks said about the attack on her by the African-American man, "Many gains have been made ... But as you can see, at this time we still have a long way to go." Skipper was sentenced to 8 to 15 years and was transferred to prison in another state for his own safety.<ref>[https://nytimes.com/1994/08/31/us/rosa-parks-robbed-and-beaten.html "Rosa Parks Robbed and Beaten"] ''New York Times'', August 31, 1994.

Suffering anxiety upon returning to her small central Detroit house following the ordeal, Parks moved into [[Riverfront Towers]], a secure high-rise apartment building. Learning of Parks' move, [[Little Caesars]] owner [[Mike Ilitch]] offered to pay for her housing expenses for as long as necessary.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2014/02/24/Champions/Ilitch-Rosa-Parks.aspx |title=Ilitch aids civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks, others |last=Botta |first=Christopher |date=February 24, 2014 |website=Sports Business Daily |access-date=February 16, 2017}}</ref>

In 1994, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] applied to sponsor a portion of United States [[Interstate 55]] in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and [[Jefferson County, Missouri|Jefferson County]], Missouri, near [[St. Louis]], for cleanup (which allowed them to have signs stating that this section of highway was maintained by the organization). Since the state could not refuse the KKK's sponsorship, the Missouri legislature voted to name the highway section the "Rosa Parks Highway". When asked how she felt about this honor, she is reported to have commented, "It is always nice to be thought of."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1210/context/ourdailylives |title=Happy Birthday, Rosa Parks! |first=Ilena |last=Rosenthal |website=WomenseNews.org |date=February 4, 2003 |access-date=February 2, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817233310/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1210/context/ourdailylives |archive-date=August 17, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/rosapark.htm |title=The Name Game |website=Snopes.com |date=December 3, 2007| access-date= November 13, 2001}}</ref>

In 1999, Parks filmed a cameo appearance for the television series ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Black Like Monica |series=Touched By An Angel |series-link=Touched By An Angel |first=John |last=Masius |network=CBS |station=CBS |date=May 2, 1999 |season=5 |number=23}}</ref> It was her last appearance on film; Parks began to suffer from health problems due to old age.

===2000s===
In 2002, Parks received an eviction notice from her $1,800 per month ({{Inflation|US|1800|2002|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) apartment for non-payment of rent. Parks was incapable of managing her own financial affairs by this time due to age-related physical and mental decline. Her rent was paid from a collection taken by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. When her rent became delinquent and her impending eviction was highly publicized in 2004, executives of the ownership company announced they had forgiven the back rent and would allow Parks, by then 91 and in extremely poor health, to live rent-free in the building for the remainder of her life.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6659487/ns/us_news-life/t/landlord-wont-ask-rosa-parks-pay-rent/ |title=Landlord won't ask Rosa Parks to pay rent |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=December 6, 2004| access-date=May 28, 2010}}</ref> Elaine Steele, manager of the nonprofit Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, told the newspaper that Parks got proper care, and that eviction notices were sent in error in 2002. Her heirs and various interest organizations alleged at the time that her financial affairs had been mismanaged.

In 2016, Parks's former residence in Detroit was threatened with demolition. A Berlin-based American artist, [[Ryan Mendoza]], arranged to have the house disassembled, moved to his garden in Germany, and partly restored. It served as a museum honoring Rosa Parks.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saved From Demolition, Rosa Parks's House Gets a Second Life |last=McGrane |first=Sally |date=May 2, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/world/europe/rosa-parks-house-berlin.html}}</ref> In 2018, the house was moved back to the USA.

==Death and funeral==
Parks died of [[natural causes]] on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92, in her apartment on the east side of [[Detroit]]. She and her husband never had children and she outlived her only sibling. She was survived by her sister-in-law (Raymond's sister), 13 nieces and nephews and their families, and several cousins, most of them residents of [[Michigan]] or [[Alabama]].

City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral. Parks' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul [[African Methodist Episcopal]] (AME) church, where she [[lying in repose|lay in repose]] at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess. A memorial service was held there the following morning. One of the speakers, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], said that if it had not been for Parks, she would probably have never become the Secretary of State. In the evening the casket was transported to [[Washington, D.C.]] and transported by a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest, to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.

[[File:Rosa Parks lying in state.jpg|thumb|The casket of Rosa Parks at the U.S. Capitol rotunda]]

Since the founding of the practice in 1852, Parks was the 31st person, the first American who had not been a U.S. government official, and the second private person (after the French planner [[Pierre L'Enfant]]) to be honored in this way. She was the first woman and the second black person to lie in honor in the Capitol.<ref>{{cite web |title=Those Who Have Lain in State |url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/capitol/lain_in_state.cfm |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 1, 2009 |publisher=Architect of the Capitol}}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/LyingState.pdf Memorial or Funeral Services in the Capitol Rotunda], senate.gov (United States Senate); content cited to Architect of the Capitol.<!-- mention that because it is not independent of our other citation.--> Retrieved November 23, 2011.</ref> An estimated 50,000 people viewed the casket there, and the event was broadcast on television on October 31, 2005. A memorial service was held that afternoon at [[Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church|Metropolitan AME Church]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite news |title=An Overflowing Tribute to an Icon |last1=Wilgoren |first1=Debbi |first2=Theola S. |last2=Labbe |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/31/AR2005103100370.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 1, 2005 |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>

With her body and casket returned to Detroit, for two days, Parks lay in repose at the [[Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History]]. Her funeral service was seven hours long and was held on November 2, 2005, at the Greater Grace Temple Church in Detroit. After the service, an honor guard from the [[Michigan National Guard]] laid the U.S. flag over the casket and carried it to a horse-drawn hearse, which was intended to carry it, in daylight, to the cemetery. As the hearse passed the thousands of people who were viewing the procession, many clapped, cheered loudly and released white balloons. Parks was interred between her husband and mother at Detroit's [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Detroit, Michigan)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in the chapel's mausoleum. The chapel was renamed the Rosa L. Parks Freedom Chapel in her honor.<ref Name="Esparza private">{{cite news |author=Santiago Esparza |agency=The Detroit News |title=Parks to remain private in death |date=November 3, 2005 |newspaper=The Indianapolis Star |url=http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051103%2FNEWS06%2F511030463%2F1012 |accessdate=May 12, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614033729/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051103%2FNEWS06%2F511030463%2F1012 |archive-date=June 14, 2006}}</ref> Parks had previously prepared and placed a headstone on the selected location with the inscription "Rosa L.
