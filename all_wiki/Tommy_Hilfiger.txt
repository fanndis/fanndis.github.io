'''Thomas Jacob Hilfiger''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/hɪlˈfɪgər/]]; born March 24, 1951) is an American [[fashion designer]] and founder of [[Tommy Hilfiger Corporation]].<ref name="thcorp_s8" />

After starting his career by co-founding a chain of jeans/fashion stores called People's Place in [[upstate New York]] in the 1970s, he began designing [[preppy]] clothing for his own eponymous [[menswear]] line in the 1980s.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> The company later expanded into women's clothing and various luxury items such as [[perfumes]] and went public in 1992.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" />

Hilfiger's collections are often influenced by the fashion of music subcultures and marketed in connection with the music industry,<ref name="TCBIO15" /><ref name="TCBIO16" /> with celebrities such as American [[R&B]] artist [[Aaliyah]] in the 1990s.<ref name="aaliyahspokes" /> In 2005, contestants in the [[CBS]] [[reality show]] ''[[The Cut (CBS)|The Cut]]'' competed for a design job with Hilfiger in a similar fashion to [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV Series)|''The Apprentice'']].<ref name="thbiotwo_kthecut" /> In 2006, Hilfiger sold his company for $1.6 billion to [[Apax Partners]],<ref name="apaxfs" /> who next sold it in 2010 to [[Phillips-Van Heusen]] for $3 billion.<ref name="calvinklienovwner" /> He remains the company's principal designer, leading the design teams and overseeing the entire creative process.<ref name="thcorp_n1" /> In 2012, Hilfiger was awarded the [[Geoffrey Beene]] Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]].<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" />

==Business and fashion career==
Hilfiger graduated from the [[Elmira Free Academy]] high school in 1969.<ref name="thbiotwo_dbestsotries" /> His parents wanted him to get a college education and pursue a traditional career,<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" /> and for a time he attended GST [[Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (New York)|BOCES]] Bush Campus in Elmira.<ref name="bocesbushcampus" />

===People's Place and early lines (1970s–1983)===
Hilfiger spent the summer of 1969 working in a clothing store on [[Cape Cod]],<ref name="TCBIO6" /> and afterwards he decided to use his life savings of $150<ref name="people'splaces" /> to open a clothing store in 1971<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> as People's Place.<ref name="TCBIO6" /> The first store was located in downtown Elmira in what is now the site of [[First Arena]] and had a hair salon, a record shop, and rock concerts in the basement.<ref name="TCBIO6" /> To stock the store, Hilfiger and a friend drove to New York City to buy clothing such as [[bell-bottoms]], [[peasant blouse]]s, and leather jackets.<ref name="TCBIO6" /> Unsatisfied with this, he began sketching his own designs, and would later write that "designing made me happier than anything I'd ever done. I knew from that early work that designing would be my life."<ref name="TCBIO6" />

The People's Place went bankrupt in 1977. Hilfiger enrolled in classes on commerce and the business side of the fashion industry.<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" /> After then moving to New York City<ref name="TCBIO6" /> and working for several different labels, he set up a company called Tommy Hill in 1979.<ref name="TCBIO6" /> One of his first clients was [[Jordache]] Jeans,<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" /><ref name="TCBIO6" /> and as Hilfiger's company expanded beyond denim,<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" /> he spent time in [[India]], learning more about his trade: "I would sit in the factory with my pile of sketches and watch them being made, tweaking as I went. There's no better design school in the world."<ref name="TCBIO6" /> In 1981 he founded the company 20th Century Survival, and the following year he founded Click Point, which designed women's clothing.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" />

===Founding Tommy Hilfiger Inc. (1984–1990s)===
{{See also|Tommy Hilfiger (company)}}
In 1984, Hilfiger was approached by businessman [[Mohan Murjani]],<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" /> to pursue his goal of designing and heading a men's sportswear line.<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" /><ref name="TCBIO6" /> Murjani backed the necessary investment for Hilfiger to establish his own brand.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> Later Hilfiger oversaw the design of the [[Coca-Cola]] clothing line for Murjani.

{{Blockquote|"[Waiting to form my own eponymous line] came from a desire to create something that wasn't out there already. I was really in tune with the market—I knew what existed, and I wanted this to be different. Maybe it's the small-town boy in me, but I've always loved the [[preppy|prep school look]], traditional [[Ivy League]], and the clothes that sailors and jocks wear. I wanted to take these familiar old things and give them a more laid-back attitude, to make them modern and cool...[with Tommy Hilfiger Corporation in 1985], finally, I felt like I was doing work that felt natural, that felt good. The brand we were building felt so honest, so true to who I am, that it didn't feel like a struggle at all."|Tommy Hilfiger in 2010<ref name="TCBIO6" />}}

In 1985, he founded the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation with support from The Murjani Group. The new clothing line made its debut with a high-profile marketing campaign, for example setting up a large billboard in [[Times Square]]<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" /> designed by [[George Lois]].<ref name="TCBIO20" /> Hilfiger left Murjani International in 1989, with [[Silas Chou]] instead providing financial backing to the Hilfiger brand,<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> and former executives of [[Ralph Lauren]] brought on board as executives of the newly formed company Tommy Hilfiger, Inc.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation went public in 1992, introducing Hilfiger's signature menswear collection.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> Hilfiger was named Menswear Designer of the Year by the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]] in 1995.<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" /><ref name="pastwinners" />  After licensing [[Pepe Jeans]] USA in 1995, in 1996, Tommy Hilfiger Inc. began distributing women's clothing.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> By the end of the next year Hilfiger had opened his first store in [[Beverly Hills]], which was followed by a store in London in 1998.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> Hilfiger was serving as the company's co-chairman by 1997,<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> and that year he published his first book, titled ''All American: A Style Book''.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" />

===Increased brand exposure (1990s–2004)===
[[file:Tommy Hilfiger 1996.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hilfiger in 1996]]
A professed lifelong fan of [[rock and roll]], Hilfiger's collections are often influenced by the fashion of music subcultures. The clothes are also marketed in connection with the music industry,<ref name="TCBIO15" /><ref name="TCBIO16" /> and as early as 1993 Hilfiger was an official sponsor for [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[Psychoderelict]] tour. Hilfiger has also sponsored several musical events, including [[Sheryl Crow]]'s [[If It Makes You Happy]] tour in 1997,<ref name="TCBIO18" /> [[Britney Spears]] 1999 [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] as main sponsor,<ref name="tommyannounced" /><ref name="TCBIO17" />  and [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s 1999 Freedom tour.<ref name="TCBIO19" /> By the mid-1990s, Hilfiger's style of clothing was popular with both the American "[[preppy]]" scene and as [[hip hop fashion]].<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" /> American [[R&B]] icon [[Aaliyah]] became the much-publicized spokesperson for Tommy Hilfiger Corporation in 1997.<ref name="aaliyahspokes" />

Hilfiger had a cameo in the fashion spoof ''[[Zoolander]]'' in 2001,<ref name="thbiotwo_limdb" /> and from 2002 to 2006 Tommy Hilfiger INc. owned the naming rights to the [[Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theatre]] venue.<ref name="promocompany" /> Largely due to declining sales in the early 2000s, Hilfiger began reworking the brand, striving to retain the designer brand exclusivity of the Hilfiger label by signing a deal to distribute the best-selling Hilfiger lines at [[Macy's]] only.<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" />  The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation continued to work closely with musicians into the 2000s, focusing on [[fragrances]] as well as clothes. [[J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez#Sweetface Fashion|Sweetface Fashion]], which owns the [[J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez]] line,<ref name="pillsoantony" /><ref name=people11 /><ref name="nickgalvinappeals" /> was bought out by Tommy Hilfiger in 2003.<ref name="boughtout" /><ref name="belowmarfashion" /> [[True Star (perfume)|True Star]], a [[perfume|fragrance]] endorsed by Hilfiger and released in 2004, featured [[Beyoncé]] as its poster girl.<ref name="truestarperfume" /> The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation company had revenues of approximately $1.8 billion, and 5,400 employees by 2004.<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" />
