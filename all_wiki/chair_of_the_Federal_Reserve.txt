The '''Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System''' is the head of the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]], which is the [[Central bank|central banking system]] of the United States. The position is known colloquially as "Chair of the Fed" or "Fed Chair". The [[Chairman|chair]] is the "active executive officer"<ref>see {{usc|12|242}}</ref> of the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors|Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]]. The chair reports to the [[United States Congress]] twice a year on progress towards the Fed's responsibilities and [[monetary policy]] objectives, which are "maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."<ref name=cumber/>

The chair is nominated by the [[President of the United States]] from among the members of the Board of Governors, and serves a term of four years after being confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. A chair may serve multiple consecutive terms, pending a new nomination and confirmation at the end of each. [[William McChesney Martin|William Martin]] was the longest serving chair, holding the position from 1951 to 1970. The chair does not serve at the pleasure of the President, meaning that he or she cannot be dismissed by the President, however, the chair can resign before the end of the term.<ref name=cumber>[https://www.cumber.com/can-the-president-fire-the-chairman-of-the-federal-reserve/ Can the President Fire the Chairman of the Federal Reserve?]</ref>

The current Chair is [[Jerome Powell]], who was sworn in on February 5, 2018.<ref name="Federal Reserve">{{Cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180205a.htm |title=Jerome H.

== 1935 reorganization ==
Section 203 of the [[Banking Act of 1935]] changed the name of the "Federal Reserve Board" to the "Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."<ref>Sec. 203, Banking Act of 1935, Public Law no. 305, 49 Stat. 684, 704 (Aug. 23, 1935).</ref> The directors' salaries were significantly lower (at $12,000 when first appointed in 1914<ref>{{cite news | title=The Reserve Board Nominations |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n77/mode/1up | newspaper=The Independent | date=July 20, 1914 |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref>) and their terms of office were much shorter prior to 1935. In effect, the Federal Reserve Board members in Washington, D.C., were significantly less powerful than the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks prior to 1935.<ref name="Meltzer 2003">{{cite book | last = Meltzer | first = Allan H.| title = A history of the Federal Reserve: Volume 1, 1913-1951 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2003 | location = Chicago}}</ref>

In the 1935 Act, the district heads had their titles changed to "President" (e.g., "President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis").{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[File:VCY CG CB CV cent grp 121613 0517 02844 (13896600480).jpg|thumb|Fed chairs from 1979 to 2018]]
As stipulated by the [[Banking Act of 1935]], the [[President of the United States|President]] appoints the seven members of the Board of Governors; they must then be confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and serve fourteen year terms.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Fed - Board Members |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm |website=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |accessdate=June 1, 2018 |date=February 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri.htm |title=The Structure of the Federal Reserve System |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>

The nominees for chair and vice-chair may be chosen by the President from among the sitting Governors for four-year terms; these appointments are also subject to Senate confirmation.<ref>{{cite news|author=Federal Reserve |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqbog.htm|title=Board of Governors FAQ|work=Federal Reserve|date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117011308/http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqbog.htm|archivedate=January 17, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Senate Committee responsible for vetting a Federal Reserve Chair nominee is the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Committee on Banking]].

By law, the chair reports twice a year to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the Federal Reserve's [[monetary policy]] objectives. He or she also testifies before Congress on numerous other issues and meets periodically with the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]].

== Conflict of interest law ==
The law applicable to the chair and all other members of the board provides (in part):

{{quote|1=No member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall be an officer or director of any bank, banking institution, trust company, or Federal Reserve bank or hold stock in any bank, banking institution, or trust company; and before entering upon his duties as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System he shall certify under oath that he has complied with this requirement, and such certification shall be filed with the secretary of the Board.<ref>{{usc|12|244}}</ref>}}

==List of Fed Chairs==
The following is a list of past and present Chairs of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
