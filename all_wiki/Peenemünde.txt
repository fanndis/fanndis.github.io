'''Peenemünde''' ({{IPA-de|peːnəˈmʏndə}}, {{lang-en|"[[Peene]] [River] Mouth"}}) is a municipality on the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Usedom]] in the [[Vorpommern-Greifswald]] district in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (collective municipality) of [[Usedom-Nord]]. The community is known for the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]], where the world's first functional large-scale [[liquid-propellant rocket]], the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], was developed.

==Geography==

The village with its seaport is located on the westernmost extremity of a long sand-spit, where the Peene empties into the Baltic Sea, in the northwestern part of Usedom Island. To the southeast it borders on the sea resort of [[Karlshagen]].

Peenemünde harbour can be reached by ferry boat across the Peene from [[Kröslin]], liners also run along the Baltic coast to [[Rügen]] Island. The local railway station is the northern terminus of the ''[[Usedomer Bäderbahn]]'' line to [[Zinnowitz]]. Air service for the village is available at the [[Peenemünde Airfield]].

==History==
During the 10th and 11th centuries, Peenemünde was part of the region of [[Circipania]], an area settled by the Circipanes, a [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribe constituent of the [[Lutici federation]]. Circipania was incorporated into the [[Billung March]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 936, but the Empire's influence in the region decayed by the end of that century after a successful Slavic uprising. During the late 12th century, in the aftermath of the [[Wendish Crusade]], the region fell under the rule of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]]. After the [[Treaty of Kremmen]] in 1236, most of Circipania was transferred to the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref>[[Werner Buchholz (historian)|Bucholz, Werner]] (1999). Pommern. Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas. Siedler, pp. 23ff. {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}</ref>

In [[World War II]], the area was highly involved in the development and production of the V-2 rocket, until the production's relocation to [[Nordhausen, Thuringia|Nordhausen]]. The village's docks were used for the ships which recovered [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] wreckage from test launches over the [[Baltic Sea]]. German scientists such as [[Wernher von Braun]], who worked at the V-2 facility, were known as "Peenemünders".  The entire island was captured by the [[Soviet Red Army]] on 5 May 1945.  The gas plant for the production of [[liquid oxygen]] still lies in ruins at the entrance to Peenemünde.

The [[post-war]] port was a Soviet [[naval base]] until turned over to the armed forces of [[East Germany]] in 1952. The seaport facilities were used at first by the East German ''Seepolizei'' (sea police) after new facilities for police [[motorboat]]s had been built. On 1 December 1956 the headquarters of the First Fleet of the East German [[Volksmarine|People's Navy]] was established at Peenemünde.

The birthplace of modern rocket science is today displayed at the [[Historical Technical Museum, Peenemünde|Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum]], a [[World War II]] museum on the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] opened in 1992 in the power station of the former Army Testing Site<ref>{{cite web|title=The Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum|url=http://www.peenemuende.de/index.php?id=40&L=1|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> and the area of the World War II [[power station]] (now part of the village) – exhibits include a [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] and a V-2.
