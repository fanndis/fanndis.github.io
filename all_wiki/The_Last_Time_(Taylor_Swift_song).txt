==Background and composition==
On the album, "The Last Time" comes after the song "Stay Stay Stay". Swift opted to collaborate with several producers on the album. One of the resulting collaborations was "The Last Time", which was produced by [[Jacknife Lee]], who is best known for working with [[Snow Patrol]] and [[U2]].

"The Last Time" is a [[power ballad]]<ref name="LA Times">{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Randall|title='The Last Time' connects Taylor Swift with Arcade Fire|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/31/entertainment/la-et-ms-the-last-time-connects-taylor-swift-with-arcade-fire-20121031|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=13 October 2013|archive-date=October 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022224535/http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/31/entertainment/la-et-ms-the-last-time-connects-taylor-swift-with-arcade-fire-20121031|url-status=live}}</ref> that draws primarily from [[alternative rock]].<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-taylor-swift-video-last-time-gary-lightbody-20131118-story.html|title=Watch new Taylor Swift video 'The Last Time' with Gary Lightbody|date=November 18, 2013|last=Lewis|first=Randy|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=12 May 2014|archive-date=May 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513080500/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-taylor-swift-video-last-time-gary-lightbody-20131118-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> This is evident in [[Owen Pallett]]'s string arrangements and conducting on the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Update - Owen Pallett|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9358-owen-pallett/|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=4 January 2015|archive-date=January 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107183706/http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9358-owen-pallett/|url-status=live}}</ref> It was written in the key of [[D major]], and has a tempo of 94 [[Tempo#Beats per minute|BPM]]

The song tells the story of a long-standing but crumbling relationship. Lyrically, the song describes the relationship as one with vicious cycles of both heartbreak and forgiveness, for instance: "You find yourself at my door, just like all those times before, you wear your best apology, but I was there to watch you leave" as sung by Swift. Orchestral swells accentuate the chorus and drama to the "instantly hummable refrain".<ref name="LA Times"/>

==Critical reception==
Joseph Atilano of ''[[The Philippine Inquirer]]'' described "The Last Time" as the most mature track on the album and positively noted that it "represents a darker tone" on ''Red''.<ref name="inquirer"/> He further commented that the song "proves she is ready for the adult-pop realm" and lends her artistic credibility.<ref name="inquirer"/> Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also praised Swift's maturity on the track, which she felt would fare well on [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] radio. Sciarretto also characterized the song as "darkly romantic" and "sort of epic."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciarretto|first=Amy|title=Taylor Swift, 'Red' - Album Review|url=http://popcrush.com/taylor-swift-red-album-review/|work=PopCrush|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|accessdate=13 October 2013|archive-date=October 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019045032/http://popcrush.com/taylor-swift-red-album-review/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Randall Roberts of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' responded favorably to the song's balladry, writing that the song "is well-crafted, emotional and features an instantly hummable refrain."<ref name="LA Times"/> Billy Dukes of ''Taste of Country'' was more critical of the song, as he felt Lightbody dominates the track and Swift "stretches out in the back seat"; he called "The Last Time" the "only pure skip-ahead moment" on ''Red''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dukes|first=Billy|title=Taylor Swift, 'Red' - Album Review|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-red/|work=Taste of Country|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|accessdate=13 October 2013|archive-date=November 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104175536/http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-red/|url-status=live}}</ref>
