'''Americans for Democratic Action''' ('''ADA''') is a liberal [[politics of the United States|American political]] organization advocating [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive policies]]. ADA works for social and economic justice through lobbying, grassroots organizing, research, and supporting progressive candidates.

==History==
===Formation===
The ADA grew out of a predecessor group, the [[Union for Democratic Action]] (UDA). The UDA was formed by former members of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and [[Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies]] as well as [[trade union|labor union]] leaders, [[Liberalism|liberal]] politicians, [[Theology|theologians]], and others who were opposed to the [[pacifism]] adopted by most left-wing political organizations in the late 1930s and early 1940s.<ref>Zuckerman, ''The Wine of Violence: An Anthology on Anti-Semitism,'' 1947, p. 220; Parmet, ''The Master of Seventh Avenue: David Dubinsky and the American Labor Movement,'' 2005, p. 214, {{ISBN|0-8147-6711-7}}; Boyle, ''The UAW and the Heyday of American Liberalism, 1945-1968,'' 1998, p. 49, {{ISBN|0-8014-8538-X}}; Brown, ''Niebuhr and His Age: Reinhold Niebuhr's Prophetic Role and Legacy,'' 2002, p. 102, {{ISBN|1563383756}}; Ceplair, "The Film Industry's Battle Against Left-Wing Influences, From the Russian Revolution to the Blacklist," ''Film History,'' 2008, 400-401; Libros, ''Hard Core Liberals: A Sociological Analysis of the Philadelphia Americans for Democratic Action,'' 1975, p. 13, {{ISBN|0870731483}}.</ref><ref name="Brock">Brock, ''Americans for Democratic Action: Its Role in National Politics,'' 1962, p. 49.</ref> It supported a strongly [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] foreign policy and a pro-union, liberal domestic policy.

[[James I. Loeb|James Isaac Loeb]] (later an [[ambassador]] and diplomat in the [[John F.

Among ADA's founding members were leading anti-communist liberals from academic, political, and labor circles, including theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], union leader [[Walter Reuther]], civil rights lawyer [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.|Joseph Rauh]], and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Its founders hoped to solidify a progressive, pragmatic, noncommunist “vital center” in mainstream politics, embodying Schlesinger's concept formulated in his 1949 book ''[[The Vital Center]]''.<ref name="oxfcomp">Mark L. Kleinman, “Americans for Democratic Action”, in ''The Oxford Companion to United States History'', ed. Paul S. Boyer (Oxford/NY: Oxford UP, 2001), 34.</ref>

===Action===
On April 3, 1948, ADA declared its decision to support a Democratic Party ticket of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Supreme Court Judge [[William O. Douglas]] over incumbent U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]]. Leveraging Truman's lack of popular support, the ADA succeeded in pushing Truman leftward on issues such as [[Civil rights movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]].<ref name="oxfcomp" /> It also led a full-scale attack on [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] candidate and former US [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Henry A. Wallace]] because of his opposition to the [[Marshall Plan]] and support for appeasement of the Soviet Union. The ADA portrayed Wallace and his supporters as dupes of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]].<ref name="oxfcomp" /> [[Adolf A. Berle Jr.]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.]] expressed their belief that Eisenhower would accept the nomination.<ref name=Eisenhower>

After November 2, 1948, ADA supported Truman after his victory.<ref name=ER />

Though strongly anti-communist, unlike other contemporary liberal groups like the [[Progressive Citizens of America]] (PCA), which supported cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]], the ADA was still subject to significant [[McCarthyist]] scrutiny.  The plight of the ADA during that period prompted [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to accept a position as honorary chair of the organization in 1953, and in doing so, put [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator McCarthy]] in a position in which he would have had to "call her a communist as well" to continue his inquiries into the activities of the group.  Because of her actions, many ADA leaders credited her with "saving" the organization.<ref name=GWU-ER>{{cite web|last1=George Washington University|title=Americans for Democratic Action|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/ada.cfm|accessdate=29 April 2015|author1-link=George Washington University}}</ref>

In the early 1960s, ADA's influence peaked when a number of its key members (e.g. James Loeb, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.) were picked to join the administration of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref name=Britannica>

Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] reforms, by the mid-1960s the ADA's influence was on the wane.<ref name="oxfcomp" /> It was badly split over the [[Vietnam War]]: initially supporting Johnson's war policy, the ADA had come to oppose the war by early 1968.<ref name="oxfcomp" /> It endorsed founder [[Hubert Humphrey 1968 presidential campaign|Hubert Humphrey's presidential candidacy]] that year, but with “barely concealed ambivalence”.<ref name="oxfcomp" /> After Richard Nixon's victory, the ADA was pushed to the political margins,<ref name="oxfcomp" /> overshadowed by more centrist groups like the [[Trilateral Commission]] and [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]].

== Voting records ==
ADA ranks legislators, identifies key policy issues, and tracks how members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] vote on these issues. The annual ADA Voting Record gives each member a Liberal Quotient (LQ) rating from&nbsp;0, meaning complete disagreement with ADA policies, to&nbsp;100, meaning complete agreement with ADA policies. A score of 0 is considered [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and a score 100 is considered [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]].  The LQ is obtained by evaluating an elected official's votes on 20 key foreign and domestic social and economic issues chosen by the ADA's Legislative Committee.  Each vote given a score of either 5 or 0 points, depending on whether the individual voted with or against the ADA's position, respectively.  Absent voters are also given a score of 0 for the vote.<ref name=ADAVotingRecords>{{cite web|last1=Americans for Democratic Action|title=Voting Records|url=http://www.adaction.org/pages/publications/voting-records.php|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>
