'''''The Daily Telegraph''''', known online as '''''The Telegraph''''', is a national British daily [[broadsheet]] newspaper published in London by [[Telegraph Media Group]] and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. 

It was founded by [[Arthur B. Sleigh]] in 1855 as ''Daily Telegraph & Courier''. ''The Telegraph'' has been described as a [[newspaper of record]] and generally had an international reputation in the twentieth century for quality, described by [[Amol Rajan]] as "one of the world's great titles".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38390488|title=What does the future hold for the Daily Telegraph?|last=Rajan|first=Amol|date=21 December 2016|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=21 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223230143/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38390488|archive-date=23 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

''The Telegraph'' has been the first newspaper to report on a number of notable news scoops, including the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 MP expenses scandal]], which led to a number of high-profile political resignations and for which it was named [[British Press Awards|2009 British Newspaper of the Year]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5297606/MPs-expenses-Full-list-of-MPs-investigated-by-the-Telegraph.html|title=MPs' expenses: Full list of MPs investigated by The Telegraph|access-date=27 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504015241/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5297606/MPs-expenses-Full-list-of-MPs-investigated-by-the-Telegraph.html|archive-date=4 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and its 2016 undercover investigation on the England football manager [[Sam Allardyce]].<ref name=":0" /> However, critics, including the paper's former chief political commentator [[Peter Oborne]], accuse it of being unduly influenced by advertisers, especially [[HSBC]].<ref name="OpenDemocracy 17 February 2015" /><ref name="BBC News 17 February 2015" />

== History ==
=== Founding and early history ===
The ''Daily Telegraph and Courier'' was founded by Colonel [[Arthur B. Sleigh]] in June 1855 to air a personal grievance against the future [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[British Army]], [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]].<ref name="bbc">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3409185.stm |title=The UK's 'other paper of record' |access-date=20 December 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=19 January 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002064335/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3409185.stm |archive-date=2 October 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="b1">Burnham, 1955. p. 1</ref> [[Joseph Moses Levy]], the owner of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', agreed to print the newspaper, and the first edition was published on 29 June 1855. The paper cost 2[[Old penny sterling|d]] and was four pages long.<ref name="bbc" /> Nevertheless, the first edition stressed the quality and independence of its articles and journalists:<ref name="telegraph.co.uk" />

{{quote|We shall be guided by a high tone of independent action.}}

However, the paper was not a success, and Sleigh was unable to pay Levy the printing bill.<ref name="b1" /> Levy took over the newspaper, his aim being to produce a cheaper newspaper than his main competitors in London, the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]'', to expand the size of the overall market.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Levy appointed his son, [[Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham|Edward Levy-Lawson, Lord Burnham]], and [[Thornton Leigh Hunt]] to edit the newspaper. Lord Burnham relaunched the paper as ''The Daily Telegraph'', with the slogan "the largest, best, and cheapest newspaper in the world".<ref>Burnham, 1955. p. 5</ref> Hunt laid out the newspaper's principles in a memorandum sent to Levy: "We should report all striking events in science, so told that the intelligent public can understand what has happened and can see its bearing on our daily life and our future. The same principle should apply to all other events—to fashion, to new inventions, to new methods of conducting business".<ref>Burnham, 1955. p. 6</ref>

In 1876, [[Jules Verne]] published his novel ''[[Michael Strogoff]]'', whose plot takes place during a fictional uprising and war in [[Siberia]]. Verne included among the book's characters a war correspondent of ''The Daily Telegraph'', named Harry Blount—who is depicted as an exceptionally dedicated, resourceful and brave journalist, taking great personal risks to follow closely the ongoing war and bring accurate news of it to ''The Telegraph''{{'}}s readership, ahead of competing papers.<ref>Verne, Jules.

=== 1901 to 1945 ===
In 1908, [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II of Germany]] gave a [[Daily Telegraph Affair|controversial interview]] to ''The Daily Telegraph'' that severely damaged [[Anglo-German relations]] and added to international tensions in the build-up to World War I.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/kaiser-wilhelm-ii |title=Kaiser Wilhelm II |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=History.com |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129085526/http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/kaiser-wilhelm-ii |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair |title= The Daily Telegraph Affair: The interview of the Emperor Wilhelm II on October 28, 1908 |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 2 June 2009 |website= wwi.lib.byu.edu The World War I Document Archive |publisher= Brigham Young University Library |access-date= 21 November 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141011181444/http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair |archive-date= 11 October 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref> In 1928, the son of Baron Burnham, [[Harry Levy-Lawson, 1st Viscount Burnham|Harry Lawson Webster Levy-Lawson, 2nd Baron Burnham]], sold the paper to [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose]], in partnership with his brother [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley]] and [[Edward Iliffe, 1st Baron Iliffe]].

In 1937, the newspaper absorbed ''[[The Morning Post]]'', which traditionally espoused a conservative position and sold predominantly amongst the retired officer class.  Originally William Ewart Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose, bought ''The Morning Post'' with the intention of publishing it alongside ''The Daily Telegraph'', but poor sales of the former led him to merge the two. For some years, the paper was retitled ''The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post'' before it reverted to just ''The Daily Telegraph''.  In the late 1930s, [[Victor Gordon Lennox]], ''The Telegraph''{{'}}s diplomatic editor, published an anti-appeasement private newspaper ''The Whitehall Letter'' that received much of its information from leaks from Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, and [[Rex Leeper]], the Foreign Office's Press Secretary.<ref name="Watt, Donald Cameron pages 276-286">Watt, Donald Cameron "Rumors as Evidence" pages 276–286 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 278.</ref> As a result, Gordon Lennox was monitored by [[MI5]].<ref name="Watt, Donald Cameron pages 276-286" /> In 1939, The Telegraph published [[Clare Hollingworth]]'s scoop that [[Invasion of Poland|Germany was to invade Poland]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Clare Hollingworth, the foreign correspondent who broke news of Second World War, turns 104|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11922645/Clare-Hollingworth-the-foreign-correspondent-who-broke-news-of-Second-World-War-turns-104.html|access-date=11 January 2017|work=Telegraph.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123225715/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11922645/Clare-Hollingworth-the-foreign-correspondent-who-broke-news-of-Second-World-War-turns-104.html|archive-date=23 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 1940, with Fleet Street subjected to almost daily bombing raids by the Luftwaffe, ''The Telegraph'' started printing in Manchester at Kemsley House (now [[The Printworks (Manchester)|The Printworks]] entertainment venue), which was run by Camrose's brother Kemsley.  Manchester quite often printed the entire run of ''The Telegraph'' when its Fleet Street offices were under threat.  The name Kemsley House was changed to Thomson House in 1959. In 1986, printing of Northern editions of the ''Daily'' and ''Sunday Telegraph'' moved to Trafford Park and in 2008 to Newsprinters at Knowsley, Liverpool.

During the Second World War, ''The Daily Telegraph'' covertly helped in the recruitment of code-breakers for [[Bletchley Park]]. The ability to solve ''The Telegraph''{{'}}s crossword in under 12 minutes was considered to be a recruitment test. The newspaper was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which each of the successful participants was contacted and asked if they would be prepared to undertake "a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort". The competition itself was won by [[F. H. W. Hawes]] of [[Dagenham]] who finished the crossword in less than eight minutes.<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3652606/25000-tomorrow.html "25000 tomorrow"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028055732/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3652606/25000-tomorrow.html |date=28 October 2009 }} 23 May 2006</ref>

=== 1946 to 1985 ===
Both the Camrose (Berry) and Burnham (Levy-Lawson) families remained involved in management until [[Conrad Black]] took control in 1986. On the death of his father in 1954, [[Seymour Berry, 2nd Viscount Camrose]] assumed the chairmanship of the ''Daily Telegraph'' with his brother [[Michael Berry, Baron Hartwell]] as his editor-in-chief. During this period, the company saw the launch of sister paper ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in 1960.<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1315093/Lord-Hartwell.html "Obituary: Lord Hartwell"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013232438/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1315093/Lord-Hartwell.html |date=13 October 2017 }} 4 April 2001</ref>

=== 1986 to 2004 ===
Canadian businessman [[Conrad Black]], through companies controlled by him, bought the Telegraph Group in 1986. Black, through his holding company [[Ravelston Corporation]], owned 78% of [[Hollinger Inc.]] which in turn owned 30% of [[Hollinger International]].  Hollinger International in turn owned the Telegraph Group and other publications such as the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' and ''[[The Spectator]]''.

On 18 January 2004, Black was dismissed as [[chairman of the board|chairman]] of the [[Hollinger International]] board over allegations of financial wrongdoing. Black was also sued by the company. Later that day, it was reported that the [[Barclay brothers]] had agreed to purchase Black's 78% interest in [[Hollinger Inc.]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]245m, giving them a controlling interest in the company, and to buy out the minority shareholders later.  However, a lawsuit was filed by the Hollinger International board to try to block Black from selling his [[stock|shares]] in Hollinger Inc. until an investigation into his dealings was completed. Black filed a countersuit but, eventually, United States judge [[Leo Strine]] sided with the Hollinger International board and blocked Black from selling his Hollinger Inc. shares to the twins.

On 7 March 2004, the twins announced that they were launching another bid, this time just for ''The Daily Telegraph'' and its Sunday sister paper rather than all of Hollinger Inc. The then owner of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', [[Richard Desmond]], was also interested in purchasing the paper, selling his interest in several pornographic magazines to finance the initiative. Desmond withdrew in March 2004, when the price climbed above £600m,<ref>{{cite news |last=Shah |first=Saeed |title=Desmond withdraws bid for 'overpriced' Telegraph |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/desmond-withdraws-bid-for-overpriced-telegraph-66296.html |access-date=23 November 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |date=27 March 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213010345/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/desmond-withdraws-bid-for-overpriced-telegraph-66296.html |archive-date=13 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> as did [[Daily Mail and General Trust plc]] a few months later on 17 June.<ref>{{cite news |last= Gibson |first= Owen |title= Barclays favourites to land Telegraph |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/17/pressandpublishing.business |access-date= 23 November 2014 |newspaper= The Guardian |location= London |date= 17 June 2004 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141129084754/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jun/17/pressandpublishing.business |archive-date= 29 November 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref>

=== Since 2004 ===
In November 2004, ''The Telegraph'' celebrated the tenth anniversary of its website, ''Electronic Telegraph'', now renamed ''www.telegraph.co.uk''. The ''Electronic Telegraph'' launched in 1995 with '[https://sites.google.com/site/suescho/ The Daily Telegraph Guide to the Internet]' by writer Sue Schofield for an annual charge of £180.00. On 8 May 2006, the first stage of a major redesign of the website took place, with a wider page layout and greater prominence for audio, video and journalist blogs.

On 10 October 2005, ''The Daily Telegraph'' relaunched to incorporate a tabloid sports section and a new standalone business section. ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s star columnist and political analyst [[Simon Heffer]] left that paper in October 2005 to rejoin ''The Daily Telegraph'', where he has become associate editor. Heffer has written two columns a week for the paper since late October 2005 and is a regular contributor to the news podcast. In November 2005 the first regular podcast service by a newspaper in the UK was launched.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Press Gazette |date=18 November 2005 |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=32570&sectioncode=1 |title='Hear all about it' as the Telegraph launches podcast |access-date=15 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605202721/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=32570&sectioncode=1 |archive-date=5 June 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Just before Christmas 2005, it was announced that ''The Telegraph'' titles would be moving from Canada Place in [[Canary Wharf]], to new offices at Victoria Plaza at 111 Buckingham Palace Road near [[Victoria Station (London)|Victoria Station]] in central London.<ref>{{Cite news |last=White |first=Dominic |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2928887/Telegraph-moves-to-Victoria.html |title=Telegraph moves to Victoria |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 December 2005 |access-date=18 September 2009 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816195042/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2928887/Telegraph-moves-to-Victoria.html |archive-date=16 August 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The new office features a "hub and spoke" layout for the newsroom to produce content for print and online editions.

In October 2006, with its relocation to Victoria, the company was renamed the Telegraph Media Group, repositioning itself as a multimedia company. On 2 September 2008, the ''Daily Telegraph'' was printed with colour on each page for the first time when it left [[Westferry]] for Newsprinters at [[Broxbourne]], Hertfordshire, another arm of the Murdoch ([[Rupert Murdoch]]) company.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=42016&c=1 |title=Daily Telegraph unveils full-colour redesign |newspaper=[[Press Gazette]] |date=2 September 2008 |access-date=18 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825075601/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=42016&c=1 |archive-date=25 August 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The paper is also printed in [[Liverpool]] and [[Glasgow]] by Newsprinters. In May 2009, the daily and Sunday editions published [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|details of MPs' expenses]]. This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition.

In June 2014, ''The Telegraph'' was criticised by ''[[Private Eye]]'' for its policy of replacing experienced journalists and news managers with less-experienced staff and [[Search engine optimization|search engine optimisers]].<ref>''Private Eye'', Issue 1369, 27 June – 10 July 2014, pg. 7.</ref>

On 26 October 2019, the ''Financial Times'' reported that the Barclay Brothers were about to put the [[Telegraph Media Group]] up for sale. The ''Financial Times'' also reported that the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] (owner of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'', ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' and ''[[Ireland on Sunday]]'') would be interested in buying.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4cb55b8a-f70d-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65|title=Barclay brothers in £500m cash call for ailing empire|website=Financial Times|date=27 October 2019|language=en-GB|url-access=subscription|access-date=16 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028074620/https://www.ft.com/content/4cb55b8a-f70d-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65|archive-date=28 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Political stance ==
''The Daily Telegraph'' has been politically conservative in modern times.<ref name="slate">{{cite news |last=Curtis |first=Bryan |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2152196/ |title=Strange days at the Daily Telegraph |work=Slate |date=25 October 2006 |access-date=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125141303/http://www.slate.com/id/2152196/ |archive-date=25 January 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The personal links between the paper's editors and the leadership of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], along with the paper's generally right-wing stance and influence over Conservative activists, have resulted in the paper commonly being referred to, especially in ''[[Private Eye]]'', as the ''Torygraph''.<ref name="slate" /> Even when Conservative support was shown to have slumped in the opinion polls and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] gained the ascendant, the newspaper remained loyal to the Conservatives. This loyalty continued after Labour ousted the Conservatives from power by an [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election result in 1997]], and in the face of Labour election wins in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] and the third successive Labour election win in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]].

When the Barclay brothers purchased the [[Telegraph Group]] for around £665m in late June 2004, Sir [[David and Frederick Barclay|David Barclay]] suggested that ''The Daily Telegraph'' might no longer be the "house newspaper" of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the future.

==== History ====
The website was launched, under the name ''electronic telegraph'' at midday on 15 November 1994 at the headquarters of ''The Daily Telegraph'' at [[Canary Wharf]] in [[London Docklands]] with Ben Rooney as its first editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/how-online-journalism-got-its-uk-start/|title=How UK online journalism got its UK start|date=1 June 2006|work=UK Press Gazette|access-date=16 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200216110951/https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/how-online-journalism-got-its-uk-start/|archive-date=16 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>  It was Europe's first daily web-based newspaper. At this time, the modern internet was still in its infancy, with as few as 10,000 websites estimated to have existed at the time – compared to more than 100&nbsp;billion by 2009. In 1994, only around 1% of the British population (some 600,000 people) had internet access at home, compared to more than 80% in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html|title=Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news|date=11 November 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph|last1=Richmond|first1=Shane|access-date=3 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013233654/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Initially, the site published only the top stories from the print edition of the newspaper but it gradually increased its coverage until virtually all of the newspaper was carried online and the website was also publishing original material. The website, hosted on a [[Sun Microsystems]] Sparc 20 server and connected via a 64 kbit/s [[leased line]] from [[Demon Internet]], was edited by [[Ben Rooney]]. Key personnel behind the launch of the site were Matthew Doull and Saul Klein and the then marketing manager of ''The Daily Telegraph'', Hugo Drayton, and the webmaster Fiona Carter. Drayton later became managing director of the newspaper.

An early coup for the site was the publication of articles by [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]] on [[Bill Clinton]] and the [[Whitewater controversy]]. The availability of the articles online brought a large American audience to the site. In 1997, the Clinton administration issued a 331-page report that accused Evans-Pritchard of peddling "right-wing inventions". [[Derek Bishton]], who by then had succeeded Rooney as editor, later wrote: "In the days before ET it would have been highly unlikely that anyone in the US would have been aware of Evans-Pritchard's work – and certainly not to the extent that the White House would be forced to issue such a lengthy rebuttal."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1471964/From-ET-to-TD.html |title=From ET to TD |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 February 2010 |access-date=2 May 2010 |location=London |first=Derek |last=Bishton |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014112005/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1471964/From-ET-to-TD.html |archive-date=14 October 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bishton, who later became consulting editor for Telegraph Media Group, was followed as editor by [[Richard Burton (journalist)|Richard Burton]], who was made redundant in August 2006. Edward Roussel replaced Burton.

=== 2009 MP expenses scandal ===

In May 2009, ''The Daily Telegraph'' obtained a full copy of all the expenses claims of British [[Members of Parliament]]. The ''Telegraph'' began publishing, in instalments from 8 May 2009, certain MPs' expenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5297606/MPs-expenses-Full-list-of-MPs-investigated-by-the-Telegraph.html|title=Full List of MPs investigated|date=8 May 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|access-date=13 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504015241/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5297606/MPs-expenses-Full-list-of-MPs-investigated-by-the-Telegraph.html|archive-date=4 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ''Telegraph'' justified the publication of the information because it contended that the official information due to be released would have omitted key information about redesignating of second-home nominations.<ref name="bbc1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7840678.stm|title=Q&A: MPs' expenses|date=8 May 2009|publisher=BBC|access-date=8 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904103344/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7840678.stm|archive-date=4 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This led to a number of high-profile resignations from both the ruling Labour administration and the Conservative opposition.

== Criticisms ==
{{Criticism section|date=October 2020}}

=== Accusation of news coverage influence by advertisers ===

In July 2014, the ''Daily Telegraph'' was criticised for carrying links on its website to pro-Kremlin articles supplied by a Russian state-funded publication that downplayed any Russian involvement in the downing of the passenger jet [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]].<ref>Spence, Alex (July 2014). [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4153902.ece "Telegraph and TV channel criticised over crash reports"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006180446/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4153902.ece |date=6 October 2014 }}, ''The Times'', 22 July 2014.

In February 2015, the chief political commentator of the ''Daily Telegraph'', [[Peter Oborne]], resigned. Oborne accused the paper of a "form of fraud on its readers"<ref name="OpenDemocracy 17 February 2015">{{cite web | title= Why I have resigned from the Telegraph | url= https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/peter-oborne/why-i-have-resigned-from-telegraph | author= Peter Oborne | date= 17 February 2015 | website= Open Democracy | access-date= 16 April 2020 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160210130853/https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/peter-oborne/why-i-have-resigned-from-telegraph | archive-date= 10 February 2016 | url-status= live }}</ref> for its coverage of the bank [[HSBC]] in relation to a Swiss tax-dodging scandal that was widely covered by other news media. He alleged that editorial decisions about news content had been heavily influenced by the advertising arm of the newspaper because of commercial interests.<ref name="BBC News 17 February 2015">{{cite web | title= Daily Telegraph's Peter Oborne resigns over HSBC coverage | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31510152 | author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | date= 17 February 2015 | publisher= BBC News | access-date= 18 February 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150218051845/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31510152 | archive-date= 18 February 2015 | url-status= live }}</ref> Professor [[Jay Rosen]] at [[New York University]] stated that Oborne's resignation statement was "one of the most important things a journalist has written about journalism lately".<ref name="BBC News 17 February 2015" />

Oborne cited other instances of advertising strategy influencing the content of articles, linking the refusal to take an editorial stance on the repression of democratic demonstrations in [[Hong Kong]] to the ''Telegraph''{{'s}} support from China. Additionally, he said that favourable reviews of the [[Cunard]] cruise liner ''[[RMS Queen Mary 2|Queen Mary II]]'' appeared in the ''Telegraph'', noting: "On 10 May last year ''The Telegraph'' ran a long feature on Cunard's Queen Mary II liner on the news review page. This episode looked to many like a plug for an advertiser on a page normally dedicated to serious news analysis. I again checked and certainly ''Telegraph'' competitors did not view Cunard's liner as a major news story. Cunard is an important ''Telegraph'' advertiser."<ref name="OpenDemocracy 17 February 2015" /> In response, the ''Telegraph'' called Oborne's statement an "astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo".<ref name="BBC News 17 February 2015" />

In January 2017, the Telegraph Media Group had a higher number of upheld complaints than any other UK newspaper by its regulator IPSO.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ipso.co.uk/rulings-and-resolution-statements/|title=Rulings and regulation statements|publisher=IPSO|access-date=19 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201094545/https://www.ipso.co.uk/rulings-and-resolution-statements/|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Most of these findings pertained to inaccuracy, as with other UK newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/telegraph-tops-ipso-naughty-list-with-nine-upheld-complaints-followed-by-the-times-and-daily-express/|title=Daily Telegraph tops IPSO naughty list with nine upheld complaints followed by The Times and Daily Express|last=Mayhew|first=Freddy|date=19 September 2016|publisher=Press Gazette|access-date=19 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220091952/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/telegraph-tops-ipso-naughty-list-with-nine-upheld-complaints-followed-by-the-times-and-daily-express/|archive-date=20 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2017, a number of major western news organisations whose coverage had irked Beijing were excluded from Xi Jinping's speech event launching a new politburo.

=== Islamic Extremism and Scout Groups ===

In January 2019, the paper published an article written by [[Camilla Tominey]] titled "Police called in after Scout group run from mosque is linked to Islamic extremist and Holocaust denier"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/18/police-called-scout-group-run-mosque-linked-islamic-extremist/|title=Police called in after Scout group run from mosque is linked to Islamic extremist and Holocaust denier|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=19 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119100131/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/18/police-called-scout-group-run-mosque-linked-islamic-extremist/|access-date=8 April 2020|archive-date=19 January 2019}}</ref> in which it was reported that the police were investigating Ahammed Hussain, the Leader of the Scout Group at the Lewisham Islamic Centre, because he had links to extremist Muslim groups that promoted terrorism and antisemitism.
