'''Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|s|t|r|oʊ}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/castro "Castro"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-es|fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo ˈrus|am}}; 13 August 1926 – 25 November 2016) was a Cuban [[revolutionary]] and [[politics|politician]] who served as [[Prime Minister of Cuba]] from 1959 to 1976 and [[President of Cuba|President]] from 1976 to 2008. Ideologically a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[nationalism|Cuban nationalist]], he also served as the [[Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] from 1961 until 2011. Under his administration the [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]] became a [[single-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]]; industry and business were [[Nationalization|nationalized]], and [[state socialism|state socialist]] reforms were implemented throughout society.

Born in [[Birán]], [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] as the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] ideas while studying law at the [[University of Havana]]. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the [[Dominican Republic#Trujillo Age (1930–61)|Dominican Republic]] and [[La Violencia|Colombia]], he planned the overthrow of Cuban President [[Fulgencio Batista]], launching a failed attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the [[26th of July Movement]], with his brother [[Raúl Castro]] and [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the [[Cuban Revolution]] by leading the Movement in a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against Batista's forces from the [[Sierra Maestra]]. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|assassination]], [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic blockade]], and counter-revolution, including the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the [[Soviet Union]] and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]&nbsp;– a defining incident of the [[Cold War]]&nbsp;– in 1962.

Adopting a Marxist–Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Policies introducing [[Economic planning|central economic planning]] and expanding [[Healthcare in Cuba|healthcare]] and [[Education in Cuba|education]] were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of [[Marxism|Marxist]] governments in [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|Chile]], [[Junta of National Reconstruction|Nicaragua]], and [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]], as well as sending troops to aid allies in the [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur]], [[Ogaden War|Ogaden]], and [[Angolan Civil War]]. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1979 to 1983 and [[Cuban medical internationalism|Cuba's medical internationalism]], increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]] in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the "[[Special Period]]", embracing environmentalist and [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American "[[pink tide]]"&nbsp;– namely with [[Hugo Chávez]]'s [[Venezuela]]&nbsp;– and signed Cuba up to the [[ALBA|Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. In 2006, Castro [[2006–2008 Cuban transfer of presidential duties|transferred his responsibilities]] to [[Vice President of Cuba|Vice President]] Raúl Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the [[National Assembly of People's Power|National Assembly]] in 2008.

The longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized opinion throughout the world. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from [[American imperialism|US hegemony]]. Critics call him a dictator whose administration oversaw [[Human rights in Cuba|human rights abuses]], [[Cuban exile|the exodus of many Cubans]], and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with [[List of awards and honours bestowed upon Fidel Castro|various international awards]] and significantly influenced different individuals and groups across the world.

===Youth: 1926–1947===

In 1945, Castro transferred to the more prestigious Jesuit-run [[Instituto Técnico Militar|El Colegio de Belén]] in [[Havana]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=14–15}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=8–9}}.</ref> Although Castro took an interest in history, geography, and debating at Belén, he did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing sports.<ref>{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=12–13,16–19}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|p=68}}.</ref>

In 1945, Castro began studying law at the [[University of Havana]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=91–92}}.</ref> Admitting he was "politically illiterate", Castro became embroiled in student activism<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=9–10}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=20, 22}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=91–93}}.</ref> and the [[Gang#Gang violence|violent ''gangsterismo'' culture]] within the university.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=34–35}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=18}}.</ref> After becoming passionate about [[anti-imperialism]] and opposing [[Banana Wars|U.S. intervention in the Caribbean]],<ref>{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=20}}.</ref> he unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidency of the Federation of University Students on a platform of "honesty, decency and justice".<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=32–33}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=18–19}}.</ref> Castro became critical of the corruption and violence of President [[Ramón Grau]]'s government, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 1946 that received coverage on the front page of several newspapers.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=34–37,63}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=21–24}}.</ref>

In 1947, Castro joined the Party of the Cuban People (''[[Partido Ortodoxo]]''), founded by veteran politician [[Eduardo Chibás]]. A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás came third in the [[1948 Cuban general election|1948 general election]], Castro remained committed to working on his behalf.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=39–40}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=28–29}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=23–27}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=83–85}}.</ref> Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university. However, he refused to do so and began to carry a gun and surround himself with armed friends.<ref>{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=27–28}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=95–97}}.</ref> In later years, anti-Castro dissidents accused him of committing gang-related assassinations at the time, but these accusations remain unproven.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=35–36, 54}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=25, 27}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=23–24,37–38, 46}}; {{harvnb|Von Tunzelmann|2011|p=39}}.</ref> The American historian John Lewis Gaddis wrote that Castro "...began his career as a revolutionary with no ideology at all: he was a student politician turned street fighter turned guerrilla, a voracious reader, an interminable speaker, and a pretty good baseball player. The only ideas that appear to have driven him were a lust for power, a willingness to use violent means to get it, and an unwillingness to share it once he had it. If he had followed any example, it was that of Napoleon, not Marx".<ref>{{harvnb|Gaddis|1997|pp=180}}</ref>

===Rebellion and Marxism: 1947–1950===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=I joined the people; I grabbed a rifle in a police station that collapsed when it was rushed by a crowd. I witnessed the spectacle of a totally spontaneous revolution&nbsp;... [T]hat experience led me to identify myself even more with the cause of the people.

In June 1947, Castro learned of [[Cayo Confites expedition|a planned expedition]] to overthrow the right-wing government of [[Rafael Trujillo]], a U.S. ally, in the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Von Tunzelmann|2011|pp=30–33}}.</ref> Being President of the University Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic, Castro joined the expedition.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=40–41}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=31}}.</ref> The military force consisted of around 1,200 troops, mostly Cubans and exiled Dominicans, and they intended to sail from Cuba in July 1947. Grau's government stopped the invasion under U.S. pressure, although Castro and many of his comrades evaded arrest.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=41–42|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2p=24|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=32–34}} Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=42|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=34–35}} The protests, accompanied by a crackdown on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between activists and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=36–37}} At this point, his public speeches took on a distinctly leftist slant by condemning social and economic inequality in Cuba. In contrast, his former public criticisms had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=36–37}}

In April 1948, Castro traveled to [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], leading a Cuban student group sponsored by President [[Juan Perón]]'s Argentine government. There, the assassination of popular leftist leader [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala]] led to widespread rioting and clashes between the governing [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservatives]]&nbsp;– backed by the army&nbsp;– and leftist [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberals]].<ref name="Bogota" /> Castro joined the Liberal cause by stealing guns from a police station, but subsequent police investigations concluded that he had not been involved in any killings.<ref name="Bogota">{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=46–52}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=25–26}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=40–45}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=98–99}}.</ref> In April 1948, the Organization of American States was founded at a summit in Bogotá, leading to protests, which Castro joined.<ref>{{harvnb|Gaddis|1997|pp=177}}</ref>

Returning to Cuba, Castro became a prominent figure in protests against government attempts to raise bus fares.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=54, 56}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=46–49}}.</ref> That year, he married [[Mirta Diaz-Balart|Mirta Díaz Balart]], a student from a wealthy family, through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle of the Cuban elite.

That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, which was instead won by his ''[[Partido Auténtico]]''{{'}}s new candidate, [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=54–55}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=46}}.</ref> Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a socialist friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found them too powerful to control.<ref>{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=49}}.</ref> Castro had moved further to the left, influenced by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. He came to interpret Cuba's problems as an integral part of capitalist society, or the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie", rather than the failings of corrupt politicians, and adopted the Marxist view that meaningful political change could only be brought about by proletariat revolution. Visiting Havana's poorest neighborhoods, he became active in the student [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=50}}.</ref>

In September 1949, Mirta gave birth to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat.<ref>{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=50}}.</ref> Castro continued to put himself at risk, staying active in the city's politics and joining the 30 September Movement, which contained within it both communists and members of the ''Partido Ortodoxo''. The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=51}}.</ref> Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on 13 November, exposing the government's secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S.<ref>{{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=51}}.</ref> Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=57}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|p=89}}.</ref>

===Provisional government: 1959===
At Castro's command, the politically moderate lawyer [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]] was proclaimed provisional president but Castro announced (falsely) that Urrutia had been selected by "popular election". Most of Urrutia's cabinet were MR-26-7 members.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=153, 161}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=216}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=126, 141–142}}.</ref> Entering Havana, Castro proclaimed himself Representative of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency, setting up home and office in the penthouse of the [[Hotel Tryp Habana Libre|Havana Hilton Hotel]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=144}}.</ref> Castro exercised a great deal of influence over Urrutia's regime, which was now [[rule by decree|ruling by decree]]. He ensured that the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy and that it attempted to remove Batistanos from positions of power by dismissing Congress and barring all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 from future office.

In suppressing the revolution, Batista's government had killed thousands of Cubans; Castro and influential sectors of the press put the death toll at 20,000, but a list of victims published shortly after the revolution contained only 898 names—over half of them combatants.{{sfnm|1a1=Wickham-Crowley|1y=1990|1pp=63–64|2a1=Guerra|2y=2012|2p=43}} More recent estimates place the death toll between 1,000{{sfn|Wickham-Crowley|1990|p=63}} and 4,000.{{sfn|Guerra|2012|p=43}} In response to popular uproar, which demanded that those responsible be brought to justice, Castro helped to set up many trials, resulting in hundreds of executions. Although popular domestically, critics–in particular the U.S. press, argued that many were not [[fair trial]]s.

Whatever we may think of him he is going to be a great factor in the development of Cuba and very possibly in Latin American affairs generally. He seems to be sincere. He is either incredibly naive about Communism or under Communist discipline-my guess is the former...His ideas as to how to run a government or an economy are less developed than those of almost any world figure I have met in fifty countries.

Although then refusing to categorize his regime as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist, Castro appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions. Most significantly, Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries. President Urrutia increasingly expressed concern with the rising influence of Marxism. Angered, Castro in turn announced his resignation as prime minister, blaming Urrutia for complicating government with his "fevered anti-Communism". Over 500,000 Castro-supporters surrounded the Presidential Palace demanding Urrutia's resignation, which he submitted. On 23 July, Castro resumed his Premiership and appointed Marxist [[Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado|Osvaldo Dorticós]] as president.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=181–183}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=248–252}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=162}}.</ref>

Castro's government emphasised social projects to improve Cuba's standard of living, often to the detriment of economic development.<ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76">{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=275–276}}.</ref> Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=275–276}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=324}}.</ref> Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically.<ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76" /> A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within the first six months of Castro's government, {{convert|600|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} of roads were built across the island, while $300&nbsp;million was spent on water and sanitation projects.<ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76" /> Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.<ref name="Bourne 1986. p. 275-76" />

At the time, 1960, the [[Cold War]] raged between two superpowers: the United States, a capitalist [[liberal democracy]], and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist–Leninist socialist state ruled by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].

Relations between Cuba and the U.S. were further strained following the explosion of a French vessel, the ''[[La Coubre]]'', in Havana harbor in March 1960. The ship carried weapons purchased from Belgium, and the cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly insinuated that the U.S. government was guilty of sabotage.

In September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]]. Staying at the [[Hotel Theresa]] in [[Harlem]], he met with journalists and anti-establishment figures like [[Malcolm X]]. Castrol had decided to stay in Harlem as a way of expressing solidarity with the poor [[African Americans|African-American]] population living there, thus leading to an assortment of world leaders such as Nasser of Egypt and Nehru of India having to drive out to Harlem to see him.<ref>{{harvnb|Gaddis|1997|pp=182}}</ref> He also met Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], with the two publicly condemning the poverty and [[Racism in the United States|racism faced by Americans]] in areas like Harlem.<ref>{{harvnb|Gaddis|1997|pp=182}}</ref> Relations between Castro and Khrushchev were warm; they led the applause to one another's speeches at the General Assembly.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=206–209}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=333–338}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=174–176}}.</ref> The opening session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 1960 was a highly racerous one with Khrushchev famously [[Shoe-banging incident|banging his shoe against his desk]] to interrupt a speech by Filipino delegate [[Lorenzo Sumulong]], which set the general tone for the debates and speeches.<ref>{{harvnb|Gaddis|1997|pp=182}}</ref> Castro delivered the longest speech ever held before the United Nations General Assembly, speaking for four and a half hours in a speech mostly given over to denouncing American policies towards Latin America.<ref>{{harvnb|Gaddis|1997|pp=183}}</ref> Subsequently, visited by Polish First Secretary [[Władysław Gomułka]], Bulgarian chairman [[Todor Zhivkov]], Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Indian Premier [[Jawaharlal Nehru]],<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=209–210}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=337}}.</ref> Castro also received an evening's reception from the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=339}}.</ref>

Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 his regime spent $120&nbsp;million on Soviet, French, and Belgian weaponry and by early 1960 had doubled the size of Cuba's armed forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=300}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=176}}.</ref> Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|p=300}}.</ref> In September 1960, they created the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints.

Despite the fear of a coup, Castro garnered support in New York City. In on February 18, 1961, 400 people—mainly Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and college students—picketed in the rain outside of the United Nations rallying for Castro's anti-colonial values and his effort to reduce the United States' power over Cuba. The protesters held up signs that read, "Mr. Kennedy, Cuba is Not For Sale.", "Viva Fidel Castro!" and "Down With Yankee Imperialism!". Around 200 policemen were on the scene, but the protesters continued to chant slogans and throw pennies in support of Fidel Castro's socialist movement. Some Americans disagreed with President [[John F.

In January 1961, Castro ordered [[Embassy of the United States, Havana|Havana's U.S. Embassy]] to reduce its 300-member staff, suspecting that many of them were spies. The U.S. responded by ending diplomatic relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=215–216}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=353–354, 365–366}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=178}}.</ref> Both President Eisenhower and his successor President Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in April 1961.

The CIA and the Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in [[Nicaragua]]. On the night of 16 to 17 April, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's [[Bay of Pigs]] and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch the counter-offensive, before taking personal control of it. After bombing the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade to surrender on 20 April.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|pp=222–225}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=370–374}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|pp=180–184}}.</ref> He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated by a panel of journalists on live television, personally taking over the questioning on 25 April.

Consolidating "Socialist Cuba", Castro united the MR-26-7, PSP and Revolutionary Directorate into a governing party based on the Leninist principle of [[democratic centralism]]: the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Integrated Revolutionary Organizations]] (''Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas'' – ORI), renamed the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) in 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=230}}; {{harvnb|Geyer|1991|p=276}}; {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=387, 396}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=188}}.</ref> Although the USSR was hesitant regarding Castro's embrace of socialism,<ref>{{harvnb|Geyer|1991|pp=274–275}}, {{harvnb|Quirk|1993|pp=385–386}}.</ref> relations with the Soviets deepened.

In May 1963, Castro visited the USSR at Khrushchev's personal invitation, touring 14 cities, addressing a [[Red Square]] rally, and being awarded both the [[Order of Lenin]] and an honorary doctorate from [[Moscow State University]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=245–248|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=458–470|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=204–205}} Castro returned to Cuba with new ideas; inspired by Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', he amalgamated ''Hoy'' and ''Revolución'' into a new daily, ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=249|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2p=538}} and oversaw large investment into Cuban sport that resulted in an increased international sporting reputation.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=249–250|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2p=702}} Seeking to further consolidate control, in 1963 the government cracked down on Protestant sects in Cuba, with Castro labeling them counter-revolutionary "instruments of imperialism"; many preachers were found guilty of illegal U.S.-links and imprisoned.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=435–434}} Measures were implemented to force perceived idle and delinquent youths to work, primarily through the introduction of mandatory military service.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=454–454, 479–480}} In September, the government temporarily permitted emigration for anyone other than males aged between 15 and 26, thereby ridding the government of thousands of critics, most of whom were from upper and middle-class backgrounds.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=530–534|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=213}} In 1963, Castro's mother died.

Despite Soviet misgivings, Castro continued to call for global revolution, funding militant leftists and those engaged in [[national liberation]] struggles. Cuba's foreign policy was strongly anti-imperialist, believing that every nation should control its own natural resources.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=744}} He supported Che Guevara's "Andean project", an unsuccessful plan to set up a guerrilla movement in the highlands of [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Argentina]].

He considered Western-dominated Africa to be ripe for revolution, and sent troops and medics to aid [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]'s socialist regime in Algeria during the [[Sand War]]. He also allied with [[Alphonse Massamba-Débat]]'s socialist government in [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]].

In 1966, Castro staged a [[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America|Tri-Continental Conference of Africa, Asia and Latin America]] in Havana, further establishing himself as a significant player on the world stage.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=265|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=214}} From this conference, Castro created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS), which adopted the slogan of "The duty of a revolution is to make revolution", signifying Havana's leadership of Latin America's revolutionary movement.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=267}}

[[File:Fidel-Gagarin-hug.jpg|thumb|Castro and Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first human in space]]

Castro's increasing role on the world stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]], declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=269}} Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to [[pure communism]] rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=559–560}} In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=269–270|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=588–590}} Recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the [[Prague Spring]] and praised the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=270–271|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=597–600|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=216–217}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Castro |first=Fidel |date=August 1968 |url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1968/19680824.html |title=Castro comments on Czechoslovakia crisis |publisher=FBIS}}</ref>

Influenced by China's [[Great Leap Forward]], in 1968 Castro proclaimed a [[Revolutionary Offensive|Great Revolutionary Offensive]], closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=591–594|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=227}} The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=647}} This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged, consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=644–645}}

===Economic stagnation and Third World politics: 1969–1974===
Castro publicly celebrated his administration's 10th anniversary in January 1969; in his celebratory speech he warned of sugar rations, reflecting the nation's economic problems.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=618–621|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=227}} The 1969 crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane, and to meet its export quota, the government drafted in the army, implemented a seven-day working week, and postponed public holidays to lengthen the harvest.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=273|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=634–640|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3p=229}} When that year's production quota was not met, Castro offered to resign during a public speech, but assembled crowds insisted he remain.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=274|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2p=644|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3p=230}} Despite the economic issues, many of Castro's social reforms were popular, with the population largely supportive of the "Achievements of the Revolution" in education, medical care, housing, and road construction, as well as the policies of "direct democratic" public consultation.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=275–276|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2p=606|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3p=230}} Seeking Soviet help, from 1970 to 1972 Soviet economists re-organized Cuba's economy, founding the Cuban-Soviet Commission of Economic, Scientific and Technical Collaboration, while Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] visited {{When|date=February 2018}} in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=276–277|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=682–684}} In July 1972, Cuba joined the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (Comecon), an economic organization of socialist states, although this further limited Cuba's economy to agricultural production.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=277}}

In May 1970, the crews of two Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based dissident group [[Alpha 66]], who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=640–641|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=230}} In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering the arrest of dissident poet [[Heberto Padilla]] who had been arrested 20 March; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=609–615, 662–676|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=232–233}}

In November 1971, [[Fidel Castro's state visit to Chile|Castro visited Chile]], where Marxist President [[Salvador Allende]] had been elected as the head of [[Popular Unity (Chile)|a left-wing coalition]].

In September 1973, he returned to [[Algiers]] to attend the Fourth Summit of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the [[Warsaw Pact]] and therefore should not be at the conference.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=283–284|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=718–719|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3p=239}} At the conference he publicly broke off relations with Israel, citing its government's close relationship with the U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel–Palestine conflict]].

Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a [[socialist state]], the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created [[Council of State of Cuba|Council of State]] and [[Council of Ministers of Cuba|Council of Ministers]], making him both [[head of state]] and head of government.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=283|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=726–729|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=240–241}}

Castro considered Africa to be "the weakest link in the imperialist chain", and at the request of Angolan President [[Agostinho Neto]] he ordered 230 military advisers into Angola in November 1975 to aid Neto's Marxist [[MPLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]]. When the U.S. and South Africa stepped up their support of the opposition [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FLNA]] and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]], Castro ordered a further 18,000 troops to Angola, which played a major role in forcing a South African and UNITA retreat.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1pp=281, 284–287|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=747–750|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=242–243}} The decision to intervene in Angola has been a controversial one, all the more so as Castro's critics have charged that it was not his decision at all, contending that the Soviets ordered him to do so.{{sfn|George|2004|p=77-79}} Castro always maintained that he took the decision to launch Operation Carlota himself in response to an appeal from Neto and that the Soviets were in fact opposed to Cuban intervention in Angola, which took place over their opposition.{{sfn|George|2004|p=79}}    

Traveling to Angola, Castro celebrated with Neto, Sékou Touré and Guinea-Bissaun President [[Luís Cabral]], where they agreed to support Mozambique's [[FRELIMO|Marxist–Leninist government]] against [[RENAMO]] in the [[Mozambique Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=752|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=243}} In February, Castro visited Algeria and then Libya, where he spent ten days with Gaddafi and oversaw the establishment of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Jamahariya system of governance]], before attending talks with [[Yemeni Socialist Party|the Marxist government]] of [[South Yemen]].

In 1977 the [[Ogaden War]] broke out over the disputed [[Ogaden]] region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; although a former ally of Somali President [[Siad Barre]], Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s Marxist government of Ethiopia. In an desperate attempt to stop the war, Castro had a summit with Barre where he proposed a federation of Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Yemen as an alternative to war.{{sfn|Tareke|2009|p=190}} Barre who saw seizing the Ogaden as the first step towards creating a greater Somalia that would unite all of the Somalis into one state rejected the federation offer, and decided upon war.{{sfn|Tareke|2009|p=190}} Castro sent troops under the command of General [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army.

In the late 1970s, Cuba's relations with North American states improved during the period when Mexican President [[Luis Echeverría]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]],{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=750–751|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=244–245}} and U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] in power. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=289|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=756–759, 769, 771|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=247–248}} Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and [[Sino-Vietnamese War|attacking Vietnam]].{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=793–794}} In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was held in Havana, where Castro was selected as NAM president, a position he held until 1982.

[[File:Fidelcastro1978.jpg|thumb|left|Fidel Castro speaking in Havana, 1978]]

By the 1980s, Cuba's economy was again in trouble, following a decline in the market price of sugar and 1979's decimated harvest.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=754–755, 804|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=250|3a1=Gott|3y=2004|3p=288}} For the first time, unemployment became a serious problem in Castro's Cuba, with the government sending unemployed youth to other countries, primarily East Germany, to work there.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=804, 816}} Desperate for money, Cuba's government secretly sold off paintings from national collections and illicitly traded for U.S. electronic goods through Panama.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=255}} Increasing numbers of Cubans fled to Florida, but were labelled "scum" and "[[lumpenproletariat|lumpen]]" by Castro and his CDR supporters.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=808|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=250–251}} In one incident, 10,000 Cubans stormed the Peruvian Embassy requesting asylum, and so the U.S. agreed that it would accept 3,500 refugees. Castro conceded that those who wanted to leave could do so from Mariel port. Hundreds of boats arrived from the U.S., leading to a mass exodus of 120,000; Castro's government took advantage of the situation by loading criminals, the mentally ill, and suspected homosexuals onto the boats destined for Florida.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=295|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=807–810|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=251–252}} The event destabilized Carter's administration, and later, in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected U.S. president. 

Reagan's administration adopted a hard-line approach against Castro, making its desire to overthrow his regime clear.{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=296|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=810–815|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3p=252}} In late 1981, Castro publicly accused the U.S. of biological warfare against Cuba by orchestrating a [[dengue fever]] epidemic.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=812–813|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=252}} Cuba's economy became even more dependent on Soviet aid, with Soviet subsidies (mainly in the form of supplies of low-cost oil and voluntarily buying Cuban sugar at inflated prices) averaging $4–5&nbsp;billion a year by the late eighties.<ref>CLYDE H.

Although described as a "relatively highly developed Latin American export economy" in 1959 and the early 1960s, Cuba's basic economic structure changed very little between then and the 1980s. Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports, and even these are produced by a pre-industrial process. The Cuban economy remained highly inefficient and over-specialized in a few highly subsidized commodities provided by the Soviet bloc countries.<ref>''The Economic Impact of U.S. Sanctions With Respect to Cuba''.

Although despising Argentina's [[National Reorganization Process|right wing military junta]], Castro supported them in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] against Britain and offered military aid to the Argentinians.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=253}} Castro supported the leftist [[New Jewel Movement]] that seized power in [[Grenada]] in 1979, befriending Grenadine President [[Maurice Bishop]] and sending doctors, teachers, and technicians to aid the country's development. When Bishop was executed in a Soviet-backed coup by hard-line Marxist [[Bernard Coard]] in October 1983, Castro condemned the killing but cautiously retained support for Grenada's government. However, the U.S. used the coup as a basis for [[Invasion of Grenada (1983)|invading the island]]. Cuban soldiers died in the conflict, with Castro denouncing the invasion and comparing the U.S. to [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bourne|1y=1986|1p=297|2a1=Quirk|2y=1993|2pp=819–822|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3pp=253–254}} In a July 1983 speech marking the 30th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, Castro condemned Reagan's administration as a "reactionary, extremist clique" who were waging an "openly warmongering and fascist foreign policy".{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=818}} Castro feared a [[CIA activities in Nicaragua|U.S. invasion of Nicaragua]] and sent Ochoa to train the governing [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] in guerrilla warfare, but received little support from the USSR.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=254–255}}

In 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he implemented measures to increase freedom of the press (''[[glasnost]]'') and economic decentralization (''[[perestroika]]'') in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=826|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=256|3a1=Gott|3y=2004|3p=273}} Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba,{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=256}} with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=257}} On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking [[Cuban cigars]], helping to set an example for the rest of the populace.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=224}} Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=255}}

[[File:Lobito Lighthouse 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Castro's image painted onto a now-destroyed lighthouse in [[Lobito]], [[Angola]], 1995]]
By November 1987, Castro began spending more time on the [[Angolan Civil War]], in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. In response to the siege of Cuito Cuanavale in 1987-1988 by South African-UNITA forces, Castro sent an additional 12, 000 Cuban Army troops to Angola in late 1987.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|pp=9}} From afar in Havana, Castro was closely involved in the decision-making about the defense of Cuito Cuanavle and came into conflict with Ochoa, whom he criticized for almost losing Cuito Cuanavle to a South African assault on 13 January 1988 despite warning for almost two months prior that such an attack was coming.{{sfn|George|2004|p=220}} On 30 January 1988, Ochoa was summoned to a meeting with Castro in Havana where he was told that Cuito Cuanavale must not fall and to execute Castro's plans for a pull-back to more defensible positions over the objections of the Angolans.{{sfn|George|2004|p=221}}  The Cuban troops played a decisive role in the relief of Cuito Cuanavale, breaking the siege in March 1988, which led to the withdrawal of most of the South African troops from Angola.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|pp=9}} Cuban propaganda turned the siege of Cuito Cuanavle into a decisive victory that changed the course of African history and Castro awarded 82 soldiers medals of the newly created Medal of Merit for the Defense of Cuito Cuanavle on 1 April 1988.{{sfn|George|2004|p=234-235}} Tensions were increased with the Cubans advancing close to the border of Namibia, which led to warnings from the South African government that they considered this an extremely unfriendly act, causing South Africa to mobilize and call up its reserves.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|pp=9}} In the spring of 1988, the intensity of South African-Cuban fighting drastically increased with both sides taking heavy losses.{{sfn|George|2004|p=237-239}} 

The prospect of an all-out Cuban-South African war served to concentrate minds in both Moscow and Washington and led to an increased push for a diplomatic solution to the Angolan war.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|pp=9}} The cost of Cuba's wars in Africa were paid for with Soviet subsidies at a time when the Soviet economy was badly hurt by low oil prices while the white supremacist government of South Africa had by the 1980s became a very awkward American ally as much of the American population, especially black Americans, objected to apartheid. From the viewpoint of both Moscow and Washington, having both Cuba and South Africa disengage in Angola was the best possible outcome.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|pp=9}} The low oil prices of the 1980s had also changed the Angolan attitude about subsidizing the Cuban economy as dos Santos found the promises made in the 1970s when oil prices were high to be a serious drain upon Angola's economy in the 1980s.<ref name="Vines">{{cite web |last1=Vines |first1=Alex |title=Fidel Castro's Greatest Legacy in Africa Is in Angola |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/2016/12/fidel-castros-greatest-legacy-africa-angola |website=Chatham House |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> South African whites were vastly outnumbered by South African blacks, and accordingly the South African Army could not take heavy losses with its white troops as that would fatally weaken the ability of the South African state to uphold apartheid.{{sfn|George|2004|p=234}} The Cubans had also taken heavy losses while the increasing difficult relations with dos Santos who become less generous in subsidizing the Cuban economy suggested that such losses were not worth the cost.{{sfn|George|2004|p=246}} Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola while South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1pp=257–258|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2pp=276–279}}

When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that ''perestroika'' meant an end to subsidies for Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=827–828|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=260–261|3a1=Gott|3y=2004|3p=276}} Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and [[Tony de la Guardia]], were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=828–829|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2pp=258–266|3a1=Gott|3y=2004|3pp=279–286}} In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to capitalist reformers between 1989 and 1991 and many Western observers expected the same in Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=830|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=277|3a1=Gott|3y=2004|3p=286}} Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with [[Manuel Noriega]]'s right-wing government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1pp=267–268|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=286}} In February 1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President [[Daniel Ortega]] and the Sandinistas, were defeated by the U.S.-funded [[National Opposition Union]] in an election.{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1pp=268–270|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=286}} With the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] in Geneva, Switzerland.

===Special Period: 1992–2000===
[[File:Cuba.FidelCastro.02.jpg|thumb|right|Castro in front of a Havana statue of Cuban national hero [[José Martí]] in 2003]]

With favourable trade from the Soviet bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a "[[Special Period|Special Period in Time of Peace]]". Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non-essential tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood began being used for cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open war, and that the country might have to resort to [[subsistence farming]].{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=830–831|2a1=Balfour|2y=1995|2p=163|3a1=Coltman|3y=2003|3p=271|4a1=Gott|4y=2004|4pp=287–289}} By 1992, Cuba's economy had declined by over 40% in under two years, with major food shortages, widespread malnutrition and a lack of basic goods.{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1p=282|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=288}} Castro hoped for a restoration of Marxism–Leninism in the USSR, but refrained from backing the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup in that country]].{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=274–275}} When Gorbachev regained control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further and Soviet troops were withdrawn in September 1991.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1pp=832–833|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=275}} In December, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was officially dissolved]] as [[Boris Yeltsin]] abolished the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and introducing a capitalist [[multiparty democracy]].

He welcomed Western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended [[Manuel Fraga]] and took a particular interest in [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s policies in the UK, believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on low taxation and personal initiative.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=290–291}} He ceased support for foreign militants, refrained from praising [[FARC]] on a 1994 visit to Colombia and called for a negotiated settlement between the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] and Mexican government in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=305–306}}

In 1991, Havana [[1991 Pan American Games|hosted]] the [[Pan American Games]], which involved construction of [[Estadio Panamericano, Havana|a stadium]] and accommodation for the athletes; Castro admitted that it was an expensive error, but it was a success for Cuba's government. Crowds regularly shouted "Fidel!

Castro believed in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was to survive in a world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the [[Cuban economic reforms|reforms]], although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1pp=276–281, 284, 287|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2pp=291–294}}

Castro's government diversified its economy into [[biotechnology]] and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of revenue in 1995.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=836|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=288|3a1=Gott|3y=2004|3pp=290, 322}} The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on [[prostitution in Cuba]], fearing a political backlash.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=294}} Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, both in the form of [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Santería]].

In contrast to the improved relations between Cuba and a number of leftist Latin American states, in 2004 it broke off diplomatic ties with Panama after centrist President [[Mireya Moscoso]] pardoned four Cuban exiles accused of attempting to assassinate Castro in 2000.

Castro's improving relations across Latin America were accompanied by continuing animosity towards the U.S. However, after massive damage caused by [[Hurricane Michelle]] in 2001, Castro successfully proposed a one-time cash purchase of food from the U.S. while declining its government's offer of humanitarian aid.<ref>{{cite news |date=17 November 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1662346.stm|title = Castro welcomes one-off US trade|work=BBC News |access-date =19 May 2006}}; {{cite news |date=16 December 2001|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1714776.stm|title = US food arrives in Cuba |work=BBC News |access-date =19 May 2006}}</ref> Castro expressed solidarity with the U.S. following the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]], condemning [[Al-Qaeda]] and offering Cuban airports for the emergency diversion of any U.S. planes.

==Ideology==
{{Main|Politics of Fidel Castro}}
[[File:XXX Cumbre del Mercosur - Córdoba - 21JUL06 -2- presidenciagovar..jpg|thumb|Castro with South American leaders of the [[Mercosur]] trade bloc in 2006. In the 2000s Castro forged alliances in the Latin American "[[pink tide]]".]]
Castro proclaimed himself to be "a Socialist, a [[Marxism|Marxist]], and a [[Leninism|Leninist]]",{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|p=157}} and publicly identified as a Marxist–Leninist from December 1961 onward.{{sfn|Sondrol|1991|p=608}} As a Marxist, Castro sought to transform Cuba from a capitalist state which was dominated by foreign imperialism to a socialist society and ultimately to a communist society. Influenced by Guevara, he suggested that Cuba could evade most stages of socialism and progress straight to communism.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=559–560}} The Cuban Revolution nevertheless did not meet the Marxist assumption that socialism would be achieved through proletariat revolution, for most of the forces involved in Batista's overthrow were led by members of the Cuban middle-class.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|pp=177–178}} According to Castro, a country could be regarded as socialist if its means of production were controlled by the state. In this way, his understanding of socialism was less about who controlled power in a country and more about the method of distribution.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=178}}

Castro's government was also [[nationalism|nationalistic]], with Castro declaring, "We are not only Marxist-Leninists, but also nationalists and patriots".{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=790}} In this it drew upon a longstanding tradition of Cuban nationalism.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=177}} Castro biographer [[Sebastian Balfour]] noted that "the vein of moral regeneration and voluntarism that runs through" Castro's thought owes far more to "Hispanic nationalism" than European socialism or Marxism–Leninism.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=177}} Historian [[Richard Gott]] remarked that one of the keys to Castro's success was his ability to use the "twin themes of socialism and nationalism" and keep them "endlessly in play".{{sfn|Gott|2004|p=149}} Castro described [[Karl Marx]] and Cuban nationalist [[José Martí]] as his main political influences,{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=101–102}} although Gott believed that Martí ultimately remained more important than [[Marx]] in Castro's politics.{{sfn|Gott|2004|p=149}} Castro described Martí's political ideas as "a philosophy of independence and an exceptional humanistic philosophy",{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|p=147}} and his supporters and apologists repeatedly claimed that there were great similarities between the two figures.{{sfn|Lecuona|1991|p=46}}

Biographer Volka Skierka described Castro's government as a "highly individual, socialist-nationalist {{'}}''fidelista''{{'}} system",{{sfn|Skierka|2006|p=xv}} with Theodore Draper terming his approach "Castroism", viewing it as a blend of European socialism with the Latin American revolutionary tradition.{{sfn|Draper|1965|pp=48–49}}
Political scientist Paul C. Sondrol has described Castro's approach to politics as "totalitarian utopianism",{{sfn|Sondrol|1991|p=610}} with a style of leadership that drew upon the wider Latin American phenomenon of the ''[[caudillo]]''.{{sfn|Sondrol|1991|pp=607, 609}} He drew inspiration from the wider Latin American anti-imperialist movements of the 1930s and 1940s, including Argentina's Perón and Guatemala's [[Jacobo Árbenz]].{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=176}} Castro took a relatively [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stance on many issues, opposing drug use, gambling, and prostitution, which he viewed as [[moral evil]]s. Instead, he advocated hard work, family values, integrity, and self-discipline.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=200}} Although his government repressed [[homosexuality]] for decades, later in his life he took responsibility for this persecution, regretting it as a "great injustice", as he himself put it.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Fidel Castro takes blame for 1960s gay persecution | newspaper = BBC | date = 31 August 2010 | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11147157 | access-date = 20 October 2018}}</ref>

==Personal and public life==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Castro first and foremost is and always has been a committed [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]]. He despises any system in which one class or group of people lives much better than another. He wanted a system that provided the basic needs to all&nbsp;– enough to eat, health care, adequate housing and education. The [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] nature of the Cuban Revolution stems largely from his commitment to that goal. Castro was convinced that he was right, and that his system was for the good of the people. Thus, anyone who stood against the revolution stood also against the Cuban people and that, in Castro's eyes, was simply unacceptable. There is, then, very little in the way of individual freedoms&nbsp;– especially freedom of expression and assembly.

Biographer Leycester Coltman described Castro as "fiercely hard-working, dedicated[,] loyal&nbsp;... generous and magnanimous" but noted that he could be "vindictive and unforgiving". He asserted that Castro "always had a keen sense of humor and could laugh at himself" but could equally be "a bad loser" who would act with "ferocious rage if he thought that he was being humiliated".{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=14}} Castro was well known for throwing tantrums, and could make "snap judgements" which he refused to back down from.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=494}} Biographer [[Peter Bourne]] noted that Castro "suffers fools poorly" and that in his younger years he was intolerant of those who did not share his views.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=178}} He claimed that Castro liked to meet with ordinary citizens, both in Cuba and abroad, but took a particularly paternal attitude toward Cubans, treating them as if "they were a part of his own giant family".{{sfn|Bourne |1986|p=273}} British historian [[Alex von Tunzelmann]] commented that "though ruthless, [Castro] was a patriot, a man with a profound sense that it was his mission to save the Cuban people".{{sfn|Von Tunzelmann|2011|p=94}} Balfour described Castro as having a "voracity for knowledge" and "elephantine memory" that allowed him to speak for hours on a variety of different subjects.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=180}}

[[File:Fidel castro angel 1954.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Castro with his son Angel in 1954]]

Castro was known for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4&nbsp;am{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=219}} He preferred to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=11}} He described [[Ernest Hemingway]] as his favorite writer,{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=204}} and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=224}} A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=224}} He took a great interest in [[gastronomy]], as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=224}} Castro had a lifelong love of guns,{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=10, 255}} and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=5}}

[[Fidel Castro's religious beliefs]] have been a matter of some debate; he was [[baptized]] and raised as a Roman Catholic, but he identified himself as an [[atheism|atheist]]. He also criticized use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans,{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=40–41}} but commented that Christianity exhibited "a group of very humane precepts" which gave the world "ethical values" and a "sense of social justice", relating, "If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am a Christian."{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|p=156}} He promoted the idea that [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] was a communist, citing the [[Feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5,000]] and the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] as evidence.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=695}}

Political scientist Paul C. Sondrol characterized Castro as "quintessentially [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] in his charismatic appeal, utopian functional role and public, transformative utilisation of power".{{sfn|Sondrol|1991|p=601}}
Unlike a number of other Soviet-era communist leaders, Castro's government did not intentionally construct a [[cult of personality]] around him, although his popularity among segments of the Cuban populace nevertheless led to one developing in the early years of his administration.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=255|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=325}} By 2006, the [[BBC]] reported that Castro's image could frequently be found in Cuban stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and on national television.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4779529.stm |title=Americas &#124; Ailing Castro still dominates Cuba |work=BBC News |date=11 August 2006 |access-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> Throughout his administration, large throngs of supporters gathered to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours and which were delivered without the use of written notes.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=312, 688}} During speeches Castro regularly cited reports and books he had read on a wide variety of subjects, including military matters, plant cultivation, filmmaking, and chess strategies.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=352–353}} Castro's speech before the United Nations General Assembly in September 1960 remains the longest speech delivered at the United Nations General Assembly, with the speech lasting 4 hours and 29 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the longest speech given at the United Nations? |url=http://ask.un.org/faq/37127 |publisher=United Nations |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Castro's Marathon Speech |url=https://abcnews.go.com/amp/International/story?id=82676&page=1 |website=ABC News |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref>

For 37 years publicly, Castro only wore olive-green military fatigues, emphasizing his role as the perpetual revolutionary, but in the mid-1990s began wearing dark civilian suits and ''[[guayabera]]'' in public.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|pp=303–304}}
Within Cuba, Castro was often nicknamed "''El Caballo''" ("The Horse"), a label attributed to Cuban entertainer [[Benny Moré]] which alludes to Castro's well known philandering during the 1950s and early 1960s,{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=175}} and during this period Castro was often recognized as a [[sex symbol]] in Cuba.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=201}} He was also nicknamed "El Comandante" (the commander).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/havana-mourning-cubans-fidelista-fidel-castro|title=Havana in mourning: 'We Cubans are Fidelista even if we are not communist'|first1=Stephen|last1=Gibbs|first2=Jonathan|last2=Watts|first3=Ted|last3=Francis|date=26 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/well-always-have-fidel-48159|title=WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE FIDEL|magazine=Pacific Standard|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>

One of the most controversial political leaders of his era,{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=1}} Castro both inspired and dismayed people across the world during his lifetime.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=vi}} The London ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' stated that he proved to be "as divisive in death as he was in life", and that the only thing that his "enemies and admirers" agreed upon was that he was "a towering figure" who "transformed a small Caribbean island into a major force in world affairs".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Graham-Harrison|first1=Emma|last2=Gibbs|first2=Stephen|last3=Borger|first3=Julian|title=Fidel Castro: leader proves as divisive in death as he was in life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-dies-cuba-revolutionary-icon |newspaper=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=26 November 2016|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' noted that across the world he was "either praised as a brave champion of the people, or derided as a power-mad dictator."<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Harriet|title=Fidel Castro: As Divisive in Death as he was in Life |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=26 November 2016|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/26/fidel-castro-divisive-death-life/ |access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

Under Castro's leadership, Cuba became one of the best-educated and healthiest societies in the Third World as well as one of the most militarised states in [[Latin America]].{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=1}} Despite its small size and limited economic weight, Castro's Cuba gained a large role in world affairs.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=2}} On the island, the Castro government's legitimacy rested on the improvements that it brought to [[social justice]], healthcare, and education.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=viii}} The administration also relied heavily on its appeals to nationalistic sentiment, in particular the widespread hostility to the U.S. government.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=ix}} According to Balfour, Castro's domestic popularity stemmed from the fact that he symbolised "a long-cherished hope of national liberation and social justice" for much of the population.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=3}} Balfour also noted that throughout Latin America, Castro served as "a symbol of defiance against the continued economic and [[cultural imperialism]] of the United States".{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=170}} Similarly, [[Wayne Smith (diplomat)|Wayne S. Smith]]&nbsp;– the former Chief of the [[United States Interests Section in Havana]]&nbsp;– noted that Castro's opposition to U.S. dominance and transformation of Cuba into a significant world player resulted in him receiving "warm applause" throughout the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name="Wayne Smith" />

Various Western governments and human rights organizations nevertheless heavily criticized Castro and he was widely reviled in the U.S.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=290}} Following Castro's death, U.S. [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Donald Trump]] called him a "brutal dictator",<ref>{{cite news |title=Donald Trump calls Fidel Castro 'brutal dictator' |date=26 November 2016 |website=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-38118739 |access-date=5 November 2016}}</ref> while the Cuban-American politician [[Marco Rubio]] called him "an evil, murderous dictator" who turned Cuba into "an impoverished island prison".<ref>{{cite news |author=Julian Borger |title=Trump and Obama offer divergent responses to death of Fidel Castro |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 November 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/fidel-castro-death-obama-trump-response |access-date=5 December 2016 }}</ref>
Castro publicly rejected the "dictator" label, stating that he constitutionally held less power than most [[head of state|heads of state]] and insisting that his regime allowed for greater democratic involvement in policy making than Western [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]].{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=529|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=292}} Nevertheless, critics claim that Castro wielded significant unofficial influence aside from his official duties.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=292}} Quirk stated that Castro wielded "absolute power" in Cuba, albeit not in a legal or constitutional manner,{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=501}} while Bourne claimed that power in Cuba was "completely invested" in Castro,{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=263}} adding that it was very rare for "a country and a people" to have been so completely dominated by "the personality of one man".{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=295}} Balfour stated that Castro's "moral and political hegemony" within Cuba diminished the opportunities for democratic debate and decision making.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=181}} Describing Castro as a "totalitarian dictator",{{sfn|Sondrol|1991|p=606}} Sondrol suggested that in leading "a political system largely [of] his own creation and bearing his indelible stamp", Castro's leadership style warranted comparisons with totalitarian leaders like [[Mao Zedong]], [[Hideki Tojo]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Benito Mussolini]].{{sfn|Sondrol|1991|p=619}}

[[File:Ben Bella a la Havane - Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Castro with [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], principal leader of the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]] against French colonial rule; Ben Bella was one of many political figures inspired by Castro{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=424}}]]

Noting that there were "few more polarising political figures" than Castro, [[Amnesty International]] described him as "a progressive but deeply flawed leader". In their view, he should be "applauded" for his regime's "substantial improvements" to healthcare and education, but criticised for its "ruthless suppression of freedom of expression."<ref>{{cite news |title=Fidel Castro: A progressive but deeply flawed leader |website=Amnesty International |date=26 November 2016 |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/fidel-castro-progressive-deeply-flawed-leader |access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that his government constructed a "repressive machinery" which deprived Cubans of their "basic rights".<ref name="HRW-Castro">{{cite web|title=Cuba: Fidel Castro's Abusive Machinery Remains Intact|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/02/18/cuba-fidel-castro-s-abusive-machinery-remains-intact|date=18 February 2008|access-date=7 October 2009}}</ref> Castro defended his government's record on human rights, stating that the state was forced to limit the freedoms of individuals and imprison those involved in counter-revolutionary activities in order to protect the rights of the collective populace, such as the right to employment, education, and health care.{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=758|2a1=Coltman|2y=2003|2p=247}}

Historian and journalist [[Richard Gott]] considered Castro to be "one of the most extraordinary political figures of the twentieth century", commenting that he had become a "world hero in the mould" of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] to people throughout the developing world for his anti-imperialist efforts.{{sfn|Gott|2004|p=148}} Balfour stated that Castro's story had "few parallels in contemporary history", for there existed no other "Third World leader" in the second half of the twentieth century who held "such a prominent and restless part on the international stage" or remained head of state for such a long period.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|p=1}} Bourne described Castro as "an influential world leader" who commanded "great respect" from individuals of all political ideologies across the developing world.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|p=302}} Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] described Castro as a "remarkable leader" and a "larger than life leader who served his people."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/27/world/justin-trudeau-castro-eulogy-parody/index.html|title=O Canada: Trudeau's Castro tribute raises eyebrows|author=Madison Park|website=Cnn.com|date=2016-11-27}}</ref> The [[European Commission]] President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] said that Castro "was a hero for many."<ref>{{cite news |title=Czech, Slovak MEPs 'shocked' by EU comments on Castro |url=https://euobserver.com/institutional/136136 |work=EUobserver |date=5 December 2016}}</ref> Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] described Castro as both "a sincere and reliable friend of Russia" and a "symbol of an era", while [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] similarly referred to him as "a close comrade and a sincere friend" to China.<ref name="AlJaz">{{Cite news |title=Fidel Castro's Death – World Reactions |website=Al Jazeera |access-date=5 December 2016 |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/fidel-castro-death-world-reactions-161126095542185.html}}</ref> Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] termed him "one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century" and a "great friend", while South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] praised Castro for aiding black South Africans in "our struggle against apartheid".<ref name="AlJaz" /> He was awarded a [[List of awards and honours bestowed upon Fidel Castro|wide variety of awards and honors from foreign governments]] and was cited as an inspiration for foreign leaders like [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=424}} and [[Nelson Mandela]],{{sfn|Sampson|1999|p=192}} who subsequently awarded him South Africa's highest civilian award for foreigners, the [[Order of Good Hope]].<ref>{{cite news |date=6 September 1998|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/165566.stm|title = Castro ends state-visit to South Africa|work=BBC News |access-date=21 May 2006}}</ref> The biographer Volka Skierka stated that "he will go down in history as one of the few revolutionaries who remained true to his principles".{{sfn|Skierka|2006|p=xxiv}}

===In Cuba===
Following Castro's death, Cuba's government announced that it would be passing a law prohibiting the naming of "institutions, streets, parks or other public sites, or erecting busts, statues or other forms of tribute" in honor of the late Cuban leader in keeping with his wishes to prevent a [[cult of personality]] from developing around him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/fidel-castro-rally-santiago-1.3879755|title=Cuba bans naming monuments after Fidel Castro|website=Cbc.ca}}</ref>
