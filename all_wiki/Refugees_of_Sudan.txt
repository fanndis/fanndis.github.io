'''Sudanese refugees''' are persons originating from the country of Sudan, but seeking refuge outside the borders of their native country. In recent history, Sudan has been the stage for prolonged conflicts and [[Sudanese Civil War (disambiguation)|civil wars]], as well as environmental changes, namely [[desertification]]. These forces have resulted not only in violence and famine, but also the [[forced migration]] of large numbers of the Sudanese population, both inside and outside the country's borders. Given the expansive geographic territory of Sudan, and the regional and ethnic tensions and conflicts, much of the forced migration in Sudan has been internal. Yet, these populations are not immune to similar issues that typically accompany refugeedom, including economic hardship and providing themselves and their families with sustenance and basic needs. With the creation of a South Sudanese state, questions surrounding southern Sudanese [[Internally_displaced_person|IDPs]] may become questions of South Sudanese refugees.

==Reasons for fleeing==
The movement of populations within and around the territory of modern-day Sudan and its neighbours for trade, opportunity, climatic variations and conflicts is not unique to recent or contemporary history. But these movements have intensified and become more concentrated for reasons including prolonged civil war, violence between various populations along ethnic and political lines, droughts and subsequent famines in the 1980s, and humanitarian emergencies and famine caused by improper responses to previous crises by international aid organizations. Movements of people are also inherently more problematic across international boundaries, which may be contradictory to natural population flows within the region.<ref name="de Waal Masalit">{{cite journal|last=de Waal|first=Alex|title=Refugees and the Creation of Famine: The Case of Dar Masalit, Sudan|journal=Journal of Refugee Studies|year=1988|volume=1|pages=129|doi=10.1093/jrs/1.2.127}}</ref>

==Internally displaced Sudanese==

An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese are [[internally displaced  persons]] (IDPs), and another 78,000 are in IDP-like situations.<ref name="auto"/> 300,000 of these IDPs were newly displaced in the first months of 2013 due to renewed intertribal conflict.  Continuing insecurity, combined with government restrictions on humanitarian access in the Darfur region, South Kordofan, and the Blue Nile States, has hampered UNHCR's activities.<ref name="2014 UNHCR Country Operations Profile">{{cite web|author=UNHCR|title=2014 UNHCR country operations profile - Sudan|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e483b76.html}}</ref>
Historically, refugee assistance programs in Sudan have relied on the definition of a refugee as one who has crossed an international frontier. This definition is increasingly inappropriate worldwide and especially so in Sudanic Africa, where the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) exceeds the number of refugees.<ref name="Abusharaf 2009">{{cite book|last=Abusharaf|first=Rogaia Mustafa|title=Transforming Displaced Women in Sudan: Politics and the Body in a Squatter Settlement|year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref> 

==Host countries==

===Chad===

===Egypt===
{{main|Sudanese refugees in Egypt}}

Starting in the 1990s, the increase in refugees from Sudan has forced UNHCR RO Cairo to shift its focus from education and training to care and maintenance of refugees.<ref name="Edwards 2007">{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Jane Kani|title=Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|ISBN= 978-1-4039-8077-9}}</ref> In Cairo, the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) is involved in helping process refugees for resettlement, moving refugees, and assisting with their medical examinations. IOM also conducts cultural orientation for the refugees to prepare them for [[third country resettlement|resettlement in third countries]].<ref name=" Edwards 2007" /> The UNHCR regional office in Cairo (RO Cairo) is overextended, and after Somalis, the Sudanese (mainly southern Sudanese) represent the largest caseload.<ref name="Akeui 2005" /> A large number of [[Sudanese refugees in Egypt]] reflects the fact that much Sudanese travel to Cairo to obtain official recognition of their refugee status from the UNHCR. The Sudanese refugees in Egypt fall under two categories: those who are waiting for their status-determination interview and those who have been rejected or who are self-settled.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards">{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Jane Kani|title=Sudanese Women Refugees: Transformations and Future Imaginings|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref> 
Between 60 and 70 per cent of Sudanese asylum seekers have their applications for refugee status rejected.<, ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/> Rejection and closure of a file have serious psychological and emotional implications for refugees. Many of those rejected, especially men, turn to alcoholism as a way of overcoming their problems. Others become mentally disturbed and there have been reports of suicide or attempted suicide upon receiving news of the rejection.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/> The unity of the family has been challenged by Sudanese refugees' quest for UNHCR recognition. Women and children wait in Cairo for their UNHCR applications to go through while husbands wait in Sudan.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/>  The difficulties of life in Cairo and the inability of some husbands to join their families in Egypt have forced some women refugees to abandon their husbands, remarry, and leave for resettlement.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/> In cases of rejection of a family application at the UNHCR, many men leave their wives and children and look for another single woman with UNHCR status in order to avoid responsibility.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/> Additionally, UNHCR RO Cairo does not recognize polygamous unions, and as such will not refer polygamists for resettlement to countries where polygamy is not permitted.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/> All of these factors have contributed to the break-up of families, divorce, and the abandonment of children. Finally, the UNHCR identity cards issued to refugees are not always recognized by Egyptian authority. There have been situations in which people have been taken and detained from three to four days and then released, despite their UNHCR status.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/> A resident permit stamp on a valid Sudanese passport seems to offer more protection for refugees.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards"/>

Ethiopia shelters about 70,000 refugees from Sudan, most of whom live in refugee camps in the [[Benishangul-Gumuz Region|Benishangul-Gumuz]] and [[Gambela Region]]s.

===Uganda===

===Gulf countries===

In the last quarter of the 20th century, many Sudanese migrated to the Gulf countries to seek work in light of the oil boom in the Gulf and the deterioration of Sudan's economy.<ref name=Assal>{{cite web|last=Assal|first=Munzoul A. M.|title=Refugees To and From Sudan|url=http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/cmrs/Documents/MunzoulAssal.pdf|work=Paper|publisher=The Forced Migration & Refugee Studies Program at the American University in Cairo|accessdate=28 March  2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111024102/http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/cmrs/Documents/MunzoulAssal.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-11}}</ref> The allure of Gulf migration waned starting in the 1990s as the Government of Sudan's support for Iraq in the Gulf War meant that some expatriates were expelled while others lived under tight restrictions. As Sudan was amidst its second civil war, return was not an option, so many Gulf expatriates started moving to the United States and Canada on "lottery" or asylum and refugee tickets.<ref name=Assal /> As such, the traditional migration to Gulf countries is being used by some refugees to achieve further migration to Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia.<ref name=Assal />

=== Issues ===

Due to the shortages in UNHCR assistance to Sudanese refugees, some Church groups have opened learning centers for refugee children. Furthermore, churches also offer training programs for adult refugees, provide food rations to families, in addition to financial assistance, health services, and job placement.<ref name="Edwards 2007" /> With respect to those Sudanese living in shantytowns in Greater Khartoum or in other urban areas of Africa and the Middle East, remittances provided by kin [[Third country resettlement|resettled ]]in Western countries have become an essential part of the overall income needed to meet daily subsistence and other critical needs.<ref name=" Akeui 2005">{{cite journal|last=Riak Akuei|first=Stephanie|title=Remittances as Unforeseen Burdens: Considering Displacement, Family and Resettlement Contexts in Refugee Livelihood and Well Being|journal=Global migration perspectives|year=2005|volume=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=musQcgAACAAJ&dq=stephanie+riak+akuei&hl=en&ei=pxOSTavVOcH1gAfylK0Z&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|publisher=Global Commission on International Migration}}</ref> [[Urban refugees]]’ reliance on cash assistance from abroad is seen as a unique situation since there are few NGOs and humanitarian-based support mechanisms available to adequately meet the needs of refugees in Cairo, Beirut, Damascus, and elsewhere on Sudan’s periphery.<ref name="Akeui 2005" /> 

=== Gender issues ===

In their communities, Sudanese women play a substantial economic role, as the inhabitants of the South depend on agriculture, grazing, fishing and hunting.<ref name="Abusharaf 2009" /> When forced to migrate to the capital Khartoum, women pick up marginal work that brings in little income and exposes them to the risk of arrest by authorities. Displaced women often sell tea or liquor, but since the sale of alcohol is illegal, this can lead to imprisonment.<ref name=" Abusharaf 2009" /> Displaced women also suffer in ways that men do not, and in the shantytowns and government-run camps around Khartoum, women continue to suffer violations of their rights and assaults on their bodily integrity.<ref name="Abusharaf 2009" />

In Egypt, many southern Sudanese women have entered the Egyptian workforce to support their families.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards" /> As some men have assumed familial roles like food preparation and childcare, they have become sensitized to the difficulties women experience.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards" /> Men, however, are uncomfortable with this role reversal and tend to emphasize the negative consequences it has on child development and the husband-wife relationship.<ref name="Jane Kani Edwards" />

==Durable solutions==

=== Resettlement ===
{{See also|Third country resettlement}}

Whereas earlier waves of Sudanese refugees found asylum first in neighbouring countries, contemporary Sudanese refugees use these countries as a springboard for resettlement in a third country.<ref name=Assal /> Some refugees find themselves moving between different countries in the region in order to increase their chances for resettlement. 

=== Repatriation ===
{{see also|Voluntary return}}
Repatriation of Sudanese refugees remains difficult given the ongoing conflict and tensions in Darfur and [[South Sudan]]. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement is viewed as the principal determinant of peace and stability in Sudan.<ref name="UNHCR Sudan">{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=2011 UNHCR country operations profile-Sudan|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e483b76|work=website|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref> 
This pact paved the way for the return of thousands of Sudanese refugees from neighboring countries.<ref name="UNHCR Voluntary Repatriation">{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Voluntary Repatriation|url=http://www.unhcrrlo.org/Protection_in_Africa/Docs/Voluntary%20Repatriation.pdf|work=Website|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=28 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In [[South Sudan]], armed groups like Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and intertribal clashes have produced increased levels of violence. The patterns of violence point to a clear targeting of women and children.<ref name="UNHCR - Sudan">{{cite web|title=UNHCR - Sudan|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e483b76.html|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> This presents a definite obstacle to repatriation. In Darfur, insecurity, land occupation, and crop destruction continue to generate fresh displacement and prevent returns.<ref name="UNHCR - Sudan" />

== Hosting refugees ==
{{see also|Refugee camp}}
During the civil war between Eritrea and Ethiopia, many travelled to Sudan as refugees. These camps had a very harsh environment, medicine and clean water were scarce. Some survived on other nations. (e.g. UN Rations).
Nowadays, in 2016, there are 232,000 South Sudanese refugees in Sudan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-humanitarian-bulletin-issue-24-6-12-june-2016-enar|title=Sudan: Humanitarian Bulletin - Issue 24 - 6 – 12 June 2016 [EN/AR]|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref>
