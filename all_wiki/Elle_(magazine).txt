==History==
Elle was founded in Paris as an immediate aftermath of [[World War II]] and first sold as a supplement to [[France-Soir]], edited at the time by Pierre Lazareff.  Hélène Gordon-Lazareff, ''Elle''<nowiki/>'s pioneering founder, returned to Paris from New York City to create a unique publication that grappled with the many forces shaping the lives of women in France in 1945.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Susan|date=1999|title=Two Modernities: From "Elle" to "Mademoiselle".

Its 100th issue, published on 14 October 1947,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hprints.com/ELLE_N100_du_14_Octobre_1947_Christian_Dior-19526.html|title=Vintage advertisement, fashion, arts, erotica, printed collectibles - Paris, France|website=hprints.com|language=en|access-date=2 April 2019}}</ref> featured the work of [[Christian Dior]] just eight months after his debut show. Likewise, [[Brigitte Bardot]] graced her first Elle cover at age 17, on 7 January 1952, months before her screen debut in ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]]''. By the 1960s, ''Elle'' had a readership of 800,000 across France and was said to "not so much reflect fashion as decree it." This dominance was reflected in the famous slogan: "Si elle lit, elle lit Elle (If she reads, she reads Elle)".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871121,00.html |title=Magazines: Si Elle Lit, Elle Lit Elle|date=22 May 1964|work=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023043858/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871121,00.html|access-date=27 October 2010|archive-date=23 October 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy }}</ref>
