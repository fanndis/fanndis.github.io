The '''Glimmerglass Festival''' (formerly known as '''Glimmerglass Opera''') is an [[opera]] company which was founded in 1975 by Peter Macris and presents an annual season of operas at the '''Alice Busch Opera Theater''' on [[Otsego Lake (New York)|Otsego Lake]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) north of [[Cooperstown, New York]], [[United States]].

The summer-only season usually consists of four productions performed in rotating repertory. Glimmerglass is well known for producing new, lesser-known, and rare works, many of which in years past have been co-produced with the [[New York City Opera]].<ref>{{cite news|title=At City Opera, an Innovator Bows Out|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/arts/music/06tomm.html|work=The New York Times|date=2007-05-06|first=Anthony|last=Tommasini|authorlink=Anthony Tommasini}}</ref> It is the second-largest summer opera festival in the United States, led by Artistic and General Director [[Francesca Zambello]].

==History==
Until 2011, the company operated under the name Glimmerglass Opera. The company presented its first season in the summer of 1975, when four performances of ''[[La bohème]]'' were staged in the auditorium of the Cooperstown High School. In the years since, it has grown considerably and now offers more than 40 performances of four operas, nearly always in new productions, each summer.

Operas have been performed in repertory since 1990. For the first seventeen seasons, all operas were sung in English; since 1992 they have, with some exceptions, been performed in their original language with [[Surtitles|projected titles]] in English.

Several works have had their American or world premieres at Glimmerglass; the 1999 season featured the world premiere of ''Central Park'', three one-act operas performed as a single work. The triptych was jointly commissioned by Glimmerglass Opera, New York City Opera, and Thirteen/[[WNET]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]'', which telecast it on [[PBS]] in January 2000. The telecast was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]].

Paul Kellogg was the General Director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1979 to 1996 and the Artistic Director from 1996 to 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=City Opera Appoints a Director|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/12/arts/city-opera-appoints-a-director.html|work=The New York Times|date=1996-01-12|first=Allan|last=Kozinn|authorlink=Allan Kozinn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Paul Kellogg to Retire From New York City Opera and Glimmerglass Posts| url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/2869.html | work=Playbill Arts | date=2005-09-15}}</ref> Esther Nelson took on the role of General Director from 1996 to 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hubarts.com/weblog/2008/08/new-leader-at-t.html|title=New leader at the BLO (Pssst!

The Young American Artists Program, established in 1988, brings singers in the first stages of their professional careers to study and perform at Glimmerglass. These young artists are chosen annually from hundreds of applicants from throughout the United States. In addition to rehearsing and performing, Young Artists receive musical coaching, attend classes in diction and acting, and are given instruction in such non-performing skills as audition techniques, role preparation, and the business aspects of managing a career. Administrators from many of the world's leading opera houses visit Glimmerglass throughout the summer and hear the Young Artists in performance. In the course of the summer each Young Artist gives a solo song recital at venues in Cooperstown and nearby Cherry Valley, a feature of the Glimmerglass season that has become extremely popular with opera patrons and the local community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Glimmerglass Opera Company History |url=https://www.cooperstown.net/glimmerglass/glimhist.html |website=The Cooperstown Network |accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref>

==Alice Busch Opera Theater==
The Glimmerglass Festival's Alice Busch Opera Theater, which opened in June 1987, was built on {{convert|43|acre|0}} of farmland donated by Tom Goodyear, its first chairman. The 914-seat theater<ref>{{cite web|title=ALICE BUSCH OPERA THEATER|url=http://glimmerglass.org/your-visit/glimmerglass/allice-busch-opera-theater/|website=The Glimmerglass Festival|publisher=The Glimmerglass Festival|accessdate=28 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702093354/http://glimmerglass.org/your-visit/glimmerglass/allice-busch-opera-theater/|archive-date=2 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> is notable for its pastoral setting, for being the first American opera house built since 1966, and for its sliding walls, closed only while singers are on-stage and in foul weather. The Theater was designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.

The new theater was built to move the performances from a high school auditorium with poor acoustics and sight lines and no orchestra pit to a building with an interior designed specifically for opera performances. The exterior design was inspired by local farm buildings to fit with the surrounding landscape and to promote a less formal and more relaxed atmosphere suitable for a summer theater. For environmental and cost efficiencies, the building was designed to use only natural ventilation, without any mechanical heating or cooling.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Theater of Architecture|last = Hardy|first = Hugh|publisher = Princeton Architectural Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 185–189}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Open-air opera|last = Anderson|first = Grace|date = 1988|journal = Architectural Record|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 90–93|issue = August}}</ref>
