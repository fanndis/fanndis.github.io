The '''''Seattle Post-Intelligencer''''' (popularly known as the '''''Seattle P-I''''', the '''''Post-Intelligencer''''', or simply the '''''P-I''''') is an [[online newspaper]] and former print newspaper based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States.

The newspaper was founded in 1863 as the weekly '''''Seattle Gazette''''', and was later published daily in [[broadsheet]] format. It was long one of the city's two daily newspapers, along with ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', until it became an online-only publication on March 18, 2009.

==History==
[[File:Seattle P-I final cover20090317.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.74|The front page<br />of the last printed edition<br />of the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'',<br />published on March 17, 2009.]]

J.R. Watson founded the ''Seattle Gazette''', Seattle's first newspaper, on December 10, 1863.<ref name="pi-history">{{cite news |title=Character of P-I's content changed as Seattle grew up |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |url=http://seattlepi.com/facts/pihistory.shtml |accessdate=2007-05-21}}{{dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref name="pi-historylink">{{cite web |title = Intelligencer newspaper founded in Seattle in 1867. |publisher=HistoryLink.org |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2516 |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> The paper failed after a few years and was renamed the ''Weekly Intelligencer'' in 1867 by new owner Sam Maxwell.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Seattle Post-Intelligencer |url=https://blogs.sos.wa.gov/newspapers/index.php/newspaper-profiles/the-seattle-post-intelligencer/ |publisher=[[Washington State Library]] |accessdate=November 21, 2017}}</ref>

In 1878, after publishing the ''Intelligencer'' as a morning daily, printer [[Thaddeus Hanford]] bought the ''Daily Intelligencer'' for $8,000. Hanford also acquired the daily ''[[Puget Sound Dispatch]]'' and the weekly ''Pacific Tribune'' and folded both papers into the ''Intelligencer''. In 1881, the ''Intelligencer'' merged with the ''Seattle Post''. The names were combined to form the present-day name.<ref name="pi-historylink" />

In 1886, Indiana businessman [[Leigh S. J. Hunt]] came to Seattle and purchased the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', which he owned and published until he was forced to sell in the [[Panic of 1893]].<ref name=Historylink8956>{{citation |work=[[HistoryLink.org]] |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8956 |title=Seattle Post-Intelligencer (1863-2009)}}</ref> At this point the newspaper was acquired by attorney and real estate developer [[James D. Hoge]] under whom it was representative of an establishment viewpoint. It was the state's predominant newspaper. Circulation was greatly increased by coverage of the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1897. Hoge who was involved in other business sought to find a buyer and sold in 1899. The newspaper was acquired with assistance from [[James J. Hill]] by [[John L. Wilson]] who had first started the Seattle Klondike Information Bureau. The newspaper was acquired by Hearst in 1921.

Circulation stood at 31,000 in 1911.<ref name="pi-history" /> In 1912, editor Eric W. Allen left the paper to found the [[University of Oregon]] School of Journalism, which he ran until his death in 1944.<ref>{{Oregon Encyclopedia|allen_eric_w_|Eric W. Allen|Floyd J. McKay}}</ref>

[[William Randolph Hearst]] took over the paper in 1921, and the [[Hearst Corporation]] owns the ''P-I'' to this day.<ref name="pi-historylink" />

In 1936, 35 P-I writers and members of [[The Newspaper Guild]] went on [[1936 Seattle Post-Intelligencer strike|three-month strike]] against "arbitrary dismissals and assignment changes and other 'efficiency' moves by the newspaper." The [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] joined the strike in solidarity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historylink.org/File/2495|title=Seattle Post-Intelligencer Newspaper Guild Strike 1936|website=www.historylink.org}}</ref> Roger Simpson and William Ames co-wrote their book ''Unionism or Hearst: the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Strike of 1936'' on the topic.<ref>[http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=SimpsonRogerUA4165.xml Roger A.

[[Anna Roosevelt Halsted]], the daughter of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], began working as the editor of the [[women's page]] at the ''P-I'' after her husband [[Clarence John Boettiger]] took over as publisher in 1936. Boettiger left Seattle to enter the U.S. Army in April 1943, while Anna stayed at the paper to help keep a liberal voice in the running of the paper. After Boettiger's absence, the paper increasingly turned conservative with Hearst's new acting publisher. Anna left Seattle in December 1943 to live in the White House with her youngest child, Johnny. This effectively ended the Roosevelt-Boettiger ties with the ''P-I''.<ref name= "A Love in Shadow by John R. Boettiger" >{{cite book |title=A Love in Shadow |last=Boettiger |first=John |authorlink=John Boettiger |year=1978 |publisher=W. W.

On December 15, 2006, no copies were printed as a result of a power outage caused by the [[December 2006 Pacific Northwest storms]]. It was the first time in 70 years that publication had been suspended.<ref name="dec2006-no-print">{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Lynn |title=With power out, Seattle papers use News Tribune's presses |work=[[The News Tribune]] |date=December 16, 2006 |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6285129p-5482214c.html |accessdate=2007-05-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327184401/http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6285129p-5482214c.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=March 27, 2007}}</ref>

On January 9, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that after losing money on it every year since 2000, Hearst was putting the ''P-I'' up for sale.<ref name="nytimes-2009jan">{{cite news |author=Perez-Pena, Richard |title=Hearst Looks to Sell, or Close, Seattle Paper |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/business/media/10paper.html |date=January 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref><ref name="pi-2009jan9">{{cite news |last1=Richman |first1=Dan |last2=James |first2=Andrea |title=For sale: The P-I |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=January 9, 2009 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/For-sale-The-P-I-1297085.php |accessdate=2017-01-24}}</ref> The paper would be put on the market for 60 days, and if a buyer could not be found within that time, the paper would either be turned into an Internet-only publication with a drastically reduced staff, or closed outright.<ref name="nytimes-2009jan"/><ref name="pi-2009jan9"/> The news of the paper's impending sale was initially broken by local station [[KING-TV]] the night prior to the official announcement, and came as a surprise to the ''P-I''{{'}}s staff and the owners of rival newspaper ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. Analysts did not expect a buyer to be found, in view of declining circulation in the U.S. newspaper industry and other newspapers on the market going unsold.<ref name="nytimes-2009jan"/> Five days before the 60-day deadline, the ''P-I'' reported that the Hearst Corporation had given several ''P-I'' reporters provisional job offers for an online edition of the ''P-I''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Richman, Dan |title=Hearst makes offers to staff online-only P-I |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |url=http://seattlepi.com/business/402470_onlinepi06.html |date=March 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref>

On March 16, 2009, the newspaper posted a headline on its front page, followed shortly after by a short news story, that explained that the following day's edition would be its final one in print.<ref name="pifrontpage">{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Richman |author2=James, Andrea  |title=Seattle P-I to publish last edition Tuesday |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/403793_piclosure17.html |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=March 16, 2009}}</ref> The newspaper's publisher, Roger Oglesby, was quoted saying that the ''P-I'' would continue as an online-only operation. Print subscribers had their subscriptions automatically transferred to ''The Seattle Times'' on March 18.

{{As of |2018}}, the ''P-I'' continues as an online-only newspaper.  In September 2010, the site had an estimated 2.8 million unique visitors and 208,000 visitors per day.<ref>[http://www.quantcast.com/seattlepi.com seattlepi.com "Quantcast Audience Profile"], ''quantcast'', September 2010</ref>

==Joint operating agreement==
From 1983 to 2009, the ''P-I'' and ''The Seattle Times'' had a [[joint operating agreement]] (JOA) whereby [[advertising]], [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], [[marketing]], and circulation were run for both papers by the Seattle Times Company. They maintained separate [[news]] and [[editorial]] departments. The papers published a combined Sunday edition, although the ''Times'' handled the majority of the editorial content while the ''P-I'' only provided a small editorial/opinions section.

In 2003 the ''Times'' tried to cancel the JOA, citing a clause in it that three consecutive years of [[Profit (accounting)|losses]] were cause for cancelling the agreement.<ref name = "JOA">{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Richman |author2=Wong, Brad  |title=Seattle P-I and Times settle legal dispute |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=April 17, 2007 |url=http://seattlepi.com/business/311795_joa17.html |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Hearst disagreed, and immediately filed suit to prevent the ''Times'' from cancelling the agreement. Hearst argued that a ''[[force majeure]]'' clause prevented the ''Times'' from claiming losses in 2000 and 2001 as reason to end the JOA, because they resulted from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven-week newspaper [[Strike action|strike]]).

Each side publicly accused the other of attempting to put its rival out of business. The trial judge granted a summary judgment in Hearst's favor on the ''force majeure'' issue. But after two appeals, the [[state supreme court|Washington State Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the ''Times'' on June 30, 2005, on the ''force majeure'' clause, reversing the trial-court judge.  The two papers settled the issue on April 16, 2007.

The JOA ended in 2009 with the cessation of the ''P-I'' print edition.<ref name="pifrontpage"/>

==Awards==
The ''P-I'' was notable for its two-time [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[editorial cartoonist]], [[David Horsey]].<ref>{{cite news |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |title=David Horsey Bio |url=http://seattlepi.com/horsey/bio.asp |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120043511/http://www.seattlepi.com/horsey/bio.asp |archivedate=November 20, 2008}}</ref>

===Report on Judge Gary Little===
Investigative reporting on [[King County Superior Court]] Judge [[Gary Little]]'s out-of-court contact with juvenile defendants revealed accusations that Little [[Sexual abuse#Child sexual abuse|molested]] young boys while he was a teacher at Seattle's exclusive [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside School]] between 1968 and 1971. It also revealed inappropriate contact between Little and juveniles appearing before him after he became a judge. On August 19, 1988, after reporter Duff Wilson called the judge to advise him the newspaper was publishing the story, Little shot himself in the [[King County Courthouse]]. The [[ethics|ethical debates]] surrounding the publication of the story{{spnd}}and the network of connections that protected Little{{spnd}}are taught in [[journalism]] classes, and led to reforms in the way judges are disciplined in Washington state.

===Conduct Unbecoming series===
In 2006 the ''P-I'' became the subject of a complaint to the [[Washington News Council]] for its reporting on the [[King County, Washington|King County]] [[King County, Washington Sheriff's Office|Sheriff's Office]]. The media watch-dog group ruled against the ''P-I'', agreeing with Sheriff Sue Rahr's complaint that the newspaper had unfairly disparaged the Sheriff's Office.<ref>{{cite news |first=Monica Soto |last=Ouchi |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=October 22, 2006 |title=Council rules against P-I over sheriff's complaint |url=http://seattlepi.com/local/289609_newscouncil23.html |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> The ''P-I'' declined to participate in the proceedings, and opted instead to give a detailed reply on its website.<ref>{{cite news |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=October 23, 2006 |title=Panel: P-I unfair to Sheriff's Office |url=http://seattlepi.com/local/289609_newscouncil23.html |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>

==The P-I Globe==
[[File:Seattle P-I Globe 2 (2014).jpg|thumb|right|The P-I Globe is an official Seattle Landmark.]]
The ''P-I'' is known for the 13.5-ton, {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Neon sign|neon]] globe atop its headquarters on the [[Elliott Bay]] waterfront, which features the words "It's in the P-I" rotating around the globe and an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} eagle perched atop with wings stretched upwards.<ref name="keep globe">{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Lynn |title=Push to keep P-I globe spinning |date=March 22, 2011 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014573105_globe23m.html |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> The globe originated from a 1947 readers' contest to determine a new symbol for the paper.
