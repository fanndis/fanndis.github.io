Straddling the banks of the [[River Isar]] (a [[tributary]] of the [[Danube]]) north of the [[Northern Limestone Alps|Bavarian Alps]], it is the seat of the Bavarian [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]] of [[Upper Bavaria]], while being the [[population density|most densely populated]] municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km<sup>2</sup>). Munich is the second-largest city in the [[Bavarian dialects|Bavarian dialect area]], after the [[Austria]]n capital of [[Vienna]].

The city was first mentioned in 1158. Catholic Munich strongly resisted the [[Reformation]] and was a political point of divergence during the resulting [[Thirty Years' War]], but remained physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant [[Swedes]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ofredsår|last=Englund|first=Peter|publisher=Atlantis|year=1993|isbn=|location=Stockholm|pages=}}</ref> Once Bavaria was established as [[Kingdom of Bavaria|a sovereign kingdom]] in 1806, Munich became a major European centre of arts, architecture, culture and science. In 1918, during the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]], the ruling [[house of Wittelsbach]], which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|socialist republic]] was declared. In the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their "Capital of the Movement". The city was heavily bombed during [[World War II]], but has restored most of its traditional cityscape. After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'', or "economic miracle". The city hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] and was one of the host cities of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]s.

Today, Munich is a global centre of [[art]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[finance]], [[publishing]], [[culture]], [[innovation]], [[education]], [[business]], and [[tourism]] and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey,<ref>{{cite web|title = Quality of Living City Rankings|url = https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Portals/0/Content/Rankings/rankings/qol2018k852147/index.html|accessdate = 28 June 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190404081202/https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Portals/0/Content/Rankings/rankings/qol2018k852147/index.html|archive-date = 4 April 2019|url-status = live}}</ref> and being rated the world's most liveable city by the [[Most livable cities in the world#Monocle's Quality of Life Survey|Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Munich Named The Most Livable City In The World | magazine = [[Forbes]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#5e1cb4886153 | date = 25 June 2018 | accessdate = 2 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180703022046/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2018/06/25/monocle-most-livable-city-quality-life-survey-2018-munich/#5e1cb4886153 | archive-date = 3 July 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> According to the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute]], Munich is considered an [[Global city|alpha-world city]], {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spottedbylocals.com/blog/alpha-beta-and-gamma-cities|title=Alpha, Beta and Gamma cities (updated 2015)|work=Spotted by Locals|date=11 March 2019|access-date=28 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221095224/http://www.spottedbylocals.com/blog/alpha-beta-and-gamma-cities/|archive-date=21 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It is one of the most prosperous<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wiwo.de/finanzen/vorsorge/studie-zum-wohlstand-wo-die-reichsten-und-aermsten-staedte-deutschlands-liegen/24245424.html |title=Wo die reichsten und ärmsten Städte Deutschlands liegen |website=WirtschaftsWoche |language=de |date=2019-04-19 |accessdate=2020-05-19}}</ref> and fastest growing<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/demografie-wo-deutschland-schrumpft-und-wo-es-waechst-a-1261262.html |title=Wo Deutschland schrumpft oder wächst |website=Spiegel Online |language=de |date=2019-04-06 |accessdate=2020-05-19}}</ref> cities in Germany.

===Etymology===
The name of the city is usually interpreted as deriving from the [[Old High German|Old]]/[[Middle High German]] term ''Munichen'', meaning "by the monks". It derives from the monks of the [[Benedictine order]], who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich.<ref>{{cite web |title=Munich |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/munich |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |language=en}}</ref> A monk is also depicted on [[Coat of arms of Munich|the city's coat of arms]].

The town is first mentioned as ''forum apud Munichen'' in the [[:de:Augsburger Schied|Augsburg arbitration]] of June 14, 1158 by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich I]].<ref name="Reitzenstein2006">{{citation|surname1=[[:de:Wolf-Armin von Reitzenstein|Wolf-Armin Freiherr von Reitzenstein]]|title=Lexikon bayerischer Ortsnamen.

}}</ref><ref>''Deutsches Ortsnamenbuch.'' Hrsg. von Manfred Niemeyer. De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2012, S.&nbsp;420.</ref>

The name in modern German is {{lang|de|München|italics=no}}, but this has been variously translated in different languages: in English, French and various other languages as "Munich", in Italian as "Monaco di Baviera", in Portuguese as "Munique".{{refn|A more complete list is available on [https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchen#%C3%9Cbersetzungen Wiktionary].}}

===Roman origins===

The ancient Roman road, Via Julia, which connected Augsburg and Salzburg, crossed over the Isar River south of modern-day Munich, at the towns of Baierbrunn and Gauting.
A Roman settlement north-east of downtown Munich was excavated in the neighborhood of Denning/Bogenhausen.


===Post-Roman settlements===

In the 6th Century and beyond, various ethnic groups, such as the Baiuvarii, populated the area around what is now modern Munich, such as in Johanneskirchen, Bogenhausen and Pasing.
The first known Christian church was built ca. 815 in Fröttmanning.


===Origin of medieval town===
[[File:Stadtansicht 1572.jpg|thumb|left|Munich in the 16th century]]
[[File:Muenchen_merian.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Munich in 1642]]

The first known settlement in the area was of Benedictine monks on the [[Salt road]] between Augsburg and Salzburg, crossing the Isar River. The foundation date is not considered the year 1158, the date the city was first mentioned in a document. The document was signed in [[Augsburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmf.bayern.de/ueber_uns/ausstellung_foyer/muenchner_pfennig/ |title=Ausstellung im Foyer |publisher=Stmf.bayern.de |accessdate=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306014325/http://www.stmf.bayern.de/ueber_uns/ausstellung_foyer/muenchner_pfennig/ |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}</ref> By then, the [[House of Welf|Guelph]] [[Henry the Lion]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Bavaria]], had built a toll bridge over the river Isar next to the monks' settlement and on the salt route. But during the archaeological excavations at Marienhof in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn from 2012, shards of vessels from the 11th century were found, which prove again that the settlement of Munich must be older than their first documentary mention in 1158.

In 1175 Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180 with the trial of Henry the Lion, [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto I Wittelsbach]] became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Bishop of Freising]]. (Wittelsbach's heirs, the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach dynasty]], ruled Bavaria until 1918.) In 1240, Munich was transferred to [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto II Wittelsbach]] and in 1255, when the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of [[Upper Bavaria]].

Duke [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]], a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income. In the late 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of [[Gothic art]]s: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church – the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] – now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.

===Capital of reunited Bavaria===
[[File:Marcktzumuenchen.png|thumb|left|[[Marienplatz]], Munich about 1650]]
[[File:Mun flags frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners with the colours of Munich (left) and Bavaria (right) with the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in the background]]

When Bavaria was reunited in 1506, Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court (see [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlando di Lasso]] and [[Heinrich Schütz]]). During the 16th century, Munich was a centre of the German [[Counter-Reformation|counter reformation]], and also of [[renaissance]] arts. Duke [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Wilhelm V]] commissioned the Jesuit [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]], which became a centre for the counter-reformation, and also built the [[Hofbräuhaus]] for brewing brown beer in 1589. The [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] was founded in Munich in 1609.

In 1623, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Munich became an electoral residence when [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria]] was invested with the [[prince-elector|electoral dignity]], but in 1632 the city was occupied by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolph of Sweden]]. When the [[bubonic plague]] broke out in 1634 and 1635, about one-third of the population died. Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of [[Baroque]] life, but also had to suffer under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] occupations in 1704 and 1742.

In 1806 the city became the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], with the state's parliament (the ''[[Landtag]]'') and the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|archdiocese of Munich and Freising]] being located in the city. 

Munich's annual Beer Festival, Oktoberfest, has its origins from a royal wedding in October 1810. The fields are now part of the 'Theresienwiese' near downtown.

In 1826, [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Landshut University]] was moved to Munich. Many of the city's finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the first three Bavarian kings. Especially [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig I]] rendered outstanding services to Munich's status as a centre of the arts, attracting numerous artists and enhancing the city's architectural substance with grand boulevards and buildings. On the other hand, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]], known the world over as the fairytale king, was mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside. Nevertheless, his patronage of [[Richard Wagner]] secured his posthumous reputation, as do his castles, which still generate significant tourist income for Bavaria. Later, Prince Regent [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]]'s years as regent were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich, enhancing its status as a cultural force of global importance (see [[Franz Stuck|Franz von Stuck]] and [[Der Blaue Reiter]]).

===World War I to World War II===
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_119-1486,_Hitler-Putsch,_München,_Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|Unrest during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]

Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.

After World War I, the city was at the centre of substantial political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of the German revolution, [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]] and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|premier of Bavaria]] [[Kurt Eisner]] in February 1919 by [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley]], the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was proclaimed. When Communists took power, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], who had lived in Munich some years before, sent a congratulatory telegram, but the Soviet Republic was ended on 3 May 1919 by the [[Freikorps]]. While the republican government had been restored, Munich became a hotbed of extremist politics, among which [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] soon rose to prominence.

The roofless [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heilig-Geist-Kirche]] is on the right of the photo. Its spire, without the copper top, is behind the church. The [[Talburgtor|Talbruck gate tower]] is missing completely.]]

In 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt to overthrow the [[Weimar Republic]] and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). The city again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933. The party created its first [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the ''Hauptstadt der Bewegung'' ("Capital of the Movement"). The NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many ''Führerbauten'' ("''Führer'' buildings") were built around the [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]], some of which still survive.

The city was the site where the [[Munich Agreement]] signed between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Third French Republic|France]] with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] as part of the Franco-British policy of [[appeasement]]. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] assented to the German annexation of      [[Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Sudetenland|Sudetenland region]] in the hopes of satisfying Hitler's territorial expansion.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

Munich was the base of the [[White Rose]], a student [[resistance movement]] from June 1942 to February 1943. The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]] by Hans and Sophie Scholl.

The city was heavily damaged by [[Bombing of Munich in World War II|Allied bombing during World War II]], with 71 air raids over five years.

===Postwar===
After US occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname ''Heimliche Hauptstadt'' ("secret capital") in the decades after World War II.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

Since 1963, Munich has been the host city for [[Munich Security Conference|annual conferences on international security policy]].

Munich was the site of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], during which 11 [[Israel|Israeli]] athletes were murdered by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorists in the [[Munich massacre]], when gunmen from the Palestinian "[[Black September (group)|Black September]]" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Mass murders also occurred in Munich [[Oktoberfest bombing|in 1980]] [[2016 Munich shooting|and 2016]].

Most Munich residents enjoy a high quality of life.

==Geography==<!-- This section has many images -->

===Topography===
[[File:Vista panorámica desde Olympiapark, Múnich, Alemania 2012-04-28, DD 03.JPG|thumb|[[Alps]] behind the skyline of Munich]]
Munich lies on the elevated plains of [[Upper Bavaria]], about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the northern edge of the [[Alps]], at an altitude of about {{convert|520|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]]. The local rivers are the [[Isar]] and the [[Würm]].
Munich is situated in the Northern [[Foothills|Alpine Foreland]]. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile [[flint]] area which is no longer affected by the [[fold (geology)|folding]] processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with [[moraine|morainic]] hills. Between these are fields of [[fluvio-glacial]] out-wash, such as around Munich. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the [[Groundwater|ground water]] can permeate the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to [[marsh]]es as in the north of Munich.

===Climate===
By [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]] templates and updated data the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] (''Cfb''), independent of the isotherm but with some [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb'') features like warm to hot summers and cold winters, but without permanent snow cover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=66801&cityname=Munich,+Bavaria,+Germany&units=metric|title=Munich, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020130/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=66801&cityname=Munich,+Bavaria,+Germany&units=metric|archive-date=7 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RUfAAAAQBAJ&q=-3+%C2%B0c+snow+cover+continental+climate&pg=PA50|title=The European Culture Area: A Systematic Geography|last1=Jordan-Bychkov|first1=Terry G.|last2=Jordan|first2=Bella Bychkova|last3=Murphy|first3=Alexander B.|date=2008-08-28|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742579064|language=en}}</ref> The proximity to the [[Alps]] brings higher volumes of rainfall and consequently greater susceptibility to [[flood]] problems.

The city center lies between both climates, while the [[Munich Airport|airport of Munich]] has a [[humid continental climate]]. The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.

Showers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in July, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.

The higher elevation and proximity to the Alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps ([[föhn wind]]), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.

Being at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.

At Munich's official [[weather station]]s, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are {{convert|37.5|C|F|0}}, on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and {{convert|-31.6|C|F|1}}, on 12 February 1929 in Botanic Garden of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel2|title=Extremwertetafel (München-Riem)|website=SKlima.de|access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sklima.de/datenbank/monat_extrem.php|title=Extremwertetafel (München-Botanischer Garten)|website=SKlima.de|access-date=February 12, 2019}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel Alt URL]</ref><!-- The archiving was done in addition to preserving the data facilitate access, since it only works by filling out the form of the site, without direct access to it.

==== Climate change ====
In Munich the general trend of [[global warming]] with a rise of medium yearly temperatures of about 1 °C in Germany over the last 120 years can be observed as well. In November 2016 the city council concluded officially that a further rise in medium temperature, a higher number of heat extremes, a rise in the number of hot days and nights with temperatures higher than 20 °C ([[Tropical night|tropical nights]]), a change in [[Precipitation|precipitation patterns]], as well as a rise in the number of local instances of heavy [[rain]], is to be expected as part of the ongoing climate change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anpassung an den Klimawandel|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Referat-fuer-Gesundheit-und-Umwelt/Stadtklima/Anpassung_an_Klimawandel.html|format=|access-date=|last=Landeshauptstadt München Redaktion|date=|year=|language=de|pages=|quote=}}</ref> The city administration decided to support a joint study from its own Referat für Gesundheit und Umwelt (department for health and environmental issues) and the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Meteorological Service]] that will gather data on local weather. The data is supposed to be used to create a plan for action for adapting the city to better deal with climate change as well as an integrated action program for climate protection in Munich. With the help of those programs issues regarding [[spatial planning]] and settlement density, the development of buildings and green spaces as well as plans for functioning ventilation in a cityscape can be monitored and managed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stadtklima und Klimawandel|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Referat-fuer-Gesundheit-und-Umwelt/Stadtklima/DWD.html|format=|access-date=|last=Landeshauptstadt München Redaktion|date=|year=|language=de|pages=|quote=}}</ref>

About 45% of Munich's residents are not affiliated with any religious group; this ratio represents the fastest growing segment of the population. As in the rest of Germany, the Catholic and Protestant churches have experienced a continuous decline in membership.

== Politics ==
[[File:Bayerische Staatskanzlei Munich 2014 02.jpg|thumb|[[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|Bavarian State Chancellery]]]]
As the capital of Bavaria, Munich is an important political centre for both the state and country as a whole. It is the seat of the [[Landtag of Bavaria]], the [[Bayerische Staatskanzlei|State Chancellery]], and all state departments. Several national and international authorities are located in Munich, including the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany]] and the [[European Patent Office]].

=== Mayor ===
The current mayor of Munich is [[Dieter Reiter]] of the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), who was elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2020. Munich has a much stronger left-wing tradition than the rest of the state, which has been dominated by the conservative [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CSU) on a federal, state, and local level since the establishment of the Federal Republic in 1949. Munich, by contrast, has been governed by the SPD for all but six years since 1948. As of the 2020 local elections, green and centre-left parties also hold a majority in the city council (''Stadtrat'').

The most recent mayoral election was held on 15 March 2020, with a runoff held on 29 March, and the results were as follows:

===Subdivisions===
{{Main|Boroughs of Munich}}
[[File:Stadtbezirke Lage in München.png|thumb|right|Munich's Boroughs]]

Since the administrative reform in 1992, Munich is divided into 25 [[borough]]s or ''Stadtbezirke'', which themselves consist of smaller quarters.

[[Allach-Untermenzing]] (23), [[Altstadt-Lehel]] (1), [[Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied]]  (22), [[Au-Haidhausen]]  (5), [[Berg am Laim]] (14), [[Bogenhausen]]  (13), [[Feldmoching-Hasenbergl]]  (24), [[Hadern]]  (20), [[Laim]] (25), [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]] (2), [[Maxvorstadt]] (3), [[Milbertshofen-Am Hart]] (11), [[Moosach (District of Munich)|Moosach]] (10), [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg]]  (9), [[Obergiesing]]  (17), [[Pasing-Obermenzing]] (21), [[Ramersdorf-Perlach]] (16), [[Schwabing-Freimann]] (12), [[Schwabing-West]] (4), [[Schwanthalerhöhe]] (8), [[Sendling]] (6), [[Sendling-Westpark]]  (7), [[Thalkirchen-Obersendling-Forstenried-Fürstenried-Solln]] (19), [[Trudering-Riem]] (15) and [[Untergiesing-Harlaching]]  (18).

The city has an eclectic mix of historic and modern architecture, because historic buildings destroyed in World War II were reconstructed, and new landmarks were built. A survey by the Society's Centre for Sustainable Destinations for the [[National Geographic Traveller]] chose over 100 historic destinations around the world and ranked Munich 30th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/list-text |title=Best 110 historic places worldwide |publisher=Traveler.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=14 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027093556/http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/list-text |archive-date=27 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Inner city===
[[File:Gierymski Aleksander-Ulica nocą.jpg|thumb|Wittelsbach Square at night, 1890, by Gierymski Aleksander]]
At the centre of the city is the [[Marienplatz]] – a large open square named after the [[Mariensäule]], a [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian column]] in its centre – with the [[Old Town Hall, Munich|Old]] and the [[New Town Hall, Munich|New Town Hall]]. Its tower contains the [[Rathaus-Glockenspiel]]. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive – the [[Isartor]] in the east, the [[Sendlinger Tor]] in the south and the [[Karlstor]] in the west of the inner city. The Karlstor leads up to the [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)|Stachus]], a square dominated by the [[Justizpalast (Munich)|Justizpalast]] (Palace of Justice) and a fountain.

The [[St. Peter's Church, Munich|Peterskirche]] close to Marienplatz is the oldest church of the inner city. It was first built during the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period, and was the focus of the early monastic settlement in Munich before the city's official foundation in 1158. Nearby St. Peter the Gothic hall-church [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heiliggeistkirche]] (The Church of the Holy Spirit) was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the [[Viktualienmarkt]].

The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] serves as the cathedral for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising]]. The nearby [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]] is the largest [[renaissance]] church north of the Alps, while the [[Theatine Church, Munich|Theatinerkirche]] is a [[basilica]] in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on Southern German [[baroque]] architecture. Its dome dominates the [[Odeonsplatz]]. Other baroque churches in the inner city include the [[Bürgersaalkirche (Munich)|Bürgersaalkirche]], the [[Trinity Church (Munich)|Trinity Church]] and the [[St. Anna Damenstiftskirche (Munich)|St. Anna Damenstiftskirche]]. The [[Asamkirche, Munich|Asamkirche]] was endowed and built by the Brothers [[Cosmas Damian Asam|Asam]], pioneering artists of the rococo period.

The large [[Munich Residenz|Residenz]] palace complex (begun in 1385) on the edge of Munich's Old Town, Germany's largest urban palace, ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Having undergone several extensions, it contains also the treasury and the splendid rococo [[Cuvilliés Theatre]]. Next door to the Residenz the neo-classical opera, the [[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]] was erected. Among the baroque and neoclassical mansions which still exist in Munich are the [[Palais Porcia]], the [[Palais Preysing]], the [[Palais Holnstein]] and the [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. All mansions are situated close to the Residenz, same as the [[Alter Hof|Alte Hof]], a medieval castle and first residence of the Wittelsbach dukes in Munich.

Lehel, a middle-class quarter east of the Altstadt, is characterised by numerous well-preserved townhouses. The [[Parish Church of St. Anna (Lehel, Munich)|St. Anna im Lehel]] is the first [[rococo]] church in Bavaria. [[St. Luke's Church, Munich|St. Lukas]] is the largest Protestant Church in Munich.

===Royal avenues and squares===
[[File:LudwigstraßeMUC.jpg|thumb|[[Ludwigstraße (Munich)|Ludwigstraße]] from above, [[Highlight Towers]] in the background]]

Four grand royal avenues of the 19th century with official buildings connect Munich's inner city with its then-suburbs:

The neoclassical [[Brienner Straße (Munich)|Brienner Straße]], starting at [[Odeonsplatz]] on the northern fringe of the Old Town close to the Residenz, runs from east to west and opens into the [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]], designed with the "[[Doric order|Doric]]" [[Propylaea (Munich)|Propyläen]], the "[[Ionic order|Ionic]]" [[Glyptothek]] and the "[[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]" [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|State Museum of Classical Art]], behind it [[St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich|St. Boniface's Abbey]] was erected. The area around Königsplatz is home to the [[Kunstareal]], Munich's gallery and museum quarter (as described [[Munich#Museums|below]]).

[[Ludwigstraße (Munich)|Ludwigstraße]] also begins at [[Odeonsplatz]] and runs from south to north, skirting the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]], the [[Ludwigskirche (Munich)|St. Louis church]], the [[Bavarian State Library]] and numerous state ministries and palaces. The southern part of the avenue was constructed in Italian renaissance style, while the north is strongly influenced by Italian Romanesque architecture. The
[[Siegestor]] (gate of victory) sits at the northern end of Ludwigstraße, where the latter passes over into Leopoldstraße and the district of [[Schwabing]] begins.
[[File:Königsplatz - Propyläen und Glyptothek.jpg|thumb|[[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]]]]

The neo-Gothic [[Maximilianstraße (Munich)|Maximilianstraße]] starts at [[Max-Joseph-Platz]], where the Residenz and the National Theatre are situated, and runs from west to east. The avenue is framed by elaborately structured neo-Gothic buildings which house, among others, the [[Munich Kammerspiele|Schauspielhaus]], the Building of the district government of Upper Bavaria and the [[State Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology]]. After crossing the river Isar, the avenue circles the [[Maximilianeum]], which houses the [[Landtag of Bavaria|state parliament]]. The western portion of Maximilianstraße is known for its designer shops, luxury boutiques, jewellery stores, and one of Munich's foremost five-star hotels, the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten.

[[Prinzregentenstraße (Munich)|Prinzregentenstraße]] runs parallel to Maximilianstraße and begins at [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. Many museums are on the avenue, such as the [[Haus der Kunst]], the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and the [[Schackgalerie]]. The avenue crosses the Isar and circles the [[Angel of Peace|Friedensengel]] monument, then passing the [[Villa Stuck]] and Hitler's old apartment. The [[Prinzregententheater]] is at Prinzregentenplatz further to the east.

===Other boroughs===
[[File:Leopoldstraße_153_(München-Schwabing).JPG|thumb|Building in Schwabing]]
In [[Schwabing]] and [[Maxvorstadt]], many beautiful streets with continuous rows of [[Gründerzeit]] buildings can be found. Rows of elegant town houses and spectacular urban palais in many colours, often elaborately decorated with ornamental details on their façades, make up large parts of the areas west of [[Leopoldstraße]] (Schwabing's main shopping street), while in the eastern areas between Leopoldstraße and [[Englischer Garten]] similar buildings alternate with almost rural-looking houses and whimsical mini-castles, often decorated with small towers. Numerous tiny alleys and shady lanes connect the larger streets and little plazas of the area, conveying the legendary artist's quarter's flair and atmosphere convincingly like it was at the turn of the 20th century. The wealthy district of [[Bogenhausen]] in the east of Munich is another little-known area (at least among tourists) rich in extravagant architecture, especially around Prinzregentenstraße. One of Bogenhausen's most beautiful buildings is [[Villa Stuck]], famed residence of painter [[Franz von Stuck]].
[[File:Image-Schloss Nymphenburg Munich CC edit3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Nymphenburg Palace]]]]
Two large baroque palaces in [[Nymphenburg]] and [[Oberschleissheim]] are reminders of Bavaria's royal past. Schloss Nymphenburg ([[Nymphenburg Palace]]), some {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} north west of the city centre, is surrounded by an park and is considered{{by whom|date=December 2019}} to be one of Europe's most beautiful royal residences. {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Nymphenburg Palace is Schloss Blutenburg ([[Blutenburg Castle]]), an old ducal country seat with a late-Gothic palace church. Schloss Fürstenried ([[Fürstenried Palace]]), a baroque palace of similar structure to Nymphenburg but of much smaller size, was erected around the same time in the south west of Munich.

[[File:Schloss oberschleissheim-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|325x325px|[[Schleissheim Palace]]]]

The second large baroque residence is Schloss Schleissheim ([[Schleissheim Palace]]), located in the suburb of [[Oberschleißheim|Oberschleissheim]], a palace complex encompassing three separate residences: Altes Schloss Schleissheim (the old palace), Neues Schloss Schleissheim (the new palace) and Schloss Lustheim (Lustheim Palace). Most parts of the palace complex serve as museums and art galleries. [[Deutsches Museum]]'s Flugwerft Schleissheim flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleissheim Special Landing Field. The [[Bavaria statue]] before the neo-classical [[Ruhmeshalle (Munich)|Ruhmeshalle]] is a monumental, bronze sand-cast 19th-century statue at [[Theresienwiese]]. The [[Grünwald castle]] is the only medieval castle in the Munich area which still exists.
[[File:BMW Vierzylinder Tower Munich 2014 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[BMW Headquarters]]]]

[[St Michael in Berg am Laim (Munich)|St Michael in Berg am Laim]] is a church in the suburbs. Another church of [[Johann Michael Fischer]] is St George in Bogenhausen. Most of the boroughs have parish churches which originate from the Middle Ages, such as the church of pilgrimage [[St. Mary's Church, Ramersdorf|St Mary in Ramersdorf]]. The oldest church within the city borders is [[Holy Cross Church, Munich|Heilig Kreuz]] in Fröttmaning next to the Allianz-Arena, known for its Romanesque fresco.

Especially in its suburbs, Munich features a wide and diverse array of modern architecture, although strict culturally sensitive height limitations for buildings have limited the construction of skyscrapers to avoid a loss of views to the distant Bavarian Alps. Most high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the [[Hypo-Haus]], the [[Arabella High-Rise Building]], the [[Highlight Towers]], [[Uptown Munich]], Münchner Tor and the [[BMW Headquarters]] next to the [[Olympiapark (Munich)|Olympic Park]]. Several other high-rise buildings are located near the city centre and on the [[Siemens]] campus in southern Munich. A landmark of modern Munich is also the architecture of the sport stadiums (as described [[Munich#Sports|below]]).

In Fasangarten is the former [[McGraw Kaserne]], a former US army base, near [[Stadelheim Prison]].

===Parks===
[[File:München Hofgartentempel.jpg|thumb|Hofgarten with the dome of the state chancellery near the [[Munich Residenz|Residenz]]]]
Munich is a densely-built city but has numerous public parks. The [[Englischer Garten]], close to the city centre and covering an area of {{convert|3.7|km²|1|abbr=on}}, is larger than Central Park in New York City, and is one of the world's largest urban public parks. It contains a [[Naturism|naturist]] (nudist) area, numerous bicycle and jogging tracks as well as bridle-paths. It was designed and laid out by [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count Rumford, both for pleasure and as a work area for the city's vagrants and homeless. Nowadays it is entirely a park, its southern half being dominated by wide open areas, hills, monuments and beach-like stretches (along the streams Eisbach and Schwabinger Bach). In contrast, its less-frequented northern part is much quieter, with many old trees and thick undergrowth. Multiple [[beer garden]]s can be found in both parts of the Englischer Garten, the most well known being located at the [[Englischer Garten#Chinese Tower|Chinese Pagoda]].

Other large green spaces are the modern [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympiapark]], the [[Westpark (Munich)|Westpark]], and the parks of [[Nymphenburg Palace]] (with the [[Botanischer Garten München-Nymphenburg]] to the north), and [[Schleissheim Palace]]. The city's oldest park is the [[Hofgarten (Munich)|Hofgarten]], near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th century. The site of the largest beer garden in town, the former royal Hirschgarten was founded in 1780 for deer, which still live there.

The city's [[zoo]] is the [[Tierpark Hellabrunn]] near the Flaucher Island in the Isar in the south of the city. Another notable park is [[Ostpark (Munich)|Ostpark]] located in the [[Ramersdorf-Perlach]] borough which also houses the Michaelibad, the largest water park in Munich.

===Football===
{{Main|Football in Munich}}
Munich is home to several professional [[Association football|football]] teams including [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Germany's most successful club and a multiple [[UEFA Champions League]] winner. Other notable clubs include [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], who were long time their rivals on a somewhat equal footing, but currently play in the 3rd Division [[3. Liga]] along with another former Bundesliga club [[SpVgg Unterhaching]].

===Basketball===
[[FC Bayern Munich (basketball)|FC Bayern Munich Basketball]] is currently playing in the Beko Basket Bundesliga. The city hosted the final stages of the FIBA [[EuroBasket 1993]], where the [[German national basketball team]] won the gold medal.

===Olympics===

Munich hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; the [[Munich massacre|Munich Massacre]] took place in the [[Olympic Village, Munich|Olympic village]]. It was one of the host cities for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 Football World Cup]], which was not held in Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]], but in a new [[Soccer-specific stadium|football specific stadium]], the [[Allianz Arena]]. Munich bid to host the [[2018 Winter Olympic Games]], but lost to [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympia 2018 in Südkorea, München chancenlos|url=https://www.welt.de/sport/article13471894/Olympia-2018-in-Suedkorea-Muenchen-chancenlos.html|accessdate=6 July 2011|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|date=6 July 2011|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709030938/http://www.welt.de/sport/article13471894/Olympia-2018-in-Suedkorea-Muenchen-chancenlos.html|archive-date=9 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2011 the [[DOSB]] President [[Thomas Bach]] confirmed that Munich would bid again for the Winter Olympics in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamesbids.com/eng/winter-olympic-bids/future-winter-bids/munich-to-bid-once-again/|title=Munich To Bid Once Again|date=27 September 2011|publisher=Games Bids|accessdate=12 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008083258/http://gamesbids.com/eng/winter-olympic-bids/future-winter-bids/munich-to-bid-once-again/|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===River surfing===
Munich has a reputation as a surfing hotspot, offering the world's best known [[river surfing]] spot, the [[Eisbach (Isar)|Eisbach]] wave, which is located at the southern edge of the [[Englischer Garten]] park and used by surfers day and night and throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=River Surfing Spots: Eisbach|url=http://riverbreak.com/spots/eisbach-river-surfing-munich/|accessdate=7 August 2016|publisher=Riverbreak: The International River Surf Magazine|author=Riverbreak Editorial Team|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806121404/http://riverbreak.com/spots/eisbach-river-surfing-munich/|archive-date=6 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Half a kilometre down the river, there is a second, easier wave for beginners, the so-called Kleine Eisbachwelle.

==Culture==

===Language===
{{Main|Bavarian language}}
The [[Bavarian dialects]] are spoken in and around Munich, with its variety West Middle Bavarian or Old Bavarian (''Westmittelbairisch'' / ''Altbairisch''). Austro-Bavarian has no official status by the Bavarian authorities or local government, yet is recognised by the [[SIL International|SIL]] and has its own ISO-639 code.

===Museums===
[[File:Deutsches Museum in the Evening.JPG|thumb|right|[[Deutsches Museum]]]]

[[File:Bayerisches Nationalmuseum - Muenchen - 2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bavarian National Museum]]]]
The [[Deutsches Museum]] or German Museum, located on an island in the River Isar, is the largest and one of the oldest science museums in the world. Three redundant exhibition buildings that are under a protection order were converted to house the Verkehrsmuseum, which houses the land transport collections of the Deutsches Museum. Deutsches Museum's Flugwerft Schleissheim flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleissheim Special Landing Field. Several non-centralised museums (many of those are public collections at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität) show the expanded state collections of [[Paläontologisches Museum München|palaeontology]], geology, [[mineralogy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~Mineralogische.Staatssammlung/ |title=Museum Reich der Kristalle München |publisher=Lrz-muenchen.de |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415161904/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~Mineralogische.Staatssammlung/ |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref> [[Zoologische Staatssammlung München|zoology]], botany and anthropology.

The city has several important [[art museum|art galleries]], most of which can be found in the [[Kunstareal]], including the [[Alte Pinakothek]], the [[Neue Pinakothek]], the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] and the [[Museum Brandhorst]]. The Alte Pinakothek contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two floors. Major displays include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s Christ-like [[Self-Portrait (Dürer, Munich)|''Self-Portrait'' (1500)]], his ''[[The Four Apostles|Four Apostles]]'', [[Raphael]]'s paintings'' [[Canigiani Holy Family (Raphael)|The Canigiani Holy Family]]'' and'' [[Tempi Madonna (Raphael)|Madonna Tempi]]'' as well as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] large ''Judgment Day''. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The [[Lenbachhaus]] houses works by the group of Munich-based modernist artists known as [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider). 
[[File:BMW Welt, Múnich, Alemania16.jpg|thumbnail| [[BMW Welt]] ]]
An important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the [[Glyptothek]] and the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|Staatliche Antikensammlung]] (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such pieces as the [[Medusa Rondanini]], the [[Barberini Faun]] and figures from the [[Temple of Aphaea]] on [[Aegina]] for the Glyptothek. Another important museum in the [[Kunstareal]] is the [[Staatliche Sammlung für Ägyptische Kunst|Egyptian Museum]].

The gothic [[Morris dance]]rs of [[Erasmus Grasser]] are exhibited in the [[Munich Stadtmuseum|Munich City Museum]] in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.

Another area for the arts next to the Kunstareal is the [[Altstadt-Lehel|Lehel]] quarter between the old town and the river Isar: the [[Museum Five Continents]] in Maximilianstraße is the second largest collection in Germany of artefacts and objects from outside Europe, while the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and the adjoining [[Bavarian State Archaeological Collection]] in Prinzregentenstraße rank among Europe's major art and cultural history museums. The nearby [[Schackgalerie]] is an important gallery of German 19th-century paintings.

The former [[Dachau concentration camp]] is {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city.

===Arts and literature===
[[File:Nationaltheater München 2.jpg|thumb|[[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]]]]
Munich is a major international cultural centre and has played host to many prominent composers including [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlando di Lasso]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A. Mozart]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Max Reger]] and [[Carl Orff]]. With the [[Munich Biennale]] founded by [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the ''[[A*Devantgarde|A*DEvantgarde]]'' festival, the city still contributes to modern music theatre. Some of classical music's best-known pieces have been created in and around Munich by composers born in the area, for example, Richard Strauss's tone poem ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' or Carl Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana]]''.

At the [[National Theatre Munich|Nationaltheater]] several of [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas were premiered under the patronage of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. It is the home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] and the [[Bavarian State Orchestra]]. Next door, the modern [[Residenz Theatre]] was erected in the building that had housed the [[Cuvilliés Theatre]] before World War II. Many operas were staged there, including the premiere of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Idomeneo]]'' in 1781. The [[Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz|Gärtnerplatz Theatre]] is a ballet and musical state theatre while another opera house, the [[Prinzregententheater]], has become the home of the Bavarian Theatre Academy and the [[Munich Chamber Orchestra]].

[[File:Gasteig_Philharmonie_14.jpg|thumb|[[Gasteig]]]]
The modern [[Gasteig]] centre houses the [[Munich Philharmonic|Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. Its primary concert venue is the Herkulessaal in the former city royal residence, the [[Munich Residenz]]. Many important conductors have been attracted by the city's orchestras, including [[Felix Weingartner]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Sergiu Celibidache]], [[James Levine]], [[Christian Thielemann]], [[Lorin Maazel]], [[Rafael Kubelík]], [[Eugen Jochum]], Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Mariss Jansons]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Zubin Mehta]] and [[Kent Nagano]]. A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the [[Deutsches Theater München|Deutsche Theater]]. It is Germany's largest theatre for guest performances.
[[File:FriedensengelMunchen.JPG|thumb|The Golden Friedensengel]]

Munich's contributions to modern popular music are often overlooked in favour of its strong association with classical music, but they are numerous: the city has had a strong music scene in the 1960s and 1970s, with many internationally renowned bands and musicians frequently performing in its clubs. Furthermore, Munich was the centre of [[Krautrock]] in southern Germany, with many important bands such as [[Amon Düül II]], [[Embryo (band)|Embryo]] or [[Popol Vuh (band)|Popol Vuh]] hailing from the city. In the 1970s, the [[Musicland Studios]] developed into one of the most prominent recording studios in the world, with bands such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Deep Purple]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] recording albums there. Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer [[Giorgio Moroder]], who invented [[synth]] [[disco]] and [[electronic dance music]], and [[Donna Summer]], one of disco music's most important performers, both living and working in the city. In the late 1990s, [[Electroclash]] was substantially co-invented if not even invented in Munich, when [[DJ Hell]] introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]] label here.<ref name="mjunikdisco"/> Other examples of notable musicians and bands from Munich are [[Konstantin Wecker]], [[:de:Willy Astor|Willy Astor]], [[Spider Murphy Gang]], [[Münchener Freiheit]], [[Lou Bega]], [[Megaherz]], [[FSK (band)|FSK]], [[Colour Haze]] and [[Sportfreunde Stiller]].

Music is so important in the Bavarian capital that the city hall gives permissions every day to ten musicians for performing in the streets around Marienplatz. This is how performers such as [[Olga Kholodnaya]] and [[Alex Jacobowitz]] are entertaining the locals and the tourists every day.

Next to the Bavarian Staatsschauspiel in the Residenz Theatre (Residenztheater), the [[Munich Kammerspiele]] in the Schauspielhaus is one of the most important German language theatres in the world. Since [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich such as [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].

The city is known as the second largest publishing centre in the world (around 250 publishing houses have offices in the city), and many national and international publications are published in Munich, such as Arts in Munich, LAXMag and Prinz.

[[File:Vassily_Kandinsky,_1908_-_Houses_in_Munich.jpg|thumb|[[Vassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Houses in Munich'' (1908)]]
At the turn of the 20th century, Munich, and especially its suburb of [[Schwabing]], was the preeminent cultural metropolis of Germany. Its importance as a centre for both literature and the fine arts was second to none in Europe, with numerous German and non-German artists moving there. For example, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] chose Munich over Paris to study at the [[Akademie der Bildenden Künste München]], and, along with many other painters and writers living in Schwabing at that time, had a profound influence on [[modern art]].

Prominent literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final decades of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the so-called ''Prinzregentenzeit'' (literally "prince regent's time") under the reign of [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria]], a period often described as a cultural Golden Age for both Munich and Bavaria as a whole. Among them were luminaries such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Paul Johann Ludwig von Heyse|Paul Heyse]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Ludwig Thoma]], [[Fanny zu Reventlow]], [[Oskar Panizza]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Max Halbe]], [[Erich Mühsam]] and [[Frank Wedekind]]. For a short while, [[Vladimir Lenin]] lived in Schwabing, where he wrote and published his most important work, ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene (although they were actually often located in the nearby Maxvorstadt quarter) were ''Künstlerlokale'' (artist's cafés) like [[Café Stefanie]] or Kabarett [[Simpl (Munich)|Simpl]], whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from Munich's more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day (although with little relevance to the city's contemporary art scene), was named after Munich's anti-authoritarian satirical magazine ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', founded in 1896 by [[Albert Langen]] and [[Thomas Theodor Heine]], which quickly became an important organ of the ''Schwabinger Bohème''. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelmine]] German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from Munich and elsewhere.

[[File:Schrimpf_oskar_maria_graf.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Oskar Maria Graf]] by [[Georg Schrimpf]] (1927)]]
The period immediately before World War I saw continued economic and cultural prominence for the city. [[Thomas Mann]] wrote in his novella ''Gladius Dei'' about this period: "München leuchtete" (literally "Munich shone"). Munich remained a centre of cultural life during the Weimar period, with figures such as [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Peter Paul Althaus]], [[Stefan George]], [[Ricarda Huch]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]], [[Oskar Maria Graf]], [[Annette Kolb]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Klaus Mann]] adding to the already established big names. [[Karl Valentin]] was Germany's most important cabaret performer and comedian and is to this day well-remembered and beloved as a [[cultural icon]] of his hometown. Between 1910 and 1940, he wrote and performed in many absurdist sketches and short films that were highly influential, earning him the nickname of "Charlie Chaplin of Germany". Many of Valentin's works wouldn't be imaginable without his congenial female partner [[Liesl Karlstadt]], who often played male characters to hilarious effect in their sketches. After World War II, Munich soon again became a focal point of the German literary scene and remains so to this day, with writers as diverse as [[Wolfgang Koeppen]], [[Erich Kästner]], [[Eugen Roth]], [[Alfred Andersch]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], [[Michael Ende]], [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]], [[Gerhard Polt]], [[John Vincent Palatine]] and [[Patrick Süskind]] calling the city their home.

From the Gothic to the Baroque era, the fine arts were represented in Munich by artists like [[Erasmus Grasser]], [[Jan Polack]], [[Johann Baptist Straub]], [[Ignaz Günther]], [[Hans Krumpper]], [[Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler|Ludwig von Schwanthaler]], [[Cosmas Damian Asam]], [[Egid Quirin Asam]], [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], [[Johann Michael Fischer]] and [[François de Cuvilliés]]. Munich had already become an important place for painters like [[Carl Rottmann]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Wilhelm von Kaulbach]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Franz Stuck|Franz von Stuck]], [[Karl Piloty]] and [[Wilhelm Leibl]] when [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), a group of expressionist artists, was established in Munich in 1911. The city was home to the Blue Rider's painters [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Gabriele Münter]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]] and [[Alfred Kubin]]. Kandinsky's first abstract painting was created in Schwabing.

Munich was (and in some cases, still is) home to many of the most important authors of the [[New German Cinema]] movement, including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Edgar Reitz]] and [[Herbert Achternbusch]]. In 1971, the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]] was founded, cementing the city's role in the movement's history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder's films, among them ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''. The Hotel [[Deutsche Eiche]] near Gärtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his "clan" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the most important artistic movement in German cinema history since the era of [[German Expressionism]] in the 1920s.

[[File:Bavaria_Film-_und_Fernsehstudios_logo.svg|thumb|Logo of [[Bavaria Film]]]]
In 1919, the [[Bavaria Film Studios]] were founded, which developed into one of Europe's largest film studios. Directors like [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Huston]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Fritz Umgelter]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and [[Wim Wenders]] made films there. Among the internationally well-known films produced at the studios are ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925) by Alfred Hitchcock, ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) by [[John Sturges]], ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) by Stanley Kubrick, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971) by [[Mel Stuart]] and both ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Neverending Story (film)|The Neverending Story]]'' (1984) by [[Wolfgang Petersen]]. Munich remains one of the centres of the German film and entertainment industry.

The experimental game was invented in Munich in the 1970s and has since spread to other countries like Egypt and China.

===Cultural history trails and bicycle routes===
Since 2001, historically interesting places in Munich can be explored via the [[List of cultural history trails in Munich|cultural history trails]] (''KulturGeschichtsPfade''). Sign-posted cycle routes are the Outer ''Äußere Radlring'' (outer cycle route) and the ''RadlRing München''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kulturreferat/Stadtgeschichte/Kulturgeschichtspfade.html | title=Münchens Stadtbezirke entdecken | author= | date= | website= | publisher=Landeshauptstadt München | language=German | accessdate=22 October 2020}}</ref>

===Culinary specialities===
[[File:Weisswurst.jpg|thumb|[[Weisswurst]] with sweet mustard and a pretzel]]
The Munich cuisine contributes to the [[Bavarian cuisine]]. Münchner [[Weisswurst]] ("white sausage") was invented here in 1857. It is a Munich speciality. Traditionally eaten only before noon – a tradition dating to a time before refrigerators – these morsels are often served with [[sweet mustard]] and freshly baked [[pretzel]]s.

===Beers and breweries===
[[File:BIER IM EG.jpg|thumb|left|[[Helles]] beer]]
[[File:MUC Westend AugustinerbrauereiA.jpg|thumb|[[Augustiner-Bräu|Augustiner brewery]]]]
Munich is known for its breweries and the ''[[Weissbier]]'' (or ''Weißbier'' / ''Weizenbier'', wheat beer) is a speciality from Bavaria. [[Helles]], a [[pale lager]] with a translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it's not old (only introduced in 1895) and is the result of a change in beer tastes. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, [[Dunkel|Dunkles]], which gets its colour from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century, but it is now more of a speciality. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with 6%–9% alcohol content. It is dark amber in colour and has a heavy malty taste. It is available and is sold particularly during the Lenten ''Starkbierzeit'' (strong beer season), which begins on or before St. Joseph's Day (19 March). The beer served at [[Oktoberfest]] is a special type of Märzen beer with a higher alcohol content than regular Helles.
[[File:Biergarten_at_Night_2.JPG|thumb|left|Beer garden in Munich]]
There are countless ''Wirtshäuser'' (traditional Bavarian ale houses/restaurants) all over the city area, many of which also have small outside areas. ''Biergärten'' ([[beer garden]]s) are popular fixtures of Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture and serve as a kind of melting pot for members of all walks of life, for locals, expatriates and tourists alike. It is allowed to bring one's own food to a beer garden, however, it is forbidden to bring one's own drinks. There are many smaller beer gardens and around twenty major ones, providing at least a thousand seats, with four of the largest in the [[Englischer Garten]]: Chinesischer Turm (Munich's second largest beer garden with 7,000 seats), Seehaus, Hirschau and Aumeister. Nockherberg, Hofbräukeller (not to be confused with the [[Hofbräuhaus]]) and Löwenbräukeller are other beer gardens. Hirschgarten is the largest beer garden in the world, with 8,000 seats.

There are six main breweries in Munich: [[Augustiner-Bräu]], [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|Hacker-Pschorr]], [[Hofbräuhaus|Hofbräu]], [[Löwenbräu]], [[Paulaner]] and [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu]] (separate brands Spaten and Franziskaner, the latter of which mainly for Weissbier).

Also much consumed, though not from Munich and thus without the right to have a tent at the Oktoberfest, are [[Tegernseer]] and [[Schneider Weisse]], the latter of which has a major beer hall in Munich.  Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich, such as [[Giesinger Bräu]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.giesinger-braeu.de|title=Giesinger Bräu München|website=Giesinger Bräu München|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206065642/http://www.giesinger-braeu.de/|archive-date=6 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  However, these breweries do not have tents at Oktoberfest.

===Circus===
The [[Circus Krone]] based in Munich is one of the largest circuses in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/ |title=Circus Krone: Europe's largest traditional circus |publisher=Munichfound.com |date=December 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531021339/http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/ |archive-date=31 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first and still is one of only a few in Western Europe to also occupy a [[Circus Krone Building|building]] of its own.

===Nightlife===
[[File:Alte Utting 6144.jpg|thumb|The party ship [[Alte Utting]]]]
[[Nightlife]] in Munich is located mostly in the city centre ([[Altstadt-Lehel]]) and the boroughs [[Maxvorstadt]], [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]], [[Au-Haidhausen]] and [[Schwabing]]. Between [[Sendlinger Tor]] and [[Maximiliansplatz]] lies the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a roughly banana-shaped unofficial party zone spanning {{convert|1.3|km|1|abbr=off}} along Sonnenstraße, characterised by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants. The Feierbanane has become the mainstream focus of Munich's nightlife and tends to become crowded, especially at weekends. It has also been the subject of some debate among city officials because of alcohol-related security issues and the party zone's general impact on local residents as well as day-time businesses.

[[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]]'s two main quarters, Gärtnerplatzviertel and Glockenbachviertel, are both considered decidedly less mainstream than most other nightlife hotspots in the city and are renowned for their many hip and laid back bars and clubs as well as for being Munich's main centres of gay culture. On warm spring or summer nights, hundreds of young people gather at Gärtnerplatz to relax, talk with friends and drink beer.

[[File:Bahnwärter Thiel Nightclub Munich Subway Floor 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bahnwärter Thiel]]]]
[[Maxvorstadt]] has many smaller bars that are especially popular with university students, whereas [[Schwabing]], once Munich's first and foremost party district with legendary clubs such as Big Apple, PN, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Tiffany, Germany's first large-scale disco [[Blow Up (club)|Blow Up]] and the underwater nightclub [[Yellow Submarine (club)|Yellow Submarine]],<ref name="mjunikdisco">{{cite book |last1=Hecktor |first1=Mirko |last2=von Uslar |first2=Moritz |last3=Smith |first3=Patti |last4=Neumeister |first4=Andreas |date=1 November 2008 |title=Mjunik Disco – from 1949 to now|isbn=978-3936738476|language=de}}</ref> as well as many bars such as [[Schwabinger 7]] or Schwabinger Podium, has lost much of its nightlife activity in the last decades, mainly due to gentrification and the resulting high rents. It has become the city's most coveted and expensive residential district, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying.

Since the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik, a former industrial complex that was converted to a large party area near [[München Ostbahnhof]] in [[Berg am Laim]], hosted more than 30 clubs and was especially popular among younger people and residents of the metropolitan area surrounding Munich.<ref name="munichfoundcom">{{cite web|title=Corpus Techno: The music of the future will soon be history|url=http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|publisher=MUNICHfound.com|accessdate=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206184555/http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|archive-date=6 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area. Apart from the Kultfarbik and the smaller Optimolwerke, there is a wide variety of establishments in the urban parts of nearby [[Haidhausen (Munich)|Haidhausen]]. Before the Kunstpark Ost, there had already been an accumulation of internationally known nightclubs in the remains of the abandoned former [[Munich-Riem Airport#Reuse|Munich-Riem Airport]].

Munich nightlife tends to change dramatically and quickly. Establishments open and close every year, and due to gentrification and the overheated housing market many survive only a few years, while others last longer. Beyond the already mentioned venues of the 1960s and 1970s, nightclubs with international recognition in recent history included Tanzlokal Größenwahn, Atomic Cafe and the techno clubs Babalu, [[Ultraschall]], {{nowrap|[[KW – Das Heizkraftwerk]]}}, {{nowrap|[[Natraj Temple]]}} and {{nowrap|[[MMA Club|MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts)]]}}.<ref name="zeitmagazin">{{cite web |first=Paulina |last=Thillmann |url=https://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2017/49/technoclubs-schliessung-bundeslaender-deutschlandkarte |title=Deutschlandkarte: Legendäre Clubs |trans-title=Germany map: legendary clubs |publisher=[[Die Zeit|Zeitmagazin]] |date=29 November 2017 |access-date=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411005217/http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2017/49/technoclubs-schliessung-bundeslaender-deutschlandkarte |archive-date=11 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1995 to 2001, Munich was also home to the [[Union Move]], one of the largest [[technoparade]]s in Germany.

[[File:Blitz Club Munich.jpg|thumb|[[Blitz Club]]]]
Munich has two directly connected gay quarters, which basically can be seen as one: Gärtnerplatzviertel and Glockenbachviertel, both part of the [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]] district. [[Freddie Mercury]] had an apartment near the Gärtnerplatz and transsexual icon [[Romy Haag]] had a club in the city centre for many years.

Munich has more than 100 night clubs and thousands of bars and restaurants within city limits.<ref name="Munich bars">{{cite web|url=http://www.muenchen.de/essen-trinken/gaststaetten-bars.html|title=List of bars in Munich|publisher=muenchen.de – The official city portal|accessdate=6 September 2016|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917175716/http://www.muenchen.de/essen-trinken/gaststaetten-bars.html|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Munich nightclubs">{{cite web|url=http://www.muenchen.de/veranstaltungen/veranstaltungsorte-discos-und-clubs.html|title=List of nightclubs in Munich|publisher=muenchen.de – The official city portal|accessdate=6 September 2016|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917175847/http://www.muenchen.de/veranstaltungen/veranstaltungsorte-discos-und-clubs.html|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Munich is a leading location for science and research with a long list of Nobel Prize laureates from [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] in 1901 to [[Theodor W. Hänsch|Theodor Hänsch]] in 2005. Munich has become a spiritual centre already since the times of Emperor Louis IV when philosophers like [[Michael of Cesena]], [[Marsilius of Padua]] and [[William of Ockham]] were protected at the emperor's court. The Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) and the Technische Universität München (TU or TUM), were two of the first three German universities to be awarded the title ''elite university'' by a selection committee composed of academics and members of the Ministries of Education and Research of the Federation and the German states (Länder). Only the two Munich universities and the Technical University of Karlsruhe (now part of [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]) have held this honour, and the implied greater chances of attracting research funds, since the first evaluation round in 2006.

For its urban population of 2.6&nbsp;million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the [[Munich U-Bahn|Munich U-Bahn (underground railway)]], the [[Munich S-Bahn|Munich S-Bahn (suburban trains)]], trams and buses. The system is supervised by the [[Munich Transport and Tariff Association]] (''Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]''). The [[Munich tramway]] is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines.

The extensive network of subway and tram lines assist and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Straße, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east–west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Similarly, Weinstraße leads off northwards to the Hofgarten. These major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. The transformation of the historic area into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes result from applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|"filtered permability"]], which selectively restricts the number of roads that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the [[Fused Grid]].

====Munich Public Transportation Statistics====
The average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min. 11% of public transit users, spend more than two hours travelling each day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is ten minutes, whilst 6% of passengers wait for over twenty minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 9.2&nbsp;km, while 21% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Germany_Munchen-3144|title=Munich Public Transportation Statistics|publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|accessdate=June 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901024953/https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Germany_Munchen-3144|archive-date=1 September 2017|url-status=live}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>

===Cycling===
{{main|Cycling in Munich}}
Cycling has a strong presence in the city and is recognised as a good alternative to motorised transport. The growing number of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle lanes]] are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer and/or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones. The cycle paths usually involve a longer route than by the road, as they are diverted around objects, and the presence of pedestrians can make them quite slow.

A modern [[Call a Bike|bike hire system]] is available within the area bounded by the ''Mittlerer Ring''.

===München Hauptbahnhof===
{{Main|München Hauptbahnhof}}
[[File:Morning Munich HB June 2014 - 2 (14181545380).jpg|thumb|Munich main railway station]]

[[München Hauptbahnhof]] is the main [[railway station]] located in the city centre and is one of three long-distance stations in Munich, the others being [[München Ost railway station|München Ost]] (to the east) and [[München-Pasing railway station|München-Pasing]] (to the west). All stations are connected to the public transport system and serve as transportation hubs.

München Hauptbahnhof serves about 450,000 passengers a day, which puts it on par with other large stations in Germany, such as [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof]] and [[Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof]]. It and München Ost are two of the 21 stations in Germany classified by [[Deutsche Bahn]] as a [[German railway station categories|category 1 station]]. The mainline station is a [[terminal station]] with 32 platforms. The subterranean [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] with 2 platforms and [[Munich U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] stations with 6 platforms are through stations.<ref name=ORM>{{cite map |url=http://www.openrailwaymap.org/index.php?lang=en&lat=48.14041185482575&lon=11.559380739927292&zoom=18&style=standard |title=Map of München Hauptbahnhof |publisher=OpenRailwayMap |date=28 September 2014 |map=OpenRailwayMap |mapurl=http://www.OpenRailwayMap.org |cartography=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=2014-10-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134627/https://www.openrailwaymap.org/index.php?lang=en&lat=48.14041185482575&lon=11.559380739927292&zoom=18&style=standard |archivedate=25 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=BhfMap>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahnhof.de/file/6511088/data/M%C3%BCnchen%20Hbf_de_PDF.pdf |title=Lageplan Hauptbahnhof München |language=German |publisher=Deutsche Bahn AG |year=2014 |type=orientation map |accessdate=2014-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204092217/http://www.bahnhof.de/file/6511088/data/M%C3%BCnchen%20Hbf_de_PDF.pdf |archivedate=4 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Intercity-Express|ICE highspeed trains]] stop at Munich-Pasing and Munich-Hauptbahnhof only. [[InterCity]] and [[EuroCity]] trains to destinations east of Munich also stop at Munich East. Since 28 May 2006 Munich has been connected to [[Nuremberg]] via [[Ingolstadt]] by the {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}} [[Nuremberg–Munich high-speed railway]] line. In 2017, the [[Berlin–Munich high-speed railway]] opened, providing a journey time of less than 4 hours between the two German cities.

===Autobahns===
[[File:Karte Fernstraßen München.png|thumb|Munich [[Autobahn|motorway]] network]]

Munich is an integral part of the [[Autobahn|motorway]] network of southern Germany. Motorways from [[Stuttgart]] (W), [[Nuremberg]], [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] and Berlin (N), [[Deggendorf]] and [[Passau]] (E), [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]] (SE), [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen|Garmisch Partenkirchen]] (S) and [[Lindau]] (SW) terminate at Munich, allowing direct access to the different parts of Germany, Austria and Italy.

Traffic, however, is often very heavy in and around Munich. Traffic jams are commonplace during rush hour as well as at the beginning and end of major holidays in Germany. There are few "green waves" or roundabouts, and the city's prosperity often causes an abundance of obstructive construction sites. Other contributing factors are the extraordinarily high rates of car ownership per capita (multiple times that of Berlin), the city's historically grown and largely preserved centralised urban structure, which leads to a very high concentration of traffic in specific areas, and sometimes poor planning (for example bad traffic light synchronisation and a less than ideal ring road).

===Munich International Airport===
[[File:Flughafen turm.png|thumb|[[Munich Airport|Munich International Airport]] (MUC)]]
[[Munich Airport|Franz Josef Strauss International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: MUC, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle]], [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Atatürk International Airport|Istanbul Atatürk]]. It is used by about 46&nbsp;million passengers a year, and lies some {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north east of the city centre. It replaced the smaller [[Munich-Riem Airport|Munich-Riem airport]] in 1992. The airport can be reached by suburban train lines from the city. From the [[München Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] the journey takes 40–45 minutes. An express train will be added that will cut down travel time to 20–25 minutes with limited stops on dedicated tracks. A [[maglev (transport)|magnetic levitation train]] (called [[Transrapid]]), which was to have run at speeds of up to {{convert|400|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} from the central station to the airport in a travel time of 10 minutes, had been approved,<ref>{{cite news|title=Germany to build maglev railway|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7011932.stm|work=BBC News|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=7 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216162151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7011932.stm|archive-date=16 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> but was cancelled in March 2008 because of cost escalation and after heavy protests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3219174,00.html|title=Germany Scraps Transrapid Rail Plans|work=Deutsche Welle|date=27 March 2008|accessdate=27 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328175125/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C3219174%2C00.html|archive-date=28 March 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Lufthansa]] opened its second hub at the airport when Terminal 2 was opened in 2003.

===Other airports===
In 2008, the Bavarian state government granted a licence to expand Oberpfaffenhofen Air Station  located west of Munich, for commercial use. These plans were opposed by many residents in the Oberpfaffenhofen area as well as other branches of local Government, including the city of Munich, which took the case to court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merkur-online.de/nachrichten/bayern/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-rolle-rueckwaerts-mm-390304.html |title=Flughafen Oberpfaffenhofen: Rolle rückwärts – Bayern – Aktuelles – merkur-online |language=de |publisher=Merkur-online.de |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622185526/http://www.merkur-online.de/nachrichten/bayern/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-rolle-rueckwaerts-mm-390304.html |archive-date=22 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, in October 2009, the permit allowing up to 9725 business flights per year to depart from or land at Oberpfaffenhofen was confirmed by a regional judge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Süddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-business-jets-willkommen-1.142886 |title=Flughafen Oberpfaffenhofen – Business-Jets willkommen – München |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date= |accessdate=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725102101/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/flughafen-oberpfaffenhofen-business-jets-willkommen-1.142886 |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite being {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}} from Munich, [[Memmingen Airport]] has been advertised as Airport Munich West. After 2005, passenger traffic of nearby [[Augsburg Airport]] was relocated to Munich Airport, leaving the Augsburg region of Bavaria without an air passenger airport within close reach.

==Around Munich==

===Nearby towns===
The Munich agglomeration sprawls across the plain of the [[Foothills|Alpine foothills]] comprising about 2.6&nbsp;million inhabitants. Several smaller traditional Bavarian towns and cities like [[Dachau, Bavaria|Dachau]], [[Freising]], [[Erding]], [[Starnberg]], [[Landshut]] and [[Moosburg]] are today part of the Greater Munich Region, formed by Munich and the surrounding districts, making up the [[Munich Metropolitan Region]], which has a population of about 6&nbsp;million people.<ref name="mmr_official_site"/>
