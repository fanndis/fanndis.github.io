==Early life and training==
Hirst was born Damien Steven Brennan in [[Bristol]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=damien%20s&lastname=brennan&eventyear=1965&eventyear_offset=2|title=findmypast.co.uk|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.biography.com/people/damien-hirst-20683781 |title= Biography |accessdate=2017-10-04}}</ref> and grew up in [[Leeds]]. He never met his father; his mother married his stepfather when Hirst was two, and the couple divorced 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic.<ref name=shockaholic>{{cite journal | author = Chaundy, Bob | date = 20 September 2002 | title = Newsmakers—Damien Hirst: Shockaholic | journal = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2268841.stm | access-date = 22 February 2017 }}</ref> Hirst's mother, who was from an Irish Catholic background, worked for the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young.<ref name=shockaholic/> He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting.<ref name=shockaholic/> However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his [[bondage trousers]] and heated one of his [[Sex Pistols]] vinyl records on the cooker to turn it into a fruit bowl<ref name=cleanup/> (or a plant pot<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hattenstone, Simon  | date = 14 November 2009 | title = Damien Hirst: 'Anyone can be Rembrandt'  | journal = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/14/damien-hirst-interview | access-date = 22 February 2017 }}</ref>). He says, "If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take me away from the bus stop." She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.<ref name=cleanup>{{cite news | author = Jardine, Cassandra  | date = 26 July 2004 | title = I Knew It Was Time to Clean up My Act | journal = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3621316/I-knew-it-was-time-to-clean-up-my-act.html | access-date = 22 February 2017 }}</ref>

His art teacher at [[Allerton Grange School]] "pleaded"<ref name=cleanup/> for Hirst to be allowed to enter the sixth form,<ref name=cleanup/> where he took two A-levels, achieving an "E" grade in art.<ref name=shockaholic/> He was refused admission to [[Leeds Arts University|Jacob Kramer College]] when he first applied, but attended the art school after a subsequent successful application to the Foundation Diploma course.<ref name=shockaholic/>

He went to an exhibition of work by [[Francis Davison]], staged by [[Julian Spalding]] at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 1983.<ref name=spalding03>{{cite news | author = [[Julian Spalding|Spalding, Julian]] | date = 8 May 2003 | title = Why it's OK Not to Like Modern Art | journal = [[The Times]] | url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article1716687.ece | access-date = 22 February 2017 }}</ref> Davison created abstract collages from torn and cut coloured paper which, Hirst said, "blew me away", and which he modelled his own work on for the next two years.<ref name=spalding03/>

He worked for two years on London building sites, then studied Fine Art at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]] (1986–89),<ref name=shockaholic/> although again he was refused a place the first time he applied. In 2007, Hirst was quoted as saying of ''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by Goldsmiths' senior tutor, [[Michael Craig-Martin]]: "That piece is, I think, the greatest piece of conceptual sculpture.

==Early career—student and warehouse shows==
{{Main article|Freeze (art exhibition)}}

In July 1988, in his second year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main organiser of an independent student exhibition, ''[[Freeze (exhibition)|Freeze]]'', in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London's [[London Docklands|Docklands]]. He gained sponsorship for this event from the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]]. The show was visited by [[Charles Saatchi]], [[Norman Rosenthal]] and [[Nicholas Serota]], thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths lecturer [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. Hirst's own contribution to the show consisted of a cluster of cardboard boxes painted with household paint.<ref>The ''Freeze'' catalogue 1988</ref> After graduating, Hirst was included in ''New Contemporaries'' show and in a group show at Kettles Yard Gallery in [[Cambridge]]. Seeking a gallery dealer, he first approached [[Karsten Schubert]], but was turned down.

Hirst, along with his friend [[Carl Freedman]] and Billee Sellman, curated two enterprising "warehouse" shows in 1990, ''[[Modern Medicine (art exhibition)|Modern Medicine]]'' and ''Gambler'', in a Bermondsey former [[Peek Freans]] biscuit factory they designated "Building One".<ref>Rainbird, Sean.

In 1991, [[Charles Saatchi]] had offered to fund whatever artwork Hirst wanted to make, and the result was showcased in 1992 in the first ''[[Young British Artists]]'' exhibition at the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in North London. Hirst's work was titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'' and was a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and sold for £50,000. The shark had been caught by a commissioned fisherman in Australia and had cost £6,000.<ref name=mulls>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/4120893.stm "Saatchi mulls £6.25m shark offer"], BBC. Retrieved 23 February 2007.</ref> The exhibition also included ''In a Thousand Years''. As a result of the show, Hirst was nominated for that year's [[Turner Prize]], but it was awarded to [[Grenville Davey]].

Hirst's first major international presentation was in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1993 with the work, ''Mother and Child Divided'', a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited in a series of separate vitrines. He curated the show ''Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away'' in 1994 at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London, where he exhibited ''Away from the Flock'' (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work ''Black Sheep''.  He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of £1,000. When a photograph of ''Away from the Flock'' was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst ''I want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now,'' the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on ''Black Sheep.''<ref>{{Cite news | title = Who's Suing Whom: The case of the pickled sheep | work = The Independent | accessdate =11 June 2012 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/whos-suing-whom-the-case-of-the-pickled-sheep-1198134.html | location=London | first=John | last=Willcock | date=14 September 1998 }}</ref>

===1995–1999===
In 1995, Hirst won the Turner Prize. New York public health officials banned ''Two Fucking and Two Watching'' featuring a rotting cow and bull, because of fears of "vomiting among the visitors". There were solo shows in [[Seoul]], London and [[Salzburg]]. He directed the video for the song "[[Country House (song)|Country House]]" for the band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. ''No Sense of Absolute Corruption'', his first solo show in the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in New York was staged the following year. In London the short film, ''Hanging Around'', was shown—written and directed by Hirst and starring [[Eddie Izzard]]. In 1997 the ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'' exhibition opened at the [[Royal Academy]] in London. ''A Thousand Years'' and other works by Hirst were included, but the main controversy occurred over other artists' works. It was nevertheless seen as the formal acceptance of the YBAs into the establishment.<ref>Beckett, Andy. "Shock art to shop art", ''The Guardian'', p. T.002, 28 August 1997.</ref>

In 1997, his autobiography and art book, ''I Want To Spend the Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now'', was published. With [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] of the band Blur and actor [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]], he formed the band [[Fat Les]], achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football-themed song ''[[Vindaloo (single)|Vindaloo]]'', followed up by ''[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]'' with the [[London Gay Men's Chorus]]. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the [[Beagle 2]] probe. This pattern was to be used to calibrate the probe's cameras after it had landed on [[Mars]]. He turned down the [[British Council]]'s invitation to be the UK's representative at the 1999 [[Venice Biennale]] because "it didn't feel right".<ref name=guardian2>[https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,564027,00.html The Guardian 6 October 2001].

===2000–2004===

In 2000, Hirst's sculpture ''Hymn'' (which Saatchi had bought for a reported £1m) was given pole position at the show ''Ant Noises'' (an anagram of "sensation") in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was then sued himself for breach of copyright over this sculpture (see [[#Appropriation and plagiarism claims|Appropriation]] below).<ref name=emms>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/754680.stm "Hirst Pays up in Toy Row" on BBC site].

On 10 September 2002, on the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online:
{{Quote|The thing about 9/11 is that it's kind of like an artwork in its own right. It was wicked, but it was devised in this way for this kind of impact. It was devised visually... You've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible, especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating, which a lot of people shy away from, which is a very dangerous thing.<ref>Allison, Rebecca. (11 September 2002). [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/11/arts.september11 "9/11 wicked but a work of art, says Damien Hirst"], ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 11 November 2008.</ref>}}

The next week, following public outrage at his remarks, he issued a statement through his company, Science Ltd:
{{Quote|I apologise unreservedly for any upset I have caused, particularly to the families of the victims of the events on that terrible day.<ref name=apologises>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2268307.stm "Hirst apologies for 11 Sept Comments" BBC website]. Retrieved 26 March 2006.</ref>}}

In 2002, Hirst gave up smoking and drinking after his wife Maia had complained and "had to move out because I was so horrible". He had met [[Joe Strummer]] (former lead singer of [[The Clash]]) at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer died of a heart attack. This had a profound effect on Hirst, who said, "It was the first time I felt mortal." He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, [[Strummerville]], to help young musicians.<ref name=cleanup/>

In April 2003, the Saatchi Gallery opened at new premises in [[County Hall, London]], with a show that included a Hirst retrospective. This brought a developing strain in his relationship with Saatchi to a head<ref name=buysback/> (one source of contention had been who was most responsible for boosting their mutual profile). Hirst disassociated himself from the retrospective to the extent of not including it in his CV.<ref name=buysback/> He was angry that a [[Mini]] car that he had decorated for charity with his trademark spots was being exhibited as a serious artwork.<ref name=buysback/> The show also scuppered a prospective Hirst retrospective at [[Tate Modern]].<ref name=buysback/> He said Saatchi was "childish"<ref name=cleanup/> and "I'm not Charles Saatchi's barrel-organ monkey ...

In September 2003, he had an exhibition ''Romance in the Age of Uncertainty'' at [[Jay Jopling|Jay Jopling's]] [[White Cube]] gallery in London, which made him a reported £11m,<ref name=cleanup/> bringing his wealth to over £35m. It was reported that a sculpture, ''Charity'', had been sold for £1.5m to a Korean, Kim Chang-Il, who intended to exhibit it in his department store's gallery in [[Seoul]].<ref name=holy>9 September 2003.

''Charity'' was exhibited in the centre of [[Hoxton Square]], in front of White Cube. Inside the gallery downstairs were 12 vitrines representing Jesus's disciples, each case containing mostly gruesome, often blood-stained, items relevant to the particular disciple. At the end was an empty vitrine, representing Christ. Upstairs were four small glass cases, each containing a cow's head stuck with scissors and knives. It has been described as an "extraordinarily spiritual experience" in the tradition of Catholic imagery.<ref name=soul>Dorment, Richard. (10 September 2003).

On 24 May 2004, a [[Momart#The 2004 warehouse fire|fire in the Momart storage warehouse]] destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including 17 of Hirst's, although the sculpture ''Charity'' survived, as it was outside in the builder's yard.

{{Main article|The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living}}

This artwork features a large [[tiger shark]] suspended in formaldehyde. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate sections. The work was created in 1991, and since then, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal's body, which shows signs of decay.<ref name="Natural History">{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=Damien|title=Natural History|url=http://www.damienhirst.com/texts1/series/nat-history|website=Damien Hirst.

Some critics argue that the minimalistic qualities of the work, coinciding with the 'stereotypical' death theme, are too bland for such a prestigious artist. One critic wrote, "But the famous shark, shackled to its coffeebar-existentialist title – The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living – seems ever more dilapidated, more fairground sideshow, with every dowdy showing. What clichéd menace it may once have theoretically possessed has evaporated."<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raine, Craig | date = April 2012 | title = Damien Hirst—Pretty vacant |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2012/04/damien-hirst-pretty-vacant |access-date=22 February 2017 | quote = [Subtitle:] : There are only two good works in the Tate’s Damien Hirst retrospective.}}</ref> <!--THE FOLLOWING IS WP:OR, AND ONLY SHOULD COME BACK IN WITH A SOURCE OF THE COMMENTS: However, when investigated further, the sculpture is said to be representational of our mind, specifically our memory, or lack thereof.

Hirst has been praised in recognition of his celebrity and the way this has galvanised interest in the arts, raising the profile of [[British art]] and helping to (re)create the image of "[[Cool Britannia]]." In the mid-1990s, the then-[[Secretary of State for National Heritage|Heritage Secretary]], [[Virginia Bottomley]] recognised him as "a pioneer of the British art movement", and even sheep farmers were pleased he had raised increased interest in British lamb.<ref name=hirstfor/> [[Janet Street-Porter]] praised his originality, which had brought art to new audiences and was the "art-world equivalent of the Oasis concerts at Earl's Court".<ref name=hirstfor/>

[[Andres Serrano]] is also known for shocking work and understands that contemporary fame does not necessarily equate to lasting fame, but backs Hirst: "Damien is very clever ... First you get the attention ... Whether or not it will stand the test of time, I don't know, but I think it will."<ref name=hirstfor/> [[Nicholas Serota|Sir Nicholas Serota]] commented, "Damien is something of a showman ... It is very difficult to be an artist when there is huge public and media attention. Because Damien Hirst has been built up as a very important figure, there are plenty of sceptics ready to put the knife in."<ref name=hirstfor>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/for.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427211215/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/for.html |archivedate=27 April 2006}}</ref>

[[Tracey Emin]] said: "There is no comparison between him and me; he developed a whole new way of making art and he's clearly in a league of his own.

===Negative===
There has been equally vehement opposition to Hirst's work. Of Hirst's work, the former ''[[Evening Standard]]'' art critic, [[Brian Sewell]], expressed the following: "I don't think of it as art ... It is no more interesting than a stuffed pike over a pub door. Indeed there may well be more art in a stuffed pike than a dead sheep."<ref name=hirstagainst>{{cite journal | authors = Childish, Billy Childish & Thomson, Charles | date = December 2000 | title = Hirst's Art: Against [A Stuckist Critique of Damien Hirst] | publisher = Channel 4 | url = http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html | access-date = 22 February 2017 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060503150414/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/H/hirst/against.html | archive-date = 3 May 2006 }}</ref>

The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] art group was founded in 1999 with a specific anti-Britart agenda by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]];<ref name=manifesto>[http://www.stuckism.com/stuckistmanifesto.html#manifest Stuckist anti-Britart manifesto, 4 August 1999].

{{quote|The fact that Hirst's work does mirror society is not its strength but its weakness – and the reason it is guaranteed to decline artistically (and financially) as current social modes become outmoded.

In 2003, under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', the [[Stuckism International Gallery]] exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display two years before Hirst's by Eddie Saunders in his [[Shoreditch]] shop, JD Electrical Supplies. Thomson asked, "If Hirst’s shark is recognised as great art, then how come Eddie’s, which was on exhibition for two years beforehand, isn’t? Do we perhaps have here an undiscovered artist of genius, who got there first, or is it that a dead shark isn’t art at all?"<ref name="alberge-shark">Alberge, Dalya. (10 April 2003).

In a 2008 [[Channel 4]] documentary called ''The Mona Lisa Curse'', art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] claimed that Hirst's work was "tacky" and "absurd". Hughes said it was "a little miracle" that the value of £5&nbsp;million was put on Hirst's ''Virgin Mother'' (a 35-foot bronze statue), which was made by someone "with so little facility".<ref name="hughes1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/07/damienhirst.art|title=Top critic lashes out at Hirst's 'tacky' art|accessdate=7 September 2008|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | date=7 September 2008}}</ref> Hughes called Hirst's shark in [[formaldehyde]] "the world's most over-rated marine organism" and attacked the artist for "functioning like a commercial brand", making the case that Hirst and his work proved that financial value was now the only meaning that remained for art.<ref name=hughes1/>

Hirst's 2009 show, ''No Love Lost'', of paintings by his own hand, at the [[Wallace Collection]] in London, received "one of the most unanimously negative responses to any exhibition in living memory".<ref name = Hudson091014/> Tom Lubbock of ''[[The Independent]]'' called Hirst's work derivative, weak and boring:<ref name=pressviews>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8306638.stm "Press views: Damien Hirst's paintings"], [[BBC]], 4 October 2009.

Hirst's 2012 retrospective at the Tate Gallery, while setting records for attendance, also received many complaints. "Members of the public wrote to the state-funded gallery accusing it of wasting taxpayers' money by showcasing art that was 'repetitive', 'meaningless' and 'almost universally awful'."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10269482/Damien-Hirst-Tate-retrospective-triggered-wave-of-complaints-about-meaningless-artwork.html|title=Damien Hirst Tate retrospective triggered wave of complaints about 'meaningless artwork'|author=Ben Riley-Smith|date=28 August 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=London}}</ref>

Hirst's work has also been a frequent subject of criticism in the tabloid press. A ''[[Daily Mail]]'' headline read: "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all." [[Norman Tebbit]], commenting on the [[Sensation (exhibition)|''Sensation'' exhibition]], wrote "Have they gone stark raving mad? The works of the 'artist' are lumps of dead animals. There are thousands of young artists who didn't get a look in, presumably because their work was too attractive to sane people. Modern art experts never learn."<ref name="hirstagainst"/>

==Appropriation and plagiarism claims==
In 1999, chef [[Marco Pierre White]] said Hirst's ''Butterflies on Mars'' had plagiarised his own work, ''Rising Sun'', which he then put on display in the restaurant Quo Vadis in place of Hirst's work.<ref name=difference>Alberge, Dalya.

In 2000, Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over his sculpture, ''Hymn'', which was a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}}, six ton, enlargement of his son Connor's 14" ''Young Scientist Anatomy Set'', designed by Norman Emms, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull-based toy manufacturer [[Humbrol]] for £14.99 each.<ref name=emms/> Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, [[Children Nationwide]] and the [[Toy Trust]], in an out-of-court settlement,<ref name=emms/> as well as a "good will payment" to Emms.<ref name=difference/> The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst also agreed to restrictions on further reproductions of his sculpture.<ref name=emms/>

In 2006, a graphic artist and former research associate at the [[Royal College of Art]], [[Robert Dixon (mathematician)|Robert Dixon]], author of '[[Mathographics]]', alleged that Hirst's print ''Valium'' had "unmistakable similarities" to one of his own designs. Hirst's manager contested this by explaining the origin of Hirst's piece was from a book ''The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry'' (1991)—not realising this was one place where Dixon's design had been published.<ref name=difference/><ref name=alberge>Alberge, Dalya.

In 2007, artist [[John LeKay]], a friend of Damien Hirst between 1992 and 1994, was reported by Dalya Alberge of ''[[The Times]]'' to have provided ideas and inspirations for a variety of his later works, including having given him a "marked-up duplicate copy" of a [[Carolina Biological Supply Company]] catalogue that LeKay had been using as inspiration and supply for his work, noting that "You have no idea how much he got from this catalogue. The Cow Divided is on page 647—it is a model of a cow divided down the centre, like his piece", a reference to Hirst's work ''Mother and Child, Divided'', a cow and calf cut in half and placed in [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=alberge/> LeKay also suggests that Hirst copied the idea of ''[[For the Love of God]]'' from his work on [[crystal]] skulls in 1993, saying, "I would like Damien to acknowledge that 'John really did inspire the skull and influenced my work a lot.'"<ref name=alberge/> Copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry reviewed images of LeKay's and Hirst's work and saw no basis for any appropriation rising to the legal level of a copyright infringement.<ref name=preece>Preece, Robert.

Although Hirst participated physically in the making of early works,<ref>Blanché, Ulrich (2018). Damien Hirst. Gallery Art in a Material World.

Hirst said that he only painted five spot paintings himself because, "I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it"; he described his efforts as "shite"—"They're shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was [[Rachel Howard|Rachel]]. She's brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel." He also describes another painting assistant who was leaving and asked for one of the paintings. Hirst told her to, "'make one of your own.' And she said, 'No, I want one of yours.' But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.'"<ref name=work/> By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist:{{quote|Art goes on in your head... If you said something interesting, that might be a title for a work of art and I'd write it down. Art comes from everywhere. It's your response to your surroundings.

Although one of the owners, Hirst had only leased his art work to the restaurant, so he was able to retrieve and sell it at a [[Sotheby's]] auction, earning over £11&nbsp;million.
