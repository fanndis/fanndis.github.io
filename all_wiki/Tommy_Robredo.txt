Robredo reached the fourth round of the [[2014 Australian Open|Australian Open]], losing a close match to eventual champion [[Stanislas Wawrinka]].

===Playing Style===
Robredo is a baseline player, who can play both offensively and defensively. He is known for his versatility and solid groundstrokes on both wings. Robredo's baseline play is exceptional, and is considered one of the most consistent and dangerous baseliners on the tour. Like most traditional Spanish players like [[Rafael Nadal]], Robredo puts a very high amount of topspin on both his forehand and single-handed backhand. This makes his groundstrokes both consistent and penetrating at the same time. His backhand is also considered one of the best single-handed backhands on the tour, being very powerful and clutch during important points. However, his slice is weaker than most one-handers'. Mainly playing from the baseline, Robredo uses his solid groundstrokes to dictate points by moving opponents around and forcing weak replies. Due to the top-spin on his groundstrokes, Robredo has an edge against one-handed backhand players, who might find it hard to return high balls to their backhand. Because of this, he has sometimes been accused of being a "moonballer".

Robredo is also versatile in his baseline play. Due to the penetrating nature of his groundstrokes, he can effectively control points and force weak returns from his opponents, finishing points quickly. However, he can also counter-punch, the height of his balls giving him enough time to recover and preventing opponents from capitalising on weak returns. Robredo usually only flattens out his groundstrokes more when hitting weak returns from opponents, and even then they are not completely flat and still have a substantial amount of topspin.

Robredo's first serve is not considered his weapon due to its lack of any significant pace, but it is not weak to the point that opponents can capitalise on it. He employs a high amount of top-spin for his second serve, making it slow but pushing his opponents further back, preventing his opponents from hitting return aces.

However, Robredo's main weaknesses is his over-defensiveness. At times, even though he has gained a significant advantage through his groundstrokes, Robredo does not make an effort to end off the point cleanly by hitting a clean winner or by coming up to the net to volley. Instead, he usually stays around the baseline, not capitalising on the advantage he has. This makes him especially vulnerable against clutch players who can make use of their opponents' speed or direction to turn the point around, such as [[Andy Murray]] and [[Novak Djokovic]].

==Personal life==
Robredo is named after the rock opera ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' by [[The Who]], of which his father is a big fan.

Robredo is currently sponsored by [[Sergio Tacchini]] for his sportswear, [[ASICS|Asics]] for his shoes, [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] for his tennis racquets, TW Steel watches, [[Smeg (appliances)|Smeg]], and the Ukrainian Food Company.

Robredo's childhood tennis idol was [[Stefan Edberg]], along with [[John McEnroe]], [[Pete Sampras]], [[Andre Agassi]], and various Spanish tennis players. He cites [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario|Arantxa Sánchez]] (with whom he won the 2002 [[Hopman Cup]] for Spain) as his favorite female player among retired players; among recently active players his favorite male and female players are [[Roger Federer]] and [[Justine Henin]].

Some fans refer to Robredo as "Disco Tommy" for the long, wavy hairstyle he began cultivating during the 2006 tennis season; after Robredo mentioned that he calls his coach "[[David Palmer (24 character)|President Palmer]]" while his coach calls him "[[Jack Bauer]]" (from ''24''), fans also began referring to him as "Disco Jack."

2007 marked increased media exposure for Robredo. He was recognized by the Spanish editions of ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'' and ''[[Marie Claire]]'', as well as ''[[People en Español]]''.

In 2018, he won the [[ATP_Awards#Arthur_Ashe_Humanitarian_of_the_Year|Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year]] award.
