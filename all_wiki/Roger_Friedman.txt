In April 2009, Friedman was fired by Foxnews.com after he reviewed the film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' based on viewing [[X-Men Origins: Wolverine#Leaked workprint|a bootlegged copy of the movie online]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7987136.stm |title=Writer loses job over Wolverine |date=2009-04-07 |publisher=[[BBC]] News |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> (Friedman later told [[Gawker|Gawker.com]] that he had not [[downloaded]] the film, but had [[Streaming media|streamed]] it after finding a link to it online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5200958/its-official-roger-friedman-loses-his-job-over-wolverine-piracy |title=It's Official: Roger Friedman Loses His Job Over Wolverine Piracy |first=Gabriel |last=Snyder |date=2009-04-06 |publisher=Gawker |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>) Friedman's column was perceived as an endorsement of [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|film piracy]] and [[Copyrighted content on file sharing networks|illegal file sharing]], particularly by the film's distributor, [[20th Century Fox]], which, like Foxnews.com, is a unit of [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/04/wolverine-the-curse-of-the-pirate-critic/7313/ |title=Wolverine: the Curse of the Pirate Critic |first=Peter |last=Suderman |date=2009-04-07 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref><ref name="fisher">{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Movies/story?id=7268500&page=1 |title=Fox News Columnist Roger Friedman Fired |first1=Luchina |last1=Fisher |first2=Ki Mae |last2=Heussner |first3=Sheila |last3=Marikar |date=2009-04-06 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> Ironically, Friedman's review of ''Wolverine'' was very favorable, including comments such as "I am, in fact, amazed about how great Wolverine turned out.
