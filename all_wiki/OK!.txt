''OK!''{{'s}} Australian edition was published by [[Bauer Media Group|Bauer Media Australia and New Zealand]]. In July 2020, Bauer Media's Australian and New Zealand operations were acquired by the [[Sydney]] investment firm [[Mercury Capital]], which cancelled the magazine due to declining advertising revenue and travel restrictions caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle |first=Michael |title=InStyle, Elle, Women's Health, Men's Health among Australian magazines axed by Bauer Media |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/elle-womens-health-ok-instyle-magazines-axed-by-bauer/12478658 |accessdate=4 September 2020 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=21 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200811093817/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/elle-womens-health-ok-instyle-magazines-axed-by-bauer/12478658|archive-date=11 August 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Meade |first1=Amanda |title=Mercury Capital axes eight former Bauer magazines, including Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Men's Health |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/21/bauer-media-australia-axes-eight-magazines-including-harpers-bazaar-elle-and-mens-health |accessdate=4 September 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 July 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827050944/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/21/bauer-media-australia-axes-eight-magazines-including-harpers-bazaar-elle-and-mens-health |archivedate=20 August 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Weddings ==
''OK!'' is best known for its coverage of celebrity nuptials.

In 2000, ''OK!'' had exclusive rights to publish photographs of the wedding of [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Michael Douglas]], but its rival ''[[Hello!]]'' magazine published pictures as well, and ''OK!'' sued. It was awarded [[pound sterling|£]]1,033,156 in an initial judgment, but lost it on appeal.<ref>Dan Tench, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/23/mondaymediasection13 Photo finish], ''The Guardian'', 3 May 2005</ref>

In October 2005, three celebrity weddings took place on the same day: those of [[Katie Price]] and [[Peter Andre]], [[Kate Garraway]] and [[Derek Draper]], and [[Samia Ghadie]] and property developer Matthew Smith. ''OK!'' covered them all over separate issues. The biggest wedding of the three (Price and Andre) was covered over two bumper issues.

The same happened for the wedding of [[Ashley Cole|Ashley]] and [[Cheryl Cole]], as well as [[Christina Aguilera]]'s. ''OK!'' devoted an issue to photos of [[Tony Parker]] and [[Eva Longoria]]'s wedding.

*[[Natasha Hamilton]] and Riad Erraji (November 2007)

==Controversies==

Prior to [[Jade Goody]]'s cancer-related death in March 2009, ''OK!'' sparked controversy by publishing an "Official Tribute Issue" with the front-page captions "In Loving Memory" and "1981-2009," even though Goody was still alive when the issue went to press.<ref>Marina Hyde, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/21/jade-goody-ok-magazine The Jade obituary issue just shows how deeply OK! cares], ''The Guardian'', 21 March 2009</ref>

In June 2009, ''OK!'' ran another tribute issue, this time for [[Michael Jackson]]. The publication had paid a reported $500,000 for images of Jackson's body being retrieved after his death. The cover photo showed a deceased Jackson on a stretcher, in a neck brace and with an oxygen mask. "It’s a photo that captures the surprise and the upset and the moment of this breaking news story," Sarah Ivens, the magazine's editorial director, said. "I hope the cover will provoke readers."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moses |first1=Lucia |title=OK! Looks to Cash In on Michael Jackson Death Cover |url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/ok-looks-cash-michael-jackson-death-cover-112752/ |website=www.adweek.com |accessdate=22 July 2020}}</ref>

In 2010, the magazine faced more criticism after running a cover story on [[Kourtney Kardashian]]'s pregnancy. It published a cover photo of Kardashian holding her son, Mason, and claimed to feature an exclusive interview revealing the secrets to her weight loss. Kardashian tweeted in response, "One of those weeklies got it wrong again…they didn’t have an exclusive with me. And I gained 40 pounds [18 kg] while pregs, not 26 [12 kg]…But thanks!" She also alleged that the body on the cover was not hers, and that ''OK!'' had Photoshopped her face onto someone else's body.

''OK!'' came under fire again in July 2013 when it published an issue featuring [[Kate Middleton]] on the same day she left the hospital after giving birth to [[Prince George of Cambridge|Prince George]].<ref>{{cite news| last1=Driscoll| first1=Brogan| title=OK!

Like the rest of the world, we were very moved by her radiance as she and William introduced the Prince of Cambridge to the world. We would not dream of being critical of her appearance. If that was misunderstood on our cover it was not intended."<ref>{{cite news| last1=Sweney| first1=Mark| title=OK! apologises for royal post-birth weight loss regime story| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/24/ok-apologies-duchess-cambridge-weight-loss-story| accessdate=22 February 2015| date=24 July 2013}}</ref>
