'''Kappa Alpha Theta''' ('''ΚΑΘ'''), also known simply as '''Theta''', is an international [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek-letter fraternity for women]] founded on January 27, 1870, at [[DePauw University]], formerly Indiana Asbury. Kappa Alpha Theta is supportive of inclusivity and diversity. Kappa Alpha Theta is a sorority on multiple college campuses and was the first [[Greek-letter fraternity]] for women. The fraternity (the term "sorority" had not yet been invented) was founded by four female students, Bettie Locke Hamilton, Alice Allen Brant, Bettie Tipton Lindsey, and Hannah Fitch Shaw.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nuwer | first = Hank | title = Wrongs of Passage: Fraternities, Sororities, Hazing, and Binge Drinking | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253335968 | url-access = registration | publisher = Indiana University Press | year= 1999 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253335968/page/149 149] | isbn = 0-253-21498-X}}</ref> The first women admitted to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honor society were Thetas.

Kappa Alpha Theta is a member of the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC), an umbrella organization that encompasses 26 social sororities found throughout North America. The organization's own headquarters are located in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana.

==History==
{{Story|date=June 2018}}

===Founding===
The Alpha Chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at Indiana Asbury College, now [[DePauw University]], on January 27, 1870. The university began admitting women in 1867 after 30 years of a male-only student body. However, women were excluded from male-only clubs and societies. In response to the lack of women's organizations, the fraternity's founding members established the first Greek letter women's organization.  The Founders were:
*Elizabeth McReynolds Locke Hamilton (Bettie Locke)
*Alice Olive Allen Brant (Alice Allen)
*Elizabeth Tipton Lindsey (Bettie Tipton)
*Hannah Virginia Fitch Shaw (Hannah Fitch) 

Bettie Locke developed the idea for a Greek letter women's society through the encouragement of her father, a professor at Indiana Asbury and a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]], and the members of [[Phi Gamma Delta]] (FIJI) at Indiana Asbury, which included her brother. Initially, the collegiate men of FIJI offered Locke their badge as a token of their friendship, but voted against initiating her as a member. Locke refused to wear the badge as she did not know the secrets and purposes the badge represented, since she was unable to become a member. Ultimately, the fraternity gifted her a symbolic silver fruit basket instead to represent their relationship and fondness for her.

Upon discovering that there were no Greek letter fraternities for women in existence (only [[literary societies]] for women existed at the time), Locke decided to create her own Greek letter fraternity for women. Kappa Alpha Theta's ritual, organizational structure, badge, and coat of arms were influenced by those of Beta Theta Pi and Phi Gamma Delta due to her familial connections. Locke and her friend Alice Allen wrote a constitution, planned rituals, designed a badge, and sought out women on campus to become members. Along with Hannah Fitch and Bettie Tipton, the first initiation was held in secret on January 27, 1870, establishing the Alpha Chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta.

=== Expansion ===
In 1887, Theta became an international organization with the establishment of the Sigma Chapter at The University of Toronto. This became the first Canadian women's fraternity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thevarsity.ca/2017/09/25/the-breakdown-the-origins-of-greek-life-on-campus/|title=The Breakdown: the origins of Greek life on campus|date=2017-09-25|work=The Varsity|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Kappa Alpha Theta as one of "the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige" in the mid-1960s.<ref>{{cite book|first=G. William|last=Domhoff|authorlink=G. William Domhoff|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|edition=Seventh|page=57|publisher=McGraw Hill College|year=2015|oclc=912380768}}</ref>

==Symbols==

Kappa Alpha Theta's colors are [[black (color)|black]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The official symbols are both the [[kite]] and twin stars, while the official flower is the black and gold [[pansy]]. The fraternity does not recognize an official stone.

===''The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine''===
Theta's Grand Convention voted to establish a magazine in 1885 and place its editorship with Kappa Chapter at Kansas. In the intervening years, Kappa Alpha Theta's magazine has undergone a change of title (from ''The Journal'' to ''The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine''), and a change of publication schedule (from monthly to quarterly). Today, ''The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine'' is published in April, June, September, and December of each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kappaalphatheta.org/collegians/resources/thetamagazine/index.cfm?from=CommonQuickLinkToc|title=The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine|publisher=Kappa Alpha Theta|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref>

===Chapters===
Kappa Alpha Theta has more than 143 active college chapters and more than 212 alumnae chapters across the United States and Canada. Alumnae chapters are alumnae groups that have been granted charters from Grand Council.

==Philanthropy==
The Kappa Alpha Theta Foundation was founded in 1960 and is the philanthropic arm of the organization. The Theta Foundation awards annual undergraduate and graduate scholarships to its members, awarding more than $1.1 million per year. In addition to scholarships, the Theta Foundation also supports the sorority's educational programs as well as its international philanthropy, [[Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA)]]. Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA's) are community volunteers who serve as the voice for abused and neglected foster care children who are going through the court system. CASA's are appointed by a judge and their purpose is to ensure all legal actions made are in the child's best interest.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In order to be able to directly volunteer at CASA you must be 21 years of age or older.

==Notable controversies==

In 2000, the chapter at the [[University of Cincinnati]] was temporarily suspended for [[hazing]]. The pledges were forced to endure several demeaning tasks, one of which included crawling up the steps of the sorority house for the amusement of their big sisters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/2000/02/20/loc_uc_sorority.html|author=Jeff Carlton|title=UC sorority suspended over hazing complaints |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=2000-02-20|accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref>

In 2000, the chapter at [[Rollins College]] was shut down after a drinking party sent newly pledged members to the hospital. One member passed out and was placed on a respirator that night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-04-12/news/0004120054_1_rollins-sorority-alcohol|author=Scott Powers|title=Sorority Chapter Is Shut Down At Rollins|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=2000-04-12|accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref>

In 2008, the chapter at [[Colgate University]] was suspended for four years after an alcohol-hazing related incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecolgatemaroonnews.com/news/article_52fbe151-4b67-50ae-a1bf-083eeb4a2a35.html|title=Kappa Alpha Theta Receives 4-Year Suspension|work=The Colgate-Maroon News |accessdate=2015-11-07}}

In 2014, the chapter at [[Columbia University]] was under national scrutiny after hosting a racially and ethnically insensitive event that went viral. Some of the costumes worn by sorority members were based on stereotypes meant to represent Mexico, Japan, the Netherlands, Ireland, Jamaica and other countries. The sorority publicly apologized for the event.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/columbia-sorority-party-offensive-olympics_n_4847827.html|author=Tyler Kingkade|title=Columbia Sorority Criticized For Offensive Olympics Party|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2014-02-24|accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref>

In 2016, the 137-year old chapter at the [[University of Michigan]] was suspended by the university for underage drinking and hazing. The chapter was disbanded by the national organization a few weeks later for violating the suspension.<ref name="bn-2016feb24">{{cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2016/02/disbanded_u-m_sorority_faced_d.html |title=Disbanded U-M sorority chapter faced discipline problems for years, national president says |website=[[Booth Newspapers]] |date=2016-02-24 |first=Darcie |last=Moran}}</ref><ref name="dfp-2016feb23">{{cite news |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/02/23/university-of-michigan-sorority-kappa-alpha-theta/80794710/ |title=University of Michigan's oldest sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, disbanded |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=2016-02-23 |first=David |last=Jesse}}</ref>

In 2018, the University of Mississippi and Clemson's chapters were closed for failure to meet quota. There was a great deal of opposition, since members felt they were being unfairly punished, simply for being less popular than other [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) sororities on campus, and not for risk management or academic issues.<ref>https://www.oxfordeagle.com/2018/11/05/kappa-alpha-theta-to-close-ole-miss-chapter-at-semesters-end/</ref><ref>https://www.independentmail.com/story/news/2018/11/15/kappa-alpha-theta-clemson-chapter-delta-phi/2011585002/</ref>

In 2019, the Randolph-Macon chapter's new president was found to have hazed members of the organization living within the chapter facility.
