From 1972-77 he studied at the Mining Industrial College in [[Donetsk]], later - in the [[Donetsk National Technical University]]. Until 1988 Shcherban worked as a mining engineering and after the independence of Ukraine he established a cooperative organization "Progress" and later a corporation "ATON". Among other companies that associated with his name were "Gefest" (today "Parallel"), "Finansist", "AMEST" and others.

In the mid-1990s, Shcherban was among the richest people in Ukraine and prominent and influential member of [[Ukrainian parliament|parliament]] for the [[Liberal Party of Ukraine]].<ref name=murdered/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sf8BcUgMSMC&pg=PA59&dq=%22Yevhen+Shcherban%22+Liberal+Party+of+Ukraine&hl=nl&ei=yCAITawTkZg6oKf54w4&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Yevhen%20Shcherban%22%20Liberal%20Party%20of%20Ukraine&f=false Unbroken Ties: The State, Interest Associations, and Corporatism in Post-Soviet Ukraine] by [[Paul Kubicek]], [[University of Michigan Press]], 2002, {{ISBN|0472110306}}/{{ISBN|978-0472110308}} (page 59)</ref><ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/116272/ Fight over natural gas trade seen at core of 1996 murder of wealthy Yevhen Shcherban], [[Kyiv Post]] (3 November 2011)</ref>

He and his wife Nadezhda (née Nikitina) were assassinated on a runway at [[Donetsk Airport]] on 3 November 1996 by several men posing as public force officers.<ref name=murdered/><ref name=part1/> Among the killers were Vadim Bolotskikh, Gennadiy Zangelidi and others. Prosecutors have stated the murder was intended to eliminate competition for control of [[Ukraine’s natural gas]] industry.<ref name=murdered/> In 2002, eight men were arrested and tried for the murder.

===Related events===
Coincidentally, the event took place soon after replacement of the Governor of Donetsk Oblast [[Volodymyr Shcherban]] (no relation to Yevhen) with the former Minister of Coal Industry of Ukraine [[Serhiy Polyakov]] and the appointment of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to the position of a deputy chairman.

Previously, in December 1995, when Serhiy Polyakov was appointed to the ministerial position in Donetsk, the [[Industrial Union of Donbas]] (ISD) was established. Headed by [[Serhiy Taruta]], many however saw the real leader of the Union as Yevhen Shcherban. Preceding that in October 1995 another no less important assassination of [[Akhat Bragin]] took place. Since then a number of assassinations of lesser ISD members took place from January to July 1996. However, the assassination of Shcherban became the most noticeable, because he was a [[People's Deputy of Ukraine]].
