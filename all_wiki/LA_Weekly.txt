'''''LA Weekly''''' is a free [[Weekly newspaper|weekly]] [[alternative newspaper]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It was founded in 1978 by Jay Levin, who served as president and editor until 1991. [[Voice Media Group]] sold the paper in late 2017 to [[Semenal Media LLC|Semanal Media LLC]].

It covers Los Angeles music, arts, film, theater, culture, concerts, and events. In 1979 they established the [[LA Weekly Theater Award]]s which awards small theatre productions (99 seats or less) in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/awards_listing.cfm?ID=5|title=Theatre Awards Listings|access-date=August 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822220737/http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/awards_listing.cfm?ID=5|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Starting in 2006, ''LA Weekly'' has hosted the [[LA Weekly Detour Music Festival]] every October.

Some of its best known writers were [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning food writer [[Jonathan Gold]], who left in early 2012, and [[Nikki Finke]], who blogged about the film industry through the ''Weekly''{{'s}} website and published a print column in the paper each week, leaving in June 2009 after the blog she founded, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline Hollywood Daily]]'', was acquired by an online firm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/mmc-acquires-deadline-hollywood-daily/|title=MAIL.COM MEDIA CORPORATION ACQUIRES DEADLINEHOLLYWOODDAILY.COM|publisher=Deadline Hollywood Daily|access-date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

==History==
The paper was founded in 1978 by [[Jay Levin]], who served as its editor from 1978 to 1991 and its president from 1978 to 1992. Levin put together an investment group that included actor [[Michael Douglas]], Burt Kleiner, Joe Benadon, and Pete Kameron.<ref name = Levin>[http://www.laweekly.com/2008-12-04/news/la-weekly-founder-jay-levin-on-the-the-vision-that-started-it-all/ ''L.A.
