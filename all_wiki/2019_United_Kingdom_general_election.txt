{{UK general election navigation|2010|2015|2017|2019}}

The '''2019 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday, 12 December 2019. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], having failed to obtain a majority in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], had faced [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|prolonged parliamentary deadlock over Brexit]] while it governed in [[minority government|minority]] with the [[Conservative-DUP agreement|support]] of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), a situation which had forced the resignation of the previous Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]].

In July 2019, after May's resignation, [[Boris Johnson]] was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected as Conservative leader]] and appointed as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Johnson could not induce Parliament to approve a revised [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]] by the end of October, and chose to call for a [[snap election]]. The House of Commons supported the [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]] by 438–20, setting the election date for 12 December.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-50229318 |title=UK set for 12 December general election |date=2019-10-29 |access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> [[Opinion polling for the 2019 United Kingdom general election|Opinion polls]] up to polling day showed a firm lead for the Conservatives against Labour throughout the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=Exit poll predicts 86-seat majority for Boris Johnson and Conservatives |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/12/exit-poll-predicts-majority-for-boris-johnson-and-conservatives |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 December 2019}}</ref>

The election resulted in the Conservative Party receiving a [[Landslide victory|landslide]] majority of 80 seats.{{refn|group=n|Given that the 7 Sinn Féin MPs [[Abstentionism#Sinn Féin|do not take their seats]] and the Speaker and deputies do not vote, they effectively have an 87-seat "working majority".<ref name=working/>}} The Conservatives made a net gain of 48 seats and won 43.6% of the popular vote – the highest percentage by any party since [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]].<ref name="Boris Elec 2019">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50776671 |title=Election results 2019: Boris Johnson hails 'new dawn' after historic victory |accessdate=13 December 2019 |publisher=BBC News |date=13 December 2019}}</ref> Many Conservative gains were made in long-held Labour Leave-voting seats dubbed the '[[Red wall (British politics)|red wall]]'.

== Background ==
{{Brexit sidebar}}
In July 2016, [[Theresa May]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], having taken over from [[David Cameron]] (who had resigned in the wake of the 2016 [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum]]). Her party{{snd}} the Conservative and Unionist Party{{snd}} had governed the UK since the [[2010 UK general election]], initially in coalition with the Liberal Democrats and after the [[2015 UK general election]], alone with a small majority. In the [[2017 UK general election]], May lost her majority but was able to resume office as a result of a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with Northern Ireland's [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. In the face of opposition from the DUP and Conservative [[back-bencher]]s, the [[second May ministry]] was unable to pass its [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] by 29 March 2019, so some political commentators considered that an early [[United Kingdom general election]] was likely.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2be9f604-5177-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49 |title=Will the Brexit impasse lead to a UK general election? |last=Blitz |first=James |date=29 March 2019 |website=Financial Times |url-status= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=30 March 2019}}</ref> The opposition [[Labour Party (United Kingdom)|Labour Party]] called for a January [[2019 vote of confidence in the May ministry]], but the motion failed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46899466 |title=May's government survives no-confidence vote |last= |first= |date=16 January 2019 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=30 March 2019}}</ref> May resigned after her party's poor performance in the [[2019 European Parliament election]], during the first extension granted by the European Union for negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. [[Boris Johnson]] won the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election]] and became Prime Minister on 23 July 2019. Along with attempting to revise the withdrawal agreement arranged by his predecessor's negotiations, Johnson made three attempts to hold a snap election under the process defined in the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which requires a two-thirds [[supermajority]] in order for an election to take place.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49584907 |title=Boris Johnson's call for general election rejected by MPs |date=5 September 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/04/cornered-boris-johnson-suffers-triple-commons-defeat |title=Cornered Boris Johnson suffers triple Commons defeat |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |date=4 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=5 September 2019 |last2=Elgot |first2=Jessica |issn=0261-3077 |last3=Walker |first3=Peter}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/mps-order-johnson-to-hand-over-aides-messages-about-prorogation |title=Boris Johnson loses sixth vote in six days as election bid fails |last=Mason |first=Rowena |date=5 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=10 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2c7e3810-f9a5-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229 |title=Johnson raises stakes in fresh election gambit |last1=Parker |first1=George |last2=Payne |first2=Sebastian |date=29 October 2019 |website=Financial Times |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

All three attempts to call an election failed to gain support: Parliament insisted that Johnson "take a [[no-deal Brexit]] off the table first" and secure a negotiated Withdrawal Agreement, expressed in particular by its enactment against his will of the [[European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019]] (often called the "Benn Act", after Labour MP [[Hilary Benn]], who introduced the bill). After failing to pass a revised deal before the first extension's deadline of 31 October 2019, Johnson agreed to a second extension on negotiations with the EU and finally secured a [[Brexit withdrawal agreement#Revisions in 2019|revised Withdrawal Agreement]]. Parliament  agreed to an election through a motion proposed by the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party on 28 October. The [[Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019]] (EPGEA) was passed in the Commons by 438 votes to 20; an attempt to pass an amendment by opposition parties for the election to be held on 9 December failed by 315 votes to 295.<ref name="auto">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/uk-general-election-confirmed-for-12-december-after-brexit-stalemate |title=Brexit: Parliament breaks deadlock with vote for 12 December election |last=Mason |first=Rowena |date=30 October 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=30 October 2019 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50221856 |title=MPs close to backing December election |date=29 October 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The House of Lords followed suit on 30 October,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2019-10-30/debates/E1BDD564-B642-4D86-A5DC-3EC807BF25DA/EarlyParliamentaryGeneralElectionBill |title=Early Parliamentary General Election Bill - Hansard |website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref> with Royal Assent made the day after for the ratification of the EPGEA.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2019-10-31/debates/E095C72C-6D9D-489F-BD54-CB67D51A195E/RoyalAssent |title=Royal Assent - Hansard |website=hansard.parliament.uk}}</ref>

As outlined above, the Conservative Party has governed in coalition or on its own since 2010, and has been led by [[Boris Johnson]] since July 2019. [[Jeremy Corbyn]] has been Labour Party leader since 2015 and was the first Labour leader since [[Tony Blair]] to contest consecutive general elections, as well as the first since [[Neil Kinnock]] to contest a second general election after losing the first. One other party, the Liberal Democrats, contested seats across Great Britain. They were led by [[Tim Farron]] at the 2017 election, before he was replaced by [[Vince Cable]]. Cable was [[2019 Liberal Democrats leadership election|succeeded]] by [[Jo Swinson]] in July 2019.<ref name="politicshome240519">{{cite news |url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/liberal-democrats/vince-cable/news/104141/vince-cable-kicks-lib-dem|title=Vince Cable kicks off Lib Dem leadership contest as he confirms departure date |last=Casalicchio |first=Emilio |date=24 May 2019 |access-date=24 May 2019 |website=PoliticsHome}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jo-swinson-leader-liberal-democrats-lib-dems-a9016006.html |title=Jo Swinson becomes first woman to be elected leader of Liberal Democrats |last1=Woodcock|first1=Andrew |date=22 July 2019 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=9 September 2019 |last2=Cowburn |first2=Ashley}}</ref> The [[Brexit Party]] contested somewhat under half the seats. It was founded in early 2019 by [[Nigel Farage]], former leader of the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), and won the most votes at the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|May 2019 European Parliament elections]]. The Brexit Party has largely replaced UKIP in British politics, with UKIP (which gained 12.6% of the vote but just one MP at the 2015 election) losing almost all its support. UKIP stood in 42 seats in Great Britain and two seats in Northern Ireland.

The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] has been led by [[Jonathan Bartley]] and [[Siân Berry]] since 2018, with its counterpart the [[Scottish Green Party]] standing in Scottish seats. The two parties stood in a total of 495 seats. The third-largest party in seats won at the 2017 election was the [[Scottish National Party]], led by [[Nicola Sturgeon]] since 2014, which stands only in Scotland but holds the majority (35 of 59 before this election) of seats there. Similarly, [[Plaid Cymru]], led by [[Adam Price]], stands only in Wales where it holds 4 of 40 seats.

===Northern Ireland===
{{Main|2019 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland}}
While a number of UK parties organise in Northern Ireland (including the [[Labour Party in Northern Ireland|Labour Party]], which does not field candidates) and others field candidates for election (most notably the [[Northern Ireland Conservatives|Conservatives]]), the main Northern Ireland parties are different from those in the rest of the UK.

Some parties in Northern Ireland operate on an all-[[Ireland]] basis, including [[Sinn Féin]] and [[Aontú]], who are [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] parties and do not take up any Commons seats to which they are elected. The only [[Independent politician|independent]] elected to Parliament in 2017, [[Sylvia Hermon]], represented [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]] but did not stand in 2019.

In the 2019 election, there were a total of 102 candidates in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50390811 |title=Candidates confirmed for general election |last=McCormack |first=Jayne |date=14 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The election result was particularly notable in Northern Ireland as the first Westminster election in which the number of [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] elected exceeded the number of [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]].

===Electoral pacts and unilateral decisions===
{{see|Unite to Remain}}
[[File:British remain alliance.png|left|thumb|Constituencies where the ''Unite to Remain'' pact was active. Coloured by which party stood a candidate.]]
In England and Wales, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and the Green Party of England and Wales – parties sharing an [[Opposition to Brexit in the United Kingdom|anti-Brexit position]] – arranged a "[[Unite to Remain]]" pact. Labour declined to be involved. This agreement meant that in 60 constituencies only one of these parties, the one considered to have the best chance of winning, stood. This pact aimed to maximise the total number of anti-Brexit MPs returned under the first-past-the-post system by avoiding the [[spoiler effect]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/remain-alliance-seats-general-election-brexit-lib-dems-greens-plaid-cymru-a9188856.html|title=Full list of 60 'Remain alliance' seats revealed as Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru agree pact to stop Brexit|last=Woodcock|first=Andrew|date=7 November 2019|accessdate=7 November 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref>

The Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage had suggested the Brexit and Conservative parties could form an electoral pact to maximise the seats taken by Brexit-supporting MPs, but this was rejected by Johnson.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/why-johnson-will-reject-nigel-farages-leave-alliance-election-offer-2019-11/ |title=Boris Johnson will reject Nigel Farage's election offer of a Brexit alliance pact |last=Colson |first=Thomas  |date=2 November 2019 |website=Business Insider France |accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref> On 11 November, Farage announced that his party would not stand in any of the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the last election. This was welcomed by the Conservative Party chairman [[James Cleverly]], and he insisted there had been no contact between them and the Brexit Party over the plan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50377396 |title=Brexit Party rules out standing in Tory seats |date=11 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> ''[[Newsnight]]'' reported that conversations between members of the Brexit Party and the Conservative, pro-Brexit research support group [[European Research Group]] (ERG) led to this decision.<ref name="newsnight11">{{cite episode |title=Newsnight - 11 November 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.com/iplayer/episode/m000b8x8/newsnight-11112019 |accessdate=11 November 2019 |series=Newsnight |series-link=Newsnight |publisher=BBC |station=[[BBC Two]] |date=11 November 2019 |time=00:56 |quote=But first, this programme can reveal the hushed conversations that have been going on between members of the Brexit Party and the Brexiteer Conservatives known as the ERG group.}}</ref> The Brexit Party reportedly requested that Johnson publicly state he would not extend the Brexit transition period beyond the planned end of December 2020 date and that he wished for a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU. Johnson did make a statement covering these two issues, something which Farage referenced as key when announcing he was standing down some candidates.

=== 2017–19 MPs standing under a different political affiliation ===
The 2017-19 Parliament was defined by a significant amount of political instability, and consequently; a large number of defections and switching between parties. This was due to issues such as disquiet over [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|anti-semitism in the Labour Party]], and divisions over Brexit in the Conservative Party. Eighteen MPs elected in 2017 contested the election for a different party or as an independent candidate; five stood for a different seat. All of these candidates failed to be re-elected.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] have been the two biggest political parties, and have supplied every [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] since [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]. The Conservative Party have governed since the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]], in coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] from 2010 to 2015. At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] the Conservative Party committed to offering a referendum on [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|whether the UK should leave the European Union]] and won a majority in that election. A referendum was held in June 2016, and the Leave campaign won by 51.9% to 48.1%. [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|The UK initiated the withdrawal process]] in March 2017, and Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] triggered [[2017 United Kingdom general election|a snap general election in 2017]], in order to demonstrate support for her planned negotiation of Brexit. The Conservative Party lost seats – they won a plurality of MPs, but not a majority. As a result, they formed a minority government, with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) as their [[confidence and supply]] partner. Neither May nor her successor [[Boris Johnson]] (winner of the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election]])<ref name="bbc240519">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48395905|title=Theresa May to resign as prime minister |date=24 May 2019 |access-date=24 May 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref name="bbc230719">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49084605 |title=Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM |date=23 July 2019 |access-date=31 October 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> was able to secure parliamentary support either for a deal on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, or for exiting the EU without an agreed deal. Johnson later succeeded in bringing his Withdrawal Agreement to a second reading in Parliament, following another extension until January 2020.

During the lifespan of the 2017 parliament, twenty MPs quit their parties, most due to disputes with their party leaderships; some formed new parties and alliances. In February 2019, eight Labour and three Conservative MPs resigned from their parties to sit together as [[The Independent Group]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Three Tory MPs join breakaway group |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47306022 |accessdate=20 February 2019 |publisher=BBC News |date=20 February 2019}}</ref> Having undergone a split and two name changes, at dissolution this group numbered five MPs who sat as the registered party [[The Independent Group for Change]] under the leadership of [[Anna Soubry]].<ref name="telegraph290319">{{cite news |url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/news/102876/independent-group-becomes-change-uk-stand-european-elections |title=The Independent Group becomes 'Change UK' to stand in European elections |first=Kevin |last=Schofield |date=29 March 2019 |work=[[PoliticsHome]] |access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-labour-party-independent-group-change-anna-soubry-mps-a9041151.html |title=Independent Group calls for new members to become 'fully fledged political party' |last=Woodcock |first=Andrew |date=6 August 2019 |work=The Independent |access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref> Two MPs sat in a group called [[The Independents (UK)|The Independents]] (which at its peak had five members), one MP created the [[Birkenhead Social Justice Party]], while a further 20 MPs who began as Labour or Conservative ended the Parliament as unaffiliated independents. Seven MPs, from both the Conservatives and Labour, joined the Liberal Democrats during the parliament, in combination with a [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election|by-election gain]]. The Lib Dems ultimately raised their number from 12 at the election to 20 at dissolution.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/tory-rebel-antoinette-sandbach-joins-lib-dems-ahead-of-election |title=Tory rebel Antoinette Sandbach joins Lib Dems ahead of election |last=Walker |first=Peter |date=31 October 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=15 November 2019 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

One reason for the defections from the Labour Party was the ongoing row over [[antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|antisemitism in the Labour Party]]. Labour entered the election campaign while under investigation by the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/europe/britain-election-antisemitism.html |title=At Odds With Labour, Britain's Jews Are Feeling Politically Homeless |first=Benjamin |last=Mueller |date=21 November 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> The [[Jewish Labour Movement]] declared it would not generally campaign for Labour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thejc.com/comment/comment/jewish-labour-movement-not-campaigning-mike-katz-1.490941 |title=Our Labour values have not changed but we can't support a leader who has so utterly failed on antisemitism |last=Katz |first=Mike |date=1 November 2019 |work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> The Conservative Party was also criticised for not doing enough to tackle the alleged [[Islamophobia in the UK Conservative Party (1997–present)|Islamophobia in the party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/andy-macdonald-and-dominic-raab-on-sky-news-1-6390585 |title=Tory minister cornered over Islamophobia live on television |first=Jonathon |last=Read |website=The New European}}</ref>

The Conservatives ended the previous parliamentary period with fewer seats than they had started with because of defections and also the [[September 2019 suspension of rebel Conservative MPs|expulsion of a number of MPs]] for going against the [[Whip (politics)|party line]] by voting to prevent a [[no-deal Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49563357 |title=Who were the Conservative Brexit rebels? |date=2019-09-05 |access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> Of the 21 expelled, 10 were subsequently reinstated, while others continued as [[Independent politician|independents]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[ITV News]] |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-29/whip-restored-to-10-conservative-mps-who-rebelled-against-government-over-brexit/ |title=Whip restored to 10 Conservative MPs who rebelled against government over Brexit |date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

===Policy positions===
====Brexit====
The major parties had a wide variety of stances on Brexit. The Conservative Party supported leaving under the terms of the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]] as negotiated by Johnson (amending Theresa May's previous agreement), and this agreement formed a central part of the Conservative campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/02/in-election-pitch-uk-pm-johnson-backs-his-deal-over-no-deal-brexit.html |title=In election pitch, UK PM Johnson backs his deal over no-deal Brexit |date=2 November 2019 |website=CNBC |access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> The [[Brexit Party]] was in favour of a no-deal Brexit, with its leader [[Nigel Farage]] calling for Johnson to drop the deal.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/farage-to-johnson-join-forces-or-brexit-party-will-contest-every-seat |title=Boris Johnson faces threat of Brexit party battle in every seat |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |date=1 November 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 November 2019 |last2=Proctor |first2=Kate |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Labour Party proposed a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement (towards a closer post-withdrawal relationship with the EU) and would then put this forward as an option in a referendum alongside the option of remaining in the EU.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/23/labour-conference-brexit-pro-remain-activists-corbyn |title=What does Labour vote signify about where it stands on Brexit? |last1=Mason |first1=Rowena |date=23 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 November 2019 |last2=Rankin |first2=Jennifer |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The Labour Party's campaigning stance in that referendum would be decided at a special conference.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/11/labours-brexit-policy-clear-shadow-cabinet-must-get-behind-it |title=Labour's Brexit policy is clear.

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), [[Plaid Cymru]], [[Change UK|The Independent Group for Change]], and the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] were all opposed to Brexit, and proposed that a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|further referendum]] be held with the option – for which they would campaign – to remain in the EU.<ref name="BBCBrexit">{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48027580 |title=General election 2019: Brexit - where do the parties stand? |date=5 December 2019}}</ref> The Liberal Democrats originally pledged that if they formed a majority government (considered a highly unlikely outcome by observers),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum |title=Lib Dems pledge to revoke Brexit without referendum |last=Walker |first=Pete |date=15 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 November 2019 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> they would revoke the Article 50 notification immediately and cancel Brexit.<ref name="BBCBrexit"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.libdems.org.uk/brexit |title=Brexit |date=17 April 2018 |publisher=Liberal Democrats}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum |title=Lib Dems pledge to revoke Brexit without referendum |work=The Guardian |first=Peter |last=Walker |date=15 September 2019 |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="bbcsummary">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48027580 |title=Party-by-party guide to the UK's European elections |date=22 May 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Part-way through the campaign, the Liberal Democrats dropped the policy of revoking Article 50 after the party realised it was not going to win a majority in the election.<ref>{{cite news |first=Albert |last=Evans |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/bbc-news-lib-dems-breakfast-layla-moran-naha-munchetty-1327026 |title=Lib Dems have 'gone back to plan A' of a second Brexit referendum instead of revoking Article 50, says Layla Moran |date=28 November 2019 |work=inews.co.uk}}</ref>

The [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) was in favour of a withdrawal agreement in principle, but it opposed the deals negotiated by both May and Johnson, believing that they create too great a divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-47718367 |title=Brexit: DUP confirms it will not back withdrawal deal |publisher=BBC News |first=Jayne |last=McCormack |date=28 March 2019 |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50079317 |title=DUP says PM 'too eager to get deal at any cost' |date=17 October 2019 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> [[Sinn Féin]], the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP)<ref name=cansteve>{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/11/can-steve-aiken-save-ulster-unionist-party |title=Can Steve Aiken save the Ulster Unionist Party? |website=www.newstatesman.com}}</ref> and [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance]] all favoured remaining in the EU. The UUP did not see a second referendum as a necessary route to achieving this goal.<ref name=cansteve />

====The environment====

The Labour Party promised what they described as a green industrial revolution. This included support for renewable energies and a promise to plant 2 billion trees by 2040. The party also promised to transition to electrify the UK's bus fleet by 2030.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/labour-vows-to-electrify-englands-entire-bus-fleet-by-2030 |title=Labour vows to electrify England's entire bus fleet by 2030 |last=Perraudin |first=Frances |date=2019-12-06 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2020-01-06 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Lib Dems also promised to put the environment at the heart of their agenda with a promise to plant 60 million trees a year. They also promised to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030 and hit zero carbon emissions by 2045. By 2030 they planned to generate 80% of the country's energy needs from renewable energies such as solar power and wind and retrofit 26 million homes with insulation by 2030. They also promised to build more environmentally friendly homes and to establish a new Department for the Climate Crisis.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The Conservatives pledged net zero emissions by 2050 with investment in clean energy solutions and green infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions and pollution. They also pledged to plant 30 million trees.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The Conservatives were judged the worst of the main parties on climate change by [[Friends of the Earth]] with a manifesto which mentioned it only ten times.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://friendsoftheearth.uk/general-election/election-manifestos-labour-tops-friends-earths-climate-and-nature-league-table |title=Election manifestos: Labour tops Friends of the Earth's climate and nature league table |website=Friends of the Earth |access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

==== Tax and spending commitments ====
In September 2019, the Conservative government performed a spending review, where they announced plans to increase public spending by £13.8 billion/year, and reaffirmed plans to spend another £33.9 billion/year on the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) by 2023. Chancellor [[Sajid Javid]] said the government had turned the page on 10 years of austerity.<ref name="SpendGuard">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/30/public-spending-pledges-tories-conservatives-sajid-javid-election |title=Tory spending plans: Sajid Javid's key pledges |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> During the election the parties produced manifestos that outlined spending in addition to those already planned.

The Conservative manifesto was described as having "little in the way of changes to tax" by the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]]. The decision to keep the rate of corporation tax at 19%, and not reduce it to 17% as planned, is expected to raise £6 billion/year. The plan to increase the national insurance threshold for employees and self-employed to £9,500 will cost £2 billion/year.<ref name="IFS2">{{cite web |url=https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/IFS-General-election-analysis-2019-Tax-Stuart-Adam.pdf |title=General election analysis 2019 |date=28 November 2019 |website=[[Institute of Fiscal Studies]] |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> They also committed to not raise rates of income tax, [[National Insurance]] or [[Value-added tax|VAT]].<ref name="ToryMan">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50532000 |title=Tory manifesto 'to forge a new Britain' - Johnson |date=24 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> There are increased spending commitments of £3 billion current spending and £8 billion investment spending. This would overall lead to the UK's debt as a percentage of GDP remaining stable (the IFS assesses that it would rise in the event of a no-deal Brexit).<ref name="IFS3">{{cite web |url=https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/Manifesto-analysis-Public-finances-general%20election-2019_V2.pdf |title=The outlook for the public finances: the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos compared |date=28 November 2019 |website=[[Institute of Fiscal Studies]] |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

The Labour manifesto planned to raise an extra £78 billion/year from taxes over the course of the parliament, with sources including:<ref name="IFS2"/>
* £24bn – raising the headline rate of corporation tax to 26%
* £6.3bn – tax multinationals' global profits according to UK share of global employment/assets/sales, not UK profits
* £4.0bn – abolish patent box & R&D tax credit for large companies
* £4.3bn – cutting unspecified corporation tax reliefs
* £9bn – financial transactions tax
* £14bn – dividends and capital gains
* £6bn – anti-avoidance
* £5bn – increases in income tax rates above £80,000/year
* £5bn – other

In addition, Labour was to obtain income from the Inclusive Ownership Fund, windfall tax on oil companies, and some smaller tax changes. There were increased spending commitments of £98 billion current spending and £55 billion investment spending. This would, overall, have led to the UK's debt as a percentage of GDP rising.<ref name="IFS3"/> Labour's [[John McDonnell]] said borrowing would only be for investment and one-offs (e.g. compensating [[Women Against State Pension Inequality|WASPI]] women, not shown above), and not for day-to-day spending.<ref name="DebtGuard">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/mcdonnell-rejects-claims-labour-policy-would-leave-people-worse-off|title=McDonnell rejects claims Labour would leave people worse off |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

The Liberal Democrat manifesto plans to raise an extra £36 billion/year from taxes over the course of the parliament, with sources including:<ref name="IFS2"/>
* £10bn – raising corporation tax to 20%
* £7bn – 1% point rise in all rates of income tax
* £5bn – abolish CGT allowance
* £5bn – air passenger duty on frequent flyers
* £6bn – anti-avoidance
* £3bn – other

There are increased commitments of £37 billion current spending and £26 billion investment spending, which would overall lead to the UK's debt as a percentage of GDP falling, partly due to improved economic conditions which would result from staying in the EU.<ref name="IFS3"/>

===== Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis =====
The [[Institute of Fiscal Studies]] (IFS), an influential research body, released on 28 November its in-depth analysis of the [[manifesto]]s of the three main national political parties. The analysis both provides a summary of the financial promises made by each party, and an inspection of the accuracy of claims around government income and expenditure.<ref name="IFSGuard">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/28/ifs-manifesto-verdict-neither-tories-nor-labour-have-credible-spending-plan |title=IFS manifesto verdict: neither Tories nor Labour have credible spending plan |date=28 November 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="IFSFinTimes">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.ft.com/content/b01a1286-11db-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae |title=UK parties not being 'honest with the electorate', think-tank says |date=28 November 2019 |newspaper=Financial Times |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="IFSTimes">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tories-and-labour-lack-credible-spending-plans-say-think-tanks-2fwtlngxq |title=Tories and Labour 'lack credible spending plans' |date=28 November 2019 |newspaper=The Times |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="IFS1">{{cite web |url=https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/manifestos |title=Party manifestos |date=28 November 2019 |website=[[Institute of Fiscal Studies]] |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="IFS2" /> The IFS reported that neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party had published a "properly credible prospectus".<ref name="IFSGuard" />

Its analysis of the Conservative manifesto concluded there was "essentially nothing new in the manifesto", that there was "little in the way of changes to tax, spending, welfare or anything else", and that they had already promised increased spending for health and education whilst in government. The Labour manifesto was described as introducing "enormous economic and social change", and increasing the role of the state to be bigger than anything in the last 40 years.<ref name="IFSTK">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/28/ifs-manifesto-labour-economy-investment |title=Look closer at the IFS manifesto report. Labour's vision is the only way |last=Kibasi |first=Tom |date=28 November 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> The IFS highlighted a raft of changes in including free childcare, university, personal care and prescriptions, as well nationalisations, labour market regulations, increases in the minimum wage, and enforcing "effective ownership of 10% of large companies from current owners to a combination of employees and government". Labour's vision, the IFS said, "is of a state not so dissimilar to those seen in many other successful Western European economies" and presumed that the manifesto should be seen as "a long-term prospectus for change rather than a realistic deliverable plan for a five-year parliament".<ref name="IFSTK" /> They said the Liberal Democrat manifesto is not as radical as the Labour manifesto but was a "decisive move away from the policies of the past decade".<ref name="IFSFinTimes" /><ref name="IFSTimes" /><ref name="IFS1" /><ref name="IFS2" />

The Conservative manifesto was criticised for a commitment not to raise rates of income tax, [[National Insurance|NICs]] or [[Value-added tax|VAT]] as this put a significant constraint on reactions to events that might affect government finances. One such event could be the "die in a ditch" promise to terminate the Brexit transition period by the end of 2020, which risked harming the economy.<ref name="IFSTK" /> The IFS also stated that it is "highly likely" spending under a Conservative government would be higher than in that party's manifesto, partly due to a number of uncosted commitments.<ref name="IFSGuard" /><ref name="IFSFinTimes" /><ref name="IFSTimes" /><ref name="IFS1" /><ref name="IFS2" /> Outside of commitments to the NHS, the proposals would leave public service spending 14% lower in 2023–2024 than it was in 2010–2011, which the IFS described as "no more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in".<ref name="IFSStand">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tax-rises-coming-whoever-wins-the-election-leading-economists-warn-a4299121.html |title=Tax rises coming whoever wins the election, leading economists warn |date=27 November 2019 |newspaper=Evening Standard |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

The IFS stated it had "serious doubt" that tax rises proposed would raise the amount Labour suggested, and said that they would need to introduce more broad based tax increases. They assess that the public sector does not have the capacity to increase investment spending as Labour would want. The IFS assesses the claim that tax rises will only hit the top 5% of earners, as "certainly progressive", but "clearly not true", with those under that threshold impacted by changes to the marriage allowance, taxes on dividends or capital gains, and lower wages/higher prices that might be passed on from corporation tax changes. Some of Labour's proposals are described as "huge and complex undertakings", where significant care is required in implementation. The IFS is particularly critical of the policy to compensate the so-called "WASPI women", announced after the manifesto, which is a £58bn promise to women who are "relatively well off on average" and will result in public finances going off target. They said that Labour's manifesto would not increase UK public spending as a share of national income above Germany.<ref name="IFSGuard" /><ref name="IFSFinTimes" /><ref name="IFSTimes" /><ref name="IFS1" /><ref name="IFS2" /> They found that Labour's plan to spend and invest would boost economic growth, but the impact of tax rises, government regulation, nationalisations and the inclusive ownership fund could reduce growth, meaning the overall impact of Labour's plan on growth is uncertain.<ref name="IFSTK" /><ref name="IFS1" />

The IFS described the Liberal Democrats' plans as a "radical" tax and spend package, and said that the proposals would require lower borrowing than Conservative or Labour plans. The report said they were the only party whose proposals would put debt "on a decisively downward path", praising their plan to put 1p on income tax to go to the NHS as "simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue". The IFS also said plans to "virtually quintuple" current spending levels on universal free childcare amounted to "creating a whole new leg of the universal welfare state".<ref name="IFSStand2">{{cite newspaper |title=IFS key verdicts on the party spending plans |date=28 November 2019 |newspaper=Evening Standard |page=5}}</ref><ref name="IFS1" />

The IFS said that the SNP's manifesto was not costed. Their proposals on spending increases and tax cuts would mean the UK government would have to borrow to cover day-to-day spending. They conclude that the SNP's plans for Scottish independence would likely require increased austerity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/why-snp-election-manifesto-is-overshadowed-by-austerity-of-independent-scotland-ifs-1-5056102 |title=Why SNP election manifesto is overshadowed by austerity of independent Scotland – IFS |website=www.scotsman.com}}</ref>

==== Other issues ====
The Conservative Party proposed increasing spending on the NHS, although not as much of an increase as Labour and Liberal Democrat proposals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50521323|title=Your Questions: Are there record numbers of doctors and nurses? |date=24 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> They also proposed increased funding for childcare and on the environment. They proposed more funding for care services and to work with other parties on reforming how care is delivered. They wish to maintain the "triple lock" on pensions. They proposed investing in local infrastructure, including building a new rail line between Leeds and Manchester.<ref name="ToryMan"/>

Labour proposed significantly increasing government spending to 45% of national output, which would be high compared to most of UK history, but is comparable with other European countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/24/labours-spending-plans-arent-especially-unusual-just-look-at-sweden |title=Labour's spending plans aren't especially unusual – just look at Sweden |first=Larry |last=Elliott |date=24 November 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> This was to pay for an increased NHS budget; stopping state pension age rises; introducing a National Care Service providing free personal care; move to a net-zero carbon economy by the 2030s; nationalising key industries; scrapping [[universal credit]]; free bus travel for under-25s; building 100,000 council houses per year; and other proposals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50501411 |title=What are the 12 key policies in the Labour manifesto? |date=21 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Within this, the Labour Party proposed to take rail-operating companies, energy supply networks, Royal Mail, sewerage infrastructure, and England's private water companies back into public ownership.

The Liberal Democrats' main priority was opposing Brexit. Other policies included increased spending on the NHS; free childcare for two-to-four-year-olds; recruiting 20,000 more teachers; generating 80% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030; freezing train fares; and legalising cannabis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50459123 |title=What is in the Liberal Democrats manifesto? |date=20 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

The Brexit Party was also focused on Brexit. It opposed privatising the NHS. It sought to reduce immigration, cutting net migration to 50,000 per year; cutting VAT on domestic fuel; banning the exporting of waste; free broadband in deprived regions; scrapping the BBC licence fee; and abolishing inheritance tax, interest on student loans, and [[HS2]]. It also wanted to move to a US-style [[supreme court]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50515516 |title=What are the Brexit Party's 12 key policies? |date=22 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

===Party positions in the event of a hung Parliament===
The Conservatives and Labour both insisted they were on course for outright majorities, but smaller parties were quizzed about what they would do in the event of a hung Parliament. The Liberal Democrats said they would not actively support Johnson or Corbyn becoming Prime Minister, but that they could, if an alternative could not be achieved, abstain on votes allowing a minority government to form if there was support for a second referendum on Brexit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50497282 |title=Lib Dems consider hung Parliament options |date=20 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The SNP ruled out either supporting the Conservatives or a coalition with Labour, but spoke about a looser form of support, such as a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement with the latter, if they supported a second referendum on [[Scottish independence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18016496.nicola-sturgeon-leaves-open-idea-dup-style-deal-labour/ |title=Nicola Sturgeon leaves open idea of DUP-style deal with Labour |last=Grant |first=Alistair |date=5 November 2019 |website=[[The Herald (Scotland)|The Herald]]}}</ref>

The DUP previously supported the Conservative government, but withdrew that support given their opposition to Johnson's proposed Brexit deal. It said it would never support Corbyn as prime minister, but could work with Labour if that party were led by someone else. Labour's position on a hung parliament was that it would do no deals with any other party, citing Corbyn to say "We are out here to win it"—although sources say it was prepared to adopt key policies proposed by the SNP and Lib Dems to woo them into supporting a minority government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/election-2019-labour-looks-at-plans-for-hung-parliament-0g3wds0sv |title=Election 2019: Labour looks at plans for hung parliament |first=Oliver |last=Wright |via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/arlene-foster-and-dup-on-jeremy-corbyn-and-election-1-6391635 |title=DUP could support a Labour government in the event of a hung parliament, says Foster |first=Jonathon |last=Read |date=24 November 2019 |website=The New European}}</ref> The UUP has also said they would never support Corbyn as Prime Minister, with their leader Steve Aiken saying he "can't really see" any situation in which they would support a Conservative government either.

===Tactical voting===
Under the [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] electoral system, voter turn-out (especially in [[marginal seat]]s) has a crucial impact on the final election outcome{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}, so major political parties disproportionately focus on opinion poll trends and these constituencies. In the early stages of the campaign, there was considerable discussion of [[tactical voting]] (generally in the context of support or opposition to Brexit) and whether parties would stand in all seats or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://inews.co.uk/opinion/alliances-and-electoral-pacts-show-just-our-broken-our-voting-system-is-whoever-you-support-1000918 |title=Electoral pacts show just how broken our voting system is - whoever you support |last=Sullivan |first=Willie |date=14 November 2019 |work=[[i (newspaper)|i]] |accessdate=14 November 2019}}</ref> There were various [[#Electoral pacts and unilateral decisions|electoral pacts and unilateral decisions]]. The Brexit Party chose not to stand against sitting Conservative candidates, but stood in most other constituencies. The Brexit Party alleged that pressure was put on its candidates by the Conservatives to withdraw, including the offer of peerages, which would be illegal.

Momentum also developed an [[Web application|app]] called My Campaign Map that updated members about where they could be more effective, particularly in canvassing in marginal constituencies. Over one weekend during the campaign period, 700 Labour supporters campaigned in [[Iain Duncan Smith]]'s constituency, [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]], which was regarded as a marginal, with a majority of 2,438 votes at the 2017 general election.<ref name="InsideMomentum">{{cite news |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/12/inside-momentum-we-re-going-be-here-long-after-jeremy-corbyn-and-i-are-dead |title=Inside Momentum: "We're going to be here long after Jeremy Corbyn and I are dead |last=Easton |first=George |date=4 December 2019 |work=New Statesman}}</ref>

In the first week of November, Labour is reported to have four of the five most "liked" [[Twitter|tweets]] by political parties, many of the top interactions of [[Facebook]] posts, as well as being "dominant" on [[Instagram]], where younger voters are particularly active.<ref name="SocialTimes">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labours-simple-message-is-winning-social-media-war-ckhk3djpx|title=Labour's simple message is winning social media war |date=7 November 2019 |newspaper=The Times |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported that between 6 and 21 November, the views on Twitter/Facebook were 18.7m/31.0m for Labour, 10m/15.5m for the Conservatives, 2.9m/2.0m for the Brexit Party, and 0.4m/1.4m for the Liberal Democrats.<ref name="SocialBloom">{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/corbyn-leads-the-election-cyber-war-but-tories-improve-on-2017|title=Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Is Winning the U.K. Election Digital War |date=22 November 2019 |website=Bloomberg |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

Brexit was the most tweeted topic for the Conservative Party (~45% of tweets), the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party (~40% each). Labour focused on health (24.1%), the environment, and business, mentioning Brexit in less than 5 percent of its tweets.<ref name="CRCC5"/> Devolution was the topic most tweeted about by the SNP (29.8%) and Plaid Cymru (21.4%), and the environment was the top issue for the Green Party (45.9%) on Twitter. The Conservatives were unique in their focus on taxation (16.2%), and the Brexit Party on defence (14%).<ref name="CRCC5"/>

Prior to the campaign, the Conservatives contracted New Zealand marketing agency Topham Guerin, which has been credited with helping Australia's [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal–National Coalition]] unexpectedly win the [[2019 Australian federal election]]. The agency's social media approach is described as purposefully posting badly-designed social media material, which becomes viral and so is seen by a wider audience.<ref name="SocialSydney">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.smh.com/federal-election-2019/how-the-liberals-beat-labor-at-its-own-game-20190523-p51qki.html|title=How the Liberals beat Labor at its own game |date=26 May 2019 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="SocialGuard">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/tories-hire-facebook-propaganda-pair-to-run-online-election-campaign |title=Tories hire Facebook propaganda pair to run online election campaign |date=23 October 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> Some of the Conservative social media activity created headlines challenging whether it was deceptive.<ref name="BBCNews-19NOV19-factcheckUK"/><ref name="SocialGuard2"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Fergal |last=Gallagher |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/conservative-party-accused-peddling-disinformation-ahead-uk-election/story?id=67204266 |title=Conservative party accused of peddling disinformation ahead of UK election |date=26 November 2019 |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Tidy |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50595930 |title=General election 2019: BBC complains to Tories over Facebook advert |date=28 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Stone |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-general-election-advert-ban-google-fake-news-manifesto-labour-a9223846.html |title=Google bans eight different Tory election adverts as disinformation concerns mount |date=1 December 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref> This included editing a clip of [[Keir Starmer]] to appear he was unable to answer a question about Labour's Brexit policy.<ref name="SocialGuard2">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/tories-unrepentant-about-doctored-video-of-keir-starmer-tv-appearance |title=Keir Starmer: Tories' doctored TV footage is 'act of desperation' |last1=Waterson |first1=Jim |last2=Syal |first2=Rajeev |date=6 November 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> In response to criticism over the doctored Starmer footage, Conservative Party chairman [[James Cleverly]] said the clip of Starmer was satire and "obviously edited".<ref name="SocialGuard2"/>

The Conservatives were the only party with an overall positive coverage, while Labour had the most negative coverage.]]
According to [[Loughborough University]]'s Centre for Research in Communication and Culture (CRCC), media coverage of the first week of the campaign was dominated by the Conservatives and Labour, with the leaders of both parties being the most represented campaigners (Johnson with 20.8%; Corbyn with 18.8%).<ref name="CRCC1">{{cite news |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/news-events/general-election/report-1/ |title=General Election 2019 Report 1: 7 November – 13 November 2019 |publisher=Centre for Research in Communication and Culture ([[Loughborough University]])}}</ref><ref name="Woodcock">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-latest-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-trump-presidential-a9218456.html |title=General election coverage becoming increasingly 'presidential' as smaller parties are sidelined, research finds |last=Woodcock |first=Andrew |date=26 November 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref> Due to this, the election coverage has been characterised as increasingly 'presidential' as smaller parties have been marginalised.<ref name="Woodcock"/>

In [[Television news|television coverage]], [[Boris Johnson]] had a particularly high-profile (30.4% against Corbyn's 22.6%). Labour (32%) and the Conservative Party (33%) received about a third of TV coverage each.

In [[newspaper]]s, Labour received two-fifths (40%) of the coverage and the Conservatives 35%. Spokespeople from both parties were quoted near equally, with Conservative sources being the most prominent in both press and TV coverage in terms of frequency of appearance. [[Sajid Javid]] and [[John McDonnell]] featured prominently during the first week because the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|economy]] was a top story for the media. McDonnell had more coverage than Javid on both TV and in print.<ref name="CRCC1"/>

A large proportion of the newspaper coverage of Labour was negative.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Peat |url=https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/the-proof-we-have-been-waiting-for-jeremy-corbyn-has-the-entire-media-elite-against-him/19/11/ |title=The proof we have been waiting for: Jeremy Corbyn has the entire media elite against him |date=19 November 2019 |work=[[The London Economic]]}}</ref> Researches from the CRCC commented that this indicated the press was partisan and were "pulling out all the stops against Labour".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://theconversation.com/uk-election-2019-partisan-press-is-pulling-out-all-the-stops-against-labour-127133 |title=UK election 2019: partisan press is pulling out all the stops against Labour |last1=Deacon |first1=David |last2=Wring |first2=Dominic |date=15 November 2019 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]}}</ref> James Hanning, writing in the [[British Journalism Review]], said that, when reporting and commenting on Boris Johnson, Conservative supporting newspapers made little mention of "a track record that would have sunk any other politician".<ref name="BJR">Hanning, James.

The Liberal Democrats were the party with the most TV coverage in the first week after Labour and the Conservatives, with an eighth of all reporting (13%). In newspapers they received less coverage than the Brexit Party, whose leader [[Nigel Farage]] received nearly as much coverage (12.3%) as Johnson and Corbyn (17.4% each). Most of this coverage regarded the Brexit Party's proposed electoral pact with the Conservatives.<ref name="CRCC1"/> The Brexit Party (7%) and the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] (5%) were fourth and fifth in terms of TV coverage, respectively.<ref name="CRCC1"/>

===Dominant issues===
As during the 2017 election, the electoral process was the most covered media topic for this election (31% of all coverage).<ref name="CRCC5"/> Brexit was the most prominent policy issue on both TV (18%) and in the press (11%), followed by the economy and health (8% and 7% of all coverage respectively).<ref name="CRCC5"/> However, there was little focused analysis on what the implementation of Brexit policies might mean, in contrast the analysis of other manifesto commitments on the economy, for example.<ref name="CRCC5"/> How Brexit might effect the union between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland received some prominence on TV but little coverage in the press.<ref name="CRCC5"/> According to the Centre for Research in Communication and Culture, "Standards/scandals" received as much coverage overall as health.<ref name="CRCC5"/>

===Gender balance===
Of the 20 most prominent spokespeople in media coverage of the first week of the election period, five were women, with SNP leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|Scottish First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]], in seventh place, the most featured.<ref name="CRCC1"/> Women (including, e.g., [[Citizenship|citizens]], [[expert]]s, [[Opinion poll|pollsters]], [[Businessperson|businesspeople]], [[trade union]] representatives, etc.) featured in 23.9% of coverage and men in 76.1%. Men spoke three times as much as women in TV coverage, and five times as much in newspaper coverage.<ref name="CRCC1"/><ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[itv.com|ITV]] |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-15/gender-imbalance-in-general-election-media-coverage-as-women-marginalised/ |title=Gender imbalance in General Election media coverage as women 'marginalised' |date=15 November 2019}}</ref>

The chart below depicts the results of opinion polls, mostly only of voters in [[Great Britain]], conducted from the 2017 United Kingdom general election until the election. The line plotted is the average of the last 15 polls and the larger circles at the end represent the actual results of the election. The graph shows that following Johnson's election in July, the Conservatives established a clear lead over Labour and simultaneously, support for the Brexit Party declined from its peak in summer 2019. The Spreadex columns below cover bets on the number of seats each party will win with the midpoint between asking and selling price.

===Predictions three weeks before the vote===
The [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] system used in UK general elections means that the number of seats won is not directly related to vote share. Thus, several approaches are used to convert polling data and other information into seat predictions. The table below lists some of the predictions.

The Conservative Party won a [[landslide victory]] securing 365 seats out of 650, giving them an overall majority of 80 seats in the House of Commons. They gained seats in several Labour Party strongholds in Northern England that were held by the party for decades, which had formed the '[[Red wall (British politics)|red wall]]'. The constituency of [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]] elected a Conservative MP for the first time in its 134-year history.

The Liberal Democrats won 11 seats, down 1, despite significantly increasing their share of the popular vote. Leader Jo Swinson lost her seat to Amy Callaghan of the SNP by 150 votes, and was disqualified from continuing as Liberal Democrat leader, with a leadership election due in August 2020.

While the Conservatives gained support in England and Wales, they lost support in Scotland in the face of a major SNP advance. The Conservatives won in England, advancing by 1.7% and gaining 48 seats to win 345 out of 533, while Labour fell back by 8% and lost 47 seats to win just 180.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2019/results/england |title=England results |date=13 December 2019 |accessdate=14 December 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Labour won in Wales, though it lost 8% of its 2017 vote share and six seats, retaining 22 out of 40, while the Conservatives advanced by 2.5% and gained six seats, winning 14 in total.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2019/results/wales |title=Wales results |date=13 December 2019 |accessdate=14 December 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> The SNP won by a landslide in Scotland, advancing by 8.1% and gaining 13 seats to win 48 out of 59, gaining several seats from the Conservatives and Labour. The Conservatives lost 3.5% of their 2017 vote share and half their seats, while Labour was reduced to one Scottish seat ([[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]]).

The SNP's leader [[Nicola Sturgeon]] described the result as a clear mandate to hold a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|new referendum for Scottish independence]].<ref name="Sturgeon 2019 Elec" />

In Northern Ireland, nationalist political parties won more seats than unionist ones for the first time. The DUP's leader in Westminster, [[Nigel Dodds]], lost his seat in [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]].<ref>{{cite news|title=North returns more nationalist than unionist MPs for first time|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/north-returns-more-nationalist-than-unionist-mps-for-first-time-1.4114260|last=McClements|first=Freya|date=13 December 2019|website=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=16 May 2020}}</ref>

The results have been attributed to leave supporting areas backing the Conservatives, the Conservatives broadening their appeal to working-class voters, and the Conservatives making gains in the Midlands and the North of England.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50770798 |title=Election analysis in maps and charts |date=13 December 2019 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> Most notable was the 'red wall' turning blue in the election, which secured the Conservative majority. Voters cited Corbyn's leadership and Brexit as to why they either switched to the Conservatives or stayed at home.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50771014 |title=How Labour's 'red wall' turned blue |last=Wainwright |first=Daniel |date=13 December 2019 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>

A [[YouGov]] post-election survey determined that the age over which a plurality of voters opted for the Conservatives was 39, down from 47 in the 2017 election.

==Reactions in political parties==
The election led to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats having leadership contests: the former as Corbyn resigned, the latter as Swinson failed to be elected as an MP.

The Labour leadership campaign was marked by conflicting analyses of what had gone wrong for the party in the general election.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/observer-view-on-why-labour-leadership-candidates-stop-ducking-truth |title=The Observer view on why Labour leadership candidates must stop ducking the truth &#124; Observer editorial |date=19 January 2020 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> There was debate as to whether Corbyn's unpopularity or their position on Brexit was more significant.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/labour-why-lost-jeremy-corbyn-brexit-media |title=Labour won't win again until it works out why it lost &#124; Gary Younge |last=Younge |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Younge |date=13 December 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> The 2020 ''Labour Together'' report, published by internal Labour party figures after Keir Starmer was elected as leader of the party, highlighted issues such as Corbyn's unpopularity, the party's Brexit policy and poor seat targeting, as well as long-term changes in Labour's electoral coalition.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=Labour: dysfunctional 'toxic culture' led to defeat, major report finds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/dysfunctional-toxic-culture-led-to-labour-defeat-major-report-finds |website=The Guardian |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref>

Successful Liberal Democrat MPs were critical in private of how the decision to support a policy of revoking Article 50 was arrived at and how it was communicated. Some have also criticised the general election campaign for being "hubristic" with its initial defining message that Swinson could be the country's next Prime Minister.<ref name=rea>{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/01/what-now-humbled-liberal-democrats |title=What now for the humbled Liberal Democrats? |website=New Statesman}}</ref> [[Ed Davey]], the party's co-acting leader after the election, argued that the unpopularity of Corbyn lost the Liberal Democrats votes to the Conservatives.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/lib-dem-election-failure-was-corbyns-fault-says-acting-leader |title=Corbyn was big factor in Lib Dem election failure, says Davey |last=Stewart |first=Heather |date=19 January 2020 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Wera Hobhouse]], who was re-elected by a majority of 12,322,<ref>{{cite news |title=Bath parliamentary constituency – Election 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000547 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref> argued that the party had been wrong to pursue a policy of equidistance between Labour and the Conservatives in the general election campaign. Instead, she argued that the party should have concentrated more on campaigning against the Conservatives.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/liberal-democrats/opinion/house-commons/109677/wera-hobhouse-mp-lib-dems |title=Wera Hobhouse MP: The Lib Dems shot ourselves in the foot by attacking Labour.
