'''Anti-humor''' is a type of indirect and [[Alternative comedy|alternative]] [[humor]] that involves the joke-teller delivering something that is intentionally not funny, or lacking in intrinsic meaning. The practice relies on the expectation on the part of the audience of something humorous, and when this does not happen, the [[irony]] itself is of comedic value. Anti-humor is also the basis of various types of [[practical joke|prank]]s and [[hoax]]es.

The humor of such jokes is based on the [[surprise factor]] of absence of an expected [[joke]] or of a [[punch line]] in a narration that is set up as a joke. This kind of [[anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] is similar to that of the [[shaggy dog story]].<ref name=shibles>[[Warren A.

==Examples==

The [[shaggy dog story]] involves telling an extremely long joke with an intricate (and sometimes grisly) back story  and surreal or repetitive plotline, before ending the story with either a weak [[spoonerism]], or abruptly stopping with no real punchline at all.

Another type of anti-joke gives a suggestion of building to a (typically [[Sexually suggestive|risqué]]) punchline, but breaks the audience's anticipation by swerving to a non-risqué punchline or no punchline at all: "Did you hear about the honeymooners who confused the tube of [[K-Y Jelly]] with window putty? Quite the tragedy, all the windows fell out of their new home."{{cn|date=May 2016}}

One more type of anti-humor is found in the joke "[[No soap radio]]". The joke is meant to have no punch line. When someone tells the joke, it is most likely with their friends, and it is meant to confuse others who do not know that there is not supposed to be a joke.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

==In stand-up comedy==
[[Alternative comedy]], among its other aspects, parodies the traditional idea of the joke as a form of humor.<ref>Andrew Stott (2005) "Comedy", {{ISBN|0-415-29933-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFmEDTxID1YC&pg=PA119&dq=%22anti-joke%22+-wikipedia&sig=vRjt7tgsE3WQmuLOaf4lj8CYH4A p. 119]</ref> Anti-humor jokes are also often associated with deliberately bad [[stand-up comedian]]s. Stand-up comedian [[Andy Kaufman]], had his own unique brand of anti-humor, quasi-[[surrealism|surrealist]] acts coupled with [[performance art]]; one of his best-known manifestations of this was his act as the fictional persona of [[Tony Clifton]], an untalented [[lounge lizard]] entertainer.{{cn|date=October 2018}} [[Norm Macdonald]] is another comedian sometimes associated with performing anti-humor, although he has objected to the characterization.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://twitchy.com/2014/05/12/norm-macdonald-worthless-anti-comedy-is-for-the-weak-and-cowardly/ | title = Norm Macdonald: ‘Worthless’ anti-comedy ‘is for the weak and cowardly’ | date = May 12, 2014 | publisher = Twitchy Entertainment | accessdate = January 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/magazine/norm-macdonald-still-in-search-of-the-perfect-joke.html | title = Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke | date = August 31, 2018 | publisher = The New York Times | accessdate = August 30, 2018}}</ref>
