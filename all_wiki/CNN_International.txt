'''CNN International''' ('''CNNI''', on-air branding simply as '''CNN''') is an international [[television]] channel that is operated by [[CNN]]. CNN International carries news-related programming worldwide; it cooperates with parent network [[CNN]]'s national and international news bureaus. Unlike its sister channel, [[CNN]], a North American only subscription service which is mostly broadcast from CNN studios in [[New York City]] and [[Atlanta]], CNN International is carried on a variety of TV platforms across the world, and mostly broadcast from studios outside the US, in [[London]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Abu Dhabi]]. In some countries, it is available as a [[free-to-air]] network. The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to [[BBC World News]], [[France 24]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW]], [[RT (TV network)|RT]], [[CGTN (TV channel)|CGTN]], [[NHK World-Japan|NHK World]] or [[Al Jazeera English]].

==History==

===Early years===
[[Image:CNN-International-Logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 1985 to 1995]]
CNN International, in large part a result of [[Ted Turner]]'s globalization ideals, began broadcasting on September 1, 1985, at first primarily broadcasting to American business travelers in hotels. The first studio for CNNI was at CNN's original studio building known as Techwood, home at that time to all of Turner Broadcasting System's channels. Today, it is home to the Turner Studios complex that houses the entertainment channels. Other early studios in Atlanta were tucked away in various corners of the [[CNN Center]], and the newsroom lacked even a [[digital clock]]. The vast majority of the network's programming originally consisted of simulcasts of the two domestic CNN channels ([[CNN|CNN/US]] and [[HLN (TV network)|Headline News]]). In 1990, however, the amount of news programming produced by CNNI especially for international viewers increased significantly. A new newsroom and studio complex was built in 1994, as CNN decided to compete against [[BBC World Service Television]]'s news programming. CNNI emerged as an internationally oriented news channel, with staff members of various national backgrounds, even though some accusations of a pro-U.S. editorial bias persist. CNN International was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] on July 4, 1997. Ted Turner, in accepting the medal on behalf of the network, said: "My idea was, we're just going to give people the facts... We didn't have to show liberty and democracy as good, and show socialism or totalitarianism as bad. If we just showed them both the way they were ... clearly everybody's going to choose liberty and democracy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitutioncenter.org/libertymedal/recipient_1997.html|title=CNN International - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org}}</ref>

===New international era (1995–2006)===
[[Image:CNN International.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from February 1, 1995, to December 31, 2005.]]
In 1995, creative director Morgan Almeida defined a progressive rebranding strategy, to target CNNI's diverse global market, making the on-air look less overtly American and with a cleaner, simpler "international" aesthetic going forward. The word "International" in the channel's logo was replaced with a globe, and the new branding featured numerous international locations filmed in time-lapse, channel idents created in CGI with Velvet Design in Munich, and a news brand designed with The Attik in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html|title=CNN International &#124; Idents|publisher=TVARK|access-date=August 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054454/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/cnni/idents.html#|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===2006–2009 revamp===
[[Image:CNN-globe-logo.png|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from January 1, 2006, to September 21, 2009.]]
The network undertook another major rebranding effort in 2006 overseen by Mark Wright and London agency Kemistry. The ticker was replaced by a flipper, on-screen graphics were more unified and from October 2007 until August 2008, new studios were progressively rolled out. However, on January 1, 2009, CNN International adopted the "lower-thirds" that CNN/US had introduced a month earlier which were inspired by the clean modern design of the CNNI rebrand efforts.

In the U.S., CNNI North America was distributed overnight and on weekends over the [[CNNfn]] financial channel, until that channel's demise in December 2004. It is now available as a standalone, full-time channel, usually as part of high-tier packages of subscription providers including [[Time Warner Cable]], [[AT&T U-Verse]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[Cox Communications]].

===Going beyond borders (2009–2013)===
Throughout January until September 2009, CNN International adapted more programs that became geared towards a primetime European audience with a few titled after CNN International personalities, most notably the interview program Amanpour. On September 21, 2009, the channel launched a new tagline "Go Beyond Borders", along with a new logo, and consolidated its general newscasts (''World News'', ''CNN Today'', ''World News Asia'', ''World News Europe'' and ''Your World Today'') into a single newscast entitled ''World Report''.

The slogan "Go Beyond Borders" emphasizes the international perspective that gives the information in this string and the plurality of the audiences. With this tagline, CNN also refers to the various platforms to disseminate their contents. The new image was created by the creativity and marketing department, and agency CNN Tooth & Nail. An important element of the rebrand was a new evening program that adds the broadcast of programs ''Amanpour'' and ''World One''. The makeover of CNN International has subject to a lot of criticism on both the new prime time lineup and the redesigned graphics.

On January 11, 2009, in a bid to compete directly with [[Al Jazeera English]], the network launched a new production center: CNN [[Abu Dhabi]], based in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Then, CNN International adapted half-hour shows in its schedule with a new evening prime program for [[Middle East]] viewers, ''Prism''.

In 2010, CNN International launched new programs for its evening lineup in order to improve its schedule. In 2011, programs from CNN U.S. were added to the CNN International schedule, including the talk program ''[[Piers Morgan Live]]'' which was later cancelled and replaced with [[CNN Tonight]] hosted by Don Lemon.
[[Image:CNN International 2009.svg|thumb|left|200px|CNN International logo from 2009 to 2014.]]

===This is CNN (2013–present)===
"This is CNN" represents CNN International's rebrand with new sets and output in full 16:9 high definition. The "This is CNN" slogan is also used on its sister network [[CNN]] in USA. The managing director of CNN International from 2003 to May 2019 was Tony Maddox.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression?] CNNi's president, Tony Maddox</ref>

In 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, with CNNI losing $10 million per year.<ref name="Waterson">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/28/cnn-preparing-cuts-london-based-news-operation|title=CNN preparing to make cuts at London-based news operation|first=Jim|last=Waterson|work=The Guardian|date=29 May 2019}}</ref> Later that year, CNNI cancelled its Asia-Pacific Primetime Show, ''[[News Stream]]'', anchored by [[Kristie Lu Stout]], effectively ending production output from its Hong Kong Studios.<ref>[https://cnncommentary.com/2019/06/03/cnn-cancels-news-stream-in-a-pivot-away-from-asia/ CNN cancels News Stream in a “pivot away from Asia”]</ref>

==Regional and online versions==
There are five variants of CNN International:
* [[CNN International Asia Pacific]], based in [[Hong Kong]], [[China]] and [[Mumbai]], [[India]]
* [[CNN International Europe/Middle East/Africa]], based in London, [[United Kingdom]]
* [[CNN International in Latin America]], based in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.
* CNN International North America, based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.
* [[CNN International South Asia]], based in [[New Delhi]], [[India]]

The schedules of the different regional versions no longer differ significantly from each other, but there are still minor variations such as content during the commercial breaks (e.g. weather forecasts and local airtimes shown).

CNN has reported that its broadcast agreement in mainland China includes an arrangement that its signal must pass through a Chinese-controlled satellite. With this method of transmission, Chinese authorities have been able to black out CNNI segments at will. CNN has also said that its broadcasts are not widely available in mainland China, but rather only in certain diplomatic compounds, hotels, and apartment blocks.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vause|first=John|title=San Francisco Torch Relay Broadcast|publisher=CNN|date=April 9, 2008}}</ref>

In June 2015, CNN International was made available online in the United States for [[TV Everywhere|CNN/U.S subscribers on participating television providers]] through the CNNgo service.<ref name="tvnewser-cnngo">{{cite web|title=CNN International Now Available on CNNgo|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cnn-international-now-available-on-cnngo/266213|website=TVNewser|access-date=July 2, 2015}}</ref>

==Simulcasts between CNNI and CNN/US==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}
Although dramatically scaled down since its early days, CNNI currently draws from the feed of the main CNN channel due to the COVID-19 pandemic for all editions of ''[[The Lead with Jake Tapper]]'', ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'', ''[[Cuomo Prime Time]]'', both hours of ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer]]'' and ''[[CNN Tonight|CNN Tonight with Don Lemon]]'', the whole three hours of the weekday edition of ''[[New Day (TV series)|New Day]]'', several hours of the CNN/U.S. ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'', the Sunday edition of ''[[Inside Politics]]'', ''[[State of the Union (American TV program)|State of the Union]]'', ''[[Fareed Zakaria GPS]]'', ''[[Reliable Sources]]'', ''[[Smerconish]]'' and some ''[[CNN Special Investigations Unit]]'' documentaries.<ref name=CNNI>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/tv/schedule/europe|title=International Schedule - Europe|work=CNN|access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref> The timepiece of CNN/US is replaced by that of CNNI, but no longer the ticker, and CNN/US's red logo on a white field is retained in the on-screen graphic (rather than replaced by CNNI's white logo on a red field), signifying CNN/US as the originating source.

CNNI also simulcasts CNN/U.S. newscasts whenever major events happen in the United States or around the world. Examples include the [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|death and funeral of Ronald Reagan]], the crash of [[Colgan Air Flight 3407|Continental Airlines Flight 3407]] in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] suburb of [[Clarence Center, New York|Clarence Center]], the Hudson River plane landing, the attempted Christmas Day bombing of flight 253 and the death and memorial service of [[Michael Jackson]] as well as scheduled broadcasts such as ''[[New Year's Eve Live]]'' and ''Election Night in America''.

Likewise, CNN/U.S. occasionally turns to CNNI newscasts, primarily when major international news breaks during overnight hours in the U.S. A notable case was during the [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|death of Pope John Paul II]] and the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Underground bombings of July 7, 2005]]. CNN/U.S. simulcast CNNI coverage of the death of [[Pakistan]]'s former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] on the night after her assassination took place. Simulcasts also happened from November 27 to 29, 2008, due to the terror attacks in [[Mumbai, India]], on January 4, 2009, when Israel launched strikes into Gaza, and during the early hours of January 14, 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti.

From 2005 until early 2008, CNNI's ''[[Your World Today]]'' aired on CNN/U.S.<ref>{{cite web|author=Home+ |url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/ |title=Breaking News, Latest News and Videos - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=September 1, 2015 |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref> during the 12–1 p.m. ET timeslot. That program was initially pre-empted by ''Issue #1'', a program dealing in the American economic, financial, and housing sectors as part of the lead-up to the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], and permanently replaced by another hour of ''[[CNN Newsroom]]'' in September 2008.

During the [[2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak|Atlanta tornado outbreak in March 2008]], CNN/U.S. and CNNI simulcasted coverage after ''Anderson Cooper 360°'' ended. That coverage ended around 12:36&nbsp;a.m. EDT<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0803/14/bn.01.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref> and the channels resumed their normal programming. Furthermore, the next day, with storms impending, CNN/U.S. had to move onto CNNI's U.S. news set and weather center to avoid water from possible flooding during the storms.

On January 17, 2011, CNN/U.S. dropped its early morning rebroadcasts of ''[[In the Arena|ParkerSpitzer]]'' and ''Anderson Cooper 360°'' during the 4–6 a.m. ET time period, and began to simulcast ''World Business Today'' and ''World One'' from CNNI in those slots. Both newscasts are the only programs broadcast entirely in [[4:3]] fullscreen frames on CNN/U.S.' standard-definition and high-definition feeds (the SD feed of CNN/US switched to a [[widescreen]] [[letterbox]] screen format on January 11, 2011). ''World One'' was dropped from CNN/U.S. just a few months later to allow the addition of an extra hour of ''American Morning'' which has been replaced with ''[[Early Start]]''.

As of August 2014, following [[Ferguson unrest|the unrest]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a permanent simulcast of CNNI's block of ''Newsroom'' with [[Rosemary Church]] and [[Errol Barnett]] was added to the late-night lineup of CNN/U.S., serving as a lead-in to ''Early Start''. In late 2015, [[John Vause]] and anchor [[Isha Sesay]] began to anchor a two-hour block of the simulcast from CNN studios in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="tvnewser-la">{{cite web|title=John Vause, Isha Sesay To Anchor CNN International Show From Los Angeles|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/john-vause-isha-sesay-to-anchor-cnn-international-show-from-los-angeles/268296|website=TVNewser|access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref>

In 2017, CNN International began simulcasting the first hour of the weekday edition of ''[[New Day (TV series)|New Day]]'' and on September 10, 2018, ''[[The Lead with Jake Tapper]]'' started to be simulcast on CNNI.<ref>[https://www.a516digital.com/2018/08/cnn-refreshes-european-schedule.html CNN refreshes European schedule]</ref>

In 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs.<ref name="Waterson"/> Consequently, an additional two hours of simulcasts with CNN/U.S. on weekdays were added - the first hour of ''Early Start'' and the second hour of ''New Day'', resulting in CNNI broadcasting CNN/U.S. for seven hours each weekday.

By mid-April 2020, due to the impact of [[COVID-19]] on CNN's operation, CNN/U.S. weekday programming accounted for 14 hours within each 24 hour cycle of CNN International broadcasting time, with CNN International's daily worldwide programming in Europe consisting of five hours of the international version of CNN Newsroom, from 5a.m. - 10a.m. GMT, and four internationally focused programs: ''First Move with Julia Chatterley'' and ''Connect the World with Becky Anderson'' between the hours of 1p.m. — 4p.m. GMT; with ''Amanpour'' and ''Quest Means Business'', between 6p.m. — 8p.m. GMT.<ref name=CNNI/>  Each of those internationally focused programmes air for one hour each, except ''Connect the World'', which airs for two hours and if live news events are slated to happen during ''Amanpour'''s timeslot, that show may air at a different time. Weekend simulcasts of CNN/U.S. were increased with CNN/U.S.'s live news output shown in full at the time. Apart from between from 5a.m. - 11a.m GMT when editions of the international version of CNN Newsroom were aired alongside magazine programmes, CNN International only showed its own programming - consisting of magazine programmes - when CNN/US was broadcasting repeat showings of programmes it had aired earlier that day.

As at September 2020, live weekend domestic programming on CNN International has been somewhat reduced to accommodate newer editions of magazine programmes.

==High definition==
'''CNN International HD''' is the [[high definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of the channel broadcasting at 1920x[[1080i]], which was launched in September 2012. Prior to June 3, 2013, only programming from CNN/U.S. was available natively in HD, while shows made for CNN International were produced in [[4:3]] [[576i]]. In February 2013, the European SD feed of CNN International began broadcasting in widescreen by downscaling the HD feed, which resulted in all 4:3-native programming being broadcast in [[pillarbox]] until the June 3 switchover, finalising on June 17 of the same year, when the switchover was completed.

Following the March 2003 launch of [[CNNj]], a live relay of CNN/U.S. and CNN International, with simultaneous audio translation into Japanese,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/factsheets/partnersandjv/?catID=19|title=CNN Partners|publisher=cnnasiapacific.com|access-date=16 April 2020|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729154345/http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/factsheets/partnersandjv/?catID=19#|archive-date=2012-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> starting in late 2010, the high definition feed of CNN/U.S. was launched in Japan under the name '''CNN HD'''.<ref>http://www.jctv.co.jp/images/press101108.pdf</ref> CNN/U.S. (both SD and HD) is also available on Greater China-based satellite service [[DishHD]], a subsidiary of [[Dish Network]] in the United States.

On June 28, 2016, CNN International HD was launched for Sky customers in the UK (including on Freesat from Sky), on channel 506 or 579, making the [[Arirang (TV network)|next news channel]] launch in the 600s, as it is next to the [[God TV|GOD Channel]].  The HD version is available free-to-air within the British Isles, and is provided on satellite and IPTV services, and also live-streamed for U.K. users (and geo-blocked outside the U.K.), through CNN International's official U.K. video site. However, viewers with non-proprietary Freesat boxes will need to add the channel manually as Freesat does not market CNN International HD publicly as part of its offerings.

==Online==
CNN debuted its news website CNN.com (initially an experiment known as ''CNN Interactive'') on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of [[blogs]], [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]] have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline]] in late 2005. In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.

CNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or "pipes"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up "news alerts" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]]. There was also a browser-based "web client" that did not require installation. In July 2007, the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.

The now-defunct topical news program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics]]'' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2005-03-20-media-mix_x.htm|title=It's prime time for blogs on CNN's 'Inside Politics'|date=March 20, 2005|publisher=USA Today|last=Johnson|first=Peter|access-date=January 24, 2009}}</ref> Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics]]'' was folded into ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer|The Situation Room]]''. In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and [[CNN iReport]], initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging]] to [[citizen journalism]] within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the [[Virginia Tech shootings]] sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562|title='Citizen journalist' often there first to snap photos|date=April 12, 2008|publisher=Regina Leader-Post|last=Cobb|first=Chris|access-date=January 24, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621203445/http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&k=80562#|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On October 24, 2009 CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website, revamping it adding a new "sign up" option where users may create their own user name, a new "CNN Pulse" (beta) feature along with a new red color theme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/relaunch/|title=Welcome to the New CNN.com&nbsp;– Interactive tour |publisher=CNN|access-date=February 20, 2010}}</ref> However, most of the news archived on the website has been deleted.

In April 2010, CNN announced via [[Twitter]] its upcoming food [[blog]] called "Eatocracy," in which it will "cover all news related to food&nbsp;– from recalls to health issues to culture."<ref>{{cite web|last=Brion|first=Raphael|title=Eatocracy: CNN Gets in the Food Blog Business|url=http://eater.com/archives/2010/04/13/eatocracy-cnn-gets-in-the-food-blog-business.php|work=Eater.com|date=April 13, 2010}}</ref> CNN had an [[internet relay chat]] (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com.

==Criticism==
[[Image:CNN International.jpg|thumb|right|The CNN International logo on a table viewed inside the CNN Center in Atlanta. These tables have since been removed.]]

=== Accusations of US-centric viewpoint ===
Former CNN Beijing and Tokyo bureau chief [[Rebecca MacKinnon]] described how the news-gathering priorities of CNN International were skewed to "produce stories and reports that would be of interest to CNN USA." Nevertheless, [[Jane Arraf]], a former correspondent who was with the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and later served as a Middle East-based correspondent for [[Al Jazeera English]], noted that when she spoke on international affairs, CNN International would usually give her more airtime than CNN/US. For its own part, former CNN executive [[Eason Jordan]] has defended CNN International's "international" perspective, saying "No matter what CNN International does, as long as CNN's headquarters is in the United States people are going to say, well, it's an American service. But the reality is that it's an international service based in the United States, and we don't make any apologies about that."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Spring02/jordan.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 28, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230185016/http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Spring02/jordan.html |archive-date=December 30, 2006  }}</ref>

=== Accusations of pro-American bias ===
CNN is one of the world's largest news organizations, and its international channel, CNN International is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/about/|title=About Us|publisher=CNN|access-date=February 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/563911/cnn-tops-european-news-channels-according-ems/|title=CNN tops European news channels according to EMS&nbsp;– Brand Republic News|publisher=Brand Republic |access-date=February 20, 2010}}</ref> Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus, CNN International makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a "liberal" or "anti-American" bias.

=== Accusations of anti-China bias ===
A Chinese website, [[anti-cnn]].com,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m4.cn |script-title=zh:四月网_M4.CN_全球视野,中国情怀 |website=M4.cn |language=zh-cn |date=June 1, 2015 |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref> has accused CNN and western media in general of biased reporting against China, with the catchphrase "Don't be so CNN" catching on in the Chinese mainstream as jokingly meaning "Don't be so biased". Pictures used by CNN are allegedly edited to have completely different meanings from the original ones. In addition, the channel was accused of largely ignoring pro-China voices during the Olympic Torch Relay debacle in San Francisco.

=== Accusations of propaganda and censorship ===
In October 2011, [[Amber Lyon]] claimed to the Syrian government news agency SANA that she had been directed by CNN to report selectively, repetitively, and falsely in order to sway public opinion in favor of direct American aggression against [[Iran]] and [[Syria]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sana.sy/eng/22/2013/03/30/475112.htm |title=Ex-CNN Reporter: I Received Orders to Manipulate News to Demonize Syria and Iran |access-date=March 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402001657/http://sana.sy/eng/22/2013/03/30/475112.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2013  }}</ref> and that this was common practice under CNN. She subsequently repeated this claim, addressing the degraded state of [[journalistic ethics]] in an interview<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/11/alex-jones-americas-top-conspiracy-theorist.html |title=An Interview With Alex Jones, America’s Leading (and Proudest) Conspiracy Theorist |website=Nymag.com |date=November 17, 2013 |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=YouTube is NOT a reliable source|date=December 2015}} during which she also discussed the Bahraini episode, suggesting paid-for content was also taken from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], and other states, that the [[War on Terrorism]] had also been employed as a pretext to pre-empt substantive [[investigative journalism]] within the U.S., and that following the Bahrain reporting, her investigative department had been terminated and "reorganized", and her severance and [[employee benefits]] used as a threat to intimidate and attempt to purchase her subsequent silence.

Lyon claimed to have met with [[Tony Maddox]], president of CNN International, twice about this issue in 2011 and had claimed that during the second meeting she was threatened and intimated to stop speaking on the matter.<ref>{{cite news|author=Glenn Greenwald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression |title=Why didn't CNN's international arm air its own documentary on Bahrain's Arab Spring repression? &#124; Glenn Greenwald &#124; US news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref> CNN issued a detailed response to Lyon's claims about its coverage of Bahrain.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/05/cnn-internationals-response-to-the-guardian/ | work=CNN | title=CNN International's Response to the Guardian – Update | date=September 5, 2012}}</ref>

Lyon also claimed on the Russian news channel [[RT (TV network)|RT]] that CNN reporters, headed by Maddox, have been instructed to over-cover Iran as a form of propaganda, and that CNN International has been paid by the Bahraini government to produce and air news segments intentionally painting them in a positive light.{{citation needed|reason=YouTube is NOT a reliable source|date=December 2015}}

=== Other dismissals ===
On July 7, 2010, [[Octavia Nasr]], senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for 20 years, was fired after she expressed admiration on her [[Twitter]] account for a militant Muslim cleric and former Hezbollah leader who had recently died.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Matea|date=July 7, 2010|title=CNN Mideast Affairs editor loses post after tweeting her respect for militant cleric|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/07/cnn-mideast-affairs-editor-loses-post-after-tweeting-her-respect-for-militant-cleric.html}}</ref>
