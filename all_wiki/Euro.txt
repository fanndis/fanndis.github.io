In late 2009, the euro became immersed in the [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]], which led to the creation of the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] as well as [[History of the euro#Reform|other reforms]] aimed at stabilising and strengthening the currency.

==Administration==
[[File:European Central Bank - building under construction - Frankfurt - Germany - 13.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[European Central Bank]] is [[Seat of the European Central Bank|seated]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and is in charge of the monetary policy of the [[eurozone]].]]
{{Main|European Central Bank|Maastricht Treaty|Eurogroup}}

The euro is managed and administered by the [[Frankfurt]]-based [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) and the [[Eurosystem]] (composed of the [[central bank]]s of the eurozone countries). As an independent central bank, the ECB has sole authority to set [[monetary policy]]. The Eurosystem participates in the printing, minting and distribution of [[euro banknotes|notes]] and [[euro coins|coins]] in all member states, and the operation of the eurozone payment systems.

The 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]] obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]], although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Euro |publisher=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/index_en.htm |access-date=29 January 2009}}</ref> while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a [[2003_Swedish_euro_referendum|non-binding referendum in 2003]], and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.

==Issuing modalities for banknotes==
Since 1 January 2002, the national central banks (NCBs) and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis.<ref name="Scheller">{{Cite book|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecbhistoryrolefunctions2006en.pdf|quote=Since 1 January 2002, the NCBs and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis. |title=The European Central Bank: History, Role and Functions|first=Hanspeter K. |last=Scheller |edition=2nd |date= 2006|isbn=978-92-899-0027-0 |page=103}}</ref> Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of the total value of banknotes issued by the Eurosystem.<ref name="Scheller"/> In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key,<ref name="Scheller"/> calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.<ref>

The euro is divided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]] (also referred to as ''euro cents'', especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of ''euro'' and ''cent'' are spelled without the ''s'', notwithstanding normal English usage.<ref name="ec.europa.eu">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/symbol/index_en.htm |title= How to use the euro name and symbol |publisher=European Commission |access-date=7 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication6336_en.pdf |title=Spelling of the words "euro" and "cent" in official Community languages as used in Community Legislative acts |access-date=26 November 2008 |author=European Commission }}</ref> Otherwise, normal English plurals are used,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf |title=English Style Guide: A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission |access-date=16 November 2008 |author=European Commission Directorate-General for Translation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205092625/http://ec.europa.eu/translation/writing/style_guides/english/style_guide_en.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}; {{cite web |url=http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-370303.htm |title=Interinstitutional style guide, 7.3.3. Rules for expressing monetary units |access-date=16 November 2008 |author=European Union }}</ref> with many [[Linguistic issues concerning the euro|local variations]] such as ''centime'' in France.

All circulating coins have a ''common side'' showing the denomination or value, and a map in the background. Due to the [[Languages of the European Union|linguistic plurality in the European Union]], the Latin alphabet version of ''euro'' is used (as opposed to the less common Greek or Cyrillic) and [[Arabic numerals]] (other text is used on national sides in national languages, but other text on the common side is avoided). For the denominations except the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, the map only showed the 15 member states which were members when the euro was introduced. Beginning in 2007 or 2008 (depending on the country), the old map was replaced by a map of Europe also showing countries outside the EU like [[Norway]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} The 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map. All common sides were designed by [[Luc Luycx]]. The coins also have a ''national side'' showing an image specifically chosen by the country that issued the coin. Euro coins from any member state may be freely used in any nation that has adopted the euro.

The coins are issued in denominations of [[2 euro coins|€2]], [[1 euro coins|€1]], [[50 euro cent coin|50c]], [[20 euro cent coin|20c]], [[10 euro cent coin|10c]], [[5 euro cent coin|5c]], [[2 euro cent coin|2c]], and [[1 euro cent coin|1c]]. To avoid the use of the two smallest coins, some cash transactions are rounded to the nearest five cents in the Netherlands and Ireland<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neurope.eu/article/ireland-to-round-to-nearest-5-cents-starting-october-28/|title=Ireland to round to nearest 5 cents starting October 28|date=27 October 2015|access-date=17 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306012032/http://neurope.eu/article/ireland-to-round-to-nearest-5-cents-starting-october-28/|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.centralbank.ie/paycurr/Pages/rounding.aspx|title=Rounding |website= Central Bank of Ireland}}</ref> (by voluntary agreement) and in Finland (by law).<ref>{{cite web|author=European Commission|author-link=European Commission|title=Euro cash: five and familiar |url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/een/005/article_4324_en.htm |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |date = January 2007|access-date=26 January 2009}}</ref> This practice is discouraged by the commission, as is the practice of certain shops of refusing to accept high-value euro notes.<ref>Pop, Valentina (22 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/?aid=29737 "Commission frowns on shop signs that say: '€500 notes not accepted'"], ''[[EU Observer]]''</ref>

[[€2 commemorative coins|Commemorative coins]] with €2 face value have been issued with changes to the design of the national side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] issued by Greece. These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/introducing_euro_practical_aspects/l25058_en.htm |title=Commission communication: The introduction of euro banknotes and coins one year after COM(2002) 747 |access-date=26 January 2009 |author=European Commission |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=15 February 2003}}</ref>

The front of the note features windows or gateways while the back has bridges, symbolising links between states in the union and with the future. While the designs are supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics, the initial designs by [[Robert Kalina]] were of specific bridges, including the [[Rialto]]  and the [[Pont de Neuilly]], and were subsequently rendered more generic; the final designs still bear very close similarities to their specific prototypes; thus they are not truly generic.

==History==
{{Main|History of the euro}}

===Introduction===
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs have no citations-->
{{Euro adoption past|group="note"}}

The euro was established by the provisions in the 1992 [[Maastricht Treaty]]. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet [[Euro convergence criteria|strict criteria]], such as a budget [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] of less than 3% of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than 60% of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and [[interest]] rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union which resulted in the introduction of the euro. (For [[macroeconomic]] theory, see [[#Optimal currency area|below]].)

The name "euro" was officially adopted in [[Madrid]] on 16 December 1995.<ref name="madrid1995"/> Belgian [[Esperantist]] [[Germain Pirlot]], a former teacher of French and history is credited with naming the new currency by sending a letter to then [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jacques Santer]], suggesting the name "euro" on 4 August 1995.<ref>{{Cite news | title= Germain Pirlot 'uitvinder' van de euro | url= http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | publisher= De Zeewacht | language= nl | date= 16 February 2007 | access-date= 21 May 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130630181850/http://www.ikso.net/vikipedio/artikeleuro.jpg | archive-date= 30 June 2013 | df= dmy-all }}</ref>

Due to differences in national conventions for [[rounding]] and significant digits, all conversion between the national currencies had to be carried out using the process of [[Triangulation (finance)|triangulation]] via the euro. The ''definitive'' values of one euro in terms of the [[exchange rate]]s at which the currency entered the euro are shown on the right.

The rates were determined by the [[Council of the European Union]],<ref group="note">by means of Council Regulation 2866/98 (EC) of 31 December 1998.</ref> based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not a currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the [[pound sterling]]) that day.

The procedure used to fix the conversion rate between the [[Greek drachma]] and the euro was different since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand.<ref group="note">by Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC) of 19 June 2000</ref>

The currency was introduced in non-physical form ([[traveller's cheque]]s, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the [[European Currency Unit]] (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as [[legal tender]] until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.

The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the [[Deutsche Mark|mark]] officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese [[Portuguese escudo|escudos]], which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.{{clear}}

[[File:Government surplus or deficit (EU-USA-UK).png|thumb|Budget deficit of the eurozone compared to the United States and the UK.]]

Following the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, fears of a [[Sovereign default|sovereign debt crisis]] developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in [[2000s European sovereign debt crisis timeline|early 2010]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216 |title= Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen |agency=Reuters   |author=George Matlock |date=16 February 2010 |access-date=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099 | title=Acropolis now | work=The Economist | date= 29 April 2010 |access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref> [[Economy of Greece|Greece]] was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members [[Economy of Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Economy of Italy|Italy]], [[Economy of Portugal|Portugal]], and [[Economy of Spain|Spain]] were also significantly affected.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/27/world/europe/european-debt-crisis-fast-facts/index.html European Debt Crisis Fast Facts], CNN Library (last updated 22 January 2017).</ref><ref>[[Ricardo Reis]], [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PDFReisTextFallBPEA.pdf Looking for a Success in the Euro Crisis Adjustment Programs: The Case of Portugal], ''Brookings Papers on Economic Activity'', [[Brookings Institution]] (Fall 2015), p. 433.</ref> All these countries utilized EU funds except Italy, which is a major donor to the EFSF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkiesta.it/it/article/2011/11/04/efsf-come-funziona-il-fondo-salvastati-europeo/2302/|title=Efsf, come funziona il fondo salvastati europeo|date=4 November 2011}}</ref> To be included in the eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain [[Euro convergence criteria|convergence criteria]], but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3454 |title=The politics of the Maastricht convergence criteria|publisher=Voxeu.org |date=15 April 2009 |access-date=1 October 2011}}</ref>

According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] in 2011, "[I]f the [euro area] is treated as a single entity, its [economic and fiscal] position looks no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK" and the budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the United States. "Moreover", they write, "private-sector indebtedness across the euro area as a whole is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] economies". The authors conclude that the crisis "is as much political as economic" and the result of the fact that the euro area lacks the support of "institutional [[paraphernalia]] (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/EuroDebtPaperMarch2011.pdf |title=State of the Union: Can the euro zone survive its debt crisis?|page=4 |publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]] |date=1 March 2011 |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

===Direct usage===

The euro is the sole currency of 19 [[European Union member states|EU member states]]: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. These countries constitute the "[[eurozone]]", some 343&nbsp;million people in total {{As of|2018|lc=y}}.<ref name="2013_data_sheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf13/2013-population-data-sheet_eng.pdf|title=2013 World Population Data Sheet|author=Population Reference Bureau|author-link=Population Reference Bureau|access-date=2013-10-01}}</ref>

With all but one (Denmark) of the remaining EU members obliged to join when economic conditions permit, together with future members of the EU, the [[enlargement of the eurozone]] is set to continue. Outside the EU, the euro is also the sole currency of Montenegro and Kosovo and several [[Microstates and the European Union|European microstates]] (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City) as well as in five [[Special member state territories and the European Union|overseas territories of EU members]] that are not themselves part of the EU ([[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]] and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]). Together this direct usage of the euro outside the EU affects nearly 3&nbsp;million people.

===Use as reserve currency===

Since its introduction, the euro has been the second most widely held international [[reserve currency]] after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period, the share held in U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and that held in RMB fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built on the status of the [[Deutsche Mark]] as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the [[International Monetary Fund]]<ref name="external1">{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/cofer.pdf |title=Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER)&nbsp;– Updated COFER tables include first quarter 2009 data.

The possibility of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency has been debated among economists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |title=Will the Euro Eventually Surpass the Dollar As Leading International Reserve Currency? |access-date=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825070016/http://www.wage.wisc.edu/uploads/Working%20Papers/chinnfrankel_NBER_eurotopcurrency.pdf |archive-date=25 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Former [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency".<ref>{{Cite news| title=Euro could replace dollar as top currency&nbsp;– Greenspan | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL1771147920070917 | access-date=17 September 2007 | date=17 September 2007 |agency=Reuters  }}</ref> In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in the share of the worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and since the beginning of the worldwide [[credit crunch]] related recession and [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]].<ref name="external1"/>

Outside the eurozone, a total of 22 countries and territories that do not belong to the EU have currencies that are directly [[Fixed exchange rate system|pegged]] to the euro including 14 countries in mainland Africa ([[CFA franc]]), two African island countries ([[Comorian franc]] and [[Cape Verdean escudo]]), three French Pacific territories ([[CFP franc]]) and three Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]]), Bulgaria ([[Bulgarian lev]]) and North Macedonia ([[Macedonian denar]]).<ref name="auto"/>  On 28 July 2009, [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] signed an agreement with Portugal which will eventually tie its currency to the euro.<ref>{{Cite news|title= S.Tomé e Princípe ancora-se ao euro |url=http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/stome-e-principe-ancorase-ao-euro_1393438 |publisher=economia.publico.pt |date=27 July 2009 |access-date=8 November 2011}}</ref> Additionally, the [[Moroccan dirham]] is tied to a basket of currencies, including the euro and the US dollar, with the euro given the highest weighting.

With the exception of Bosnia, Bulgaria, North Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these non-EU countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency is regarded as a safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.

Within the EU several currencies are pegged to the euro, mostly as a precondition to joining the eurozone. The [[Danish krone]], [[Croatian kuna]] and [[Bulgarian lev]] are pegged due to their participation in the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|ERM II]].

In total, {{As of|2013|lc=y}}, 182&nbsp;million people in Africa use a currency pegged to the euro, 27&nbsp;million people outside the eurozone in Europe, and another 545,000 people on Pacific islands.<ref name="2013_data_sheet" />

==Economics==
===Optimal currency area===

{{Further|Optimum currency area}}

In economics, an optimum currency area, or region (OCA or OCR), is a geographical region in which it would maximise economic efficiency to have the entire region share a single currency. There are two models, both proposed by [[Robert Mundell]]: the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with stationary expectations|stationary expectations model]] and the [[Optimum currency area#OCA with international risk sharing|international risk sharing model]]. Mundell himself advocates the international risk sharing model and thus concludes in favour of the euro.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=A Plan for a European Currency |date=1970 |orig-year=published 1973|last=Mundell |first=Robert|editor1=Johnson, H.

Before the [[late-2000s recession]] it was considered unlikely that a state would leave the euro or the whole zone would collapse.<ref>{{cite paper |ssrn=1014341 |title=The Breakup of the Euro Area by Barry Eichengreen |date=14 September 2007 |journal=[[NBER Working Paper]] |number=w13393}}</ref> However the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] led to former [[British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] claiming the eurozone could not last in its current form.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13839381 |title=Greek debt crisis: Straw says eurozone 'will collapse' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 June 2011 |access-date=17 July 2011}}</ref> Part of the problem seems to be the rules that were created when the euro was set up. John Lanchester, writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', explains it: {{quote|The guiding principle of the currency, which opened for business in 1999, were supposed to be a set of rules to limit a country's annual deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product, and the total accumulated debt to sixty per cent of G.D.P. It was a nice idea, but by 2004 the two biggest economies in the euro zone, Germany and France, had broken the rules for three years in a row.<ref>John Lanchester, "Euro Science," ''New Yorker'', 10 October 2011.</ref>}}

===Transaction costs and risks===

{{Most traded currencies|group="note"}}

The most obvious benefit of adopting a single currency is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., [[credit card]]s, [[debit card]]s and [[cash machine]] withdrawals).

Financial markets on the continent are expected to be far more [[market liquidity|liquid]] and flexible than they were in the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that [[risk aversion]] has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.<ref>Benchimol, J., 2014. [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/reecon/v68y2014i1p39-56.html Risk aversion in the Eurozone], [[Research in Economics]], vol. 68, issue 1, pp. 39–56.</ref>

===Price parity===

Another effect of the common European currency is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because of the [[law of one price]]. Differences in prices can trigger [[arbitrage]], i.e., [[speculation|speculative]] trade in a [[commodity]] across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in some regions and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Pinelopi K. |last1=Goldberg |first2=Frank |last2=Verboven |title=Market Integration and Convergence to the Law of One Price: Evidence from the European Car Market |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=65 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=49–73 |doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2003.12.002 |citeseerx=10.1.1.494.1517 |s2cid=26850030 }}</ref>

===Macroeconomic stability===

Before the introduction of the euro, some countries had successfully contained inflation, which was then seen as a major economic problem, by establishing largely independent central banks. One such bank was the [[Bundesbank]] in Germany; the European Central Bank was modelled on the Bundesbank.<ref name="bundesbank">{{Cite book|title=The History of the Bundesbank: Lessons for the European Central Bank |last=de Haan |first=Jakob |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-21723-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaIV0OWlaokC}}</ref>

The euro has come under criticism due to its regulation, lack of flexibility and rigidity towards sharing member States on issues such as nominal interest rates.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Steven J|year=2004|title=Is the Euro Working? The Euro and European Labour Markets|jstor=4007858|volume=24|issue=2|pages=147–168|doi=10.1017/s0143814x0400008x|journal=Journal of Public Policy}}</ref>
Many national and corporate [[bond (finance)|bonds]] denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have lower interest rates than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the [[nominal interest rate]] on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency with low levels of inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.

Unfortunately, there is also a cost in structurally keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the eurozone becomes more difficult.

In general, those in Europe who own large amounts of euros are served by high stability and low inflation.

A [[monetary union]] means states in that union lose the main mechanism of recovery of their international [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]] by weakening ([[Currency appreciation and depreciation|depreciating]]) their currency. When [[wage]]s become too high compared to [[productivity]] in exports sector then these exports become more expensive and they are crowded out from the market within a country and abroad. This drive fall of employment and output in the exports sector and fall of [[Balance of trade|trade]] and [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account]] balances. Fall of output and employment in tradable goods sector may be offset by the growth of non-exports sectors, especially in [[construction]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. Increased purchases abroad and negative current account balance can be financed without a problem as long as [[credit]] is cheap.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Ernest Pytlarczyk, Stefan Kawalec |title=Controlled Dismantlement of the Euro Area in Order to Preserve the European Union and Single European Market |url=http://www.case-research.eu/en/controlled-dismantlement-of-the-euro-area-in-order-to-preserve-the-european-union-and-sing |publisher=CASE Center for Social and Economic Research |access-date=19 December 2018 |pages=11 |date=June 2012}}</ref> The need to finance trade deficit weakens currency making exports automatically more attractive in a country and abroad. A state in a monetary union cannot use weakening of currency to recover its international competitiveness. To achieve this a state has to reduce prices, including wages ([[deflation]]). This could result in high [[unemployment]] and lower incomes as it was during [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=[[Martin Feldstein]] |title=The Failure of the Euro |journal=Foreign Affairs |date=January–February 2012 |url=https://www.nber.org/feldstein/fa121311.html |at=Chapter: Trading Places}}</ref>

====Trade====
A 2009 consensus from the studies of the introduction of the euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.de/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp594.pdf |title=The euro's trade effects |access-date=2 October 2009}}</ref> although one study suggested an increase of only 3%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |title=The Euro Effect on Trade is not as Large as Commonly Thought |access-date=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724172326/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/pp/klaassen/index_files/trend27_forthcoming.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> while another estimated 9 to 14%.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2007.00725.x |ssrn=1079383 |title=Estimating the Euro Effects on Trade with Propensity Score Matching |journal=Review of International Economics |volume=16 |pages=186–198 |year=2007 |last1=Chintrakarn |first1=Pandej |s2cid=154077583 }}</ref> However, a [[meta-analysis]] of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by [[publication bias]] and that the underlying effect may be negligible.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rose effect and the euro: is the magic gone? |journal=Review of World Economics |doi=10.1007/s10290-010-0050-1 |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=241–261|year=2010 |last1=Havránek |first1=Tomáš |s2cid=53585674 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00582634/file/PEER_stage2_10.1007%252Fs10290-010-0050-1.pdf }}</ref> Although a more recent meta-analysis shows that publication bias decreases over time and that there are positive trade effects from the introduction of the euro, as long as results from before 2010 are taken into account.

====Investment====
Physical investment seems to have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |title=The Impact of the Euro on Investment: Sectoral Evidence |access-date=2 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831043539/http://www.eu-financial-system.org/fileadmin/content/Dokumente_Events/second_conference/Dvorak.pdf |archive-date=31 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Regarding foreign direct investment, a study found that the intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210053621/http://www.afse.fr/docs/congres_2005/docs2005/Sousa.pdf |archive-date=10 December 2006 |title=Does the single currency affect FDI? |publisher=AFSE.fr |access-date=30 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe.

====Inflation====
The introduction of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the introduction of the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|author = Paolo Angelini |author2=Francesco Lippi | title = Did Prices Really Soar after the Euro Cash Changeover?

====Exchange rate risk====
One of the advantages of the adoption of a common currency is the reduction of the risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates. It has been found that the introduction of the euro created "significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms both in and outside Europe".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The impact of the introduction of the Euro on foreign exchange rate risk exposures |journal=Journal of Empirical Finance |doi=10.1016/j.jempfin.2006.01.002 |volume=13 |issue=4–5 |pages=519–549|year=2006 |last1=Bartram |first1=Söhnke M. |last2=Karolyi |first2=G. Andrew }}</ref> These reductions in market risk "were concentrated in firms domiciled in the eurozone and in non-euro firms with a high fraction of foreign sales or assets in Europe".

====Financial integration====
The introduction of the euro seems to have had a strong effect on European financial integration. According to a study on this question, it has "significantly reshaped the European financial system, especially with respect to the securities markets [...] However, the real and policy barriers to integration in the retail and corporate banking sectors remain significant, even if the wholesale end of banking has been largely integrated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp139.pdf |title=The Euro and Financial Integration|date=May 2006 |access-date=2 October 2009}}</ref> Specifically, the euro has significantly decreased the cost of trade in bonds, equity, and banking assets within the eurozone.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The geography of asset trade and the euro: Insiders and outsiders |journal=Journal of the Japanese and International Economies |doi=10.1016/j.jjie.2008.11.001 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=90–113|year=2009 |last1=Coeurdacier |first1=Nicolas |last2=Martin |first2=Philippe |s2cid=55948853 |url=http://www.cepremap.fr/depot/docweb/docweb0701.pdf }}</ref> On a global level, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has led to an integration in terms of investment in bond portfolios, with eurozone countries lending and borrowing more between each other than with other countries.<ref>{{cite document |ssrn=925858 |title=Global Bond Portfolios and EMU |author=Philip R.

====Effect on interest rates====
[[File:Long-term interest rates of eurozone countries since 1993.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Secondary market yields of government bonds with maturities of close to 10 years]]

As of January 2014, and since the introduction of the euro, interest rates of most member countries (particularly those with a weak currency) have decreased. Some of these countries had the most serious sovereign financing problems.

The effect of declining interest rates, combined with excess liquidity continually provided by the ECB, made it easier for banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/opinion/2076100/redwood-origins-euro-crisis |title=Redwood: The origins of the euro crisis |publisher=Investmentweek.co.uk |date=3 June 2011 |access-date=16 September 2011}}</ref> Following the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-global.org/2011/02/01/farewell-fair-weather-euro/ |title=Farewell, Fair-Weather Euro &#124; IP&nbsp;– Global-Edition |publisher=Ip-global.org |access-date=16 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317161013/http://www.ip-global.org/2011/02/01/farewell-fair-weather-euro/ |archive-date=17 March 2011 }}</ref> This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.

====Price convergence====
The evidence on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction of the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.eu/events/pdf/conferences/emu/sessionV_Angeloni_Paper.pdf |title=Price setting and inflation dynamics: did EMU matter |access-date=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725112443/http://www.ecb.eu/events/pdf/conferences/emu/sessionV_Angeloni_Paper.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://opus.zbw-kiel.de/volltexte/2009/7575/pdf/200906dkp.pdf |title=Price convergence in the EMU?

====Tourism====
A study suggests that the introduction of the euro has had a positive effect on the amount of tourist travel within the EMU, with an increase of 6.5%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gil-Pareja|first1=Salvador|last2=Llorca-Vivero|first2=Rafael|last3=Martínez-Serrano|first3=José|title=The Effect of EMU on Tourism|ssrn=983231|journal=Review of International Economics |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=302–312 |date=May 2007|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9396.2006.00620.x|s2cid=154503069}}</ref>

==Exchange rates==

===Flexible exchange rates===

The ECB targets [[interest rate]]s rather than [[exchange rate]]s and in general, does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This is because of the implications of the [[Mundell–Fleming model]], which implies a central bank cannot (without [[capital control]]s) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the [[money supply]] results in a [[depreciation]] of the currency. In the years following the [[Single European Act]], the EU has liberalised its capital markets and, as the ECB has [[inflation targeting]] as its [[monetary policy]], the exchange-rate regime of the euro is [[floating exchange rate|floating]].

===Against other major currencies===

The euro is the second-most widely held [[reserve currency]] after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate against the other major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (3 May vs [[Pound sterling]], 25 October vs the [[U.S. dollar]], 26 October vs [[Japanese yen]]). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese yen, 29 December vs Pound sterling). With the advent of the global financial crisis the euro initially fell,  to regain later. Despite pressure due to the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] the euro remained stable.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kirschbaum|first1=Erik|title=Schaeuble says markets have confidence in euro|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-schaeuble/schaeuble-says-markets-have-confidence-in-euro-idUSTRE77L0LK20110822|access-date=28 March 2018|agency=Reuters}}</ref> In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index&nbsp;– measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners&nbsp;– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/11/15/uk-markets-euro-mystery-idUKLNE7AE02520111115 |title= Puzzle over euro's 'mysterious' stability |work=[[Reuters]] |date= 15 November 2011}}</ref>

==Political considerations==
Besides the economic motivations to the introduction of the euro, its creation was also partly justified as a way to foster a closer sense of joint identity between European citizens. Statements about this goal were for instance made by [[Wim Duisenberg]], European Central Bank Governor, in 1998,<ref>{{cite book|title=Global Finance After the Crisis|date= 2013|quote=The euro is far more than a medium of exchange.

==Linguistic issues==
{{Main|Linguistic issues concerning the euro}}

The formal titles of the currency are ''euro'' for the major unit and ''cent'' for the minor (one-hundredth) unit and for official use in most eurozone languages; according to the ECB, all languages should use the same spelling for the nominative singular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/conrep/cr200705en.pdf|title=European Central Bank, Convergence Report|date= May 2007|quote=The euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it. To make this singleness apparent, Community law requires a single spelling of the word ''euro'' in the nominative singular case in all community and national legislative provisions, taking into account the existence of different alphabets.|access-date=29 December 2008}}</ref> This may contradict normal rules for word formation in some languages, e.g., those in which there is no ''eu'' [[diphthong]]. Bulgaria has negotiated an exception; ''euro'' in the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet is spelled as eвро (''evro'') and not eуро (''euro'') in all official documents.<ref>{{cite news|author=Elena Koinova |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2007/10/19/656777_evro-dispute-over-portuguese-foreign-minister |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212303/http://sofiaecho.com/2007/10/19/656777_evro-dispute-over-portuguese-foreign-minister |archive-date=3 June 2011 |url-status=dead |title="Evro" Dispute Over&nbsp;– Portuguese Foreign Minister&nbsp;– Bulgaria |newspaper=The Sofia Echo |date=19 October 2007 |access-date=17 July 2011}}</ref> In the Greek script the term ευρώ (evró) is used; the Greek "cent" coins are denominated in λεπτό/ά (leptó/á). Official practice for English-language EU legislation is to use the words euro and cent as both singular and plural,<ref>European Commission. "Spelling of the words "euro" and "cent" in official community languages as used in community legislative acts" (PDF). Retrieved 12 January 2009.</ref> although the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] states that the plural forms ''euros'' and ''cents'' should be used in English.<ref>For example, see European Commission, Directorate General for Translation: English Style Guide section 22.9 ''"'''The euro.''' Like 'pound', 'dollar' or any other currency name in English, the word 'euro' is written in lower case with no initial capital and, where appropriate, takes the plural 's' (as does 'cent')."''
