===Early opposition from two sides===
[[File:Sen. Hillary Clinton 2007.jpg|thumb|Hillary Clinton at [[Gallaudet University]] for the [[SEIU]] [[labor union|union]] forum in late January 2007]]
In February 2007, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that several anti-Clinton organizations, including [[Stop Her Now]] and ''Stop Hillary PAC'', were preparing "[[swiftboating]]" style attacks against her, with venues to include a documentary film, numerous books, and websites.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-hillary18feb18,0,3735952,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title=GOP activists circling Clinton's campaign |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2007-02-18 | first=Stephen | last=Braun | accessdate=2010-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007124019/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/18/nation/na-hillary18 |archive-date=2009-10-07}}</ref> A top [[Rudy Giuliani]] donor, Richard Collins, who has also supported [[George W.

Former Bill Clinton fundraiser and ally [[David Geffen]] spoke out against Hillary Clinton in an interview with [[Maureen Dowd]]. Geffen stated that Clinton "was overproduced and overscripted." He also stated that, "I don't think anybody believes that in the last six years, all of a sudden Bill Clinton has become a different person [...] Everybody in politics lies, but they do it with such ease, it's troubling."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1592614,00.html|title=TIME|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref> The Clinton campaign responded by stating, "While Senator Obama was denouncing slash and burn politics yesterday, his campaign's finance chair was viciously and personally attacking Senator Clinton and her husband. If Senator Obama is indeed sincere about his repeated claims to change the tone of our politics, he should immediately denounce these remarks, remove Mr. Geffen from his campaign and return his money. While Democrats should engage in a vigorous debate on the issues, there is no place in our party or our politics for the kind of personal insults made by Senator Obama's principal fundraiser."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=1344 |title=Clinton Camp to Obama: Cut Ties & Return Cash After Top Booster's Vicious Attacks |publisher=Hillary Clinton for President |date=2007-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127154034/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=1344 |archive-date=November 27, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Accent===
While speaking from the pulpit of the First Baptist Church in [[Selma, Alabama]], on March 4, 2007, as part of ceremonies honoring the anniversary of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965, Clinton used a broad [[Southern American English|Southern Drawl]] during parts of her talk and used speech patterns common to the [[Southern United States]].<ref>[http://www.wmcstations.com/Global/story.asp?S=6178779 "Detractors claim Hillary Clinton mocked southern accent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505083454/http://www.wmcstations.com/Global/story.asp?S=6178779 |date=May 5, 2008 }}, [[WMC-TV]], March 5, 2007.

===Discussion of Iraq War (first debate)===
On April 26, 2007, she appeared with seven other Democratic candidates at the first debate of the campaign, held at [[South Carolina State University]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina]], and broadcast on [[MSNBC]]. Of her initial Senate vote to approve the U.S. role in the [[Iraq War]], she stated, "If I knew then what I know now, I would not have voted that way." She further stated, "If this president does not get us out of Iraq, when I'm president I will."<ref>Alex Johnson, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18326264 "Democrats seek to seize initiative on Iraq: Eight candidates wrangle over who's the toughest on Bush policy"], [[NBC News]], April 27, 2007.

===Campaign song===
In June 2007, Clinton spoofed the much-talked-about closing scene of "[[Made in America (The Sopranos)|Made in America]]", the series finale of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', with the subject being the voting for her campaign song. The parody shows her entering a diner to [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s "[[Don't Stop Believin']]", followed by Bill entering but not getting the [[onion rings]] he really wants, while daughter Chelsea is unable to [[parallel parking|parallel park]] her car. ''Sopranos'' cast member [[Vince Curatola]] also appears in the skit, mimicking "Man in Members Only" but with his signature [[Johnny Sack]] malevolent glare. The screen then goes black.<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/?splash=1 Clinton Spoof] Clinton Campaign video</ref>

The campaign song selected was [[Céline Dion]]'s "[[You and I (Celine Dion song)|You and I]]", which garnered political criticism from Republicans for being "[[outsourcing|outsourced]]" to a [[Canada|Canadian]] singer; the song was written initially for use in an [[Air Canada]] commercial.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6221438.stm "Dion song captures Clinton vote"], [[BBC News]], June 20, 2007. Accessed June 23, 2007.</ref>

===Viral videos===
Besides the ''Sopranos'' spoof, other popular [[viral videos]] played a role in the campaign. In March 2007, "[[Hillary 1984]]" spliced footage of Clinton into the legendary "[[1984 (television commercial)|1984]]" [[Apple Computer]] television commercial, ending with a plug for Barack Obama's candidacy. In June 2007 Obama was the beneficiary of the very popular "[[I Got a Crush on Obama]]" [[music video]], as an attractive young woman suggestively sang his praises. In July 2007 singer and actress [[Taryn Southern]] wrote and performed in an [[answer song|answer music video]], "[[Hott4Hill]]", that earned national media attention for its sexually ambiguous declaration of support for Hillary Clinton's presidential bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,288974,00.html|title=Video Send-Up of Hillary Clinton by 'American Idol' Contestant Walks a Sexual Line|work=Fox News|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref> In both cases, the videos were created and produced independently of the Obama and Clinton campaigns. In December 2007 satirical site [[23/6]] produced two videos "against" Clinton by a purported "SwiftKids for Truth" that made fun of viral videos and negative ads in general.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://blog.nj.com/digitallife/2007/12/exposed_the_biggest_flipflop_i.html | title=Swift Kids For Truth and Cookies | first=J.

===First campaign trip with Bill===
In early July 2007, Bill Clinton "served as an opening act" for Hillary during a three-day tour.

===Later debates===
Following the July 12, 2007, Democratic candidates debate at an [[NAACP]] convention, a live microphone caught Clinton discussing in private with third-in-the-polls fellow candidate [[John Edwards]] how to get future debates limited to fewer candidates: "We've got to cut the number . . .

===Fears of backlash===
An August 12, 2007, article described concerns that a Clinton candidacy could lead to a backlash due to fears that she might prove "polarizing." The article states, "A strategist with close ties to leaders in Congress said Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races would be strongly urged to distance themselves from Clinton."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20237246 | title=Democrats quietly fear a backlash from Clinton | first=Ron | last=Fournier | agency = Associated Press | date = 2007-08-12 | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> According to an online poll, "half of likely voters nationwide said they would never vote for New York Sen.

===Unveiling of health care plan===
On September 17, 2007, Clinton revealed her new American Health Choices Plan, an "[[individual mandate]]" [[universal health care]] plan that would require health care coverage for all individuals. Clinton explained individuals can keep their current employer-based coverage, or choose an expanded version of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or federal employee health plans.<ref name=fox091707>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296997,00.html | title=Sen.

===Advertisement on care for 9/11 workers===
On October 4, 2007, Clinton's campaign began airing television advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire. The advertisement dealt with Clinton's legislative efforts to address the [[Ground Zero illness]] issues of [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks|clean-up workers]] at "[[World Trade Center site|the Pile]]" site of the former World Trade Center.<ref name = "NewsMax20071005">{{cite news | url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/hillary-ground-zero-ad/2007/10/05/id/321820/ | title=Hillary Connects to Ground Zero in Ad | publisher=[[NewsMax]] | date=2007-10-05 | accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> Some interpreted the ad as an implicit criticism of then-mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref name = "NewsMax20071005"/>

The ad, filmed in [[black-and-white]], shows an earnest-looking Clinton wearing a paper mask. The voiceover says, "She stood by Ground Zero workers who sacrificed their health after so many sacrificed their lives, and kept standing 'til the administration took action."  The ad referred to Clinton's Congressional effort to secure additional funding and medical care for workers who have suffered Ground Zero illnesses, such as cancer and sarcoidosis.<ref>Geoff Earle and Maggie Haberman, "[http://www.nypost.com/seven/10052007/news/nationalnews/hillary_in_9_11_air_strike.htm Hillary in 9/11 Air Strike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323135102/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10052007/news/nationalnews/hillary_in_9_11_air_strike.htm |date=March 23, 2008 }}," ''[[New York Post]]'', October 5, 2007, p. 5.</ref>

During the course of the 2007 Democratic debates Clinton had established a reputation, even amongst her ideological opponents such as [[Rich Lowry]], as a very solid debater who never made mistakes.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTY1MGQ2ZmNlODAxMWQwMTdhY2ZjOTNmOGMxZTIxNTQ= | title=Why I'm Not in Post-Debate Focus Groups | first=Rich| last=Lowry| author-link=Rich Lowry | magazine=[[National Review Online]] | date=2007-07-24 | accessdate=2007-11-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116213831/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTY1MGQ2ZmNlODAxMWQwMTdhY2ZjOTNmOGMxZTIxNTQ= | archive-date=November 16, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="wapo110107">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/31/AR2007103103093.html | title=Clinton Regroups As Rivals Pounce | first1=Anne E. |last1=Kornblut |author1-link=Anne E.

However, at the October 30, 2007, [[MSNBC]] Democratic debate at [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia]], Clinton was the subject of two hours of near-continuous attacks from her Democratic rivals as well as pointed questioning from moderator [[Tim Russert]].<ref name="wapo110107"/><ref name="bb110107"/>
This was not unexpected, as leading up to the debate, Clinton had assumed a wide lead in many polls, rival [[Barack Obama]] had indicated that he was now going to be more aggressive in pointing out differences between himself and Clinton, and another leading rival [[John Edwards]] had also been increasing his statements against Clinton.<ref name="nyt103007">{{cite news | url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/debate-preview-all-eyes-on-obama/ | title=Debate Preview: All Eyes on Obama | first=Adam| last=Nagourney| author-link=Adam Nagourney | newspaper=The New York Times | date=2007-10-30 | accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref> [[Adam Nagourney]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "the most eagerly anticipated forum of this year."<ref name="nyt103007"/>

Clinton refused to commit to a position on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Illegal Immigration]], the war in Iraq and the New York Governor [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s bill to deliver driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Her response on the last issue brought the most criticism, with opponent Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] and Edwards immediately saying she had contradicted herself, an assessment echoed by [[Margaret Carlson]] of [[Bloomberg News]], who wrote that "In the course of two minutes, she gave two different answers while trying to give none at all."<ref name="bb110107">{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&refer=columnist_carlson&sid=aUyd08Mpt5kE | title=Democratic Debate Proves You Can Hit a Girl | first=Margaret| last=Carlson| author-link=Margaret Carlson | publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=2007-11-01 | accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>

On November 12, 2007, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that "At two campaign events in Iowa this year, aides to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged audience members to ask her specific questions, a tactic that drew criticism from an opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination and led her yesterday to promise that it would not happen again." In response, Clinton remarked, 'It was news to me [...] and neither I nor my campaign approve of that, and it will certainly not be tolerated.'"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/us/politics/12clinton.html?ex=1352523600&en=5c224a8a4d0e4daa&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss "Clinton Aides Prompted Queries at Campaign Events"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 2007.</ref>

Kennedy|President Kennedy]] was hopeful to do, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|the President before]] had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done. That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became a real in people's lives because we had a president who said we are going to do it, and actually got it accomplished."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/01/07/clinton-talks-tears-with-fox-news/ |title=Clinton Talks Tears with Fox News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104002719/http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/01/07/clinton-talks-tears-with-fox-news/ |archive-date=2009-01-04}}</ref> Some African-American leaders took this statement as a denigration of the accomplishments of King and the larger [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name="king"/> Hillary Clinton blamed Obama for the controversy, claiming his campaign had fanned the flames, a charge which Obama dismissed as "ludicrous".<ref name="king"/> Shortly before, and during, a January 15 Democratic debate in Nevada, Clinton and Obama declared a truce on the matter, with both making reconciliatory statements about race, gender, and each other.<ref name="ft011708">{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e706e626-c49e-11dc-a474-0000779fd2ac.html|title='Truce' has little impact on black vote|first=Edward|last=Luce|work=Financial Times|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> However, there was concern that Clinton's support among some African Americans may have been damaged,<ref name="ft011708"/> with [[SUNY Albany]]'s [[Debra Dickerson]] stating "The Clintons have to do something dramatic and symbolic to win back the trust of many African-Americans."<ref name="ft011708"/>

===Michigan – maybe===
Because of a party dispute over scheduling, the January 15 [[Michigan Democratic primary, 2008|Michigan primary]] lost its delegates to the national convention, and all major candidates signed a pledge "not to campaign or participate" in Michigan's primary. The majority of candidates, including Richardson, Edwards and Obama, interpreted the pledge as requiring the removal of their names from the Michigan ballot. Clinton, however, decided to keep her name on the ballot, only agreeing to the "campaign" part of the pledge. Thus, little or no campaigning was done there (in the actual vote, Clinton would win nothing with 55&nbsp;percent of the vote against 40&nbsp;percent for an uncommitted slate<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#MI|title=Election Center 2008: Primary Results for Michigan|publisher=CNN|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=January 16, 2008}}</ref>) and attention instead moved to the January 19 [[Nevada Democratic caucuses, 2008|Nevada caucuses]].

Later, in the month, Clinton announced that she wanted a Michigan delegation (and Florida's, in the same circumstance) seated at the convention,<ref name="obs012508">{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/clinton-wants-florida-and-michigan-delegates-seated-convention |title=Clinton Wants Florida and Michigan Delegates Seated at Convention |first=Katherine |last=Jose |work=[[The New York Observer]] |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128063555/http://www.observer.com/2008/clinton-wants-florida-and-michigan-delegates-seated-convention |archive-date=January 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> saying "I hear all the time from people in Florida and Michigan that they want their voices heard in selecting the Democratic nominee.

===Nevada===
The Clinton campaign benefited from a surge in fundraising after its New Hampshire win, garnering $6 million in new funds.<ref name="lat011308">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gopmoney13jan13,1,7362218.story|title=Belt-tightening times for GOP campaigns|first=Janet|last=Hook|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 13, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014104045/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/13/nation/na-gopmoney13 |archive-date=2009-10-14}}</ref> [[Robby Mook]] served as Clinton's state director in Nevada.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/us/politics/virginia-campaign-could-lift-strategist-to-stardom.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Albert R. | last=Hunt | title=Virginia Campaign Could Lift Strategist to Stardom | date=July 14, 2013}}</ref>

In Nevada, Obama gained the valuable endorsement of the [[Culinary Workers Union]], whose 60,000 members staff the casinos and resorts of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and elsewhere.<ref name="nyt011308nv">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/us/politics/13vegas.html|title=Lawsuit Over Precincts in Nevada|first=Steve|last=Friess|work=The New York Times|date=January 13, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2008}}</ref> Clinton countered by appealing to the [[Hispanic]] vote in the state, emphasizing that they were at special risk from the fallout from the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-dems_jan13,0,6538694.story|title=Clinton makes push for Hispanics' support in Nevada|first=Michael|last=Martinez|work=Chicago Tribune|date=January 13, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2008}}</ref> Meanwhile, a proxy legal battle between Clinton and Obama broke out over the creation of special at-large precincts within nine Las Vegas resorts, which were approved in 2007 to allow casino employees a chance to participate in the caucuses, as many employees could not leave the casinos during voting hours. Clinton supporters said they violated equal protection and one-person-one-vote requirements, and the Nevada State Education Association filed a lawsuit seeking to eliminate the casino caucus sites. The organization did not officially endorse Clinton, but many of its top officials have done so.<ref name="nyt011308nv"/> This led Obama to allege that the suit was filed in order to hurt his chances at the caucuses. "Some of the people who set up the rules apparently didn't think we'd be as competitive as we were and are trying to change them last minute," he said.<ref name=judge/>

On January 17, a federal judge ruled that the casino at-large caucus plan could go ahead.

To further complicate matters, the major news and polling organizations decided to not do any polls before the Nevada caucuses, fearing the newness of the caucus, the transient nature of Nevada's population, and more fallout from their bad experience in New Hampshire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jan/11/pollsters-have-plan-nevada-skip-it/|title=Pollsters have a plan for Nevada: Skip it|first1=Brian |last1=Eckhouse |first2=Michael |last2=Mishak |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=January 13, 2008}}</ref> In one of the few polls that was conducted, the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' reported that Clinton was ahead by 9 points.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lvrj.com/breaking_news/13871382.html|title=Romney, Clinton Lead in R-J Poll|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=January 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119105732/http://www.lvrj.com/breaking_news/13871382.html |archive-date=January 19, 2008}}</ref>

===Impact of Bill Clinton===
[[File:Bill Clinton campaigning at Virginia Tech february 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton]] campaigning for Hillary Clinton at [[Virginia Tech]]. February 9, 2008.]]
After South Carolina, the Clinton campaign sought to find a "gentler" role for Bill Clinton,<ref name="nyt012808b">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/us/politics/28dems.html?hp|title=Clinton's Camp Seeks Gentler Role for Ex-President|first=Patrick|last=Healy|work=The New York Times|date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=January 28, 2008}}</ref> whose actions during the South Carolina campaign and earlier was suspected of having polarized the Democrat electorate and harming Hillary Clinton's standing among women,<ref name="nyt012808b"/> in addition to having contributed to Ted Kennedy's decision to endorse Obama.<ref name="nyt012808k"/> Congressman [[Charles Rangel]], an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, said of Bill Clinton, "He's got to [pull back].

By late February, with Hillary Clinton trailing further behind Obama, one unnamed senior adviser to her campaign said that in hindsight it had been unwise to use Bill Clinton as much as they had, as "his presence, aura and legacy caused national fatigue with the Clintons."<ref name="nyt022408">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/us/politics/24mood.html|title=Somber Clinton Soldiers on as the Horizon Darkens|first=Patrick|last=Healy|work=The New York Times|date=February 24, 2008}}</ref>

===Florida – maybe===
The [[Florida Democratic primary, 2008|Florida Primary]] on January 29, like the earlier Michigan one, had had its delegates stripped from it due to its jumping too early in the primary season. The Democratic candidates agreed not to campaign in the state, although unlike Michigan all were on the ballot here. Several days before the primary, Clinton announced that she believed Florida delegates ''should'' get seated at the national convention.<ref name="obs012508"/>

Despite no delegates apparently being at stake, over 1.5 million Democrats voted in the primary. Clinton won with 50 percent of the vote, compared to 33 percent for Obama and 14 percent for Edwards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#FL|work=CNN|title=Election Center 2008: Primary Results - Elections & Politics news from CNN.com|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Clinton was in Florida that evening and gave a brief victory speech, saying, "You know, I could not come here to ask in person for your votes.

===Role of superdelegates===
Following the Potomac primary, the potential role of [[superdelegates]] in deciding the Democratic nomination was heavily discussed. In particular, the possibility of one candidate gaining more pledged delegates from primary and caucus wins, but losing the nomination to the other due to the decisions of superdelegates, made some Democratic leaders uncomfortable. The Clinton camp, behind in pledged delegates, advocated that superdelegates exercise their own judgment in deciding which candidate to back; Clinton campaign worker [[Geraldine Ferraro]] argued for this option,<ref name="super-ferraro">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/opinion/25ferraro.html|title=Got a Problem?

The most publicized charge which Clinton used against Obama preceding the Wisconsin primary were accusations that he plagiarized portions of his campaign's national co-chair Governor [[Deval Patrick]] of Massachusetts. The lines Obama used were in response to charges by Clinton that his campaign offered "speeches but not solutions." The lines Obama used were almost verbatim from portions of a speech made by Patrick in 2006, stating "Don't tell me words don't matter.'I have a dream.' Just words? 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.' Just words! 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Just words – just speeches!" Obama stated that he borrowed the lines after being recommend to do so by Patrick who had faced similar attacks that he was only offering talk but not action.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article3392913.ece|title=Hillary Clinton hits Barack Obama with plagiarism allegation|work=The Times|location=London|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=March 11, 2008|first=Tim|last=Reid}}</ref>

One of the most controversial and upfront moves of the so-called "kitchen sink" strategy against Obama had been an ad entitled "Children" which Clinton aired in Texas concerning a 3&nbsp;am phone call at the White House during a world crisis and touting Clinton's national security credentials. Many political commentators compared the Clinton ad to one used in the 1984 Democratic primary by Walter Mondale against Gary Hart. Obama responded with a similar ad on the same day claiming that Clinton lacked the judgment to deal with a world crisis because of her vote for the Iraq War. Clinton gave her harshest rebuke of Obama yet on March 3 when she repeatedly stated that she and Senator McCain had foreign policy experience while Obama only had a speech.

On March 7, 2008, the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee]] and Clinton finance committee member [[Geraldine Ferraro]], gave an interview to the small California newspaper ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' in which she said, "I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama's campaign – to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against. For one thing, you have the press, which has been uniquely hard on her. It's been a very sexist media. Some just don't like her. The others have gotten caught up in the Obama campaign.

===Campaign finance===
The Clinton campaign had $33 million on hand at the end of February 2008, but due to federal election laws, would only be able to spend $11 million of that on the Democratic primary. As of the end of February, the campaign owed $8.7 million in unpaid debts. The campaign has also been slow paying vendors, drawing criticism from small business owners who have provided services to the campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9259.html|title=Cash-strapped Clinton fails to pay bills|work=Politico|accessdate=March 31, 2008|date=March 30, 2008|last=Vogel|first=Kenneth P.}}</ref>

After Clinton's April win in the Pennsylvania primary by 9.4%, her campaign released to the media that it had received a renewed national boost, as evidenced by 60,000 donors who contributed a total of $10 million, more than 80 percent of whom the campaign said were first-time donors. An investigation from The Politico, however, concluded that the claim was only "successful campaign [[Spin (public relations)|spin]]," and "a case of shaping favorable media coverage by crafting a narrative too compelling to overlook." Politico concluded this because the campaign's claims, it said, were "impossible to independently verify."<ref>Kenneth P.

On March 27, Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] of [[Vermont]] called for Clinton to withdraw from the presidential campaign and support opponent [[Barack Obama]]. The six-term senator, and chair of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] made the statements during an interview on [[Vermont Public Radio]]. Leahy stated: "Senator Clinton has every right, but not a very good reason, to remain a candidate for as long as she wants to. As far as the delegate count and the interests of a Democratic victory in November go, there is not a very good reason for drawing this out."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080328/ap_on_el_pr/clinton_leahy|title=Leahy says Clinton should withdraw|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=March 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331233603/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080328/ap_on_el_pr/clinton_leahy |archive-date=March 31, 2008}}</ref> Clinton rejected calls to withdraw, saying "The more people get a chance to vote, the better it is for our democracy...we of all people [know] how important it [is] to give everyone a chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted." Campaigning in the week of April 14, 2008, included a tough debate between Obama and Clinton, who pounded her rival for his recent remark that decades of economic decline had left some rural voters "bitter" and clinging to religion and guns.

On April 22, she won the [[Pennsylvania Democratic primary, 2008|Pennsylvania primary]] by 9.2&nbsp;percentage points, keeping her campaign alive and bringing in a much-needed $4.3 million in new funds over the next 24 hours, although the campaign claimed the figure was $10 million.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/2008-04-25-voa1.cfm|title=Pennsylvania Win Helps Clinton Raise Millions, Adds to Obama Questions|publisher=Voice of America|date=April 25, 2008|accessdate=April 25, 2008}}</ref> Weekly churchgoers made up almost 36 percent of the electorate, who went to Clinton by a 56–44 margin.

After winning West Virginia, the Clinton campaign claimed a lead in the popular vote. The math behind this claim required (1) excluding the caucus states of Iowa, Nevada, Maine, and Washington; (2) including the disputed Florida totals; (3) including the disputed Michigan totals; (4) allotting 0 votes to Obama in Michigan.

Clinton's mention of the 1968 [[assassination of Robert F.

===Florida and Michigan resolution===
At a meeting of the [[Democratic National Committee]] Rules & Bylaws Committee held in Washington, D.C., on May 31, 2008, decisions were made regarding seating delegates from the [[Michigan Democratic primary, 2008|Michigan primary]] and [[Florida Democratic primary, 2008|Florida primary]].<ref name="cnn060108">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/31/dems.delegates/index.html|title=Florida, Michigan get all delegates, but each gets half vote|publisher=CNN|date=June 1, 2008|accessdate=June 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531160733/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/31/dems.delegates/index.html |archive-date=May 31, 2008}}</ref>

The Florida delegation was seated by following the results of the primary, but with each delegate having one-half vote in consequence of the penalty for holding the primary too early. This gave Clinton 105 pledged delegates (52.5 votes), Obama 67 delegates (33.5 votes), and Edwards 13 delegates (6.5 votes). The Florida resolution was acceptable to all sides and approved by a committee vote of 27 to 0.<ref name="cnn060108"/>

The Michigan resolution was less obvious, since only Clinton of the major candidates had been on the ballot. The same half-vote penalty was employed, then a formulation was devised wherein the Michigan delegation was seated with 69 delegates (34.5 votes) pledged to Clinton and 59 delegates (29.5 votes) for Obama. This gave Obama four more delegates than the primary results would have warranted, assuming that all "uncommitted" votes were for Obama. The Michigan resolution was approved by a vote of 19 to 8. [[Harold M. Ickes]], a strong supporter and representative of Clinton, objected strongly to the resolution, saying: "This motion will hijack – hijack – remove four delegates won by Hillary Clinton. This body of 30 individuals has decided that they're going to substitute their judgment for 600,000 voters."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/31/AR2008053102355_pf.html|title="Fla., Mich.

===Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Montana===
The final three primaries took place in early June. The Clinton campaign knew the end was near, but enjoyed the time spent at events in [[Puerto Rico]], and Clinton spoke of the virtue of "finishing the job."<ref>Mark Leibovich, "Far From Her Party's Bitter Feuding, a Breezy Island Weekend for Clinton", ''The New York Times'', June 2, 2008.</ref>

On June 1, Clinton won the [[Puerto Rico Democratic primary, 2008|Puerto Rico primary]] by more than a 2-to-1 margin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/01/puerto.rico/index.html|title=Clinton wins in Puerto Rico, CNN projects|publisher=CNN|date=June 1, 2008}}</ref> Later on June 3, Clinton won the [[South Dakota Democratic primary, 2008|South Dakota primary]] and Obama won the [[Montana Democratic primary, 2008|Montana primary]]. This was the final primary of the season.

===Obama becomes the presumptive presidential nominee===
A flurry of superdelegates declared for Obama on June 3, and that combined with the day's winning of new pledged delegates in the two primaries, meant Obama had gained enough delegates to become the [[presumptive nominee|presumptive presidential nominee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html|title=CNN projects Obama clinches nomination|publisher=CNN|date=June 3, 2008|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref>

Following the result, after rumors fueled by a misunderstanding of an [[Associated Press]] report, the campaign dismissed suggestions that Clinton was going to concede in the speech following the primaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/clinton-campaign-confronts-ap-report/|work=The New York Times|title=Clinton Campaign Confronts A.P.

Meanwhile, while not officially confirming interest in the vice presidential slot, Clinton hinted at the possibility earlier on June 3. When asked for clarification, her campaign released the statement "Today on a conference call with New York legislators, Sen.

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the relationship between Obama and Clinton during the campaign as having "veered between strained and strange",<ref name="nyt060408an"/> and suggested that the manner in which Obama reacted to Clinton and her supporters would be a major test of the post-primaries period.<ref name="nyt060408an">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/us/politics/04assess.html|title=Next on Agenda Is Clinton's Role|first=Adam|last=Nagourney|author-link=Adam Nagourney|work=The New York Times|date=June 4, 2008}}</ref>

Obama responded to the speech in a number of venues. Shortly after she gave it, Obama stated that he was "thrilled and honored" to be supported by Clinton.<ref name="ap060708"/> In [[North Carolina]] on June 9, 2008, Obama began his speech by praising Clinton. He stated:
