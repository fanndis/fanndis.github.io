'''''Stuff''''' is a British [[consumer electronics]] magazine published by [[Kelsey Media]].

== History ==
''Stuff'' was first published in Britain in November 1996 by [[Dennis Publishing]]. A bi-monthly title, it followed the success of magazines such as ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]'' in being pitched toward a young, male audience, with a focus on consumer goods and electronics.

The brand took a more lifestyle orientated direction in 1998, before publishing group [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket]] bought the title in January 1999 and refocusing the magazine to consumer electronics.

In May 2018 the brand was sold to Kelsey Media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kelsey.co.uk/news/haymarket-media-group-agrees-sale-of-worlds-best-selling-gadget-magazine-stuff-to-kelsey-media/|title=Haymarket Media Group agrees sale of world’s best-selling gadget magazine - Stuff - to Kelsey Media {{!}} Kelsey Media|date=2018-05-31|work=Kelsey Media|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fusiondiginet.com/2018/05/31/kelsey-media-acquires-stuff-gadget-magazine-from-haymarket/|title=Kelsey Media acquires Stuff gadget magazine from Haymarket|date=2018-05-31|website=Fusion Corporate Partners|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>

Haymarket Media Group CEO Kevin Costello said at the time of the sale: "''Stuff'' is a truly iconic brand, trusted by its tech-loving followers to entertain, educate and inspire. It's been a big part of the Haymarket story, but our strategic focus has shifted and ''Stuff'' needs a new home where the brand can really achieve its potential."

== UK edition ==
