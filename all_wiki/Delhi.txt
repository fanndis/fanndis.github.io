A [[union territory]], the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a [[States of India|state]] of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a [[Chief Minister of Delhi|Chief Minister]]. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal [[government of India]] and the local [[government of Delhi]], and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi hosted the inaugural [[1951 Asian Games]], [[1982 Asian Games]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|1983 NAM Summit]], [[2010 Men's Hockey World Cup]], [[2010 Commonwealth Games]], [[4th BRICS summit|2012 BRICS Summit]] and was one of the major host cities of the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]].

Delhi is also the centre of the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR), which is a unique 'interstate regional planning' area created by the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rationale|url=http://ncrpb.nic.in/rationale.php|website=ncrpb.nic.in|publisher=NCR Planning Board|quote=The National Capital Region (NCR) in India was constituted under the NCRPB Act, 1985|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216113422/http://www.ncrpb.nic.in/rationale.php|archivedate=16 December 2012|access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="profile">{{cite web|title=Census 2011|url=http://ncrpb.nic.in/pdf_files/Annual%20Report%202014-15.pdf|website=National Capital Region Planning Board|publisher=National Informatics Centre|accessdate=26 March 2016|page=3|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406160207/http://ncrpb.nic.in/pdf_files/Annual%20Report%202014-15.pdf|archivedate=6 April 2016}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Delhi|Old Delhi}}

=== Ancient and Early Medieval Periods ===
The area around Delhi was probably inhabited before the second millennium BCE and there is evidence of continuous inhabitation since at least the 6th century BCE.<ref name=asherhabit /> The city is believed to be the site of [[Indraprastha]], the legendary capital of the [[Pandava]]s in the Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.<ref name="ecosurv1" /> According to the Mahabharata, this land was initially a huge mass of forests called '[[Khandava Forest|Khandavaprastha]]' which was burnt down to build the city of Indraprastha. The earliest architectural relics date back to the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] period (c. 300 BCE); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]] (273–235 BCE) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these were in the southern part of present-day Delhi. King [[Anangpal Tomar|Anang Pal]] of the [[Tomara dynasty]] founded the city of [[History of Delhi|Lal Kot]] in 736 CE. [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] conquered Lal Kot in 1178 and renamed it [[Qila Rai Pithora]].

The king [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] was defeated in 1192 by [[Muhammad of Ghor|Muhammad Ghori]] in the second battle of Tarain, a Muslim invader from [[Afghanistan]], who made a concerted effort to conquer northern India.<ref name=ecosurv1 /> By 1200, native Hindu resistance had begun to crumble, and the Muslim invaders were victorious. The newfound dominance of foreign Turkic Muslim dynasties in north India would last for the next five centuries. The slave general of Ghori, [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutb-ud-din Aibak]], was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India until Ghori returned to his capital, [[Ghor Province|Ghor]]. When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE, his territories fractured, with various generals claiming sovereignty over different areas. Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions, and laid the foundation of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]]. He began construction of the [[Qutb Minar]] and [[Qutb complex|Quwwat-al-Islam]] (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. It was his successor, [[Iltutmish]] (1211–1236), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India.<ref name=ecosurv1 /><ref name=Quwwat>{{cite web

The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] (1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra]] in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]] (1351–1388), the [[Delhi Sultanate]] rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces.

Delhi is located in [[North India|Northern India]], at {{coord|28.61|N|77.23|E}}. The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Haryana]] and to the east by that of [[Uttar Pradesh]] (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the [[Delhi ridge]]. The [[Yamuna river]] was the historical boundary between [[Punjab]] and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in [[Hinduism]], is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The [[Hindon River]] separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the [[Aravalli Range]] in the south and encircles the west, north-east and north-west parts of the city. It reaches a height of {{convert|318|m|abbr=on}} and is a dominant feature of the region.<ref name=gisridge>{{cite web |url=https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig_2002/Ts3-9/TS3_9_mohan.pdf |title=GIS-Based Spatial Information Integration, Modeling and Digital Mapping: A New Blend of Tool for Geospatial Environmental Health Analysis for Delhi Ridge |accessdate=3 February 2007 |last=Mohan |first=Madan |date=April 2002 |work=Spatial Information for Health Monitoring and Population Management |publisher=FIG XXII International Congress |page=5 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151705/https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig_2002/Ts3-9/TS3_9_mohan.pdf |archivedate=22 December 2015 }}</ref>

=== Metro ===
[[File:Delhi Metro - Magenta Line.jpg|right|thumb|[[Delhi Metro]] is the lifeline of Delhi- [[National Capital Region (India)|NCR]].]]
The [[Delhi Metro]] is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, [[Ghaziabad]], [[Faridabad]], [[Gurgaon]] and [[Noida]] in the National Capital Region of India. Delhi Metro is the world's tenth-largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro was India's second modern public transportation system. The network consists of eleven lines with a total length of {{convert|311|km|mi|abbr=off}} with 214 stations, which are a mix of underground, at-grade and elevated stations. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at Metro stations to further encourage the use of the system. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.
It has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi–ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi–ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. The Phase-I of Delhi Metro was built at a cost of US$2.3&nbsp;billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional {{INRConvert|216|b}}.<ref name="Bloomberg.com: Opinion" /> Phase-II has a total length of 128&nbsp;km and was completed by 2010.<ref name="Economictimes.indiatimes.com" /> [[Delhi Metro]] completed 10&nbsp;years of operation on 25 December 2012.

Delhi Metro is being built and operated by the [[Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited]] (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the organisation is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Besides construction and operation of Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by [[Padma Vibhushan]] [[E. Sreedharan]], the managing director of DMRC and popularly known as the "Metro Man" of India. He famously resigned from DMRC taking moral responsibility for a metro bridge collapse, which took five lives. Sreedharan was awarded the prestigious [[Legion of Honour]] by the French Government for his contribution to Delhi Metro.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/11/23/stories/2005112322640300.htm|title=French award presented to Sreedharan|place=New Delhi|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=23 November 2005|accessdate=24 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117091622/http://www.thehindu.com/2005/11/23/stories/2005112322640300.htm|archive-date=17 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
