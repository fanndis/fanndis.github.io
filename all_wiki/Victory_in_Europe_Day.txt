'''Victory in Europe Day''' is the day celebrating the formal acceptance by the [[Allies of World War II]] of [[Germany|Germany’s]] [[unconditional surrender]] of [[Wehrmacht|its armed forces]] on Tuesday, 8 May 1945, marking the [[end of World War II in Europe]]. Several countries observe [[Public holiday|public holidays]] on the day each year, also called Victory Over Fascism Day, Liberation Day or Victory Day. In the UK it is often abbreviated to '''VE Day''', or '''V-E Day''' in the US, a term which existed as early as September 1944,<ref>{{cite web|title=VE Day|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=VE+Day|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> in anticipation of victory.

Several former [[Soviet bloc]] countries like [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Serbia]] celebrate on [[Victory Day (9 May)|9 May]] as the end of all combat actions was specified at 23:01 [[Central European Time]], which was already 9 May in the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Israel]] also [[Victory in Europe Day (Israel)|marks VE Day on 9 May]], as a result of the large number of immigrants from the former Soviet bloc, but it is not a public holiday.

[[Adolf Hitler]], the [[Führer|Nazi leader]], had [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April during the [[Battle of Berlin]] and Germany's surrender was authorised by his successor, ''[[Reichspräsident]]'' [[Karl Dönitz]]. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the [[Flensburg Government]]. The act of military surrender was first signed at 02:41 on 7 May in [[SHAEF]] HQ at [[Reims]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Charles|title=Leaders & Personalities of the Third Reich, Vol. 2|publisher=R. James Bender Publishing|year=1996|isbn=978-0-912138-66-4|location=San Jose, CA|pages=285, 286}}</ref> and a slightly modified document, considered the definitive [[German Instrument of Surrender]], was signed on 8 May 1945 in [[Karlshorst]], [[Berlin]] at 21:20 local time.

Upon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the western world, especially in the UK and North America. More than one million people celebrated in the streets throughout the UK to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in [[Trafalgar Square]] and up [[The Mall (London)|the Mall]] to [[Buckingham Palace]], where King [[George VI]] and Queen [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]], accompanied by their daughters and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Churchill went from the palace to [[Whitehall]] where he addressed another large crowd:{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=355}}

{{quote|God bless you all. This is your victory. In our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone, man or woman, has done their best.}}

At this point he asked [[Ernest Bevin]] to come forward and share the applause. Bevin said: "No, Winston, this is your day", and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of ''[[For He's a Jolly Good Fellow]]''.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=355}} Later, Princess [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/queen-elizabeth-ve-day-75-princess-margaret-celebrate-london-crowds-king-a9490676.html |last=Barr |first=Sabrina |title=How Princess Elizabeth celebrated VE Day |publisher=The Independent |date=8 May 2020 |accessdate=11 May 2020}}</ref>

In the United States, the event coincided with President [[Harry Truman]]'s 61st birthday.<ref name="TrumanBirthday"/> He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.<ref name="VEDay">{{cite news |title=Victory Wreath From Truman Is Laid On Hyde Park Grave of War President |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 May 1945 |page=15 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Flags remained at [[half-staff]] for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.<ref>{{cite news |title=Army Extends Mourning Period |newspaper=New York Times |date=12 May 1945 |page=13 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=30 Days of Mourning For Roosevelt Ended |newspaper=New York Times |date=15 May 1945 |page=4 |author=United Press}}</ref> Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was "that Franklin D.

Tempering the jubilation somewhat, both Churchill and Truman pointed out that the war against [[Japan]] had not yet been won. In his radio broadcast at 15:00 on 8 May, Churchill told the [[British people]] that: "We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing (as Japan) remains unsubdued".{{sfn|Telfer|2015|p=33}}{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=356}} In America, Truman broadcast at 09:00 and said it was "a victory only half won".{{sfn|Telfer|2015|p=76}}

=== Germany ===
Events in [[Berlin]] occur on 8 May to commemorate those who fought against Nazism in the [[German resistance to Nazism|German Resistance]] and lost their lives in World War II. In 2020, a regional holiday in Berlin occurred on 8 May to mark the 75th anniversary of surrender.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Schereck|first=Sabine|date=8 May 2020|title=Berlin marks end of WW2 with unprecedented holiday|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52574748|access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref> [[East Germany]] celebrated 8 May as its ''Tag der Befreiung'' (Day of Liberation), first celebrated under [[Walter Ulbricht]]'s government in 1950 and repeated annually until the [[fall of communism]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=May 8, 1945: Total defeat or day of liberation? {{!}} DW {{!}} 05.05.2020|url=https://www.dw.com/en/may-8-1945-total-defeat-or-day-of-liberation/a-53340869|website=Deutsche Welle (www.dw.com)|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref> Between 1975 and 1990, it was ''Tag des Sieges'' (Victory Day).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Poland ===
8 May is known in [[Poland]] as "Narodowy Dzień Zwycięstwa" (National Victory Day). [[Public holidays in Poland|Poland]] officially recognised 9 May from 1945 until 2014, and on 24 April 2015, Poland officially recognised National Victory Day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mamy nowe święto państwowe.

Finally, in Poland, the National Day of Victory and Freedom was established by a decree of 9 May.  From 1946–1989, it was celebrated with Russian traditions being a [[Polish People's Republic|socialist state]] at the time. The main celebrations were carried out at Plac Zwycięstwa or [[Parade Square|Plac Defilad]] in [[Warsaw]] (most notably in [[1985 Warsaw Victory Day Parade|1985]]). After 1990, no official ceremonies were organized, however many cities and military units together with local governments organized their own festivities. The [[Russian minority in Poland]] continues to celebrate 9 May traditions to this date. At the end of March 2015, due to the upcoming 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, the President of the Institute of National Remembrance Łukasz Kamiński sent a letter to the [[Speaker of the Sejm]] requesting the change from 9 May to 8 May.<ref>{{cite web|title=Informacja o działalności Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu w okresie 1 stycznia 2015 r. – 31 grudnia 2015 r., Warszawa 2016, s. 107 i 109|url=https://ipn.gov.pl/download/1/66091/SPRAWOZDANIEIPN2015.pdf|accessdate=2018-05-07|language=pl}}</ref> On 24 April, the [[Sejm]] adopted the Act on National Victory Day celebrated on May 8, at the same time abolishing the National Day of Victory and Freedom celebrated on May 9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20150000622|title=Ustawa z dnia 24 kwietnia 2015 r. o ustanowieniu Narodowego Dnia Zwycięstwa|website=isap.sejm.gov.pl}}</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===
The [[United Kingdom]] celebrates Victory in Europe Day on 8 May as a national commemorative holiday. VE Day is not an annual public holiday because of the proximity of the [[May Day]] [[bank holiday]] on the first Monday in May. In 1995 and 2020 the bank holiday was moved from the preceding Monday to 8 May to commemorate the 50th and 75th anniversaries of VE Day, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/08/ve-day-2020-75-anniversary-celebrations-live-latest-news/|title=VE Day 2020: Britons celebrate 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day|first1=Verity|last1=Bowman|first2=Georgina|last2=Hayes|date=8 May 2020|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2020-may-bank-holiday-will-be-moved-to-mark-75th-anniversary-of-ve-day |title=2020 May bank holiday will be moved to mark 75th anniversary of VE Day |website=GOV.UK |date=7 June 2019 |accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>

===Soviet Victory Day===
{{main|Victory Day (9 May)}}
The instrument of surrender signed 7 May 1945 stipulated that all hostilities must cease at 23:01 ([[Central European Time|CET]]), 8 May 1945. Since that point in time would be on 9 May in local time in the USSR, most Soviet states including Russia celebrated [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|Victory Day]] on 9 May.<ref>[[Earl F.
