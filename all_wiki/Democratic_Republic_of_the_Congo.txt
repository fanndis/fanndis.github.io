The '''Democratic Republic of the Congo''' ('''DRC''') ({{pronunciation|En-DRC-pronunciation.ogg}} {{lang-fr|République démocratique du Congo (RDC) {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃ɡo|}}}}), also known as '''Congo-Kinshasa''', '''DR Congo''' ({{lang-fr|RD Congo}}), '''the DROC''',<ref name=DROC /> or simply either '''Congo''' or '''the Congo''', and historically '''[[Zaire]]''', is a country in [[Central Africa]]. It is, by area, the largest country in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the second-largest in all of Africa (after [[Algeria]]), and the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|11th-largest in the world]]. With a population of over 101&nbsp;million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most-populous [[List of countries where French is an official language|officially Francophone country]] in the world, as well as the 4th-most populous in [[Africa]], and the [[List of countries by population|15th-most populous country in the world]]. Since 2015, the Eastern DR Congo has been the scene of an [[Kivu conflict|ongoing military conflict in Kivu]].

Centred on the [[Congo Basin]], the territory of the DRC was first inhabited by [[Central African foragers]] around 90,000 years ago and was reached by the [[Bantu expansion]] about 3,000 years ago. In the west, the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] ruled around the mouth of the [[Congo River]] from the 14th to 19th centuries. In the northeast, centre and east, the kingdoms of [[Zande people|Azande]], [[Kingdom of Luba|Luba]] and [[Kingdom of Lunda|Lunda]] ruled from the 16th and 17th centuries to the 19th century.

In the 1870s, just before the onset of the [[Scramble for Africa]], European [[exploration of the Congo Basin]] was carried out, first led by [[Henry Morton Stanley]] under the sponsorship of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885 and declared the land his private property, naming it the [[Congo Free State]]. During the Free State, his [[Colonialism|colonial]] military unit, the ''[[Force Publique]],'' forced the local population to produce [[Natural rubber|rubber]]. From 1885 to 1908, millions of the Congolese people died as a consequence of [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|disease and exploitation]]. In 1908, Leopold, despite his initial reluctance, [[Leopold II of Belgium#Relinquishment of the Congo|ceded]] the so-called Free State to [[Belgium]], thus it became known as the [[Belgian Congo]].

Congo achieved independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960 under the name [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]]. [[Congolese nationalism (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Congolese nationalist]] [[Patrice Lumumba]] was [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|elected]] the first [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]], while [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] became the first [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]]. Conflict arose over the administration of the territory, which became known as the [[Congo Crisis]]. The [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|provinces]] of [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], under [[Moïse Tshombe]], and [[South Kasai]] attempted to secede. After the UN and Western governments refused his requests for aid and Lumumba stated that he was open to any country, including the [[Soviet Union]], for assistance in the crisis, the US and Belgium became wary and oversaw his removal from office by [[Kasa-Vubu, Kinshasa|Kasa-Vubu]] on 5 September and ultimate execution by Belgian-led Katangese troops on 17 January 1961.

On 25 November 1965, Army Chief of Staff Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, who later renamed himself [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], officially came into power through a [[Congo Crisis#Second Mobutu coup d'état|coup d'état]]. In 1971, he renamed the country [[Zaire]]. The country was run as a [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] [[one-party state]], with his [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] as the sole legal party. Mobutu's government received considerable support from the United States, due to its anti-communist stance during the [[Cold War]]. By the early 1990s, Mobutu's government began to weaken. Destabilisation in the east resulting from the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] and disenfranchisement among the eastern [[Banyamulenge]] (Congolese Rwandans of the Tutsi tribe) population led to a 1996 invasion led by [[Tutsi]] [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|FPR]]-ruled Rwanda, which began the [[First Congo War]].<ref name="cia.gov" />

On 17 May 1997, [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], a leader of Tutsi forces from the province of [[South Kivu]], became President after Mobutu fled to [[Morocco]], reverting the country's name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tensions between President Kabila and the Rwandan and Tutsi presence in the country led to the [[Second Congo War]] from 1998 to 2003. Ultimately, nine African countries and around twenty armed groups became involved in the war,<ref name="Bowers2">{{cite web|url=http://mydd.com/story/2006/7/24/135222/827|title=World War Three|date=24 July 2006|publisher=My Direct Democracy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007113538/http://mydd.com/story/2006/7/24/135222/827|archive-date=7 October 2008|author=Bowers, Chris}}</ref> which resulted in the deaths of 5.4&nbsp;million people.<ref name="IRC2007fullreport">

</ref> The two wars devastated the country. President Laurent-Désiré Kabila was assassinated by one of his bodyguards on 16 January 2001 and was succeeded eight days later by his son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]], under whom [[Human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|human rights in the country]] remained poor and included frequent abuses such as [[forced disappearance]]s, torture, arbitrary imprisonment and restrictions on civil liberties according to NGOs.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely rich in [[natural resource]]s but has suffered from [[Fragile state|political instability]], a lack of infrastructure, corruption, and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation with little widespread development. Besides the capital [[Kinshasa]], the two next largest cities, [[Lubumbashi]] and [[Mbuji-Mayi]] are both mining communities. DR Congo's largest export is raw minerals, with China accepting over 50% of DRC's exports in 2012.

==Etymology==
{{further|Congo River|Kongo people}}
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after the [[Congo River]], which flows throughout the country. The Congo River is the world's deepest river and the world's second-largest river [[List of rivers by discharge|by discharge]]. The ''Comité d'études du haut Congo'' ("Committee for the Study of the Upper Congo"), established by [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]] in 1876, and the [[International Association of the Congo]], established by him in 1879, were also named after the river.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmadDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|title=The Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Congo River itself was named by early European sailors after the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] and its [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] inhabitants, the [[Kongo people]], when they encountered them in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sj9mDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA158|title=Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|last=Kisangani|first=Emizet Francois|year= 2016|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-7316-0|pages=158|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IwMwBVfr0sC&pg=PA79
|title=Africa's Urban Past|last=Anderson|first=David|date=2000|isbn=978-0-85255-761-7}}</ref> The word ''Kongo'' comes from the [[Kongo language]] (also called ''Kikongo''). According to American writer Samuel Henry Nelson: "It is probable that the word 'Kongo' itself implies a public gathering and that it is based on the root ''konga'', 'to gather' (trans[itive])."<ref>Nelson, Samuel Henry. Colonialism In The Congo Basin, 1880–1940. Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1994</ref> The modern name of the Kongo people, ''Bakongo'' was introduced in the early 20th century.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been known in the past as, in chronological order, the [[Congo Free State]], [[Belgian Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of Congo-Léopoldville]], the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the [[Republic of Zaire]], before returning to its current name the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<ref name="cia.gov" />

At the time of independence, the country was named the Republic of Congo-Léopoldville to distinguish it from its neighbour the [[Republic of the Congo|Republic of the Congo-Brazzaville]]. With the promulgation of the [[Luluabourg Constitution]] on 1 August 1964, the country became the DRC, but was renamed to [[Zaire]] (a past name for the Congo River) on 27 October 1971 by President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] as part of his ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|Authenticité]]'' initiative.<ref name="kisanganibobb">{{Cite book |author1=Emizet Francois Kisangani |author2=Scott F.

The word ''Zaire'' is from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] adaptation of a [[Kongo language|Kikongo]] word ''nzere'' ("river"), a truncation of ''nzadi o nzere'' ("river swallowing rivers").<ref>Forbath, Peter. ''The River Congo'' (1977), p. 19.</ref> The river was known as ''Zaire'' during the 16th and 17th centuries; ''Congo'' seems to have replaced ''Zaire'' gradually in English usage during the 18th century, and ''Congo'' is the preferred English name in 19th-century literature, although references to ''Zaire'' as the name used by the natives (i.e. derived from Portuguese usage) remained common.<ref>James Barbot, ''An Abstract of a Voyage to Congo River, Or the Zair and to Cabinde in the Year 1700'' (1746).

===Early history===
{{Main|Early Congolese history}}
The geographical area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 90,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the [[Semliki harpoon]] at [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]], one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, believed to have been used to catch [[Bagrus|giant river catfish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point |title=Katanda Bone Harpoon Point &#124; The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|publisher=Humanorigins.si.ed|access-date=10 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302062128/http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/katanda-bone-harpoon-point|archive-date=2 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Barbed Bone Points: Tradition and Continuity in Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa |date=1 September 1998|doi=10.1023/A:1021659928822|volume=15|issue=3 |journal=African Archaeological Review|pages=173–98|last1=Yellen|first1=John E.|s2cid=128432105}}</ref>

[[Bantu peoples]] reached Central Africa at some point during the first millennium BC, then gradually started to expand southward. Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of [[pastoralism]] and of [[Iron Age]] techniques.
The people living in the south and southwest were [[Central African foragers|foraging]] groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture. This led to the displacement of the hunter-gatherer groups in the east and southeast.
The final wave of the [[Bantu expansion]] was complete by the 10th century, followed by the establishment of the Bantu kingdoms, whose rising populations soon made possible intricate local, regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in slaves, salt, iron and copper.

[[Belgian Congo|Belgian exploration]] and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by [[Sir Henry Morton Stanley]], who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of [[King Leopold II of Belgium]]. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant [[slave raiding]], mainly from Arab–Swahili [[Arab slave trade|slave traders]] such as the infamous [[Tippu Tip]], who was well known to Stanley.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page51.shtml The East African slave trade] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206194052/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page51.shtml |date=6 December 2013 }}.

Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the [[Conference of Berlin]] in 1885 and made the land his private property. He named it the Congo Free State.<ref name="cfskeyes"/> Leopold's regime began various infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the [[Matadi–Kinshasa Railway|railway that ran from the coast to the capital]] of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), which took eight years to complete. Nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which Leopold and his associates could extract from the colony.<ref name=b1>[[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild, Adam]]. ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999; {{ISBN|0-547-52573-7}}</ref>

In the Free State, colonists coerced the local population into producing [[rubber]], for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market. Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in [[Brussels]] and [[Ostend]] to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the army, the ''[[Force Publique]]'', was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy.<ref name="google748">Fage, John D.

During the period of 1885–1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically&nbsp;– it has been estimated that [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[smallpox]] killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River.<ref name="google748"/>

News of the abuses began to circulate. In 1904, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, [[Roger Casement]] was instructed by the British government to investigate. His report, called the [[Casement Report]], confirmed the accusations of humanitarian abuses. The Belgian Parliament forced Leopold II to set up an independent commission of inquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report of abuses, concluding that the population of the Congo had been "reduced by half" during this period.<ref name=b1/> Determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.

[[File:Bugidi, the mission engineer, and his wife. Bakundi was a Bateke boy, trained by Grenfell.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|1908 photograph of a married [[Christians|Christian]] couple.]]

In 1908, the [[Belgian parliament]], in spite of initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) and took over the Free State from [[King Leopold II]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness|magazine=History Today|author=Tim Stanley|volume=62|number=10|date=October 2012|title=Belgium's Heart of Darkness|access-date=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121065836/http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness|archive-date=21 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian [[colony]]. Executive power went to the [[Minister of the Colonies (Belgium)|Belgian minister of colonial affairs]], assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in [[Brussels]]). The Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo. In 1926 the colonial capital moved from Boma to [[Léopoldville]], some {{convert|300|km|mi}} further upstream into the interior.

The transition from the Congo Free State to the [[Belgian Congo]] was a break but it also featured a large degree of continuity. The last Governor-general of the Congo Free State, Baron [[Théophile Wahis]], remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold II's administration with him.<ref>Stengers, Jean (2005), ''Congo: Mythes et réalités'', Brussels: Editions Racine.</ref> Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches to the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion&nbsp;– however, other priorities, such as healthcare and basic education, slowly gained in importance.

Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed (a system of European courts and another one of indigenous courts, ''tribunaux indigènes''). Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. [[File:Congo belge campagne 1918.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers in the Belgian Congo in 1918.

The Belgian population of the colony increased from 1,928 in 1910 to nearly 89,000 in 1959.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), an initial stand-off between the ''Force Publique'' and the German colonial army in [[German East Africa]] ([[Tanganyika]]) turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian-Portuguese invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]]. The ''Force Publique'' gained a notable victory when it marched into [[Tabora]] in September 1916 under the command of General [[Charles Tombeur]] after heavy fighting.

After 1918, Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the ''Force Publique'' in the East African campaign with a [[League of Nations]] mandate over the previously German colony of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. During [[World War II]], the Belgian Congo provided a crucial source of income for the [[Belgian government in exile|Belgian government-in-exile]] in London, and the ''Force Publique'' again participated in Allied campaigns in Africa.

===Independence and political crisis (1960–1965)===

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC) led by [[Patrice Lumumba]], won the [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960|parliamentary elections]]. Patrice Lumumba thus became the first [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]], then known as the Republic of the Congo, on 24 June 1960. The parliament elected [[Joseph Kasavubu]] as [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]], of the [[Alliance des Bakongo]] (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the [[Parti Solidaire Africain]] (PSA) led by [[Antoine Gizenga]], and the Parti National du Peuple (PNP) led by Albert Delvaux and [[Laurent Mbariko]].<ref>Congo 1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium</ref>

The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name "République du Congo" ("Republic of Congo" or "Republic of the Congo" in English). As the neighboring French colony of [[Middle Congo]] (Moyen Congo) also chose the name "[[Republic of Congo]]" upon achieving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as "Congo-Léopoldville" and "Congo-Brazzaville", after their capital cities.

Shortly after independence the Force Publique mutinied, and on 11 July the [[Katanga Province|province of Katanga]] (led by [[Moïse Tshombe]]) and [[South Kasai]] engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership.<ref>"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826488-4,00.html Jungle Shipwreck] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216231712/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826488-4,00.html |date=16 December 2014 }}", ''Time'', 25 July 1960.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=- HeinOnline.org |url=https://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Welcome?message=Please%20log%20in&url=%2FHOL%2FPage%3Fhandle%3Dhein.cow%2Fcowcs0092%26size%3D2%26collection%3Dcow%26id%3D1 |website=www.heinonline.org |language=en |access-date=16 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116131729/https://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Welcome?message=Please%20log%20in&url=%2FHOL%2FPage%3Fhandle%3Dhein.cow%2Fcowcs0092%26size%3D2%26collection%3Dcow%26id%3D1 |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm|title=The United Nations and the Congo|publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk|date=30 March 2007|access-date=2 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601233005/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm|archive-date=1 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite.<ref>[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/4/6/0/pages254609/p254609-19.php "Hearts of Darkness"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130056/http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/4/6/0/pages254609/p254609-19.php |date=25 April 2012 }}, allacademic.com</ref>

Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (the [[College of Commissioners-General|Collège des commissaires généraux]]). The secession ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments, of [[Joseph Ileo]], [[Cyrille Adoula]] and Moise Tshombe, took over in quick succession.

Lumumba had previously appointed Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army, [[Military of the Democratic Republic of Congo|Armée Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Tshombe, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup.

{{Main|Zaire}}

[[File:Mobutu Nixon.gif|thumb|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and Richard Nixon in Washington, D.C., 1973.]]
The new president had the staunch support of the United States because of his [[Anti-communism|opposition]] to Communism; the US believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/08/13/rape-of-the-congo/ |title=Rape of the Congo |author=Adam Hochschild |date=13 August 2009 |magazine=New York Review of Books |access-date=1 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164520/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/08/13/rape-of-the-congo/ |archive-date=1 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> A [[single-party system]] was established, and Mobutu declared himself [[Head of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|head of state]]. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's government was guilty of severe [[human rights violations]], [[political repression]], a [[cult of personality]] and [[Corruption in Zaire|corruption]].

By late 1967 Mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals, either through co-opting them into his regime, arresting them, or rendering them otherwise politically impotent.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=58}} Throughout the late 1960s, Mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of the office to maintain control. Kasa-Vubu's death in April 1969 ensured that no person with First Republic credentials could challenge his rule.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|pp=61–62}} By the early 1970s, Mobutu was attempting to assert Zaire as a leading African nation. He traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about African issues, particularly those relating to the southern region. Zaire established semi-clientelist relationships with several smaller African states, especially Burundi, Chad, and Togo.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=64}}

Corruption became so common the term "''le mal Zairois''" or "Zairian Sickness",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html|title="Zaire: The Hoax of Independence", The Aida Parker Newsletter #203, 4 August 1997|publisher=cycad.com|access-date=4 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511093917/http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Aida/203/203_zaire.html|archive-date=11 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu himself.{{sfn|Young|Turner|2013|p=74}} International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a [[kleptocracy]] as Mobutu and his associates [[embezzlement|embezzled]] government funds.

[[File:Prince Bernhard and Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|Mobutu with the Dutch [[Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard]] in Kinshasa in 1973]]
In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: Léopoldville became [[Kinshasa]] (the country was now Congo-Kinshasa), Stanleyville became [[Kisangani]], Elisabethville became [[Lubumbashi]], and Coquilhatville became [[Mbandaka]]. This renaming campaign was completed in the 1970s.

In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the ''Republic of Zaire'',<ref name="kisanganibobb" /> its fourth name change in eleven years and its sixth overall. The [[Congo River]] was renamed the Zaire River.

During the 1970s and 1980s, he was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Johns, Michael (29 June 1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060721174238/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Africa/upload/91612_1.pdf "Zaire's Mobutu Visits America"], Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #239.<!-- date?? --></ref> Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a [[Cold War]] ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in 1997. "From 1990 to 1993, the United States facilitated Mobutu's attempts to hijack political change", one academic wrote, and "also assisted the rebellion of Laurent-Desire Kabila that overthrew the Mobutu regime."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/country_reports/drc_country_report.pdf|title=The 2006 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo |website=Icla.up.ac.za|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303225109/http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/country_reports/drc_country_report.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

By 1996, following the [[Rwandan Civil War]] and [[Rwandan Genocide|genocide]] and the ascension of a [[Tutsi]]-led government in Rwanda, Rwandan [[Hutu]] militia forces ([[Interahamwe]]) fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as a base for incursions against Rwanda.

A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu, and ultimately to control the mineral resources of Zaire,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} launching the [[First Congo War]]. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], becoming the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (AFDL). In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, named himself president, and reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries. He had concerns that the Rwandan officers running his army were plotting to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report directly to [[Rwanda]]<nowiki/>n president, [[Paul Kagame]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Rwandan troops retreated to Goma and launched a new [[Tutsi]]-led rebel military movement called the [[Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie]] (RCD) to fight Kabila, while Uganda instigated the creation of new rebel movement called the [[Movement for the Liberation of Congo]] (MLC), led by Congolese warlord [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The two rebel movements, along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops, started the [[Second Congo War]] by attacking the DRC army in 1998. Angolan, Zimbabwean, and Namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001. His son [[Joseph Kabila]] succeeded him and called for multilateral peace talks. UN peacekeepers, [[MONUC]], now known as MONUSCO, arrived in April 2001. In 2002 and 2003 Bemba intervened in the [[Central African Republic]] on behalf of its former president, [[Ange-Félix Patassé]].<ref>

</ref> Talks led to a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. A [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] was set up until after the election. A constitution was approved by voters, and on 30 July 2006 DRC held its [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|first multi-party elections]]. An election-result dispute between Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba turned into an all-out battle between their supporters in the streets of Kinshasa. MONUC took control of the city. A new election took place in October 2006, which Kabila won, and in December 2006 he was sworn in as President.

===Kivu conflict===
{{main|Kivu Conflict}}
[[Laurent Nkunda]], a member of [[RCD-Goma]], an RCD branch integrated to the army, defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the [[National Congress for the Defence of the People]] (CNDP), which began an armed rebellion against the government, starting the [[Kivu conflict]]. They were believed{{by whom|date=May 2015}} to be again backed by Rwanda as a way to tackle the [[Hutu]] group, [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR). In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-U_1NZdVdXyssb9DPt47IHx7j7Q |title=DR Congo government, CNDP rebels 'sign peace deal' |date=23 March 2012 |agency=Agence France-Presse |access-date=18 November 2012 |archive-date=30 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130053138/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j-U_1NZdVdXyssb9DPt47IHx7j7Q |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012 [[Bosco Ntaganda]], the leader of the CNDP, and troops loyal to him, mutinied and formed the rebel military [[March 23 Movement]], claiming the government violated the treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201204040870.html |title=Congo-Kinshasa: General Ntaganda and Loyalists Desert Armed Forces |first=Melanie |last=Gouby |date=4 April 2012 |publisher=allafrica.com |access-date=18 November 2012 |archive-date=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061859/http://allafrica.com/stories/201204040870.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Kabila's term in office and multiple anti-government protests===
In 2015, [[2015 Congolese protests|major protests]] broke out across the country and protesters demanded that Joseph Kabila step down as President. The protests began after the passage of a law by the Congolese lower house that, if also passed by the Congolese upper house, would keep Kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted (a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections, which he is constitutionally barred from participating in).

This bill passed; however, it was gutted of the provision that would keep Kabila in power until a census took place. A census is supposed to take place, but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place. In 2015, elections were scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace held in the Congo.<ref name="The DRC">{{cite web|last1=Global|first1=PGW |title=The Democratic Republic of the Congo: Hurdle After Hurdle |url=http://www.pgwglobal.com/democratic-republic-of-congo-hurdle-hurdle/|website=PGW Global Risk Management|publisher=PGW Global Risk Management LLP |access-date=5 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003225531/http://www.pgwglobal.com/democratic-republic-of-congo-hurdle-hurdle/|archive-date=3 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 27 November Congolese foreign minister [[Raymond Tshibanda]] told the press no elections would be held in 2016, after 20 December, the end of president Kabila's term. In a conference in Madagascar, Tshibanda said that Kabila's government had "consulted election experts" from Congo, the United Nations and elsewhere, and that "it has been decided that the voter registration operation will end on July 31, 2017, and that election will take place in April 2018."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/739195/no-elections-in-dr-congo-before-april-2018-minister.html|title=No elections in DR Congo before April 2018: minister|work=modernghana.com|date=27 November 2016|access-date=27 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128133421/https://www.modernghana.com/news/739195/no-elections-in-dr-congo-before-april-2018-minister.html|archive-date=28 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[December 2016 Congolese protests|Protests broke out in the country on 20 December]] when Kabila's term in office ended.

===Upsurge in violence===
{{See also|Ituri conflict}}
According to [[Jan Egeland]], presently Secretary-General of the [[Norwegian Refugee Council]], the situation in the DRC became much worse in 2016 and 2017 and is a major moral and humanitarian challenge comparable to the wars in Syria and Yemen, which receive much more attention. Women and children are abused sexually and "abused in all possible manners". Besides the conflict in [[North Kivu]], violence has gone up in the [[Kasai region]]. The armed groups are after [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[cobalt]] to line the pockets of rich men both in the region and internationally. There are also ethnic and cultural rivalries at play, as well as religious motives and the political crisis with postponed elections. He says people believe the situation in the DRC is "stably bad" but in fact, it has become much, much worse.

Nearly 900 Banunu people from four villages were slaughtered by members of the Batende community in a deep-rooted rivalry over monthly tribal duties, land, fields and water resources. Some 100 Banunus fled to Moniende island in the Congo River, and another 16,000 to [[Makotimpoko District]] in the [[Republic of Congo]].

{{Main|Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Geology of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is located in central [[sub-Saharan Africa]], bordered to the northwest by the [[Republic of the Congo]], to the north by the [[Central African Republic]], to the northeast by [[South Sudan]], to the east by [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], and by [[Tanzania]] (across [[Lake Tanganyika]]), to the south and southeast by [[Zambia]], to the southwest by [[Angola]], and to the west by the South [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda Province exclave of Angola]]. The country lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°N]] and [[14th parallel south|14°S]], and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°E]] and [[32nd meridian east|32°E]]. It straddles the [[Equator]], with one-third to the North and two-thirds to the South. The size of Congo, {{convert|2345408|km2|sqmi}}, is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway. It is the second-largest country in Africa by area, after [[Algeria]].

As a result of its equatorial location, the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of {{convert|2000|mm|in|round=5}} in some places, and the area sustains the [[Congo Rainforest]], the second-largest rain forest in the world after the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast, low-lying central [[drainage basin|basin]] of the river, which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by [[plateau]]s merging into [[savanna]]s in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and dense [[grassland]]s extending beyond the Congo River in the north. High, glaciated mountains ([[Rwenzori Mountains]]) are found in the extreme eastern region. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:Rainforest - Ituri (20874628148).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ituri Rainforest]]]]
The [[tropical climate]] also produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through, though they are not mutually exclusive. The name for the Congo state is derived in part from the river. The river basin (meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad tributaries) occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The river and its tributaries form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation. Major tributaries include the [[Kasai River|Kasai]], [[Sangha River|Sangha]], [[Ubangi River|Ubangi]], [[Ruzizi River|Ruzizi]], [[Aruwimi]], and [[Lulonga River|Lulonga]].

{{MapLibrary|dem_congo_sat.jpg|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

The sources of the Congo are in the [[Albertine Rift Mountains]] that flank the western branch of the [[East African Rift]], as well as [[Lake Tanganyika]] and [[Lake Mweru]]. The river flows generally west from [[Kisangani]] just below [[Boyoma Falls]], then gradually bends southwest, passing by [[Mbandaka]], joining with the [[Ubangi River]], and running into the [[Pool Malebo]] (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa and [[Brazzaville]] are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool. Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons, collectively known as the [[Livingstone Falls]], and runs past [[Boma, Congo|Boma]] into the Atlantic Ocean. The river also has the second-largest flow and the second-largest [[drainage basin|watershed]] of any river in the world (trailing the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] in both respects). The river and a {{convert|37|km|mi}} wide strip of coastline on its north bank provide the country's only outlet to the Atlantic. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The [[Albertine Rift]] plays a key role in shaping the Congo's geography. Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but due to the rift's [[tectonics|tectonic]] activity, this area also experiences [[volcanic]] activity, occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created the [[African Great Lakes]], three of which lie on the Congo's eastern frontier: [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] (known during the Mobutu era as Lake Mobutu Sese Seko), [[Lake Kivu]] (Unknown until late 1712), [[Lake Edward]] (known during the [[Idi Amin|Amin]] era as Lake Idi Amin Dada), and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. Lake Edward and Lake Albert are connected by the [[Semliki River]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The [[Rift valley]] has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining. [[Cobalt]], copper, [[cadmium]], industrial and gem-quality [[diamonds]], gold, silver, [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[tin]], [[germanium]], [[uranium]], [[radium]], [[bauxite]], iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo's southeastern Katanga region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pamojasolutions.org/home/about-katanga/|title=About Katanga {{!}} Pamoja Tujenge|website=pamojasolutions.org|language=en-US|access-date=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029174110/http://pamojasolutions.org/home/about-katanga/|archive-date=29 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 17 January 2002 [[Mount Nyiragongo]] erupted in Congo, with the lava running out at {{convert|64|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|46|m|yd|abbr=on}} wide. One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava flowed through the nearby city of [[Goma]], killing 45 and leaving 120,000 homeless. Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the eruption. The lava poisoned the water of [[Lake Kivu]], killing fish. Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol. The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway, trapping several airplanes. Six months after the 2002 eruption, nearby [[Nyamuragira|Mount Nyamuragira]] also erupted. Mount Nyamuragira then erupted in 2006 and again in January 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.volcanolive.com/nyamuragira.html|title=Nyamuragira Volcano, Democratic Republic of Congo {{!}} John Seach|website=Volcanolive.com|access-date=29 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114120624/http://www.volcanolive.com/nyamuragira.html|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[rainforest]]s of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great [[biodiversity]], including many rare and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, such as the [[common chimpanzee]] and the [[bonobo]], the [[African forest elephant]], the [[mountain gorilla]], the [[okapi]] and the [[white rhino]]. Five of the country's [[national park]]s are listed as [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Garamba National Park|Garumba]], [[Kahuzi-Biega National Park|Kahuzi-Biega]], [[Salonga National Park|Salonga]] and [[Virunga National Park]]s, and the [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve]].
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most biodiverse African country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/468283.html|title=Lambertini, A Naturalist's Guide to the Tropics, excerpt|access-date=30 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516181308/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/468283.html|archive-date=16 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

The civil war and resulting in poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity. Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work. All five sites are listed by [[UNESCO]] as World Heritage in Danger.

Conservationists have particularly worried about [[primates]]. The Congo is inhabited by several [[great ape]] species: the [[common chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes''), the [[bonobo]] (''Pan paniscus''), the [[eastern gorilla]] (''Gorilla beringei''), and possibly the [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/9404/102330408|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=23 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234244/https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/9404/102330408|archive-date=23 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild. Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the chimpanzee, the bonobo and the gorilla, each of whose populations once numbered in the millions, have now dwindled down to only about 200,000 gorillas, 100,000 chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000 bonobos.<ref name="gorillas">

==== Poaching ====
Poaching for the exotic animal or ivory trade has been a persistent problem for species loss in the DRC, it has been made a necessity for some trying to escape poverty and a means of continuing the civil war for some rebel groups including the [[Lord's Resistance Army|Lords Resistance army]] (LRA).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephant-poaching-on-rise-in-resistance-army-stronghold-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/|title=Elephant Poaching on Rise in Resistance Army Stronghold in Democratic Republic of Congo|work=Scientific American|access-date=18 October 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121203659/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elephant-poaching-on-rise-in-resistance-army-stronghold-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/|archive-date=21 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The forest elephant is particularly at risk due to the high cost of its ivory, especially in the Far East, due to this its population has reduced by 62% in 2002–2011<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Maisels|first1=Fiona|last2=Strindberg|first2=Samantha|last3=Blake|first3=Stephen|last4=Wittemyer|first4=George|last5=Hart|first5=John|last6=Williamson|first6=Elizabeth A.|last7=Aba’a|first7=Rostand|last8=Abitsi|first8=Gaspard|last9=Ambahe|first9=Ruffin D.|date=4 March 2013|title=Devastating Decline of Forest Elephants in Central Africa|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e59469|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0059469|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3587600|pmid=23469289|bibcode=2013PLoSO...859469M}}</ref> The main way this poaching for ivory can be reduced is through the hampering of the international demand for ivory, as this drives the trade.<ref name=":1" />

==Politics==
===Government===
{{Main|Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

[[File:Joseph kabila.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Kabila]] was President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from January 2001 to January 2019.]]
After a four-year interlude between two constitutions, with new political institutions established at the various levels of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country, a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable [[presidential system|presidential]] [[democratic republic]].
The 2003 transitional constitution<ref>[[s:fr:Constitution de la transition de la République démocratique du Congo (2003)|Full text of constitution (in French)]]</ref> had established a parliament with a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, consisting of a [[Senate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Senate]] and a [[National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|National Assembly]].

The [[Senate (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Senate]] had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://constitutionnet.org/vl/item/interim-constitution-democratic-republic-congo-2003-2006|title=Interim Constitution - Democratic Republic of the Congo (2003-2006)|website=ConstitutionNet|language=en|access-date=2 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202095718/http://constitutionnet.org/vl/item/interim-constitution-democratic-republic-congo-2003-2006|archive-date=2 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime Minister, appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly.

The government&nbsp;– not the President&nbsp;– is responsible to the Parliament. The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments, creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government, whom they elect. The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new institutions. The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the [[Constitutional Court of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Constitutional Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Congo (Democratic Republic of the) 2005 (rev. 2011)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_2011?lang=en#940|website=Constitute|access-date=23 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905084107/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo_2011?lang=en#940|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although located in the Central African [[United Nations geoscheme|UN subregion]], the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).<ref>{{cite web |title=Member States |website=Southern African Development Community: Towards a common future |url=http://www.sadc.int/member-states |access-date=25 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422060429/http://www.sadc.int/member-states |archive-date=22 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Corruption===

Mobutu Sese Seko ruled the DRC, which he renamed [[Zaire]], from 1965 to 1997. A relative explained how the government illicitly collected revenue: "Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million.

There are economic and strategic incentives to bring more security to the Congo, which is rich in natural resources such as [[cobalt]], a strategic and critical metal used in many industrial and military applications.<ref name=":8" /> The largest use of cobalt is in [[superalloy]]s, used to make [[jet engine]] parts. Cobalt is also used in [[magnetic alloy]]s and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented [[carbide]]s. The [[chemical industry]] consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including [[catalyst]]s for petroleum and chemical processing; drying agents for paints and inks; ground coats for porcelain enamels; decolorant for ceramics and glass; and pigments for ceramics, paints, and plastics.

The ''[[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo]]'' (FARDC) consist of about 144,000 personnel, the majority of whom are part of the [[Land Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|land forces]], also with a small [[Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|air force]] and an even smaller [[Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|navy]]. The FARDC was established in 2003 after the end of the Second Congo War and integrated many former rebel groups into its ranks. Due to the presence of undisciplined and poorly trained ex-rebels, as well as a lack of funding and having spent years fighting against different militias, the FARDC suffers from rampant corruption and inefficiency. The agreements signed at the end of the Second Congo War called for a new "national, restructured and integrated" army that would be made up of Kabila's government forces (the FAC), the RCD, and the MLC. Also stipulated was that rebels like the RCD-N, RCD-ML, and the [[Mai-Mai]] would become part of the new armed forces. It also provided for the creation of a ''Conseil Superieur de la Defense'' (Superior Defence Council) which would declare states of siege or war and give advice on security sector reform, disarmament/demobilisation, and national defence policy. The FARDC is organised on the basis of brigades, which are dispersed throughout the [[provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Congolese troops have been fighting the [[Kivu conflict]] in the eastern [[North Kivu]] region, the [[Ituri conflict]] in the [[Ituri Province|Ituri]] region, and other rebellions since the Second Congo War. Besides the FARDC, the largest peacekeeping mission of the [[United Nations]], known as [[MONUSCO]], is also present in the country with about 18,000 peacekeepers.

Despite such vast mineral wealth, the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. The African country generated up to 70% of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time. By 2005, 90% of the DRC's revenues derived from its minerals (Exenberger and Hartmann 2007:10).<ref name=ExenbergerHartmann2007>

</ref> The [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s began in 1996. These conflicts have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, increased external debt, and resulted in deaths of more than five million people from war and associated [[famine]] and disease. [[Malnutrition]] affects approximately two-thirds of the country's population.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. The war intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations.

Conditions improved in late 2002, when a large portion of the invading foreign troops withdrew. A number of [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] missions met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President [[Joseph Kabila]] began implementing reforms. Much economic activity still lies outside the GDP data. A [[United Nations Human Development Index]] report shows that the human development index of DRC is one of the worst the country has had in decades. Through 2011 the DRC had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries. It ranked lower than [[Niger]], despite a higher margin of improvement than the latter country over 2010's numbers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:First train in Kindu, DRC.jpg|thumb|Train from [[Lubumbashi]] arriving in [[Kindu]] on a newly refurbished line.]]
Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the [[Congo Basin]] present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. The DRC has more navigable rivers and moves more passengers and goods by boat and ferry than any other country in Africa, but air transport remains the only effective means of moving goods and people between many places within the country, especially in rural areas. Chronic economic mismanagement, political corruption and internal conflicts have led to long-term under-investment of infrastructure.

====Rail====
{{Main|Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:Train rdc.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|Map of rail network]]
Rail transportation is provided by the [[Congo Railroad Company]] (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo) and the [[Office National des Transports (Congo)]] (ONATRA) and the Office of the Uele Railways (Office des Chemins de fer des Ueles, CFU). Like much of the infrastructure in the Congo, the railways are poorly maintained, dirty, crowded and dangerous.

====Road====
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa&nbsp;— a total of {{convert|2250|km|mi|abbr=on}}, of which only {{convert|1226|km|mi|abbr=on}} is in good condition (see below). To put this in perspective, the road distance across the country in any direction is more than {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} (e.g. Matadi to Lubumbashi, {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} by road). The figure of {{convert|2250|km|mi|abbr=on}} converts to {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} of paved road per 1,000,000 of population. Comparative figures for Zambia and Botswana are {{convert|721|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3427|km|mi|abbr=on}} respectively.<ref>The figures are obtained by dividing the population figures in the Wikipedia country articles by the paved roads figure in the 'Transport in [country]' articles.</ref>

Three routes in the [[Trans-African Highway network]] pass through DR Congo:
* [[Tripoli-Cape Town Highway]]: this route crosses the western extremity of the country on National Road No. 1 between Kinshasa and [[Matadi]], a distance of {{convert|285|km|mi|abbr=on}} on one of the only paved sections in fair condition.
* [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]]: the DR Congo is the main missing link in this east-west highway and requires a new road to be constructed before it can function.
* [[Beira-Lobito Highway]]: this east-west highway crosses [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and requires re-construction over most of its length, being an earth track between the Angolan border and [[Kolwezi]], a paved road in very poor condition between Kolwezi and [[Lubumbashi]], and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the Zambian border.

====Water====
The Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of [[navigable]] [[waterway]]s. Traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around in approximately two-thirds of the country.

====Air====
{{as of|2016|June|}}, DR Congo had one major national airline ([[Congo Airways]]) that offered flights inside DR Congo. Congo Airways was based at [[N'djili Airport|Kinshasa's international airport]]. All air carriers certified by the DRC have been banned from European Union airports by the European Commission, due to inadequate safety standards.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124922/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/doc/list_en.pdf List of airlines banned within the EU], Official EC list, updated 20 April 2011.

===Migration===

[[File:Opening ceremony of new PNC headquarters in Goma (7134901927).jpg|thumb|Population fleeing their villages due to fighting between FARDC and rebels groups, Sake North Kivu 30 April 2012]]
Given the situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data. However, evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants, in spite of recent declines in their numbers. Immigration is very diverse in nature; refugees and asylum-seekers&nbsp;– products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes Region]]&nbsp;– constitute an important subset of the population. Additionally, the country's large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond. There is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied.<ref name="IOMProfile"/> Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role.

Immigration to the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of immigrants in the DRC has fallen from just over one million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Official figures are unavailable, partly due to the predominance of the [[informal economy]] in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring countries' ethnic links to DRC nationals, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon.<ref name="IOMProfile">

Figures for Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from three to six million. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of whom live in Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimated 2000 data. New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe. The DRC has produced a considerable number of [[refugees]] and [[asylum-seekers]] located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to [[UNHCR]], there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of whom were living in other African countries.<ref name="IOMProfile"/>

[[Islam]] has been present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the 18th century, when Arab traders from [[East Africa]] pushed into the interior for [[ivory]]- and slave-trading purposes.

The first members of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] to live in the country came from Uganda in 1953. Four years later the first local administrative council was elected. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly (national administrative council) was first elected. Though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 1980s, due to misrepresentations of foreign governments, the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s. In 2012 plans were announced to build a national [[Baháʼí House of Worship]] in the country.<ref>[http://bahaiwritings.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ridvan-message-2012.pdf Ridvan Message 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108235827/http://bahaiwritings.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ridvan-message-2012.pdf |date=8 November 2013 }}. p. 3.

Traditional religions embody such concepts as [[monotheism]], [[animism]], [[vitalism]], [[spirit worship|spirit]] and [[ancestor worship]], [[witchcraft]], and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups. The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity. New variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread, led by US-inspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations, particularly against children and the elderly.{{Clarify|reason=What is the new belief?

French is the [[official language]] of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is culturally accepted as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' facilitating communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo. According to a 2014 [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|OIF]] report, 33&nbsp;million Congolese people (47% of the population) could read and write in French.<ref>{{cite book

Approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country, but only four have the status of national languages: [[Kituba language|Kituba]] ("Kikongo ya leta"), [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Tshiluba language|Tshiluba]], and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. Although some people speak these regional, or trade languages as first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language after their own tribal language. Lingala was the official language of the colonial army, the "[[Force Publique]]", under Belgian colonial rule, and remains to this day the predominant language in the armed forces. Since the recent rebellions, a good part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent.

When the country was a Belgian colony, the Belgian colonizers instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. This trend was reversed after independence, when French became the sole language of education at all levels.<ref name=lang_educ>{{cite book |author=Organisation internationale de la Francophonie |title=La langue française dans le monde 2014 |url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/ |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Nathan |page=117 |date=2014 |isbn=978-2-09-882654-0 |access-date=16 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702202909/http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/ |archive-date=2 July 2015 |url-status=dead |author-link=Organisation internationale de la Francophonie }}</ref> Since 1975, the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education, with French becoming the sole language of education from the third year onward, but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use French from the first year of school onward.<ref name=lang_educ />
Portuguese is taught in the Congolese schools as a foreign language. The lexical similarity and phonology with French makes Portuguese a relatively easy language for the people to learn. Most of the roughly 175,000 Portuguese speakers in the DRC are Angolan and Mozambican expatriates.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

[[File:Hemba male figure1.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Hemba]] male statue]]
The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s and their differing ways of life throughout the country&nbsp;&nbsp;— from the mouth of the [[Congo River|River Congo]] on the coast, upriver through the [[rainforest]] and [[savanna]] in its centre, to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by [[colonialism]], the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era, and most recently, the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s. Despite these pressures, the [[convention (norm)|customs]] and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality. The country's 81&nbsp;million inhabitants (2016) are mainly rural. The 30% who live in urban areas have been the most open to [[Western culture|Western]] influences.

===Music===
Another feature in Congo culture is its music. The DRC has its influences on Cuban music [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]],originally kumba from Congo and [[merengue music|merengue]]. And those two later give birth to [[soukous]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEeTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA133 |author=Stone, Ruth M. |title=The Garland Handbook of African Music |page=133 |access-date=24 August 2014 |isbn=978-1-135-90001-4 |year=2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512113805/https://books.google.com/books?id=XEeTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA133 |archive-date=12 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other African nations produce music genres derived from Congolese soukous. Some of the African bands sing in [[Lingala]], one of the main languages in the DRC. The same Congolese soukous, under the guidance of "le sapeur", [[Papa Wemba]], have set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive designer clothes. They came to be known as the fourth generation of Congolese music and mostly come from the former well-known band {{ILL|Wenge Musica|fr}}.

===Sports===
{{Main| Sport in DR Congo}}
[[File:Stade des martyrs 0332 Kinshasa (8756673901).jpg|thumb|[[Stade des Martyrs]] in [[Kinshasa]].]]
Many sports are played in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including [[Football in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|football]], basketball, and [[Rugby union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|rugby]]. The sports are played in numerous stadiums throughout the country, including the [[Stade Frederic Kibassa Maliba]].<ref>[http://www.worldstadiums.com/africa/countries/dr_congo.shtml Stadiums in the Democratic Republic Congo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206213344/http://www.worldstadiums.com/africa/countries/dr_congo.shtml |date=6 February 2013 }}.

As Zaire they have participated in the World Cup Football (Final stage) in 1974.

Internationally, the country is especially famous for its professional basketball [[NBA]] and football players. [[Dikembe Mutombo]] is one of the best African basketball players to ever play the game. Mutombo is well known for humanitarian projects in his home country. [[Bismack Biyombo]], [[Christian Eyenga]], and [[Emmanuel Mudiay]] are others who gained significant international attention in basketball. Several Congolese players and players of Congolese descent—including strikers [[Romelu Lukaku]], [[Yannick Bolasie]], and [[Dieumerci Mbokani]]—have gained prominence in world football. DR Congo has twice won the African Cup of Nations football tournament.

=== Literature ===
[[List of Democratic Republic of the Congo writers|Congolese authors]] use literature as a way to develop a sense of [[national consciousness]] amongst the Congo people. The tragic history of colonialism and [[Congo Crisis|war]] lead the Congolese people to settle in a place of complacency, accepting the culture that was forced upon them by [[Belgian Congo|Belgium]].

Modern Congolese literature began to emerge in the late 1950s. There are a few rare pieces of literature dated back to before [[East African Campaign (World War I)|WWI]], but it was not until about 1954 that literature written in French made its appearance in the Congo. After gaining their independence from Belgium in the 1960s, new authors, such as Guy Menga and Jean Pierre Makouta-Mboukou, were inspired by older authors, such as [[Jean Malonga]] from Congo-Brazzaville, and used writing to bring attention to new issues affecting the Congo. The rise of female authors began in the 1970s introducing diversity to Congolese literature and support for gender empowerment. Many authors who have contributed to the success of Congolese literature are now living abroad due to economic and political issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/colonies_19e_eng.html|title=Women Perception of French Colonial Life in 19th Century Africa, 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817100658/http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/colonies_19e_eng.html|archive-date=17 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Frederick Kambemba Yamusangie]] writes literature for the between generations of those who grew up in the Congo, during the time when they were colonised, fighting for independence and after. Yamusangie in an interview<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2690IMv3UDU|title=Frederick Kambemba Yamusangie Interview}}</ref> said he felt the distance in literature and wanted to remedy that he wrote the novel, Full Circle, which is a story of a boy named Emanuel who in the beginning of the book feels a difference in culture among the different groups in the Congo and elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Full Circle|isbn = 978-0595282944|last1 = Yamusangie|first1 = Frederick|year=2003}}</ref>

[[Raïs Neza Boneza|Rais Neza Boneza]], an author from the [[Katanga Province|Katanga province]] of the Democratic Republic of Congo, wrote novels and poems to promote artistic expressions as a way to address and deal with conflicts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://raisnezaboneza.no/about-ras-n-boneza/|title=Rais Neza Boneza's Baraza|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205193404/http://raisnezaboneza.no/about-ras-n-boneza/|archive-date=5 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

These authors, along with others, used their platforms to bring awareness to the crises and conflicts that took place in the Congo.

===Environmental issues===
A dense [[tropical rainforest]] in the DRC's central [[drainage basin|river basin]] and eastern highlands is bordered on the east by the [[Albertine Rift]] (the western branch of Africa's [[Great Rift Valley|Great Rift System]]). It includes several of Africa's Great Lakes.

'''Major environmental issues'''

DR Congo's major environmental issues include:
* [[deforestation]]
* poaching, which threatens wildlife populations
* water pollution
* mining

Displaced refugees cause or are otherwise responsible for significant deforestation, soil erosion and wildlife poaching. Another significant issue is environmental damage from the mining of minerals, especially diamonds, gold, and [[coltan]] – a mineral used to manufacture [[capacitors]].

=== Species and Biodiversity loss ===

The environmental problems associated with The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) affect its many endemic species of flora and fauna. The DRC has the world's second largest contiguous rain forest after the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] as well as other ecosystems including Savanna, swamps and flood plains. According to the [[World Wildlife Fund]], these unique habitats and species make the DRC one of the most valuable yet vulnerable areas in the world for biodiversity, wildlife protection and rainforest sustainability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/congo-basin|title=Congo Rainforest and Basin {{!}} Places {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|language=en|access-date=2 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030045815/https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/congo-basin|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Species loss has been cited as a problem in the DRC, brought about or exacerbated by reasons that include deforestation for mining, wood fuel, infrastructure or agriculture, war, illegal poaching and increased consumption of bush meat due to overpopulation and lack of food security.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Butsic|first1=Van|last2=Baumann|first2=Matthias|last3=Shortland|first3=Anja|last4=Walker|first4=Sarah|last5=Kuemmerle|first5=Tobias|date=2015|title=Conservation and conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo: The impacts of warfare, mining, and protected areas on deforestation|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=191|pages=266–273|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.037|issn=0006-3207}}</ref> Some attempts to combat species loss in countries such as the DRC are actions such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), specifically [[Sustainable Development Goal 15|SDG 15]] Life on Land, the primary goals of which is to increase reforestation and biodiversity and reduce species loss, desertification, and illegal poaching.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/biodiversity/|title=Forests, desertification and biodiversity – United Nations Sustainable Development|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101045746/https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/biodiversity/|archive-date=1 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the primary defences for species and habitat protection in the DRC is its system of national parks and reserves, which gives protected status to nearly 12% of the DRC's rainforest.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last1=Butsic|first1=Van|last2=Baumann|first2=Matthias|last3=Shortland|first3=Anja|last4=Walker|first4=Sarah|last5=Kuemmerle|first5=Tobias|date=November 2015|title=Conservation and conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo: The impacts of warfare, mining, and protected areas on deforestation|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=191|pages=266–273|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.037|issn=0006-3207}}</ref> Five of these parks and reserves are [[UNESCO world heritage]] sites, including Africa’s first national park [[Virunga National Park|Virunga national park]].

==== Deforestation ====
{{Main|Deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:Changing land use in the Masisi - Julien Harneis - May 2 2007 - 4.jpg|thumb|Deforested lands in the DRC]]
Between 2000 and 2014 the DRC lost an average of 570,000 hectares (0.2%) of rainforest to deforestation per year, with the highest amount of deforestation coming between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Nancy L|last2=Goldman|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Gabris|first3=Christopher|last4=Nordling|first4=Jon|last5=Minnemeyer|first5=Susan|last6=Ansari|first6=Stephen|last7=Lippmann|first7=Michael|last8=Bennett|first8=Lauren|last9=Raad|first9=Mansour|date=1 February 2017|title=Using spatial statistics to identify emerging hot spots of forest loss|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=12|issue=2|pages=024012|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa5a2f|bibcode=2017ERL....12b4012H|issn=1748-9326|doi-access=free}}</ref> Deforestation is the primary cause of biodiversity reduction and species loss globally, through habitat loss and fragmentation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/problems/habitat_loss_degradation/|title=Impact of habitat loss on species|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116134037/http://wwf.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/problems/habitat_loss_degradation/|archive-date=16 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> One of the goals of the SDG 15 is to reduce deforestation and encourage reforestation by 2020.

The DRC has Africa’s largest rainforest, which is under the threat of deforestation through mining operations, agriculture, infrastructure and wood fuel. In the DRC 94% of wood taken from the rainforest is used for wood fuel, mainly due to poverty, lack of energy infrastructure and the decentralised nature of its population. To mitigate this aid agencies have tried to promote agro-forestry with fast growing trees to avoid over exploitation of the rainforests.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/congo/forests-and-logging/woodfuel |title=Woodfuel in the Congo forests |website=Global Forest Atlas |access-date=2 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026130911/http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/congo/forests-and-logging/woodfuel |archive-date=26 October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other large drivers of deforestation include mining and conflict, during the [[Second Congo War|Congo conflict]] deforestation by militia groups was high for wood fuel, small mining operations and illegal logging to fund their operations. However, conversely conflict reduced deforestation for large scale mining due to security instability.<ref name=":4"/>

One policy being attempted to reduce the deforestation and increase biodiversity in the DRC is the [[United Nations REDD Programme|UN-REDD]] program, which uses emissions trading system so that developed nations can offset their carbon emissions by paying developing nations with rainforest to manage and conserve their forest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-redd.org/|title=UN-REDD Programme|website=UN-REDD Programme|language=en|access-date=20 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119074856/http://www.un-redd.org/|archive-date=19 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Bush meat ====
Bush meat refers to any meat that is procured from the wild. Overpopulation and continual conflicts in the DRC have led to food shortages, which have therefore increased the use of bush meat. Although, data on bush meat use is not extensive, studies estimate 6&nbsp;million tonnes of animals are taken for bush meat globally each year.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Nasi|first1=R.|last2=Taber|first2=A.|last3=Van Vliet|first3=N.|s2cid=18157508|date=1 September 2011|title=Empty forests, empty stomachs?

There has been a war in the DRC in different levels of intensity since 1994 when the country was called [[Zaire]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-11108589|title=Q&A: DR Congo conflict|date=20 November 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=18 October 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007052354/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-11108589|archive-date=7 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Although what was known as [[Second Congo War|Africa's World War]] had ended in 2003 the eastern part of the country still has ongoing skirmishes between rebel groups and government forces.<ref name=":2" /> No other method has reduced species population so dramatically than conflict, when a militia reached the [[Garamba National Park]] in 1997, within three months half of the park's elephants, two thirds of the buffalo, and three quarters of its hippos vanished.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/science/africa-war-animals-conservation.html|title=War's Other Victims: Animals|last=Nuwer|first=R|work=New York Times|access-date=18 October 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017143837/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/science/africa-war-animals-conservation.html|archive-date=17 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The reason conflict is so damaging to wildlife is the increased use of bush meat to feed soldiers, the prevalence of weapons, the lucrative industry of selling exotic animals and ivory as well as the general failure of law and order.<ref name=":3" /> According to another study which was taken during the time of the civil war in the [[Okapi Wildlife Reserve|Okapi Faunal Reserve]], there was a 50% reduction in the abundance of elephants and a vast change in the distribution of them to the more secluded areas of the park.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Beyers|first1=Rene L.|last2=Hart|first2=John A.|last3=Sinclair|first3=Anthony R.
