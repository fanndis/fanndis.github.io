==Plot==
From his secret lair located behind the [[Hollywood Sign]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[Dr. Evil]] unveils to his top [[lieutenant]] Number 2, his clone [[Mini-Me]], lover Frau Farbissina, and their son Scott Evil that his plan for world domination is to [[time travel|travel back in time]] to 1975 and partner with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[gold]] obsessed [[Johan van der Smut]], who after losing his [[genitalia]] in a [[smelting]] accident, is known by the [[Pseudonym|alias]] "Goldmember".  Goldmember developed a [[cold fusion]] power unit for a [[tractor beam]] which Dr. Evil names "[[Preparation H]]" and he intends to use it to pull a [[meteor]] into the earth, striking the [[polar ice caps]] and causing a global flood.  Moments after this plan is revealed, [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] and the British Intelligence invade the lair and arrest Dr. Evil and Mini-Me.  In [[England]], the Queen [[Accolade|knights]] Austin for his service, but is disappointed when his father, the famous super-spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event.  During an after party, [[Basil Exposition]] informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped and the only clue is that the crew of his [[yacht]] have had their genitalia painted gold.

Austin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil who antagonizes Austin by reminding him that his father was also absent when Austin was given the title of "International Man of Mystery" during their British Intelligence academy graduation; an event that angered Dr. Evil due to him being the top of the class.  He tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction so Austin time travels to 1975 and infiltrates Goldmember's [[roller disco]] club.  He is reunited with his former lover, [[FBI]] agent Foxxy Cleopatra who is undercover.  With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father but is unable to rescue him and Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day.  Foxxy desires revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit.  In the present, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a [[prison riot|riot]] in their prison, allowing them to escape.  A British Intelligence [[mole (espionage)|mole]] named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].  Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]], who is now a [[sumo wrestling|Sumo wrestler]].  Fat Bastard explains that a Japanese business man, Mr. Roboto, is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember.

Austin and Foxxy later meet with Mr. Roboto, who pleads ignorance about Nigel's whereabouts.  Unconvinced, Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember's car, and Roboto hands Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam.  Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel, but Goldmember escapes with the command unit and flees to Dr. Evil's [[submarine]]. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's son, Scott Evil, has become increasingly evil and in an attempt to prove himself to his father he presents him with [[sharks]] with [[laser beams]] attached to their heads, a request that had gone unfulfilled in [[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery|the first film]].  Roboto is then killed when Scott causes him to fall into the shark pool and he is subsequently eaten.  Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son and the rejected Mini-Me defects and joins Austin and Foxxy in their mission.

Austin and Foxxy, now joined by Mini-Me, infiltrate the submarine but Austin is captured.  Dr. Evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but Foxxy steals the key and frees Austin.  Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are both his sons.  Confused, Dr. Evil explains that his parents died in a car accident and he was raised by evil [[Belgians]], but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought that only Austin survived.  Dr. Evil, Austin, Nigel, and Mini-Me embrace, enraging Scott, who flees to pursue his own vengeance whilst Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his pants to reveal his gold-covered genitals to be a spare key.  Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world.  The heroes arrest Goldmember, who turns to the camera to reveal the entire string of events was [[story within a story|adapted into a film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Austin, [[Kevin Spacey]] as Dr. Evil, [[Danny DeVito]] as Mini-Me, and [[John Travolta]] as Goldmember. Austin, Foxxy, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Nigel are in the audience of a Hollywood theater watching the film.  Upon exiting the theater they run into Fat Bastard, now thin but with sagging hanging flesh, thanks to the [[Subway diet]].  As Austin and Foxxy kiss, in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, Scott – now completely bald, dressed like and laughing in a manner similar to his father – declares he will get his revenge on Austin before dancing to [[Michael Jackson]].  During the end credits, [[Britney Spears]] hangs out with Mini-Me asking him if she can give him her cell phone number.

===Title concerns===
The title of the film, ''Goldmember'', led to legal action being taken by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the distributors of the [[James Bond (franchise)|''James Bond'' film franchise]], that briefly led to the film's title being removed from promotional material and trailers. The dispute was quickly resolved and the film title remained unchanged on the provision that the film would include trailers in its cinema releases for the then-upcoming James Bond film, ''[[Die Another Day]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-04-10-bond-powers.htm|title=Spy vs. spy ends amicably|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-04-07 | date=2002-04-10}}</ref>

===Characters===
[[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] (Myers), having conquered the 1990s and the 1960s, travels back to the 1970s and teams up with his nemesis [[Dr. Evil]] (also played by Myers) to thwart a new villain, Goldmember (Myers once again). Myers also plays [[Fat Bastard (Austin Powers Character)|Fat Bastard]] for the second time, this time [[parody]]ing the kind of [[Wire fu|"wire fight"]] seen in ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''. The film also stars Beyoncé Knowles as [[Foxxy Cleopatra]] (parodying [[blaxploitation]] heroines, primarily [[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]] and [[Cleopatra Jones]], as well as [[Get Christie Love!|Christie Love]] when she says, "You're under arrest, sugah!"), [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]], reprising the role of Basil Exposition, and [[Verne Troyer]] in his second appearance as [[Mini-Me]]. The film also introduced a new character named Number 3 (a.k.a. the Mole), who is portrayed by former [[child actor|child star]] [[Fred Savage]]. [[Clint Howard]] plays a radar operator in all three films. [[Michael Caine]] guest stars as Austin's father, Nigel; this role was inspired by the character of [[Harry Palmer]] from ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'', a 1965 film starring Caine.<ref name="ipc">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/01/05/the_ipcress_file_2006_review.shtml | title=The Ipcress File (1965) | publisher=BBC | date=January 6, 2006 | accessdate=June 17, 2013 | author=Leyland, Matthew}}</ref>

Four actors who appeared in the earlier films play different characters in ''Goldmember''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} [[Rob Lowe]], who played the friend of a dead guard in ''International Man of Mystery'', reprises his role as a younger Number 2 from ''The Spy Who Shagged Me'', while [[Neil Mullarkey]] (quartermaster clerk in ''International Man of Mystery'') and Eric Winzenried (army private soldier in ''The Spy Who Shagged Me'') appear as the Physician and Henchman Sailor in the Sick Bay. [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] (the Virtucon guard who got run over by a steamroller in ''International Man of Mystery'' and a NATO soldier in ''The Spy Who Shagged Me'') appears as the royal guard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Goldmember====
'''[[Johan van der Smut]]''', better known as '''Goldmember''', is a fictional villain played by Myers ([[John Travolta]] plays the character in a cameo at the end of the film). The name was inspired by the [[James Bond]] villain [[Auric Goldfinger]]. Goldmember's Dutch origins and character traits were, according to Myers, inspired by an episode of the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Real Sex]]'' featuring a Dutchman who operated a "sex barn" north of [[Rotterdam]]. The man's distinct forms of expression caught Myers' attention while he was writing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2002-07-25-goldmember_x.htm |work=USA Today|title=Movie news|date=2002-07-25 | first1=Andy | last1=Seiler | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>

==Possible sequel==
In October 2005, in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Mike Myers discussed the possibility of studio sources moving forward with a fourth film. "There is hope!". "We're all circling and talking to each other. I miss doing the characters."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1114708,00.html |title=Mike Myers may return to ''Austin Powers'' |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref> In May 2007, in an interview with [[IGN]], "So no more ''Austin Powers''?" was asked, and Myers replied, "No, no, there is a fully conceived idea for a fourth and I can just say that it's from Dr. Evil's point of view. So if you balanced how much of it was Austin with Dr. Evil, it's more about Dr. Evil than Austin".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/788/788829p2.html |title=IGN: Interview: Mike Myers and Antonio Banderas |website=IGN|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref> Also, in the audio commentary from the DVD release of ''Goldmember'', Myers revealed that in the fourth film, [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]] would return and regain the weight that he lost in ''Goldmember''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/news/austin-powers-needs-kill-fat-bastard-wbna44147655|title='Austin Powers' needs to kill off Fat Bastard}}</ref>
