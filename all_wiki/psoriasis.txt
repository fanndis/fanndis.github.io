<!-- Types -->
The five main types of psoriasis are plaque, [[Guttate psoriasis|guttate]], [[Inverse psoriasis|inverse]], [[Pustular psoriasis|pustular]], and [[Psoriatic erythroderma|erythrodermic]].<ref name=NIH2015/> Plaque psoriasis, also known as psoriasis vulgaris, makes up about 90% of cases.<ref name=Lancet2015/> It typically presents as red patches with white scales on top.<ref name=Lancet2015/> Areas of the body most commonly affected are the back of the forearms, shins, navel area, and scalp.<ref name=Lancet2015/> Guttate psoriasis has drop-shaped lesions.<ref name=NIH2015/> Pustular psoriasis presents as small, noninfectious, [[pus]]-filled blisters.<ref name=Jain2012/> Inverse psoriasis forms red patches in skin folds.<ref name=NIH2015/> Erythrodermic psoriasis occurs when the rash becomes very widespread, and can develop from any of the other types.<ref name=Lancet2015/> [[Nail (anatomy)|Fingernails]] and toenails are affected in most people with psoriasis at some point in time.<ref name=Lancet2015/> This may include pits in the nails or changes in nail color.<ref name=Lancet2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehncke WH, Schön MP | title = Psoriasis | journal = Lancet | volume = 386 | issue = 9997 | pages = 983–94 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26025581 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61909-7 | s2cid = 208793879 }}</ref>

<!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis -->
Psoriasis is generally thought to be a [[genetic disease]] that is triggered by environmental factors.<ref name=Menter2008 /> If one twin has psoriasis, the other twin is three times more likely to be affected if the twins are [[identical twins|identical]] than if they are [[fraternal twins|nonidentical]].<ref name=Lancet2015/> This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis.<ref name=Lancet2015/> Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as [[beta blockers]] or [[NSAIDs]].<ref name=Lancet2015/> Infections and [[psychological stress]] can also play a role.<ref name=Menter2008/><ref name=NIH2015/>  The underlying mechanism involves the [[immune system]] reacting to [[Keratinocyte|skin cell]]s.<ref name=Lancet2015/> Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.<ref name=Lancet2015/>

<!-- Treatment and epidemiology -->
No cure for psoriasis is known, but various treatments can help control the symptoms.<ref name=Lancet2015/> These treatments include [[corticosteroid|steroid creams]], [[vitamin D3|vitamin D<sub>3</sub>]] cream, [[ultraviolet light]], and [[immunosuppressive drug]]s, such as [[methotrexate]].<ref name=NIH2015/> About 75% of skin involvement improves with creams alone.<ref name=Lancet2015/> The disease affects 2-4% of  the population.<ref name=Parisi2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parisi R, Symmons DP, Griffiths CE, Ashcroft DM | title = Global epidemiology of psoriasis: a systematic review of incidence and prevalence | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 377–85 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23014338 | doi = 10.1038/jid.2012.339 | others = Identification and Management of Psoriasis and Associated ComorbidiTy (IMPACT) project team | doi-access = free }}</ref> Men and women are affected with equal frequency.<ref name=NIH2015/> The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood.<ref name=NIH2015>{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers About Psoriasis|url=https://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/psoriasis/|website=National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases|access-date=22 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422134800/https://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/psoriasis/|archive-date=22 April 2017|date=2017-04-12}}</ref> Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[lymphoma]]s, [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Crohn disease]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name=Lancet2015/> Psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of individuals with psoriasis.<ref name=Jain2012>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Sima|title=Dermatology : illustrated study guide and comprehensive board review|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-0524-6|pages=83–87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4Xzi0LKROcC&q=dermatology&pg=PA86|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908183432/https://books.google.com/books?id=r4Xzi0LKROcC&lpg=PP1&dq=dermatology&pg=PA86|archive-date=2017-09-08| name-list-style=vanc }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

===Plaque psoriasis===
[[File:Psoriasis2010.JPG|thumbnail|Psoriatic plaque, showing a silvery center surrounded by a reddened border]]
Psoriasis vulgaris (also known as chronic stationary psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) is the most common form and affects 85–90% of people with psoriasis.<ref name="Palfreeman2013"/> Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of [[Inflammation|inflamed]] skin covered with silvery-white, scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back.<ref name="Palfreeman2013"/><ref name=DAVIDSONS2010>{{cite book|editor1=Colledge, N.R. |editor2=Walker, B.R. |editor3=Ralston, S.H. |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine.|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-3084-0|edition=21st | pages=1260–1 }}</ref>

=== Other forms ===
Additional types of psoriasis comprise about 10% of cases. They include pustular, inverse, napkin, guttate, oral, and seborrheic-like forms.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author1=James, William |author2=Berger, Timothy |author3=Elston, Dirk |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7216-2921-6 |edition=10th|pages=191–7 }}</ref>

====Pustular psoriasis====
[[File:Psoriasis manum.jpg|thumbnail|Severe Generalized pustular psoriasis]]
[[Pustular psoriasis]] appears as raised bumps filled with noninfectious pus ([[pustules]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson A, Van Voorhees AS, Hsu S, Korman NJ, Lebwohl MG, Bebo BF, Kalb RE | title = Treatment of pustular psoriasis: from the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 279–88 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22609220 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2011.01.032 }}</ref> The skin under and surrounding the pustules is red and tender.<ref name="Raychaudhuri2014" /> Pustular psoriasis can either be localized or more widespread throughout the body. Two types of localized pustular psoriasis include psoriasis pustulosa palmoplantaris and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau; both forms are localized to the hands and feet.<ref name="Rendon2019" />

==== Inverse psoriasis ====
[[Inverse psoriasis]] (also known as flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect [[skin fold]]s, particularly around the [[genitals]] (between the thigh and groin), the [[armpit]]s, in the skin folds of an overweight abdomen (known as [[panniculus]]), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the [[breasts]] in the [[inframammary fold]]. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought to play a role in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.<ref name="Weigle2013" />

==== Napkin psoriasis ====
[[Napkin psoriasis]] is a subtype of psoriasis common in infants characterized by red papules with silver scale in the diaper area that may extend to the torso or limbs.<ref name="Gudjonsson2012" /> Napkin psoriasis is often misdiagnosed as [[irritant diaper dermatitis|napkin dermatitis]] (diaper rash).<ref name="Gelmetti2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelmetti C | title = Therapeutic moisturizers as adjuvant therapy for psoriasis patients | journal = American Journal of Clinical Dermatology | volume = 10 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 7–12 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19209948 | doi = 10.2165/0128071-200910001-00002 | s2cid = 9513914 }}</ref>

==== Guttate psoriasis ====
[[File:Psoriasis en gouttes enfant 2.jpg|thumbnail|Example of [[guttate psoriasis]]]]
[[Guttate psoriasis]] is characterized by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules). These numerous spots of psoriasis appear over large areas of the body, primarily the trunk, but also the limbs and scalp. Guttate psoriasis is often triggered by a [[Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus|streptococcal]] infection, typically [[streptococcal pharyngitis]].<ref name="Weigle2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigle N, McBane S | title = Psoriasis | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 87 | issue = 9 | pages = 626–33 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23668525 | url = https://www.aafp.org/afp/2013/0501/p626.html }}</ref>
 
==== Erythrodermic psoriasis ====
[[Psoriatic erythroderma]] (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface, often involving greater than 90% of the body surface area.<ref name="Rendon2019">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rendon A, Schäkel K | title = Psoriasis Pathogenesis and Treatment | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 1475 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30909615 | doi = 10.3390/ijms20061475 | pmc = 6471628 }}</ref> It may be accompanied by severe dryness, itching, swelling, and pain. It can develop from any type of psoriasis.<ref name="Rendon2019" /> It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic [[glucocorticoid]]s.<ref name="Zattra2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zattra E, Belloni Fortina A, Peserico A, Alaibac M | title = Erythroderma in the era of biological therapies | journal = European Journal of Dermatology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–71 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22321651 | doi = 10.1684/ejd.2011.1569 }}</ref> This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to [[Thermoregulation|regulate temperature]] and perform barrier functions.<ref name="DermNZ">{{cite web | last=Stanway | first=Amy | title=Erythrodermic psoriasis | url=http://dermnetnz.org/scaly/erythrodermic-psoriasis.html | publisher=DermNet NZ | access-date=16 March 2014 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202222207/http://dermnetnz.org/scaly/erythrodermic-psoriasis.html | archive-date=2 February 2014 | name-list-style=vanc }}</ref>

==== Mouth ====
Psoriasis in the mouth is very rare,<ref name="Yesudian2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yesudian PD, Chalmers RJ, Warren RB, Griffiths CE | title = In search of oral psoriasis | journal = Archives of Dermatological Research | volume = 304 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21927905 | doi = 10.1007/s00403-011-1175-3 | s2cid = 33434341 }}</ref> in contrast to [[lichen planus]], another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth. When psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic,<ref name="Yesudian2012"/> but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques.<ref name="Yesudian2012"/> [[Fissured tongue]] is the most common finding in those with oral psoriasis and has been reported to occur in 6.5–20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by [[geographic tongue]] (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last3 = Ship | editor-first1 = Martin S. | editor-last1 = Greenberg | editor-first2 = Michael | editor-last2 = Glick | editor-first3 = Jonathan A. | name-list-style = vanc | title = Burket's oral medicine | year = 2008 | publisher = BC Decker | location = Hamilton, Ont | isbn = 978-1-55009-345-2 | pages = 103–4 | edition = 11th }}</ref> However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reamy BV, Derby R, Bunt CW | title = Common tongue conditions in primary care | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 627–34 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20187599 }}</ref>

==== Seborrheic-like psoriasis ====
[[Seborrheic-like psoriasis]] is a common form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and [[seborrheic dermatitis]], and it may be difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher [[sebum]] production such as the [[scalp]], [[forehead]], [[nasolabial fold|skin folds next to the nose]], skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the [[sternum]], and in [[intertriginous|skin folds]].<ref name="Gudjonsson2012"/>

===Psoriatic arthritis===
[[Psoriatic arthritis]] is a form of chronic inflammatory [[arthritis]] that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail psoriasis.<ref name="Chimenti2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chimenti MS, Saraceno R, Chiricozzi A, Giunta A, Chimenti S, Perricone R | title = Profile of certolizumab and its potential in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis | journal = Drug Design, Development and Therapy | volume = 7 | pages = 339–48 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23620660 | pmc = 3633576 | doi = 10.2147/DDDT.S31658 }}</ref><ref name="Goldenstein2012"/> It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and [[Synovitis|surrounding connective tissue]], and can occur in any joint, but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes.  This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as [[dactylitis]].<ref name="Chimenti2013"/> Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees, spine ([[spondylitis]]), and [[sacroiliac joint]] ([[sacroiliitis]]).<ref name="Krawczyk2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Krawczyk-Wasielewska A, Skorupska E, Samborski W | title = Sacroiliac joint pain as an important element of psoriatic arthritis diagnosis | journal = Postepy Dermatologii I Alergologii | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–12 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 24278057 | pmc = 3834688 | doi = 10.5114/pdia.2013.34161 }}</ref> About 30% of individuals with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis.<ref name="Palfreeman2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Palfreeman AC, McNamee KE, McCann FE | title = New developments in the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: a focus on apremilast | journal = Drug Design, Development and Therapy | volume = 7 | pages = 201–10 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23569359 | pmc = 3615921 | doi = 10.2147/DDDT.S32713 }}</ref> Skin manifestations of psoriasis tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75% of cases.<ref name="Goldenstein2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldenstein-Schainberg C, Favarato MH, Ranza R | title = Current and relevant concepts in psoriatic arthritis | journal = Revista Brasileira de Reumatologia | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–106 | date = January–February 2012 | pmid = 22286649 | doi = 10.1590/s0482-50042012000100010 | url = http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbr/v52n1/en_v52n1a10.pdf | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140824/http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbr/v52n1/en_v52n1a10.pdf | archive-date = 2014-04-13 }}</ref>

===Nail changes===
[[File:Luszczyca paznokcia.jpg|thumbnail|Psoriasis of a fingernail, with visible pitting]]
[[File:NailPsoriasis.JPG|thumb|A photograph showing the effects of psoriasis on the toenails]]
[[Psoriatic nails|Psoriasis can affect the nails]] and produces a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin, and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis.<ref name="Tan2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan ES, Chong WS, Tey HL | title = Nail psoriasis: a review | journal = American Journal of Clinical Dermatology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 375–88 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22784035 | doi = 10.2165/11597000-000000000-00000 | s2cid = 8561015 }}</ref> These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), [[leukonychia|whitening of the nail]], [[splinter hemorrhage|small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail]], yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, dryness, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail ([[onycholysis]]), and crumbling of the nail.<ref name="Tan2012"/>

===Medical signs===
In addition to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific [[medical sign]]s may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include [[Auspitz's sign]] (pinpoint bleeding when scale is removed), [[Koebner phenomenon]] (psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma to the skin),<ref name="Gudjonsson2012">{{cite book|vauthors=Gudjonsson JE, Elder JT, Goldsmith LA, Katz SI, Gilchrest BA, Paller AS, Leffell DJ, Wolff K | display-authors=3 |title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-166904-7|edition=8th|chapter=18: Psoriasis }}</ref> and [[Pruritus|itching]] and pain localized to papules and plaques.<ref name="Weigle2013"/><ref name="Gudjonsson2012"/>

==Causes==
The cause of psoriasis is not fully understood, but a number of theories exist.

===Genetics===
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
Around one-third of people with psoriasis report a [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of the disease, and researchers have identified genetic [[locus (genetics)|loci]] associated with the condition. [[twin|Identical twin]] studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.<ref name=Krueger>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krueger G, Ellis CN | title = Psoriasis--recent advances in understanding its pathogenesis and treatment | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 Suppl 1 | pages = S94-100 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15968269 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.04.035 }}</ref>

Psoriasis has a strong hereditary component, and many genes are associated with it, but how those genes work together is unclear. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) and [[T cells]]. Genetic studies are valuable due to their ability to identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential medication targets.<ref name=Nestle>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestle FO, Kaplan DH, Barker J | title = Psoriasis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 5 | pages = 496–509 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19641206 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra0804595 }}</ref>

Classic genome-wide [[linkage analysis]] has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (''[[PSORS1]]'' through ''PSORS9''). Within those loci are genes on pathways that lead to inflammation. Certain variations ([[mutation]]s) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis.<ref name=Nestle/> [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association scans]] have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.<ref name=Nestle/>

The major determinant is ''PSORS1'', which probably accounts for 35–50% of psoriasis heritability.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith CH, Barker JN | title = Psoriasis and its management | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7564 | pages = 380–4 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16916825 | pmc = 1550454 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.333.7564.380 }}</ref> It controls genes that affect the immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. ''PSORS1'' is located on [[chromosome 6]] in the MHC, which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the ''PSORS1'' locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: ''HLA-C'' variant ''HLA-Cw6'',<ref name="Prieto2013"/> which encodes an MHC class I protein; ''[[CCHCR1]]'', variant WWC, which encodes a [[coiled coil]] protein  overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and ''[[CDSN]]'', variant allele 5, which encodes [[corneodesmosin]], a protein expressed in the granular and [[cornified layer]]s of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.<ref name=Nestle/>

Two major immune system genes under investigation are interleukin-12 subunit beta (''IL12B'') on [[Chromosome 5 (human)|chromosome 5q]], which expresses interleukin-12B; and ''[[IL23R]]'' on chromosome 1p, which expresses the interleukin-23 receptor, and is involved in T cell differentiation. Interleukin-23 receptor and ''IL12B'' have both been strongly linked with psoriasis.<ref name="Prieto2013"/> T cells are involved in the inflammatory process that leads to psoriasis.<ref name=Nestle/>  These genes are on the pathway that upregulate tumor necrosis factor-α and [[NF-κB|nuclear factor κB]], two genes involved in inflammation.<ref name=Nestle/> The first gene directly linked to psoriasis was identified as the ''[[CARD14]] ''gene located in the ''PSORS2'' locus. A rare mutation in the gene encoding for the ''[[CARD14]]''-regulated protein plus an environmental trigger was enough to cause plaque psoriasis (the most common form of psoriasis).<ref name = Jordan1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan CT, Cao L, Roberson ED, Duan S, Helms CA, Nair RP, Duffin KC, Stuart PE, Goldgar D, Hayashi G, Olfson EH, Feng BJ, Pullinger CR, Kane JP, Wise CA, Goldbach-Mansky R, Lowes MA, Peddle L, Chandran V, Liao W, Rahman P, Krueger GG, Gladman D, Elder JT, Menter A, Bowcock AM | display-authors = 6 | title = Rare and common variants in CARD14, encoding an epidermal regulator of NF-kappaB, in psoriasis | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages = 796–808 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22521419 | pmc = 3376540 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.03.013 }}</ref><ref name = Jordan2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan CT, Cao L, Roberson ED, Pierson KC, Yang CF, Joyce CE, Ryan C, Duan S, Helms CA, Liu Y, Chen Y, McBride AA, Hwu WL, Wu JY, Chen YT, Menter A, Goldbach-Mansky R, Lowes MA, Bowcock AM | display-authors = 6 | title = PSORS2 is due to mutations in CARD14 | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–95 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22521418 | pmc = 3376640 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.03.012 }}</ref>

A [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, [[erythema]]tous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch.<ref name="Weigle2013"/> No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are usually required to make the diagnosis.<ref name="Raychaudhuri2014"/><ref name="Johnson 166–72">{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson MA, Armstrong AW | title = Clinical and histologic diagnostic guidelines for psoriasis: a critical review | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–72 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22278173 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-012-8305-3 | s2cid = 42148834 }}</ref>

The [[differential diagnosis]] of psoriasis includes dermatological conditions similar in appearance such as [[discoid eczema]], [[seborrheic eczema]], [[pityriasis rosea]] (may be confused with guttate psoriasis), [[tinea unguium|nail fungus]] (may be confused with nail psoriasis) or [[cutaneous T cell lymphoma]] (50% of individuals with this cancer are initially [[misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] with psoriasis).<ref name=Weller2008 /> Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of [[secondary syphilis]] may also be confused with psoriasis.<ref name=Weller2008/>

If the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, a skin [[biopsy]] or scraping may be performed to rule out other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy shows clubbed [[rete pegs|epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis]] on microscopy.

Another classification scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 has a positive family history, starts before the age of 40, and is associated with the [[human leukocyte antigen]], [[HLA-C|''HLA-Cw6'']].

====Severity====
[[Image:Distribution of psoriasis severity.svg|thumb|Distribution of severity]]
No consensus exists about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis has been defined as a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a [[psoriasis area severity index]] (PASI) score ≤10, and a [[Dermatology Life Quality Index]]  (DLQI)  score ≤10.<ref name="Mrowietz2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mrowietz U, Kragballe K, Reich K, Spuls P, Griffiths CE, Nast A, Franke J, Antoniou C, Arenberger P, Balieva F, Bylaite M, Correia O, Daudén E, Gisondi P, Iversen L, Kemény L, Lahfa M, Nijsten T, Rantanen T, Reich A, Rosenbach T, Segaert S, Smith C, Talme T, Volc-Platzer B, Yawalkar N | display-authors = 6 | title = Definition of treatment goals for moderate to severe psoriasis: a European consensus | journal = Archives of Dermatological Research | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20857129 | pmc = 3016217 | doi = 10.1007/s00403-010-1080-1 }}</ref> Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10.<ref name="Mrowietz2011"/>

The DLQI is a 10-question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.<ref name="Mease2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mease PJ | title = Measures of psoriatic arthritis: Tender and Swollen Joint Assessment, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI), Mander/Newcastle Enthesitis Index (MEI), Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI), Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC), Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesis Score (MASES), Leeds Dactylitis Index (LDI), Patient Global for Psoriatic Arthritis, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Psoriatic Arthritis Quality of Life (PsAQOL), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC), Psoriatic Arthritis Joint Activity Index (PsAJAI), Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA), and Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (CPDAI) | journal = Arthritis Care & Research | volume = 63 Suppl 11 | issue = Supplement 11 | pages = S64-85 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22588772 | doi = 10.1002/acr.20577 }}</ref>

===Topical agents===
Topical corticosteroid preparations are the most effective agents when used continuously for 8 weeks; [[retinoid]]s and [[coal tar]] were found to be of limited benefit and may be no better than [[placebo]].<ref name="Samarasekera2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Samarasekera EJ, Sawyer L, Wonderling D, Tucker R, Smith CH | title = Topical therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: systematic review and network meta-analyses | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 168 | issue = 5 | pages = 954–67 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23413913 | doi = 10.1111/bjd.12276 | s2cid = 21979785 }}</ref> Greater benefit has been observed with very potent corticosteroids when compared to potent corticosteroids.

[[Vitamin D analogue]]s such as [[paricalcitol]] were found to be superior to placebo.

Moisturizers and emollients such as [[mineral oil]], [[Vaseline|petroleum jelly]], [[calcipotriol]], and [[decubal]] (an oil-in-water emollient) were found to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques.

Another topical therapy used to treat psoriasis is a form of [[balneotherapy]], which involves daily baths in the [[Dead Sea]].

===UV phototherapy===
[[Phototherapy]] in the form of [[sunlight]] has long been used for psoriasis.<ref name=Lancet07/> UVB wavelengths of 311–313&nbsp;[[nanometer]]s are most effective, and special lamps have been developed for this application.<ref name=Lancet07/> The exposure time should be controlled to avoid overexposure and burning of the skin.

<!-- Tanning bed benefits and limited effectiveness with UVA -->
One of the problems with clinical phototherapy is the difficulty many people have gaining access to a facility. Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for people to get UV exposure when dermatologist-provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to [[erythema|erythemogenic]] doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.<ref name="radack">{{cite journal | vauthors = Radack KP, Farhangian ME, Anderson KL, Feldman SR | title = A review of the use of tanning beds as a dermatological treatment | journal = Dermatology and Therapy | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–51 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25735439 | pmc = 4374067 | doi = 10.1007/s13555-015-0071-8 }}</ref>

<!-- Risks of UV light therapy -->
UV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, being listed by the [[World Health Organization]] as carcinogens.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=((World Health Organization)) | title=Artificial tanning devices: public health interventions to manage sunbeds | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | date=15 June 2017 | hdl=10665/255695 | isbn=9789241512596 }}</ref> Exposure to UV light is known to increase the risks of melanoma and squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas; younger people with psoriasis, particularly those under age 35, are at increased risk from melanoma from UV light treatment. A review of studies recommends that people who are susceptible to skin cancers exercise caution when using UV light therapy as a treatment.<ref name="radack" />

A major mechanism of NBUVB is the induction of [[DNA]] damage in the form of [[pyrimidine dimer]]s. This type of phototherapy is useful in the treatment of psoriasis because the formation of these dimers interferes with the [[cell cycle]] and stops it. The interruption of the cell cycle induced by NBUVB opposes the characteristic rapid division of skin cells seen in psoriasis.<ref name="Dogra2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dogra S, De D | title = Narrowband ultraviolet B in the treatment of psoriasis: the journey so far! | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 76 | issue = 6 | pages = 652–61 | date = November–December 2010 | pmid = 21079308 | doi = 10.4103/0378-6323.72461 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The activity of many types of immune cells found in the skin is also effectively suppressed by NBUVB phototherapy treatments. The most common short-term side effect of this form of phototherapy is redness of the skin; less common side effects of NBUVB phototherapy are itching and [[blister]]ing of the treated skin, irritation of the eyes in the form of [[conjunctivitis|conjunctival inflammation]] or [[keratitis|inflammation of the cornea]], or [[Herpes labialis|cold sores]] due to reactivation of the [[herpes simplex virus]] in the skin surrounding the lips. Eye protection is usually given during phototherapy treatments.<ref name="Dogra2010"/>

PUVA combines the oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The [[mechanism of action]] of PUVA is unknown, but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin.  There are multiple mechanisms of action associated with PUVA, including effects on the skin's immune system. PUVA is associated with [[nausea]], [[headache]], [[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], burning, and itching. Long-term treatment is associated with [[squamous cell carcinoma]] (but not with [[melanoma]]).<ref name="Richard2013"/><ref name="Lapolla2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lapolla W, Yentzer BA, Bagel J, Halvorson CR, Feldman SR | title = A review of phototherapy protocols for psoriasis treatment | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 936–49 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21429620 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.12.054 }}</ref>  A combination therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis using PUVA plus [[acitretin]] resulted in benefit, but acitretin use has been associated with [[birth defect]]s and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]].<ref name="Dunn2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn LK, Gaar LR, Yentzer BA, O'Neill JL, Feldman SR | title = Acitretin in dermatology: a review | journal = Journal of Drugs in Dermatology | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 772–82 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21720660 }}</ref>

===Systemic agents===
[[Image:Psoriasis infliximab ar1182-2.gif|thumb|Pictures of a person with psoriasis (and [[psoriatic arthritis]]) at baseline and 8 weeks after initiation of [[infliximab]] therapy.]]
Psoriasis resistant to [[topical|topical treatment]] and [[light therapy|phototherapy]] may be treated with systemic therapies including [[medication]]s by mouth or [[Injection (medicine)|injectable treatments]].<ref name="Dogra2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dogra S, Mahajan R | title = Systemic methotrexate therapy for psoriasis: past, present and future | journal = Clinical and Experimental Dermatology | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 573–88 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23837932 | doi = 10.1111/ced.12062 | s2cid = 11207097 }}</ref> People undergoing systemic treatment must have regular [[Blood test|blood]] and [[liver function tests]] to check for medication toxicities.<ref name="Dogra2013"/> [[Pregnancy]] must be avoided for most of these treatments.

<!-- Biologics -->
[[biologic medical product|Biologics]] are manufactured proteins that interrupt the immune process involved in psoriasis. Unlike generalized immunosuppressive medical therapies such as methotrexate, biologics target specific aspects of the immune system contributing to psoriasis.<ref name="Rustin2012"/> These medications are generally well tolerated, and limited long-term outcome data have demonstrated biologics to be safe for long-term use in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.<ref name="Rustin2012"/><ref name="Griffiths2012"/> However, due to their immunosuppressive actions, biologics have been associated with a small increase in the risk for infection.<ref name="Rustin2012"/>

<!-- Others -->
Two medications that target T cells are [[efalizumab]] and [[alefacept]]. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the [[CD11a]] subunit of [[LFA-1]].<ref name="Rustin2012"/> It also blocks the adhesion molecules on the [[endothelial]] cells that line blood vessels, which attract T cells. Efalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the European market in February 2009, and from the U.S. market in June 2009, by the manufacturer due to the medication's association with cases of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]].<ref name="Rustin2012"/> Alefacept also blocks the molecules that dendritic cells use to communicate with T cells and even causes [[natural killer cell]]s to kill T cells as a way of controlling inflammation.<ref name=Nestle/> [[Apremilast]] may also be used.<ref name="Palfreeman2013"/>

Individuals with psoriasis may develop [[neutralizing antibodies]] against monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization occurs when an antidrug antibody prevents a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab from binding antigen in a laboratory test. Specifically, neutralization occurs when the antidrug antibody binds to infliximab's antigen binding site instead of TNF-α. When infliximab no longer binds [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]], it no longer decreases inflammation, and psoriasis may worsen. Neutralizing antibodies have not been reported against [[etanercept]], a biologic medication that is a fusion protein composed of two TNF-α receptors. The lack of neutralizing antibodies against etanercept is probably secondary to the innate presence of the TNF-α receptor, and the development of [[immune tolerance]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harding FA, Stickler MM, Razo J, DuBridge RB | title = The immunogenicity of humanized and fully human antibodies: residual immunogenicity resides in the CDR regions | journal = mAbs | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 256–65 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20400861 | pmc = 2881252 | doi = 10.4161/mabs.2.3.11641 }}</ref>

==History==
Scholars believe psoriasis to have been included among the various skin conditions called ''[[tzaraath]]'' (translated as leprosy) in the [[Hebrew Bible]], a condition imposed as a punishment for slander. The person was deemed "impure" (see [[tumah and taharah]]) during their afflicted phase and is ultimately treated by the [[kohen]].<ref name="Gruber2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gruber F, Kastelan M, Brajac I | title = Psoriasis treatment--yesterday, today, and tomorrow | journal = Acta Dermatovenerologica Croatica | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–4 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15072746 }}</ref> However, it is more likely that this confusion arose from the use of the same Greek term for both conditions. The Greeks used the term lepra (λεπρα) for scaly skin conditions. They used the term psora to describe itchy skin conditions.<ref name="Gruber2004"/> It became known as ''Willan's lepra'' in the late 18th century when English [[dermatologist]]s [[Robert Willan]] and Thomas Bateman differentiated it from other skin diseases. [[Leprosy]], they said, is distinguished by the regular, circular form of patches, while psoriasis is always irregular. Willan identified two categories: ''leprosa graecorum'' and ''psora leprosa''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meenan FO | title = A note on the history of psoriasis | journal = Irish Journal of Medical Science | volume = 30 | issue = 351 | pages = 141–2 | date = March 1955 | pmid = 14353580 | doi = 10.1007/bf02949688 | s2cid = 27467338 }}</ref>

The history of psoriasis is littered with treatments of dubious effectiveness and high toxicity. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Fowler's solution]], which contains a [[poisonous]] and [[carcinogenic]] [[arsenic]] compound, was used by dermatologists as a treatment for psoriasis.<ref name="Gruber2004"/> [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was also used for psoriasis treatment during this time period.<ref name="Gruber2004"/> [[Sulfur]], [[iodine]], and [[phenol]] were also commonly used treatments for psoriasis during this era when it was incorrectly believed that psoriasis was an infectious disease.<ref name="Gruber2004"/> Coal tars were widely used with ultraviolet light irradiation as a topical treatment approach in the early 1900s.<ref name="Gruber2004"/><ref name="Benedek2013 Part 2"/> During the same time period, psoriatic arthritis cases were treated with intravenously administered gold preparations in the same manner as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name="Benedek2013 Part 2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Benedek TG | title = Psoriasis and psoriatic arthropathy: historical aspects: part II | journal = Journal of Clinical Rheumatology | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 267–71 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23872545 | doi = 10.1097/RHU.0b013e31829d4ad4 | s2cid = 199596315 }}</ref>
