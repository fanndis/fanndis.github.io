==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Dijon}}
The earliest archaeological finds within the city limits of Dijon date to the [[Neolithic]] period. Dijon later became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement called ''Divio'', which may mean ''sacred fountain'', located on the road from [[Lyon]] to Paris.  [[Benignus of Dijon|Saint Benignus]], the city's apocryphal [[patron saint]], is said to have introduced Christianity to the area before being martyred.

This province was home to the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] from the early 11th until the late 15th century, and Dijon was a place of tremendous wealth and power and one of the great European centres of art, learning, and science. The [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was a key in the transformation of medieval times toward [[early modern Europe]]. The Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy now houses city hall and a museum of art.

In 1513, Swiss and Imperial armies invaded Burgundy and besieged Dijon, which was defended by the governor of the province, [[Louis II de la Trémoille]]. The siege was extremely violent, but the town succeeded in resisting the invaders.  After long negotiations, Louis II de la Trémoille managed to persuade the Swiss and the Imperial armies to withdraw their troops and also to return three hostages who were being held in Switzerland. During the siege, the population called on the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] for help and saw the town's successful resistance and the subsequent withdrawal of the invaders as a miracle. For those reasons, in the years following the siege the inhabitants of Dijon began to venerate [[Church of Notre-Dame of Dijon#Statue of Notre-Dame de Bon-Espoir|Notre-Dame de Bon-Espoir]] (Our Lady of Good Hope). Although a few areas of the town were destroyed, there are nearly no signs of the siege of 1513 visible today. However, [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon|Dijon's museum of fine arts]] has a large tapestry depicting this episode in the town's history: it shows the town before all subsequent destruction (particularly that which occurred during the French Revolution) and is an example of 16th-century art.

Dijon was also occupied by anti-Napoleonic coalitions in 1814, by the Prussian army in 1870–71, and by [[Nazi Germany]] beginning in June 1940, during WWII, when it was bombed by US Air Force B-17 Flying Fortresses,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fold3.com/document/49492859/ |title=Bombing of Dijon, France |publisher=U.S. Air Force |access-date=19 January 2009}}</ref> before the liberation of Dijon by the French Army and the French Resistance, 11 September 1944.

==Geography==
Dijon is situated at the heart of a plain drained by two small converging rivers: the Suzon, which crosses it mostly underground from north to south, and the [[Ouche]], on the southern side of town. Farther south is the ''côte'', or hillside, of vineyards that gives the department its name. Dijon lies {{convert|310|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of Paris, {{convert|190|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Geneva]], and {{convert|190|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Lyon]].

==Climate==
The average low of winter is {{convert|-1|°C|0|abbr=on}}, with an average high of {{convert|4.2|°C|1|abbr=on}}.  The average high of summer is {{convert|25.3|°C|1|abbr=on}} with an average low of {{convert|14.7|°C|1|abbr=on}}. Average normal temperatures are between {{convert|2.3|°C|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|5.3|°C|1|abbr=on}} from November to March, and {{convert|17.2|to|19.7|°C|°F}} from June to August.

==Sights==

Dijon has a large number of churches, including [[Church of Notre-Dame of Dijon|Notre Dame de Dijon]], St. Philibert, St. Michel, and [[Dijon Cathedral]], dedicated to the apocryphal Saint Benignus, the [[crypt]] of which is over 1,000 years old. The city has retained varied [[architectural style]]s from many of the main periods of the past millennium, including Capetian, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Many still-inhabited town houses in the city's central district date from the 18th century and earlier. Dijon architecture is distinguished by, among other things, ''[[toits bourguignons]]'' (Burgundian polychrome roofs) made of tiles glazed in [[terracotta]], green, yellow and black and arranged in geometric patterns.

[[File:F09.St-Bénigne.Dijion.0078.JPG|thumb|View of the spire of Dijon Cathedral, showing roofs with polychrome tiles.]]

Dijon was largely spared the destruction of wars such as the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the Second World War, despite the city being occupied. Therefore, many of the old buildings such as the [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] houses dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries (found mainly in the city's core district) are undamaged, at least by organized violence.

Dijon is home to many museums, including the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]] in part of the Ducal Palace (see below). It contains, among other things, ducal kitchens dating back to the mid-15th century, and a substantial collection of primarily European art, from Roman times through the present.

Among the more popular sights is the [[Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy|Ducal Palace]], the ''Palais des Ducs et des États de Bourgogne'' or "Palace of the Dukes and the States of Burgundy" ({{Coord|47|19|19|N|5|2|29|E}}), which includes one of only a few remaining examples of Capetian period architecture in the region.
 
The church of Notre Dame is famous for both its art and architecture. Popular legend has it that one of its stone relief sculptures, an owl (''la chouette'') is a [[wikt:talisman|good-luck charm]]: visitors to the church touch the owl with their left hands to make a wish. (The current carving was restored after it was damaged by vandalism in the night of 5 and 6 January 2001).

The Grand Théâtre de Dijon, built in 1828 and one of the main performing venues of the [[Opéra de Dijon]], was declared a [[monument historique]] of France in 1975. It was designed by the Dijon-born architect [[Jacques Cellerier]] (1742–1814) in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classical]] style with an interior modelled on Italian opera houses.<ref>Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication de France. [http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00112435 Monuments historiques: Théâtre: Bourgogne, Côte-d'Or, Dijon].

[[Dijon mustard]] originated in 1856, when Jean Naigeon of Dijon substituted [[verjuice]], the acidic "green" juice of not-quite-ripe grapes, for vinegar in the traditional mustard recipe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack E.

Dijon mustard is not necessarily produced near Dijon, as the term is regarded as [[Genericized trademark|genericized]] under [[Law of the European Union|European Union law]], so that it cannot be registered for [[Protected Geographical Status|protected designation of origin]] status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l66044.htm |title=SCADPlus: Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin |work=Europa (web portal) |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310042208/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l66044.htm |archive-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most Dijon mustard (brands such as [[Amora (mustard)|Amora]] or [[Maille (company)|Maille]]) is produced industrially and over 90% of mustard seed used in local production is imported, mainly from Canada. In 2008, Unilever closed its Amora mustard factory in Dijon. Dijon mustard shops sell exotic or unusually-flavoured mustard (fruit-flavoured, for example), often sold in decorative hand-painted ''[[faience]]'' (china) pots.

Burgundy is a world-famous wine growing region, and notable vineyards, such as [[Vosne-Romanée]] and [[Gevrey-Chambertin]], are within 20 minutes of the city center. The town's university boasts a renowned enology institute. The road from [[Santenay, Côte-d'Or|Santenay]] to Dijon is known as the "[[route des Grands Crus]]", where eight of the world's top ten most expensive wines are produced, according to Wine Searcher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/most-expensive-wines |title=World's Top 50 Most Expensive Wines |publisher=Wine-Searcher |access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>

The city is also well known for its ''[[crème de cassis]]'', or blackcurrant [[liqueur]], used in the drink known as "[[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]]", named after former mayor of Dijon [[canon (priest)|canon]] [[Félix Kir]], a mixture of crème de cassis with white wine, traditionally [[Bourgogne Aligoté AOC|Bourgogne aligoté]].

Dijon is home to [[Dijon FCO]], a men's [[football team]] now in [[Ligue 1]], and [[Dijon FCO (women)|Dijon FCO]], a women's team now in [[Division 1 Féminine]]. Dijon has a its own (Pro A) basketball club, [[JDA Dijon Basket]]. The [[Palais des Sports de Dijon]] serves as playground for the team and hosted international basketball events such as the FIBA [[EuroBasket 1999]] in the past. Dijon is home to the [[Ducs de Dijon|Dijon Ducs]] ice hockey team, who play in the [[Ligue Magnus|Magnus League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhc.reseau-concept.net/|title=Duc's Official Website|author=Dijon Hockey Club|language=fr|access-date=1 October 2010}}</ref> To the northwest, the [[race track]] of [[Dijon-Prenois]] hosts various [[Motorsport|motor sport]] events.
