The '''Christian right''' or the '''religious right''' are [[Christianity and politics|Christian]] [[political faction]]s that are characterized by their strong support of [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] policies. Christian conservatives seek to influence politics and public policy with their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&pg=PA469 Sociology: understanding a diverse society], Margaret L.

In the United States, the Christian right is an informal coalition formed around a core of [[conservative]] [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholics]].<ref name="Deckman2004">{{cite book|last= Deckman|first= Melissa Marie|author-link=Melissa Deckman|title= School Board Battles: The Christian Right in Local Politics|url= https://archive.org/details/schoolboardbattl0000deck|url-access= registration|accessdate= April 10, 2014|year= 2004|publisher= Georgetown University Press|isbn= 9781589010017|page= [https://archive.org/details/schoolboardbattl0000deck/page/48 48]|quote= More than half of all Christian right candidates attend evangelical Protestant churches, which are more theologically liberal.

==Terminology==
The Christian right is "also known as the ''New Christian Right'' (NCR) or the ''Religious Right''", although some consider the religious right to be "a slightly broader category than Christian Right".<ref name=hartsem>{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Cright.htm|title=Content Pages of the Encyclopedia of Religion and Social Science|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230556/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Cright.htm|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=wacker>{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/chr_rght.htm|title=The Christian Right, The Twentieth Century, Divining America: Religion in American History|author=Grant Wacker|publisher=National Humanities Center}}</ref>

[[John C. Green]] of the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] states that [[Jerry Falwell]] used the label ''religious right'' to describe himself. Gary Schneeberger, vice president of media and public relations for [[Focus on the Family]], states that "[t]erms like 'religious right' have been traditionally used in a pejorative way to suggest extremism. The phrase 'socially conservative evangelicals' is not very exciting, but that's certainly the way to do it."<ref name=ct>Sarah Pulliam: [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/februaryweb-only/106-42.0.html Phrase 'Religious Right' Misused, Conservatives Say] ''Christianity Today'' (Web-only), February 12, 2009.</ref>

Evangelical leaders like [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] of the [[Family Research Council]] have called attention to the problem of equating the term ''Christian right'' with [[evangelicalism|evangelicals]]. Although evangelicals constitute the core constituency of the Christian right, not all evangelicals fit the description and moreover, a number of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] are also members of the Christian right's core base.<ref name="Deckman2004"/> The problem of description is further complicated by the fact that ''religious conservative'' may refer to other groups. [[Mennonites]] and the [[Amish]], for example, are theologically conservative, however,  there are no overtly political organizations associated with these denominations.

==History==
[[File:Jerry Falwell portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jerry Falwell]], whose founding of the [[Moral Majority]] was a key step in the formation of the "New Christian Right"]]
In 1863, representatives from eleven Christian denominations in the United States organized the [[National Reform Association (United States)|National Reform Association]] with the goal of adding a [[Christian amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], in order to establish the country as a [[Christian state]].<ref name="Boston2010">{{cite book |last1=Boston |first1=Robert |title=Why the Religious Right Is Wrong About Separation of Church and State |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=9781615924103 |page=103 }}</ref> The National Reform Association is seen as one of the first organizations of the Christian right, through which adherents from several Christian denominations worked together to try to enshrine Christianity in American politics.<ref name="Boston2010"/>

Early organizations of the Christian right, such as the [[Christian Civic League of Maine]] founded in 1897, supported the aims of the [[temperance movement]].<ref name="RozellGreenJelenWilcox2003"/>

Patricia Miller states that the "alliance between evangelical leaders and the Catholic bishops has been a cornerstone of the Christian Right for nearly twenty years".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://religiondispatches.org/meet-the-new-christian-right-same-as-the-old-christian-right/|title=Meet the New Christian Right, Same as the Old Christian Right|last=Miller|first=Patricia|date=December 12, 2016|publisher=[[Religion Dispatches]]|language=en|accessdate=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203080843/http://religiondispatches.org/meet-the-new-christian-right-same-as-the-old-christian-right/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the late 1970s, the Christian right has been a notable force in both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and American politics when Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell and other Christian leaders began to urge conservative Christians to involve themselves in the political process. In response to the rise of the Christian right, the 1980 Republican Party platform assumed a number of its positions, including adding support for a restoration of [[school prayer]]. The past two decades have been an important time in the political debates and in the same time frame religious citizens became more politically active in a time period labeled the New Christian Right.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=Kimberly J. |first2=Chris |last2=Powell |title=Christianity and Punitive Mentalities: A Qualitative Study |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change |volume=39 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=69–89 |doi=10.1023/A:1022487430900 |s2cid=142654351 }}</ref> While the platform also opposed [[abortion]]<ref name=hartsem /><ref name="williams" /><ref name=gop1980>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25844|title=Republican Party Platforms: Republican Party Platform of 1980}}</ref> and leaned towards restricting taxpayer funding for abortions and passing a constitutional amendment which would restore protection of the right to life for unborn children,<ref name=gop1980 /> it also accepted the fact that many Americans, including fellow Republicans, were divided on the issue.<ref name=gop1980 /> Since about 1980, the Christian right has been associated with several institutions including the [[Moral Majority]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], [[Focus on the Family]] and the [[Family Research Council]].<ref name=Himmelstein /><ref name="Martin1996a" />

While the influence of the Christian right is typically traced to the 1980 Presidential election, Daniel K. Williams argues in ''God's Own Party'' that it had actually been involved in politics for most of the twentieth century. He also notes that the Christian right had previously been in alliance with the Republican Party in the 1940s through 1960s on matters such as opposition to communism and defending "a Protestant-based moral order."<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2010|p=3}}</ref>

In light of the [[state atheism]] espoused by communist countries, secularization came to be seen by many Americans as the biggest threat to American and Christian values,<ref>Merriman, Scott A.

The alienation of [[Southern Democrat]]s from the Democratic Party contributed to the rise of the right, as the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] provoked fear of [[social disintegration]]. In addition, as the Democratic Party became identified with a pro-abortion rights position and with nontraditional societal values, [[social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] joined the Republican Party in increasing numbers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Perlstein |first=Rick | author-link = Rick Perlstein | title=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America |page=164 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2008 |isbn=978-0743243025|title-link=Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America }}</ref>

In 1976, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] received the support of the Christian right largely because of his much-acclaimed religious conversion. However, Carter's spiritual transformation did not compensate for his liberal policies in the minds of Christian conservatives, as reflected in Jerry Falwell's criticism that "Americans have literally stood by and watched as godless, spineless leaders have brought our nation floundering to the brink of death."<ref name=Reinhard />

Randall Balmer, on the other hand, has suggested that the New Christian Right Movement's rise was not centered around the issue of abortion, but rather [[Bob Jones University]]'s refusal to comply with the Supreme Court's 1971 ''[[Coit v.

====Grassroots activism====
Much of the Christian right's power within the American political system is attributed to their extraordinary turnout rate at the polls. The voters that coexist in the Christian right are also highly motivated and driven to get out a viewpoint on issues they care about. As well as high voter turnout, they can be counted on to attend political events, knock on doors and distribute literature. Members of the Christian right are willing to do the electoral work needed to see their candidate elected. Because of their high level of devotion, the Christian right does not need to monetarily compensate these people for their work.<ref name=Green2006>{{cite news |first1=John C. |last1=Green |first2=Mark |last2=Silk |title=Why Moral Values Did Count |work=Religion in the News |date=Spring 2005 |url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/RINVol8No1/WhyMoral%20ValuesDidCount.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123231911/http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/RINVol8No1/WhyMoral%20ValuesDidCount.htm |archive-date=January 23, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Geoffrey C. |last1=Layman |first2=John C. |last2=Green |title=Wars and Rumors of Wars: The Contexts of Cultural Conflict in American Political Behavior |journal=British Journal of Political Science |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=61–89 |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 }}</ref>{{Update inline|reason=Does this still hold after so many years?|?=yes|date=November 2020}}

===National organizations===

One early attempt to bring the Christian right into American politics began in 1974 when [[Robert Grant (Christian Leader)|Robert Grant]], an early movement leader, founded American Christian Cause to advocate Christian ideological teachings in Southern California. Concerned that Christians overwhelmingly voted for President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976, Grant expanded his movement and founded [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]] to rally Christian voters behind socially conservative candidates.  Prior to his alliance with Falwell, Weyrich sought an alliance with Grant.<ref name=weyrichgrant /> Grant and other Christian Voice staff soon set up their main office at the headquarters of Weyrich's Heritage Foundation.<ref name=weyrichgrant>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ehBRJGC7kq0C&pg=PT122|title=What Every American Should Know About Who's Really Running America|first=Melissa|last=Rossi|date=May 29, 2007|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books|isbn=9781440621031}}</ref>  However, the alliance between Weyrich and Grant fell apart in 1978.<ref name=weyrichgrant />

In the late 1980s, Pat Robertson founded the [[Christian Coalition of America]], building from his [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential run]], with Republican activist [[Ralph E. Reed Jr.|Ralph Reed]], who became the spokesman for the Coalition. In 1992, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, began producing voter guides, which it distributed to conservative Christian churches, both Protestant and Catholic, with the blessing of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]].<ref name="SmidtPenning1997">{{cite book|last1=Smidt|first1=Corwin E.|last2=Penning|first2=James M.|title=Sojourners in the Wilderness: The Christian Right in Comparative Perspective|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|language=en|isbn=9780847686452|page=51|quote=Perhaps the most prominent example of this was when the Archdiocese of New York joined forces with the Christian Coalition during the New York City school board elections in 1993 and allowed the distribution of Christian Coalition voter guides in Catholic parishes.}}</ref> Under the leadership of Reed and Robertson, the Coalition quickly became the most prominent voice in the conservative Christian movement, its influence culminating with an effort to support the election of a conservative Christian to the [[1996 United States presidential election|presidency in 1996]].

In an essay written in 1996, Ralph Reed argued against the [[Moral absolutism|moral absolutist]] tone of Christian right leaders, arguing for the Republican Party Platform to stress the moral dimension of abortion rather than placing emphasis on overturning Roe v.

Both Christian right and secular polling organizations sometimes conduct polls to determine which presidential candidates will receive the support of Christian right constituents. One such poll is taken at the [[Family Research Council]]'s Values Voter Summit.<ref>[http://www.frcaction.org/index.cfm?c=WASH_BRIEFING FRC Action: Tuesday, March 25, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512182418/http://www.frcaction.org/index.cfm?c=WASH_BRIEFING |date=May 12, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/presidential-hopefuls-highlight-values-to-christian-conservatives-29775/ |title=Presidential Hopefuls Highlight 'Values' to Christian Conservatives |date=October 20, 2007 |last=Vu |first=Michelle |newspaper=The Christian Post |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102043700/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20071020/29775_Presidential_Hopefuls_Highlight_'Values'_to_Christian_Conservatives.htm |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |accessdate=May 28, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> George W.

===Education===
[[File:Donald Trump delivers remarks at the Liberty University.jpg|thumb|[[Jerry Falwell Jr.]] and [[Donald Trump]] at [[Liberty University]].]]
The [[Home School Legal Defense Association]] was co-founded in 1983 by [[Michael Farris (lawyer)|Michael Farris]], who would later establish [[Patrick Henry College]], and Michael Smith. This organization attempts to challenge laws that serve as obstacles to allowing parents to home-school their children and to organize the disparate group of homeschooling families into a cohesive bloc. The number of homeschooling families has increased in the last twenty years, and around 80 percent of these families identify themselves as evangelicals.<ref>Rosin, God's Harvard, 2007, 61–62</ref>

===Media===
The media has played a major role in the rise of the Christian right since the 1920s and has continued to be a powerful force for political Christianity today. The role of the media for the Religious right has been influential in its ability to connect Christian audiences to the larger American culture while at the same time bringing and keeping religion into play as both a political and a cultural force.<ref name="Diamond"/> The political agenda of the Christian right has been disseminated to the public through a variety of media outlets including radio broadcasting, television, and literature.

Religious broadcasting began in the 1920s through the radio.<ref name="Diamond">Diamond, S. (2000) Not by Politics Alone: The Enduring Influence of the Christian right. New York: Guildford Press.</ref> Between the 1950s and 1980s, TV became a powerful way for the Christian right to influence the public through shows such as Pat Robertson's ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and [[ABC Family|The Family Channel]]. The Internet has also helped the Christian right reach a much larger audience. Organization's websites play a strong role in popularising the Christian right's stances on cultural and political issues, and informed interested viewers on how to get involved. The Christian Coalition, for example, has used the Internet to inform the public, as well as to sell merchandise and gather members.<ref>"The Christian Coalition of America: America's Leading Grassroots Organization Defending Our Godly Heritage."

===Education===
The Christian right strongly advocates for a system of educational choice, using a system of [[school voucher]]s, instead of public education. Vouchers would be government funded and could be redeemed for "a specified maximum sum per child per years if spent on approved educational services".<ref>Spring, Joel. ''Political Agendas for Education: From the Religious Right to the Green Party''. Second Edition. (Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002)</ref>  This method would allow parents to determine which school their child attends while relieving the economic burden associated with private schools. The concept is popular among constituents of church-related schools, including those affiliated with Roman Catholicism.

===Evolution===

===Sunday Sabbatarianism===
The Christian right is in favour of legislation that maintains and promotes [[Sabbatarianism|Sunday Sabbatarianism]], such as [[blue laws|Sunday blue laws]] that forbid shopping and restrict the sale of alcohol on Sundays, which is the [[Lord's Day]] in mainstream Christianity.<ref name="Bowers2009"/> 

===Role of government===
Supporters of the Christian right have no one unified stance on the role of government since the movement is primarily one that advocates [[social conservatism]]; in fact, "struggles [have] broken out in state party organizations" between supporters of the Christian right and other conservatives.<ref name="Farney2012">{{cite book|last=Farney|first=James Harold|title=Social Conservatives and Party Politics in Canada and the United States|year=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|language=en|isbn=9781442612600|page=61|quote=Struggles broke out in state party organizations between social conservatives - in general organized by the Christian Coalition - and party activists more interested in fiscal policy, foreign policy, or simply winning office.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/twenty/tkeyinfo/chr_rght.htm |title=The Christian Right, The Twentieth Century, Divining America: Religion in American History, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center |publisher=Nationalhumanitiescenter.org |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> It promotes conservative interpretations of the Bible as the basis for moral values and enforcing such values by legislation.

The Christian right believes that separation of church and state is not explicit in the American Constitution, believing instead that such separation is a creation of what it claims are activist judges in the judicial system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrobertson.com/Teaching/Teachingonfirstamendment.asp|title=The First Amendment|publisher=PatRobertson.com|author=Pat Robertson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html |title=Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=ThinkExist.com Quotations |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_purpose_of_separation_of_church_and_state_is/212643.html |title=James Madison quotes |publisher=Thinkexist.com |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> In the United States, the Christian right often supports their claims by asserting that the country was "[[Christian nationalism|founded by Christians as a Christian Nation]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.RES.888:|title=House Resolution 888 United States House of Representatives (Bill Text – 110th Congress (2007–2008) – THOMAS)|publisher=Library of Congress|date=December 18, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=A Nonbeliever |url=http://freethought.mbdojo.com/foundingfathers.html |title=America is not founded upon Christianity but the Enlightenment |publisher=Freethought.mbdojo.com |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref> Members of the Christian right take the position that the Establishment Clause bars the federal government from establishing or sponsoring a state church (e.g., the Church of England), but does not prevent the government from acknowledging religion.

Thus, Christian right leaders have argued that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the display of religion in the public sphere. Leaders therefore believe that public institutions should be allowed, or even required, to display the [[Ten Commandments]]. This interpretation has been repeatedly rejected by the courts, which have found that such displays violate the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]]. Public officials though are prohibited from using their authority in which the primary effect is "advancing or prohibiting religion", according to the Lemon Supreme Court test, and there cannot be an "excessive entanglement with religion" and the government. Some, such as Bryan Fischer of the [[American Family Association]], argue that the First Amendment, which specifically restricts Congress, applies only to the Congress and not the states. This position rejects the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://action.afa.net/Blogs/BlogPost.aspx?id=2147492060 |title=The First Amendment means what it says - RIGHTLYCONCERNED.COM |publisher=Action.afa.net |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721203505/http://action.afa.net/Blogs/BlogPost.aspx?id=2147492060 |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Generally, the Christian right supports the presence of religious institutions within government and the public sphere, and advocates for fewer restrictions on government funding for religious charities and schools. Both Catholics and Protestants, according to a 2005 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] study, have been supportive of [[school prayer]] in public schools.<ref name="Wilson2007"/><ref name="GallupNewport2006">{{cite book|last1=Gallup|first1=Alec|last2=Newport|first2=Frank|title=The Gallup Poll: Public Opinion 2005|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|language=en|isbn=9780742552586|page=318|quote=Related to their support of school prayer, most Americans also believe that religion should have a greater "presence" in public schools. ...

===Economics===
Early American fundamentalists, such as [[John R. Rice]]<ref name="ah">"[Rice] melded politics and religion in a way that made it very clear what side of any political
issue he believed God was on. God had been very clearly opposed to the New Deal "socialism" of Franklin Roosevelt,
and God was equally opposed to the Great Society "socialism" of Lyndon Baines Johnson". Andrew Himes,

===Middle East===
{{See also|Christian Zionism}}
Many evangelical Protestant supporters of the religious right have given very strong support to the state of [[Israel]] in recent decades, encouraging support for Israel in the United States government.<ref>Stephen Spector, ''Evangelicals and Israel: the story of American Christian Zionism'' (2008) pp 23–49</ref>  Some have linked Israel to Biblical prophesies; for example, Ed McAteer, founder of the Moral Majority, said "I believe that we are seeing prophecy unfold so rapidly and dramatically and wonderfully and, without exaggerating, makes me breathless."<ref>Jan G. Linn, ''What's Wrong With The Christian Right'' (2004) p 27</ref> This belief, an example of [[dispensationalism]], arises from the idea that the establishment of Israel is a prerequisite for the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, because it represents the Biblically prophesied [[Gathering of Israel]]. A 2017 poll indicates that this belief is held by 80% of evangelicals, and that half of evangelicals consider it an important cause of their support for the state of Israel.<ref>Bump, Philip. May 14, 2017. "Half of evangelicals support Israel because they believe it is important for fulfilling end-times prophecy" .https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/14/half-of-evangelicals-support-israel-because-they-believe-it-is-important-for-fulfilling-end-times-prophecy/</ref> During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] that started in 1975 and ended in 1990, many Christian parties endorsed the right politics spectrum such as the Christian Lebanese phalanges known as the [[Kataeb Party]], and later the Lebanese Forces, in facing the more radical Islamist or left-wing movements, such as the [[Shiite]] [[Amal Movement]], and the [[Progressive Socialist Party]] in the 1980s.

===Abortion and contraception===
{{See also|Bioethics|Consistent life ethic}}

The Christian right opposes abortion,{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} believing that life begins at [[Human fertilization|conception]] and that abortion is murder. Therefore, those in the movement have worked toward the overturning of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', and have also supported incremental steps to make abortion less available. Such efforts include bans on [[late-term abortion]] (including [[intact dilation and extraction]]),<ref>[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abortion/2003s3.html Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003] 108th United States Congress (1st session)</ref> prohibitions against Medicaid funding and other public funding for elective abortions, removal of taxpayer funding for [[Planned Parenthood]] and other organizations that provide abortion services, legislation requiring [[parental consent]] or notification for abortions performed on [[minor (law)|minors]],<ref>[http://articles.dailypress.com/1994-04-09/news/9404090085_1_parental-notification-notification-bill-abortion Allen Wants Parents Notified – Daily Press].

Retrieved on August 24, 2013.</ref> legal protections for unborn victims of violence, [[BAIPA|legal protections for infants born alive]] following failed abortions, and bans on [[abortifacient]] medications.

The Christian right element in the Reagan coalition strongly supported him in 1980, in the belief that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn ''Roe V Wade''. They were astonished and dismayed when his first appointment was [[Sandra Day O’Connor]], whom they feared would tolerate abortion. They worked hard to defeat her confirmation but failed.<ref>Prudence Flowers, "‘A Prolife Disaster’: The Reagan Administration and the Nomination of Sandra Day O’Connor." ''Journal of Contemporary History''  53.2 (2018): 391-414</ref>

The Christian right contends that morning-after pills such as [[Plan B (drug)|Plan B]] and [[Ulipristal acetate|Ella]] are possible abortifacients, able to interfere with a [[fertilized egg]]'s [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] in the [[uterine wall]].<ref name="abortifacients">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html|title=Abortion Qualms on Morning-After Pill May Be Unfounded|last=Belluck|first=Pam|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 6, 2012}}</ref> The labeling mandated by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for Plan B and Ella state that they may interfere with implantation, but according to a June 2012, ''The New York Times'' article, many scientists believe that they work only by interfering with [[ovulation]] and are arguing to have the implantation language removed from product labels. The Christian right maintains that the chemical properties of morning-after pills make them abortifacients and that the politics of abortion is influencing scientific judgments. Jonathan Imbody of the [[Christian Medical Association]] says he questions "whether ideological considerations are driving these decisions."<ref name="abortifacients"/> Specifically, many Catholic members, as well as some conservative Protestant members, of the Christian right have campaigned against contraception altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2014/01/06/catholic-groups-trying-to-eliminate-coverage-of-contraception-no-matter-who-pays/|title=Catholic Groups Trying to Eliminate Coverage of Contraception No Matter Who Pays: The latest court challenges to the birth control benefit show how much the fight against the contraception mandate is really about the Christian right trying to establish an employer's "right" to control your private sex life.|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|date=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Rewire (website)|Rewire]]|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Contra-Contraception|last=Shorto|first=Russell|date=May 7, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

===Environment===
{{expand section|date = February 2015}}
According to some [[social science]] research, Christians and members of the Christian right are typically less concerned about issues of environmental responsibility than the general public.<ref name="Structuring the religion-environmen">{{cite journal | last1 = Sherkat | first1 = D.

===Biotechnology===
Due to the Christian right's views regarding ethics and to an extent due to negative views of [[eugenics]] common to most ideologies in North America, it has worked for the regulation and restriction of certain applications of [[biotechnology]]. In particular, the Christian right opposes therapeutic and reproductive [[human cloning]], championing a 2005 United Nations ban on the practice,<ref name="human cloning ban">{{cite news|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/2/19/102711.shtml|title=U.N.

The Christian right also opposes [[euthanasia]], and, in one highly publicized case, took an active role in seeking governmental intervention to prevent [[Terri Schiavo]] from being deprived of nutrition and [[Dehydration|hydration]].

===Opposition to drugs===

===Sex and sexuality===
The modern roots of the Christian right's views on sexual matters were evident in the 1950s, a period in which many Christian conservatives in the United States viewed sexual promiscuity as not only excessive, but in fact as a threat to their ideal vision of the country.<ref name="Herman">{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Didi|url=https://archive.org/details/antigayagendaort00herm|title=The Antigay Agenda: Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-226-32764-8|location=Chicago, IL|url-access=registration}}<!--|access-date=September 20, 2012|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>{{rp|30}}

Beginning in the 1970s, conservative Christian protests against promiscuity began to surface, largely as a reaction to the "permissive sixties" and an emerging prominence of sexual rights arising from ''Roe v Wade'' and the gay rights movement. The Christian right proceeded to make sexuality issues a priority political cause.<ref name=Herman />{{rp|28}}

The Christian right champions itself as the "self-appointed conscience of American society". During the 1980s, the movement was largely dismissed by political pundits and mainstream religious leaders as "a collection of buffoonish has-beens". Later, it re-emerged, better organized and more focused, taking firm positions against abortion, pornography, sexual deviancy, and extreme feminism.<ref name=Kaplan>{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=George R.|title=Shotgun Wedding: Notes on Public Education's Encounter with the New Christian Right|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|date=May 1994|volume=75|issue=9}}{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref><ref name=Green>{{cite book|last=Green|first=Hohn|title=THE VALUES CAMPAIGN?

Slate, February 15, 2018.  ''Slate''.  Start listening at 37:00.</ref>

Influential Christian right organizations at the forefront of the anti-gay rights movement in the United States include Focus on the Family, Family Research Council and the [[Family Research Institute]].<ref name=Herman />{{rp|15–16}} An important stratagem in Christian right anti-gay politics is in its rejection of "the edicts of a Big Brother" state, allowing it to profit from "a general feeling of discontent and demoralization with government". As a result, the Christian right has endorsed smaller government, restricting its ability to arbitrate in disputes regarding values and traditions. In this context, gay rights laws have come to symbolize the government's allegedly unconstitutional "[interference] with individual freedom".<ref name=Herman />{{rp|170–171}}

The central tenets of Focus on the Family and similar organizations, such as the Family Research Council, emphasise issues such as abortion and the necessity of gender roles. A number of organizations, including the New Christian Right, "have in various ways rejected liberal America in favor of the regulation of pornography, anti-abortion legislation, the criminalization of homosexuality, and the virtues of faithfulness and loyalty in sexual partnerships", according to sociologist [[Bryan S. Turner|Bryan Turner]].<ref name=Petersen>{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=David L.|title=Genesis and Family Values|journal= Journal of Biblical Literature|year=2005|volume=124|issue=1|doi=10.2307/30040988|jstor=30040988}}{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>

A large number of the Christian right view same-sex marriage as a central issue in the culture wars, more so than other gay rights issues and even more significantly than abortion.<ref name=Green />{{rp|57}}{{dubious|date=July 2013}} The legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2004 changed the Christian right, causing it to put its opposition to these marriages above most other issues. It also created previously unknown interracial and ecumenical coalitions, and stimulated new electoral activity in pastors and congregations.<ref name=Green />{{rp|58}}

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the Christian right often come from Christians who believe Jesus' message was centered on [[social responsibility]] and [[social justice]]. Theologian Michael Lerner has summarized: "The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a revulsion against God and religion by identifying them with militarism, ecological irresponsibility, fundamentalist antagonism to science and rational thought, and insensitivity to the needs of the poor and the powerless."<ref>{{cite book |last       = Lerner

===Interpretation of Christianity===
{{See also|Christian left}}
One argument which questions the legitimacy of the Christian right posits that [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] may be considered a leftist on the modern [[political spectrum]].

According to Frank Newport of [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], "there are fewer Americans today who are both highly religious and liberal than there are Americans who are both highly religious and conservative." Newport also noted that 52% of white conservatives identify as "highly religious" while only 16% of white liberals identify as the same. However, [[African-Americans]], "the most religious of any major racial or ethnic group in the country", are "strongly oriented to voting Democratic[.]" While observing that African-American Democrats are more religious than their white Democrat counterparts, Newport further noted, however, that African-American Democrats are "much more likely to be ideologically moderate or conservative."<ref>[https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/258032/religious-left-numbers-problem.aspx The Religious Left Has a Numbers Problem by Frank Newport | Gallup, June 4, 2019] (retrieved May 5, 2020)</ref>

===Canada===
{{further|Conservatism in Canada}}
{{See also|Abortion in Canada}}
Religion has been a key factor in Canadian politics since well before [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, when the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] were the party of traditionalist Catholics and Anglicans and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] were the party of [[Protestant]] dissenters and [[anti-clerical]] Catholics. This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the [[Christian left]] (represented by the [[Social Gospel]] philosophy and [[ecumenicism]]) and the Christian right (represented by [[fundamentalism]] and [[biblical literalism]]). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] while the right moved to the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]].

The Social Credit Party, founded in 1935 represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as "[[worldly]]", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher [[William Aberhart]] or "Bible Bill". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the [[monetary reform]] theories of [[social credit]] to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple [[Ernest Manning]] then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada. In 1987 Manning's son, [[Preston Manning]], founded the new [[Reform Party of Canada]], which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the [[official opposition]] from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[Stephen Harper]], a member of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], who went on to become [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] in 2006.

Canada has had a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since the [[Canadian Constitution]] was patriated in 1982. As a result, there have been major changes in the law's application to issues that bear on individual and minority group rights. Abortions were completely decriminalized after two R. v. Morgentaler cases ([[R. v. Morgentaler|in 1988]] and [[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)|in 1993]]). A series of provincial superior court decisions allowing same-sex marriage led the federal government to introduce legislation that introduced [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage in all of Canada]]. Former [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] stated before taking office that he would hold a free vote on the issue,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2005/11/29/harper-smaesex051129.html |title=Harper reopens same-sex marriage debate |publisher=CBC TV |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=February 29, 2008}}</ref> but declared the issue closed after a vote in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061207/samesexmarriage_vote_061207?s_name=&no_ads= |title=Harper declares same-sex marriage issue closed |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |date=December 7, 2006 |publisher=CTV}}</ref>

In the Netherlands Calvinist Protestants have long had their own political parties, now called the [[Reformed Political Party]] (SGP) on the right, and the [[ChristianUnion]] (CU) in the center. For generations they operated their own newspapers and broadcasting association. The SGP has about 28,000 members, and three members of parliament, of the 150. It has always been in opposition to the government.<ref>Alan J. Day, ''Political parties of the world'' (2002) p 343</ref> The SGP has helped the Dutch government to get laws through the Second Chamber 2010–2012.

The Swiss [[Federal Democratic Union]] is a small conservative Protestant party with about 1% of the vote.<ref>Alan J. Day, ''Political parties of the world'' (2002) p 449</ref>

In [[Scandinavia]], the [[Centre Party (Faroe Islands)|Centre Party]] is a bible-oriented fundamentalist party; it has about 4% of the votes in the Faroe Islands. However, the Norwegian [[Christian Democratic Party of Norway|Christian People's Party]], the Swedish [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] and Danish [[Christian Democrats (Denmark)|Christian Democrats]] are less religiously orthodox and are similar to mainstream European [[Christian Democracy]].

In [[Fiji]], [[Social Democratic Liberal Party|Sodelpa]] is a conservative, nationalist party which seeks to make Christianity the [[state religion]], while the [[constitution of Fiji|constitution]] makes Fiji a secular republic. Following the 2014 general election, Sodelpa is the main opposition party in Parliament.

In [[Brazil]], the evangelical caucus have a great influence at the parliament and in the society in general. The bloc promotes strong socially conservative positions, like [[Anti-abortion movement|opposition to abortion]], LGBT rights, [[marijuana]] legalization, sexual and gender education at schools and support to decrease of age of [[Age of criminal responsibility|defense of infancy]]. Except for left-wing and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] or [[Socialism and Liberty Party]], Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil, but nevertheless they are more common associated with parties like [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011)|Social Democratic Party]], [[Democratas]], [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]], [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]], [[Brazilian Republican Party]], [[Patriota]] and in the [[Party of the Republic]]. In 2016, [[Marcelo Crivella]], a licensed [[pentecostal]] pastor from the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], won in a runoff the election to mayor of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the second biggest city in Brazil, with the Brazilian Republican Party, making for the first time an evangelical bloc member mayor of a big city in Brazil. In 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected president with massive support of conservative Catholics, Charismatics, Evangelicals and Pentecostals; Another candidate, [[Cabo Daciolo]], from [[Patriota]], attracted much attention from media and public in general, despite a lower votation. Both had a [[right-wing populist]], [[christian nationalism|Christian Nationalist]] program, but Bolsonaro was near to a [[national conservative]] and [[economic liberal]] one, contrasting with an [[Ultranationalist]], [[theocratic]] and [[protectionist]] style of Daciolo.
