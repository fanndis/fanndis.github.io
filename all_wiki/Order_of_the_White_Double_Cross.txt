The '''Order of the White Double Cross''' ({{lang-sk|Rad Bieleho dvojkríža}}) is the highest [[state decoration]] of the [[Slovak Republic]].

The Order was instituted on 1 March 1994 after Slovakia became independent on 1 January 1993. It continues the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[Order of the White Lion]], which was created in 1922 as an award for foreigners.

The Order of the White Double Cross is conferred only upon foreign citizens, with the sole exception of the current President of Slovakia, who is awarded the Order by the National Council for the duration of his or her term of office upon inauguration.

According to the Order's statute, it is awarded:

*"for the comprehensive development of relations between the state, whose citizens they are and the Slovak Republic";
*"for the empowerment of the Slovak Republic’s position in international relations";
*"for meeting the foreign policy priorities of Slovakia";
*"for otherwise outstanding achievement in the benefit of the Slovak Republic"; or
*"for the outstanding spread of good reputation of Slovakia abroad."

==Classes==
The Order of the White Double Cross has two divisions, civil and military, and three classes:
*''First Class'' or ''Grand Cross'' – badge may be worn on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star is worn on the left chest; 
*''Second Class'' or ''Grand Officer'' – badge may be worn on a necklet and the star is worn on the left chest;
*''Third Class'' or ''Commander'' – badge may be worn on a necklet.

==Insignia==
The ''star'' is an eight-pointed gold breast star, with golden straight rays between the points of the star. The central disc on the star has a white [[Patriarchal cross|double cross]] on a red enamel background, which is surrounded by a gold [[wreath]] of laurel and oak leaves.

The ''badge'' of the Order is of the same design as the star, although smaller. Furthermore, the upper point is missing and the badge is suspended on a stylized leaf of a [[common lime tree]], with or without the crossed swords of the Military Division.

The ''ribbon'' of the order is blue with a red central stripe.
