=== Towers Financial Corporation ===
Steven Hoffenberg hired Epstein in 1987, as a consultant for [[Towers Financial Corporation]] (unaffiliated with the company of the same name founded in 1998, and acquired by [[Old National Bancorp]] in 2014),<ref>{{cite web |title=Company Overview of Towers Financial Corporation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=404773 |work=Bloomberg|access-date=July 20, 2019}}{{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref> a [[collection agency]] that bought debts people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/epstein-clinton-hoffenberg-1448213|title=Jeffrey Epstein's mentor says his former protege was ruined by relationship with Bill Clinton: "It inflated his ego"|last=Cole|first=Brendan|date=July 9, 2019|work=Newsweek|access-date=July 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712131048/https://www.newsweek.com/epstein-clinton-hoffenberg-1448213|archive-date=July 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Illusion-NYT">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/jeffrey-epstein-net-worth.html|title=Jeffrey Epstein's Fortune May Be More Illusion Than Fact|last1=Stewart|first1=James B.|date=July 10, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 11, 2019|last2=Goldstein|first2=Matthew|issn=0362-4331|last3=Kelly|first3=Kate|last4=Enrich|first4=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711014027/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/jeffrey-epstein-net-worth.html|archive-date=July 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Hoffenberg set Epstein up in offices in the "[[Villard Houses]]" in Manhattan and paid him {{US$|25,000}} per month for his consulting work ({{Inflation|US|25000|1987|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name="Vanity Fair" />

Hoffenberg and Epstein then refashioned themselves as [[corporate raid]]ers using Towers Financial as their raiding vessel.

A similar unsuccessful bid in 1988 was made to take over [[Emery Worldwide|Emery Air Freight Corp]]. During this period, Hoffenberg and Epstein worked closely together and traveled everywhere on Hoffenberg's private jet.<ref name="Vanity Fair" />

By 1995, Epstein was a director of the [[Wexner Foundation]] and Wexner Heritage Foundation. He was also the president of Wexner's Property, which developed part of the town of [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]] outside [[Columbus, Ohio]], where Wexner lived.

The innovation of Liquid Funding, and other early companies, was that instead of having [[stocks]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as the underlying securities, it had [[commercial mortgage]]s and investment-grade [[Mortgage loan|residential mortgages]] bundled into [[Mortgage-backed security|complex securities]] as the underlying security.<ref name=":3" />

Liquid Funding was initially 40{{nbsp}}percent owned by Bear Stearns. Through the help of the [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] – [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Fitch Ratings]] and [[Moody's Investors Service]] – the new bundled securities were able to be created for companies so that they got a gold-plated AAA rating. The implosion of such complex securities, because of their inaccurate ratings, led to the [[Government intervention during the subprime mortgage crisis#Bear Stearns|collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008]] and set in motion the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and the subsequent [[Great Recession]]. If Liquid Funding was left holding large amounts of such securities as collateral, it could have lost large amounts of money.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Asset Securitisation and Synthetic Structures: Innovations in the European Credit Markets|last1=Watson|first1=Rick|last2=Carter|first2=Jeremy|year=2006|publisher=Euromoney Books|isbn=9781843742005|page=123}}</ref>

====Non-prosecution agreement (NPA) (2006–2008)====
[[File:Epstein Non-Prosecution Agreement and Addendum.pdf|thumb|upright|The controversial non-prosecution agreement]]
In July 2006, the FBI began its own investigation of Epstein, nicknamed "Operation Leap Year".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221404845.html|title=Timeline of the Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case|date=November 28, 2018|website=Miami Herald|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815165036/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221404845.html|archive-date=August 15, 2019|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> It resulted in a 53-page [[indictment]] in June 2007.<ref name=":27"/> [[Alexander Acosta]], then the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida]], agreed to a plea deal, which [[Alan Dershowitz]] helped to negotiate,<ref name="VoxDersh" /> to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges to Epstein, along with four named co-conspirators and any unnamed "potential co-conspirators". According to the ''Miami Herald'', the non-prosecution agreement "essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes". At the time, this halted the investigation and sealed the indictment. The ''Miami Herald'' said: "Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims."<ref name="deal">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Julie K.|author-link=Julie K.

A federal judge later found that the prosecutors had violated the [[Crime Victims' Rights Act|victims' rights]] in that they had concealed the agreement from the victims and instead urged them to have "patience".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-prosecutors-broke-law-deal-sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-n974181|title=Judge: Prosecutors broke law in deal with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Sarah|last2=Winter|first2=Tom|date=February 22, 2019|work=NBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721033031/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-prosecutors-broke-law-deal-sex-offender-jeffrey-epstein-n974181|archive-date=July 21, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=July 21, 2019|last3=Welker|first3=Kristen|last4=Jackson|first4=Hallie|last5=Schapiro|first5=Rich}}</ref><ref name="jta.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/2019/07/11/united-states/alan-dershowitz-helped-jeffrey-epstein-secure-his-controversial-plea-deal-he-has-no-regrets|title=Alan Dershowitz helped Jeffrey Epstein secure his controversial plea deal.

==== Conviction and sentencing (2008–2011) ====
On June 30, 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge (one of two) of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18,<ref name="JonSwaine">{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/13/jeffrey-epstein-donations-us-virgin-islands-review |title = Jeffrey Epstein's donations to young pupils prompts US Virgin Islands review |first = Jon |last = Swaine |work = [[The Guardian]] |location=London, England|date=January 13, 2015|url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161110194357/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/13/jeffrey-epstein-donations-us-virgin-islands-review |archive-date = November 10, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> he was sentenced to 18{{nbsp}}months in prison. While most convicted sex offenders in Florida are sent to state prison, Epstein was instead housed in a private wing of the Palm Beach County Stockade and, according to the sheriff's office, was after {{frac|3|1|2}}{{nbsp}}months allowed to leave the jail on "work release" for up to 12{{nbsp}}hours a day, 6{{nbsp}}days a week. This contravened the sheriff's own policies requiring a maximum remaining sentence of 10{{nbsp}}months and making sex offenders ineligible for the privilege. He was allowed to come and go outside of specified release hours.<ref name="county">{{cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article219494920.html|work=[[Miami Herald]]|first=Julie K.|last=Brown|author-link=Julie K.

Epstein's cell door was left unlocked, and he had access to the attorney room where a television was installed for him, before he was moved to the Stockade's previously unstaffed infirmary. He worked at the office of a foundation he had created shortly before reporting to jail; he dissolved it after he had served his time. The Sheriff's Office received $128,000 from Epstein's non-profit to pay for the costs of extra services being provided during his work release. His office was monitored by "permit deputies" whose overtime was paid by Epstein. They were required to wear suits, and checked in "welcomed guests" at the "front desk". Later the Sheriff's Office said these guest logs were destroyed per the department's "records retention" rules (although inexplicably the Stockade visitor logs were not).<ref name="Rosza">{{cite web|last=Rosza|first=Lori|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/captain-at-jail-where-epstein-served-time-in-2008-ordered-that-his-cell-door-be-left-unlocked/2019/07/19/93e38934-a972-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html|title=For 'client' Jeffrey Epstein, an unlocked cell in a Florida jail|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 19, 2019|access-date=July 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720031830/https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/captain-at-jail-where-epstein-served-time-in-2008-ordered-that-his-cell-door-be-left-unlocked/2019/07/19/93e38934-a972-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html|archive-date=July 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He was allowed to use his own driver to drive him between jail and his office and other appointments.<ref name="county"/><ref name="Rosza"/>

Epstein served almost 13{{nbsp}}months before being released for a year of probation on house arrest until August 2010. While on probation he was allowed numerous trips on his corporate jet to his residences in Manhattan and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. He was allowed long shopping trips and to walk around Palm Beach "for exercise".<ref name="county" />

After a contested hearing in January 2011, and an appeal, he stayed registered in New York State as a "level three" (high risk of repeat offense) [[sex offender]], a lifelong designation.<ref name="Palm Beach">{{cite news |url = http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/jeffrey-epstein-must-register-as-nys-highest-level/nMD5m/ |work = [[Palm Beach Daily News]] |publisher=[[GateHouse Media]]|first = Michele |last = Dargan |title = Jeffrey Epstein must register as NY's highest level sex offender |date = November 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160917021737/http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/jeffrey-epstein-must-register-as-nys-highest-level/nMD5m/ |archive-date = September 17, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="sutherland">{{cite news |last = Sutherland |first = Amber |title = Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator |work = [[New York Post]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing|Tronc]]|date = February 25, 2011 |url = https://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predator/ |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150113112652/http://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predator/ |archive-date = January 13, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>
At that hearing the Manhattan District Attorney argued unsuccessfully that the level should be reduced to a low-risk "level one" and was chided by the judge. Despite opposition from Epstein's lawyer that he had a "main" home in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the judge confirmed he personally must check in with the [[New York Police Department]] every 90{{nbsp}}days. Though Epstein had been a level-three registered sex offender in New York since 2010, the New York Police Department never enforced the 90-day regulation, though non-compliance is a felony.<ref name="jta.org"/>

==== Reactions ====
The immunity agreement and his lenient treatment were the subject of ongoing public dispute. The Palm Beach police chief accused the state of giving him preferential treatment,<ref name=nymag2 /> and the ''Miami Herald'' said U.S. Attorney Acosta gave Epstein "the deal of a lifetime".<ref name = deal/> Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019, on sex trafficking charges, Acosta resigned as [[Secretary of Labor]] effective July 19, 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/alex-acosta-donald-trump-labor-secretary/index.html|title=Acosta resigns amid furor over Epstein plea deal|first1=Maegan|last1=Vazquez|first2=Jim|last2=Acosta|website=[[CNN]]|date=July 12, 2019|access-date=August 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810150215/https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/alex-acosta-donald-trump-labor-secretary/index.html|archive-date=August 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the accusations became public, several persons and institutions returned donations that they had received from Epstein, including [[Eliot Spitzer]], [[Bill Richardson]],<ref name="crimson">{{cite news |first = Nicholas M. |last = Ciarelli |url = https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/9/13/harvard-to-keep-epstein-gift-after/ |title = Harvard to Keep Epstein Gift |work = [[The Harvard Crimson]] |date = September 13, 2006 |access-date = September 13, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027052635/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=514187 |archive-date = October 27, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> and the Palm Beach Police Department.<ref name=beachpost /> [[Harvard University]] announced it would not return any money.<ref name=crimson /> Various charitable donations that Epstein had made to finance children's education were also questioned.<ref name=JonSwaine />

There was a later unsuccessful effort to add Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3) and another woman (Jane Doe 4) as plaintiffs to that case.<ref>{{cite news |first = Philip |last = Sherwell |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11520495/Prince-Andrew-sex-abuse-allegation-thrown-out-by-judge.html |title = Prince Andrew sex abuse allegation thrown out by judge |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London, England|date = April 7, 2015 |access-date = November 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160719173320/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11520495/Prince-Andrew-sex-abuse-allegation-thrown-out-by-judge.html |archive-date = July 19, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The addition accused Alan Dershowitz of sexually abusing a minor, Jane Doe 3, provided by Epstein.<ref name="gerstein">{{cite web |first=Josh|last=Gerstein|url = http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/12/court-filing-levels-sex-claims-at-alan-dershowitz-200495.html |title = Woman who sued convicted billionaire over sex abuse levels claims at his friends |date = December 31, 2014 |work = [[Politico]] |publisher=[[Capitol News Company]]|location=Arlington, Virginia|url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150104085125/http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2014/12/court-filing-levels-sex-claims-at-alan-dershowitz-200495.html |archive-date = January 4, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The allegations against Dershowitz were stricken by the judge and eliminated from the case because he said they were outside the intent of the suit to re-open the plea agreement.<ref name="strike" /><ref>{{cite web |first = Sean P. |last = Murphy |url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/07/judge-drops-dershowitz-from-lawsuit-involving-lurid-allegations/rWS86rVg3zDXMMPrfc50rI/story.html |title = Judge drops Dershowitz from lawsuit involving 'lurid' allegations |work = [[The Boston Globe]] |date = April 7, 2015 |access-date = November 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161022205507/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/04/07/judge-drops-dershowitz-from-lawsuit-involving-lurid-allegations/rWS86rVg3zDXMMPrfc50rI/story.html |archive-date = October 22, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> A document filed in court alleges that Epstein ran a "[[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|sexual abuse ring]]", and lent underage girls to "prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders".<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/jeffrey-epstein-rise-and-fall-of-teacher-turned-tycoon |title = Jeffrey Epstein: the rise and fall of teacher turned tycoon |first = Paul |last = Lewis |work = [[The Guardian]] |location=London, England|url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161126103523/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/jeffrey-epstein-rise-and-fall-of-teacher-turned-tycoon |archive-date = November 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all |date = January 4, 2015 }}</ref>

====''Virginia Roberts Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell'' (2015)====
As a result of Giuffre's allegations and Maxwell's comments about them, Giuffre sued Maxwell for [[defamation]] in September 2015. After much legal confrontation, the case was settled [[under seal]] in May 2017. The ''Miami Herald'', other media, and Alan Dershowitz filed to have the documents about the settlement unsealed. After the judge dismissed their request, the matter was appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].<ref name="CNBC_20190809">{{cite news | first1=Dan | last1=Mangan | first2=Kevin | last2=Breuninger | title=Court releases documents about Jeffrey Epstein, accused in sex traffic case, and his alleged procurer Ghislaine Maxwell | website=[[CNBC]] | date=August 9, 2019 | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/documents-released-about-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine-maxwell.html | access-date=August 10, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809231903/https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/documents-released-about-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine-maxwell.html | archive-date=August 9, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On March 11, 2019, in the appeal of the district judge's refusal to unseal the documents relating to the 2017 defamation settlement of ''Giuffre v. Maxwell'', the Second Circuit Court gave parties one week to provide good cause as to why they should remain under seal, without which they would be unsealed on March 19, 2019. Later the Court ordered these documents to be unsealed (after having them redacted to protect innocent parties). In Giuffre's testimony, she claims that she was "directed" by Maxwell to give erotic massages and engage in sexual activities with [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]]; [[Jean-Luc Brunel]]; [[Glenn Dubin]]; [[Marvin Minsky]]; Governor [[Bill Richardson]]; another unnamed prince; an unnamed foreign president; "a well known Prime Minister"; and an unnamed hotel chain owner from France, among others.<ref name="DailyBeast8-19">{{cite news |last1=Briquelet |first1=Kate |last2=Baker |first2=Katie |last3=Miller |first3=Justin |last4=Melendez |first4=Pilar |last5=Connor |first5=Tracy |title=Jeffrey Epstein Accuser Names Powerful Men in Alleged Sex Ring |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-unsealed-documents-name-powerful-men-in-sex-ring |accessdate=August 10, 2019 |work=The Daily Beast |date=August 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190810011802/https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-unsealed-documents-name-powerful-men-in-sex-ring |archive-date=August 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The deposition does not claim that any of these men in fact engaged with Giuffre, and {{asof|August 2019|lc=y}}, none of these men have been indicted or sued for related sex crimes.<ref name="DailyBeast8-19" /> Giuffre testified, "my whole life revolved around just pleasing these men and keeping Ghislaine and Jeffrey happy.

On August 9, less than 24 hours before Epstein's death, 2,000 pages of previously sealed documents from the case were released. Two sets of additional sealed documents will be analyzed by a federal judge to determine whether they should also be made public. A "John Doe" asked the judge on September 3 to permanently keep the documents secret, claiming "unproven allegations of impropriety" could damage his reputation, though he had no evidence his name was included.<ref name="BloombergJohnDoe">{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Erik |title='John Doe' Wants to Keep Documents Sealed in Epstein Suit |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-03/-john-doe-asks-judge-to-keep-documents-sealed-in-epstein-suit |date=September 3, 2019 |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=September 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204232351/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-03/-john-doe-asks-judge-to-keep-documents-sealed-in-epstein-suit |archive-date=December 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== ''Jane Doe v. Epstein and Trump'' (2016) ====
{{Main|List of lawsuits involving Donald Trump}}{{Main|Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations}}
A federal lawsuit filed in California in April 2016, against Epstein and [[Donald Trump]] by a California woman alleged that the two men sexually assaulted her at a series of parties at Epstein's Manhattan residence in 1994, when she was 13{{nbsp}}years old. The suit was dismissed by a federal judge in May 2016 because it did not raise valid claims under federal law. The woman filed another federal suit in New York in June 2016, but it was withdrawn three months later, apparently without being served on the defendants. A third federal suit was filed in New York in September 2016. {{fact|date=July 2020}}

The two latter suits included affidavits by an anonymous witness who attested to the accusations in the suits, asserting Epstein employed her to [[procuring (prostitution)|procure]] underage girls for him, and an anonymous person who declared the plaintiff had told him/her about the assaults at the time they occurred.

So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and a view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world.

Epstein rented multiple apartment units for his employees, models, and guests since the 1990s at 301 East 66th Street. The majority of the apartment complex at this address is owned by Ossa properties, which is owned by Jeffrey Epstein's brother, Mark, who purchased the complex in the early 1990s from Wexner. Over the years Epstein has housed different friends at 11 East 71st Street, including his ex-girlfriend Eva Andersson, who is now married to his hedge-fund friend [[Glenn Dubin]], MC2 Models founder Jean-Luc Brunel, and on occasions former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]. He has housed some of his workers, including his pilot, housekeeper and office work staff, in the apartment complex. Epstein has also housed [[Minor (law)|underage girls]], who Brunel scouted for his MC2 modeling agency.<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="auto" /> On August 6, 2012, a model and party promoter associated with MC2, Pedro Gaspar, who lived above another of the modeling agency's locations in Manhattan, died of what some consider to be a suspicious drug overdose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/13/the-dead-model-and-the-dirty-billionaire|title=The Dead Model and the Dirty Billionaire|first=M.

===Political donations===
From 1989 until 2003, Epstein donated more than $139,000 to [[U.S. Democratic Party]] federal candidates and committees and over $18,000 to [[U.S. Republican Party]] candidates and groups.<ref>{{cite web | first=Grace | last=Haley | title=Billionaire sex offender Epstein gave heavily to Democrats, until he didn't | work=OpenSecrets News | date=December 4, 2018 | url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/12/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-gave-heavily/ | access-date=July 12, 2019 | quote=From 1989 up until 2003, Epstein donated more than $139,000 to Democratic federal candidates and committees and over $18,000 to Republican candidates and groups, according to data from OpenSecrets.

Epstein contributed $50,000 to Democrat [[Bill Richardson]]'s successful campaign for [[Governor of New Mexico]] in 2002 and again for his successful run for reelection in 2006. Also that year, he contributed $15,000 to Democrat [[Gary King (politician)|Gary King]]'s successful campaign for [[Attorney General of New Mexico]]. He later contributed $35,000 to King's 2014 unsuccessful campaign for Governor. Other contributions in New Mexico included Epstein $10,000 toward [[Jim Baca]]'s campaign to become head of the land commission and $2,000 toward [[Santa Fe County]] Sheriff Jim Solano's bid for reelection. In 2010, Epstein received a notice from [[New Mexico Department of Public Safety]] which said, "You are not required to register [as a sex offender] with the state of [[New Mexico]]." This was in contravention of federal law, which would seem to say that the conviction in Florida required him to register in New Mexico.<ref>{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Daly | title=Epstein Seen With Young Girls as He Shopped for 'Baby Ranch' in New Mexico | work=DailyBeast | date=August 6, 2019 | url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-new-mexicans-saw-young-girls-with-him-as-he-shopped-for-his-baby-ranch | access-date=July 12, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806131810/https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-new-mexicans-saw-young-girls-with-him-as-he-shopped-for-his-baby-ranch | archive-date=August 6, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The true extent of Epstein's donations is unknown. The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation fails to disclose information which other charities routinely disclose. Concerns have been raised over this lack of transparency. In 2015, the [[Attorney General of New York|Attorney General of the state of New York]] was reported to be trying to gain information but was refused since the charities were based outside of the state and did not solicit in [[New York State]].<ref>{{cite news | first=David |last=Ingram |date=March 5, 2015 |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/06/us-epstein-charity-idUSKBN0M200V20150306 |title = Exclusive: New York attorney general seeks information on financier Epstein's philanthropy |work= Reuters |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006071823/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/06/us-epstein-charity-idUSKBN0M200V20150306 |archive-date = October 6, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Epstein, besides making donations through the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, also made a number of charitable donations through his three private charities: Epstein Interest, the COUQ Foundation, and Gratitude American Ltd.

===Interest in eugenics and transhumanism===
According to various sources, beginning in the early 2000s Epstein developed a strong interest in improving the human race through [[genetic engineering]] and [[artificial intelligence]], including using his own sperm. He addressed the scientific community at various events and occasions and communicated his fascination with [[eugenics]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/jeffrey-epstein-eugenics.html|title=Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA|last1=Stewart|first1=James B.|date=July 31, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 1, 2019|last2=Goldstein|first2=Jacob|last3=Silver-Greenberg|first3=Jessica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731235929/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/jeffrey-epstein-eugenics.html|archive-date=July 31, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was reported in August 2019 that Epstein had planned to "seed the human race with his [[DNA]]" by impregnating up to 20 women at a time using his New Mexico compound as a "baby ranch", where mothers would give birth to his offspring.

[[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]], director of the [[Annenberg Public Policy Center]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] said: "Scientists need funding for important work ... if the funding is for legitimate scientific work, there is nothing wrong with accepting support from a billionaire. However it would have been wrong for scientists to accept his funding if they were aware that he was planning a eugenics experiment that might draw legitimacy from his association with them." Professor [[George M. Church|George Church]] also publicly apologized for meeting Epstein after his 13-month sentence, saying "There should have been more conversations about, should we be doing this, should we be helping this guy? There was just a lot of nerd [[Tunnel vision (metaphor)|tunnel vision]]."<ref name="Millward" />

Among the bones broken in Epstein's neck was the [[hyoid bone]]. Such breaks of the hyoid bone can occur from those who hang themselves, but they are more common in victims of [[homicide]] by strangulation. A 2010 study found broken hyoids in one-fourth of cases of hangings, and a larger study conducted from 2010 to 2016 found hyoid damage in just 16 of 264 cases, or six percent of cases of hangings. Hyoid bone breaks are more common in older individuals, as the bones become more brittle upon reaching middle age.<ref name=":38">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-jeffrey-epsteins-neck-deepening-questions-around-his-death/2019/08/14/d09ac934-bdd9-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html|title=Autopsy finds broken bones in Jeffrey Epstein's neck, deepening questions around his death|last1=Leonnig|first1=Carol|date=August 14, 2019|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=August 14, 2019|last2=Davis|first2=Aaron|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815044336/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-jeffrey-epsteins-neck-deepening-questions-around-his-death/2019/08/14/d09ac934-bdd9-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html|archive-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Forensic pathologist]] [[Cyril Wecht]] noted that hanging by leaning forward would not result in broken cervical bones.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wecht |first1=Cyril |title=Jeffrey Epstein's death ruled suicide by hanging |url=https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/jeffrey-epsteins-death-ruled-suicide-by-hanging |website=Fox |accessdate=August 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821061031/https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/jeffrey-epsteins-death-ruled-suicide-by-hanging |archive-date=August 21, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
