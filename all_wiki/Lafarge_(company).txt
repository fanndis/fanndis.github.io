'''Lafarge S.A.''' was a [[France|French]] industrial company specialising in three major products: [[cement]], [[construction aggregate]]s, and [[concrete]]. It was founded in 1833 by Joseph-Auguste Pavin de Lafarge. On 10 July 2015, Lafarge merged with [[Holcim]], a Swiss cement company. On 15 July, the new company was officially launched around the globe under the name of [[LafargeHolcim]], creating a new leader in the building materials sector.<ref name="uk.reuters.com">{{cite web|title=A New Leader for a New World: LafargeHolcim Officially Launched around the Globe|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/15/lafargeholcim-idUKnBw146823a+100+BSW20150715?type=companyNews|website=Reuters}}</ref>

==History==
===Foundation and development===
Lafarge was founded in 1833<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.lafarge.com/wps/portal/1_6_1-Dates-cles|title=Lafarge - Transcript of: Timeline: history of Lafarge}}</ref> by  Joseph-Auguste Pavin de Lafarge in Le Teil ([[Ardèche]]), to exploit the limestone quarry in [[Mont Saint-Victor]] between [[Le Teil]] and [[Viviers, Ardèche|Viviers]]. The limestone is white and [[argillaceous]], and yielded an eminently [[hydraulic lime]].

[[File:Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone, Hérault 05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Villeneuve-lès-Maguelone]]]]
In 1864 Lafarge signed its first international contract for the delivery of 110,000 tonnes of lime to the [[Suez Canal]] construction project.<ref name="history" /> 
In 1980 Lafarge joined with the Belgian coal, coke and fertilizer company Coppée to become SA Lafarge Coppée.

Lafarge purchased a plant from the [[National Gypsum]] in early 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatnerd.com/pictures/fleet/jawiglehart.htm |title=J.A.W.

In 1999, Lafarge acquired 100% shareholding in [[Hima Cement Limited]], the second-largest cement manufacturer in [[Uganda]], with installed capacity of 850,000 metric tonnes annually, as of January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in2eastafrica.net/hima-cement-expands-factory/|title=Hima Cement Expands Factory|access-date=2011-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723155528/http://in2eastafrica.net/hima-cement-expands-factory/|archive-date=2011-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>
In 1999, Lafarge entered the Indian market through its cement business,with the acquisition of Tata Steel's cement activity. This acquisition was followed by the purchase of the Raymond Cement facility in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lafarge.in|title=Lafarge in India - Cement, concrete, aggregates}}</ref>  
In 2001, Lafarge, then the world's second largest cement manufacturer, acquired [[Blue Circle Industries]] (BCI), which at the time was the world's sixth largest cement manufacturer, to become the world leader in cement manufacturing.<ref name="history" />

In 2006, Lafarge North America shareholders accepted a $3 billion tender offer from Lafarge Group which gave the parent company full control over the North American business, removing LNA from the New York Stock Exchange.  Previously the group had owned 53% of LNA shares.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/12/AR2006021201002_pf.html|title=Jerry Knight - French Parent Targets Huge but Little-Known Lafarge North America}}</ref>

In 2007, it divested its roofing division, selling it to a private equity group in a deal that resulted in Lafarge retaining a 35% equity stake.<ref name="history" />

In December 2007, Lafarge announced the purchase of the Orascom Cement Group, an Egyptian-based cement producer with operations across Africa and the Middle East, from [[Orascom Construction Industries (OCI)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3bf1310e-a6f0-11dc-a25a-0000779fd2ac.html|title=Subscribe to read}}</ref>

===Merger with Holcim===
{{main|LafargeHolcim}}
On 7 April 2014, Lafarge and Holcim announced they had agreed to terms on a "merger of equals".<ref>{{cite news|title=Holcim Agrees To Merge With Lafarge|date=April 7, 2014|work=Bloomberg TV India |url=http://www.btvin.com/videos/watch/6607/holcim-agrees-to-merge-with-lafarge}}</ref> The exchange ratio will be based on 9 Holcim shares for 10 Lafarge shares.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lafarge, Holcim, CRH shares rise as merger saved|work=Financial Times|date=March 20, 2015|url=http://www.ft.com/fastft/296113/lafarge-holcim-crh-shares-rise-merger-saved}}</ref> The new company would be based in Switzerland and have a manufacturing capacity of 427 million tons a year would vastly exceed the 227 million ton capacity [[Anhui Conch]], the current industry leader in that category.<ref name=hurdles />

The deal will face significant regulatory obstacles, as 15 different jurisdictions could potentially raise objections. The cement market in Europe is already tightly consolidated and antitrust scrutiny of deals has been commonplace since the 1970s.<ref name=hurdles />  To meet regulatory concerns, Holcim and Lafarge plan to sell or spinoff assets that generated about 5 billion euros (US$6.9 billion) of revenue in 2013 in areas of large overlap between the two companies.<ref name=form /> Lafont said the merger was aimed at rebalancing operations, not cutting costs.  He said overlapping businesses would be sold, not closed, so industry job losses would be minimal.<ref name=hurdles />

Industry analysts said the deal would combine Holcim's marketing strength with Lafarge's edge in innovation, while providing significant cost savings, but cautioned "the road to merger clearance will be a long, complex and uncertain one."<ref name=create>{{cite news|title=Holcim, Lafarge agree to merger to create cement giant|author=Natalie Huet|author2=Caroline Copley|date=April 7, 2014|agency=Reuters|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/04/07/lafarge-holcim-idINDEEA3607P20140407|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>  Others said the deal could lead to further mergers within the industry and give competitors a chance to pick up assets at a bargain price.<ref name=form>{{cite news|title=Holcim to Merge With Lafarge to Form Biggest Cement Maker|author=Patrick Winters|author2=Francois de Beaupuy|date=April 7, 2014|work=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-07/holcim-to-merge-with-lafarge-to-form-biggest-cement-maker.html|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>  Most analysts surveyed by [[Reuters]] felt the merger would be approved in the end.<ref name=create />

The acquisition, will turn it into the world's third-biggest building materials supplier. Analysts said that although it was broadly anticipated by the market. "The additional assets expand the company’s footprint in Eastern Europe and into Brazil and the Philippines. Given the well flagged nature of the deal however, these benefits are largely reflected in the price at current levels," Alan Breen of Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland said.

On 10 July 2015, Lafarge merged with [[Holcim]], a Swiss cement company. On 15 July 2015, the new company was officially launched around the globe under the name of [[LafargeHolcim]], creating a new leader in the Building Materials sector.<ref name="uk.reuters.com"/>

== Controversies ==

=== Terrorist financing ===
In June 2016, France opened an inquiry into the Syrian activities of the construction. The inquiry followed reports by French journalist Dorothée Myriam Kellou, published by Le Monde and FRANCE 24, which uncovered the deals Lafarge made with an array of armed groups, including the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] terrorist group, in order to keep the cement plant operating.

===Environmental concerns===
[[File:Lafarge, ZI Horizon Sud, Frontignan, Hérault 01.jpg|thumb|Cement plant in [[Frontignan]], [[France]].]]

On 11 July 2008, the [[Albany Times Union]] reported that Lafarge's [[Ravena, New York]] plant "was the greatest source of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions in New York from 2004 to 2006" <ref name="TU2008a">{{cite web |url=http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=702460 |title=Update at Ravena Cement Plant to Clean Air |accessdate=2008-07-29 |publisher=Albany Times Union}}</ref> According to the story, plans have been made to upgrade the plant to reduce the mercury emissions. A second story, published the following day, stated that the factory had emitted 400 pounds (181&nbsp;kg) of mercury annually from 2004 to 2006.<ref name="TU2008b">{{cite web |url=https://www.timesunion.com/archives/secure/docheckout.asp?action=Get+Doc+Tag&dblist=TX2008_ALBANYTU&tagnum=200807240221&papid=albanytu&suffixes=false&synonyms=false&thesfile=savesufx.fth&view=rtemplate&templatetype=legacy&outputtype=DOCXSLT |title=Update at Ravena Cement Plant to Clean Air |accessdate=2008-07-29 |publisher=Albany Times Union}}</ref>
In November 2010 Lafarge, together along with other companies, opposes new EPA regulations that require mercury-emissions reductions at cement plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicnewsservice.org/index.php?/content/article/16878-1|title=NY Plant at Heart of Cement-Making Air Pollution Battle}}</ref> Preliminary data published by the EPA for the year 2009 showed 145 pounds of mercury were recorded for the Ravena plant (total on- and off-site disposals).

In July 2013, the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH), in partnership with the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, completed a public health assessment for communities near the Lafarge Cement Plant in Ravena, New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/investigations/lafarge/|title=Lafarge Cement Plant|website=www.health.ny.gov}}</ref>

Major findings and results from the NYS DOH Lafarge Cement Plant Health Assessment:
*Breathing the ground-level air concentrations of metals (e.g., mercury), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[lead]], [[particulate matter]], [[dioxin]]s, [[furan]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[ammonia]] released in cement kiln stack emissions is not expected to harm people's health.
*For the general public, breathing ground-level air concentrations of [[sulfur dioxide]] or [[nitrogen dioxide]] released in the kiln stack emissions is not expected to harm people's health.
*Touching, breathing or accidentally eating dust that originated from the Ravena cement plant and other sources is not expected to harm the health of people who reside, work, or attend school in the community.
*Current health status of the communities near the cement plant is similar to the health status of other areas in the region and state.
On 23 July 2013, under an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Justice and the state of New York, Lafarge North America Inc. agreed to fund $1.5 million in projects to reduce air pollution in the community surrounding its Ravena, New York cement plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/2e777a3c07b77bca85257bb1005a98cf!opendocument|title=07/23/2013: Lafarge North America Inc. Agrees to Environmental Projects as Part of Clean Air Act Agreement|website=yosemite.epa.gov}}</ref> The agreement also amends a March 2010 consent decree that the federal Environmental Protection Agency, New York and 11 other states entered into with Lafarge requiring the company to limit pollutant emissions from its 13 plants nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/press/92539.html|title=A.G. Schneiderman & DEC Commissioner Martens Announce Continuing Air Pollution Reductions - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov}}</ref>

Under the agreement, Lafarge North America will adhere to an updated schedule that provides Lafarge an additional 18 months to finish construction of a new modernized facility by 1 July 2016. At that time, the existing Ravena plant - which remains in compliance with all current environmental requirements - will be taken offline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lafarge-na.com/wps/portal/na/en/1_8_1-Latest_NewsDetail?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connectlib_na/Site_na/AllPR/PressRelease_1384871431435/PR_Header|title=Press Room < About Us: Lafarge}}</ref>

Lafarge's $300 million upgrade to its Ravena plant includes a new, German-designed dry-process [[cement kiln]] that will replace two 50-year-old wet-process kilns. The new kiln will use less coal and emit fewer pollutants, including a 66% reduction in mercury emissions, while increasing production capacity. It will also take less water from the [[Hudson River]], getting most of its water from the nearby limestone quarry that feeds the plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/tuplus-business/article/New-less-polluting-cement-plant-rises-in-Ravena-6673902.php|title=New, less-polluting cement plant rises in Ravena}}</ref>

Details of the agreement include that Lafarge North America will: 
*Invest $1.5 million in projects benefiting the local environment;
*Make additional improvements to the environmental infrastructure at the existing Ravena plant;
*Adopt new, stricter emission limits for SO2 and mercury; and
*Set a strict, new timetable complete the Ravena plant modernization project.

In July 2019, the company filed a request for a permit with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks to increase the amount of water it moves from its gravel pits near [[Guelph]] in [[Wellington County, Ontario]], Canada into the local watershed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ero.ontario.ca/index.php/notice/019-0240#proponent(s) |title=Lafarge Canada Inc. - Permit to take water Instrument type: Permit to take water |website=Environmental Registry of Ontario |date=4 July 2019 }}</ref> According to a news report, "If it’s approved, the company would be permitted to take up to 27.7 million litres of water a day — more than half of the city’s average daily demand of 47 million litres" but a City of Guelph report stated that it would "add a groundwater water-taking of 21,718 m3/day to the existing permit". The company was already permitted to take just over six million litres per day. According to a Lefarge spokesperson, the company's plan was actually to move the water from the quarry and pump into nearby wetlands or the Speed River, not to take water from the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/9558617-lafarge-water-taking-request-is-the-largest-guelph-has-seen/ |title=Lafarge water-taking request is the largest Guelph has seen |website=guelphmercury.com |date=22 August 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://guelph.ca/2019/08/information-about-the-citys-plans-to-provide-comment-on-lafarge-canadas-permit-to-take-water-application/ |title=Information about the City’s plans to provide comment on LaFarge Canada’s water-taking application |website=guelph.ca |date=12 August 2019 }}</ref> The Wellington Water Watchers lobby group expressed concern about how the discharged water might affect aquatic ecosystems downstream and believed that a full environmental review was necessary before the request for the permit should be allowed. "With climate change, there's all kinds of uncertainties that come into our long-term water security issues and we can no longer afford to play fast and loose with that", said the group's chair Robert Case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/9489964-lafarge-canada-looking-to-expand-quarry-operations-near-guelph/ |title=Lafarge Canada looking to expand quarry operations near Guelph |website=guelphmercury.com |date=5 July 2019 }}</ref>

==Nature Reserves==
Lafarge also own several nature reserves. An example of this is Brandon Marsh,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.rugby.gov.uk/fastweb_upload/Planning%20Scanned%20Applications/R14-2179/4.0%20Design%20and%20Access%20Statement.pdf|title=Rugby Design and Access Statement}}</ref> in the UK, which is on an old quarry and an existing quarry is next door to it. Another example is the LaCouronne plant in France. It was never quarried but Lafarge bought some land and began to convert it into a 16.5 hectare nature reserve. Other nature reserves are Eardington Nature Reserve; Shropshire (UK), Medway Nature Reserve; Kent (UK) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.agg-net.com/news/lafarge-tarmac-renew-medway-nature-reserve-lease|title=Lafarge Tarmac renew Medway Nature Reserve lease &#124; Agg-Net|website=www.agg-net.com}}</ref> and NWT Besthorpe Nature Reserve; Trent Vale (UK). They own other nature reserves.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
