'''Jonathan King''' (born '''Kenneth George King''', 6 December 1944) is an English singer-songwriter, record producer, music entrepreneur, and former television and radio presenter. He first came to prominence in 1965 when "[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]", a song that he wrote and sang while still an undergraduate, achieved chart success.<ref name=Eder/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in 2002 that he had sold over 40 million records in his career.<ref name="ronson_fall" /> As an independent producer, he discovered and named [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] in 1967, producing their first album ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]''. He founded his own label, [[UK Records]] in 1972. He released and produced songs for [[10cc]] and the [[Bay City Rollers]]. In the 1970s King became known for hits that he performed and/or produced under different names, including "[[Johnny Reggae]]", "[[Loop di Love]]", "[[Sugar, Sugar]]", "[[It Only Takes a Minute]]", "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]" and "[[Paloma Blanca|Una Paloma Blanca]]"; between September 1971 and 1972 alone he produced 10 [[UK Singles Chart|top 30 singles]] in the UK.<ref name=BillboardSept1972>"King Forms U.K. Records," ''Billboard'', 9 September 1972, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4icEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32 32].</ref> [[Rod Liddle]] described him as someone who could "storm the pop charts at will, under a hundred different disguises".<ref>Liddle, Rod (11 April 2010). [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/rod_liddle/article7094203.ece "McLaren was no cultural genius just a lucky punk"], ''The Sunday Times''. London.</ref>

While living in New York in the 1980s, King appeared on radio and television in the UK, including on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Entertainment USA]]''. In the early 1990s he produced the [[Brit Awards]], and from 1995 he selected and produced the British entries for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], including the winning entry in 1997, "[[Love Shine a Light]]" by [[Katrina and the Waves]].<ref name=BBC24Nov2000/>

In September 2001, King was convicted of [[Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom|child sexual abuse]] and sentenced to seven years in prison, for having sexually assaulted five boys, aged 14 and 15, in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/nov/21/childprotection.society |title=Jonathan King jailed for child sex abuse |date=21 November 2001 |work=The Guardian |location= London}}</ref> In November 2001 he was acquitted of 22 similar charges.<ref name=apology /> He was released on parole in March 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4388913.stm "Jonathan King freed from prison"], BBC News, 29 March 2005.</ref> A further trial for sexual offences against teenage boys resulted in several not guilty verdicts and the trial being abandoned in June 2018.<ref name = "2018_trial" /><ref name= "finkelstein">{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Finkelstein |url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/trials-of-jonathan-king-should-worry-us-all-795ct8f79 |title=Trials of Jonathan King should worry us all |newspaper=The Times |location= London |date=15 August 2018 |access-date=25 August 2018}}{{subscription}}</ref>

==Early life==

===Family background===
[[File:Brookhurst Grange, Ewhurst, Surrey (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|Brookhurst Grange, [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]]]
King was born in a nursing home in Bentinck Street, [[Marylebone]], London, the first child of Jimmy King (d. 1954) and his wife, Ailsa Linley Leon (1916–2007), a former actress.<ref>[http://www.kingofhits.co.uk/component/option,com_gallery2/Itemid,64/?g2_itemId=472 "Ailsa Linley"], www.kingofhits.co.uk; King, Jonathan (2009). ''65 My Life So Far'', London: Revvolution Publishing Ltd., chs.&nbsp;1, 25.</ref> Originally from New Jersey, Jimmy King had moved to England when he was 14. He attended [[Oundle School]] and Trinity College, Cambridge, before joining the [[American Field Service]] during World War II and later [[Tootal]] Ties and Shirts as managing director.<ref name=King2/>

King's birth was a [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps delivery]] and a muscle on his upper lip was affected during it, giving him his slightly crooked smile.<ref name=King1>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;1.</ref><ref name=Chalmers22April2012/> After he was born, the family lived in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, then moved to Surrey, where King and his younger brothers, James and Anthony ("Andy"), were raised in Brookhurst Grange, a mansion near [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]].<ref name=King1/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kingofhits.co.uk/index.php?option=com_gallery2&Itemid=64&g2_itemId=899 |title=Brookhurst Grange Ewhurst Surrey| publisher = kingofhits.co.uk |author=King, Jonathan |access-date=12 May 2012}}</ref>

===Stoke House and Charterhouse===
King was sent to boarding school, first as a weekly boarder to pre-prep school in [[Hindhead]], Surrey, then, when he was eight, to Stoke House Preparatory School in [[Seaford, East Sussex]].<ref name=King2>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;2.</ref> A year later, in 1954, after his father died from a heart attack, Brookhurst Grange was sold and the family moved to Cobbetts, a cottage in nearby [[Abinger|Forest Green]].<ref name=King3>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;3.</ref>

Music became his passion around this time. King would save his pocket money for train trips to London to watch ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[Irma La Douce (musical)|Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'', ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' and ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'' from the cheap seats in the balcony. He also discovered pop music and bought his first single, [[Guy Mitchell]]'s "[[Singing the Blues]]" (1956).<ref name=King3/><ref name=King4>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;4.</ref>

In 1958 King became a boarder at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] in [[Godalming]], Surrey. He wrote that he "loved Charterhouse immediately", with its history and "every possible area of encouragement from sport to intellectual pursuits." Unlike at Stoke House, there were other boys there who appreciated pop music. He bought a [[transistor radio]] and earphones and joined the "under the bedclothes" club, listening to [[Tony Hall (music executive)|Tony Hall]], [[Jimmy Savile]], Don Moss and [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]] on [[Radio Luxembourg]], and keeping track of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' charts.<ref name=King4/> The music, particularly [[Buddy Holly]], [[Adam Faith]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Gene Pitney]], made him "ache with desire":

<blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;">
Since "[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]" swept me off my feet, I had become a raving pop addict, desperate for a fix every few seconds. I kept thick notebooks packed with copies of the weekly charts, adverts for new products, pages of predictions of future hits, reviews and comments about current artistes. Looking at them now, there was no way I could ever have avoided a future in the music industry.<ref name=King4/></blockquote>

===Gap year===
King left Charterhouse in 1962 to attend Davies's, a London [[Cram school|crammer]], for his [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A level]]s. With his wages from a job stacking shelves in a supermarket, he made a demo of himself the following year singing "[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]" and "Fool's Paradise" [[Shane Fenton|Eden Kane song]] with the Ted Taylor Trio, a professional group in [[Rickmansworth]].<ref name=King6/> Wearing a pinstripe suit and trainers, he approached [[John Schroeder (musician)|John Schroeder]] of [[Oriole Records (UK)|Oriole Records]] and told him he could make a hit record. "I have been studying the music industry for the last three years and it is one big joke," Schroeder reported him as saying. "Anyone can make it if they're clever and can fool a few people." After hearing King's demo, Schroeder booked a studio session with an orchestra but suspected that King could not sing in tune.<ref>Schroeder, John (2016). ''All for the Love of Music'', Matador, 66–68.</ref>

King also joined a local band in [[Cranleigh]], the Bumblies, as manager/producer and occasional singer, sometimes wearing thigh-length boots and long black gloves, during the band's appearances at birthday parties and similar.<ref name=King6>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;6.</ref>

Despite the cramming, King failed the scholarship exam for [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], but he was offered a place in 1963 after an interview.<ref name=King6/> He accepted, but first took a [[gap year]] and spent six months travelling with a [[round-the-world ticket]] from his mother. Staying mostly in youth hostels, he visited Greece, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and the United States, including Hawaii, where, in June 1964, he met the manager of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], [[Brian Epstein]]. They spent hours together in Honolulu discussing the music industry, King wrote.<ref name=King7>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;7.</ref><ref name=PA29March2005>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/29/ukcrime.childprotection1 |title=The rise and fall of a pop tsar |agency=Press Association |date=29 March 2005}}</ref>{{efn|For June 1964: King flew to Hawaii a week after booking himself into the [[Southern Cross Hotel]] in Melbourne, where the Beatles were staying.

 |description  = "Everyone's Gone to the Moon" was written and performed by King while he was at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]}}
Around the time King began at Cambridge, the Bumblies (featuring Terry Ward) recorded a song he had written and produced, "Gotta Tell", which King persuaded [[Fontana Records]] to release. It appeared in April 1965 and "rightly sank without trace", King writes, but the experience of taking it from label to label, and then trying to find people to play it, taught him how to promote a record. He called DJs and television producers to ask them to listen to it and, because it was Easter, delivered hundreds of vinyl singles to music critics complete with Easter eggs he had painted himself.<ref name="King6"/> King and the Bumblies recorded another of his songs, "All You've Gotta Do", with producer [[Joe Meek]], but nothing came of it.<ref name=King7/><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY1UGtXFRIE&t=8m0s "The Joe Meek Story"], 8 February 1991, 00:08:02.</ref>

Keen to break into the music business, King contacted [[Tony Hall (music executive)|Tony Hall]] of [[Decca Records]], who put him in touch with the [[Zombies]]' producers Ken Jones and Joe Roncoroni. King played them one of his songs, "Green is the Grass", and they asked him to write a [[A-side and B-side|B side]]. He offered them six songs, including "[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]", which became the A side. They also suggested he change his name.<ref name=King8>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;8.</ref>

Decca released "[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]" in August 1965.<ref name=Lazell/> Relying on the contacts he had made while promoting "Gotta Tell", King plugged it relentlessly to radio stations to get it on their playlists. DJ Tony Windsor of [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], a [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate station]] broadcast from the ''[[USS Density (AM-218)|MV Galaxy]]'', was the first to play it, not only once, but three times in a row. (Windsor later said he did this only because of a problem with his other turntable.) It sold 26,000 copies the next day.<ref>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;9.</ref>

When the song made number 18 in the charts, King was invited onto the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The following day it sold 35,000 copies.<ref>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;9; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=traW5spkJs8 "Everyone's Gone to the Moon"], ''Top of the Pops'', BBC, 1965.</ref> It peaked at number four in the UK (the Beatles were at number one with "[[Help!

From his second year at university, King split his time between Cambridge and London, moving into a three-bedroom apartment, owned by his mother, at 20 St Andrews Mansions, [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]], [[Marylebone]], driving there from classes in his white [[MGB GT]].<ref>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', chs.&nbsp;2, 9.</ref> His next release, "Green is the Grass", flopped, but the third (which he wrote and produced, but did not perform), "[[It's Good News Week]]" by [[Hedgehoppers Anonymous]], was a hit.

Ltd, which was named after King, Ken Jones and Joe Roncoroni and based in Jones' and Roncoroni's office at 37 [[Soho Square]].<ref>[[:File:Its Good News Week.jpg]], image courtesy of Wikipedia</ref><ref>[https://www.discogs.com/label/230005-Jonjo-Music-Ltd "JonJo Music Ltd"], Discogs.

Also in 1965, King began contributing a column to ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc and Music Echo]]'', a weekly magazine edited by [[Ray Coleman]]. King adopted a deliberately provocative style, promoting new acts but also publishing criticism of the music industry and particular artists.<ref name=King10>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;10.</ref> [[Michael Wale]] described him as "the butterfly who stamped its foot".<ref>Vale, Michael (1972). ''VoxPop'', Larousse Harrap Publishers, 78.</ref>

===Discovery of Genesis===
In early 1967, King attended an old boys' reunion at Charterhouse. He said he went there to show off, "oust[ing] [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden Powell]] as their most famous Old Boy."<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). ''Turn It On Again'', Hal Leonard Corporation, 11.</ref> When they heard he was going to be there, a school band recorded a demo tape for him, and a friend, John Alexander, left the [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] in King's car with a note, "These are Charterhouse boys. Have a listen".<ref>Rutherford, Mike (2014). ''The Living Years'', Constable, 45.</ref><ref name="Banks2007pp27–28"/> Calling themselves [[Anon (band)|Anon]], the band consisted at that point of [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], [[Anthony Phillips]], [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]] and [[Mike Rutherford]], then all aged 15 to 17.<ref name=Welch>Welch, Chris (1995). ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Genesis''.

King liked several songs such as "She is Beautiful" (which became "The Serpent" on the band's first album) and, according to Philips, they got the deal with King on the basis of that song. King signed the band to JonJo Music and licensed the short-term rights to Decca Records. He paid them £40 for four songs, and came up with their name, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], to mark the start of his own career as a record producer.<ref name="Banks2007pp27–28">Banks, Tony, et al. (2007). "Charterhouse (1963–1968)," in Philip Dodd (ed.), ''Genesis: Chapter and Verse'', St. Martin's Griffin, 27–28.</ref><ref name=Welch/> According to Phillips, King was "hugely patient and indulgent" with the band.<ref name="Banks2007pp27–28"/> [[John Silver (musician)|John Silver]], drummer on the first album, wrote in 2007:

<blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;">
We would be pretending to rehearse or simply waiting around and somehow somebody would bring a message to the flat, "Quick, get over to Jonathan King's flat, because [[Paul McCartney]]'s turning up." We would scurry over as quickly as possible because the art was to be there, looking casual, before the next famous person arrived, so that Jonathan King could say, "Hey, these are my new protégés." I trusted him as a god, because he knew these people. It wasn't celebrity like it is now. There were only a few famous people and he knew them. If Jonathan said jump or stand backwards or stand on your head, basically you did it. This was the nature of the relationship; he was completely omnipotent, in a decent way.<ref>Banks, et al. (2007), "Christmas Cottage (1968–1970)", 57.</ref></blockquote>

King produced their first three singles, including "[[The Silent Sun]]" (1968) and an album, ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' (1969). Banks and Gabriel wrote "The Silent Sun" as a late-1960s [[Bee Gees]] "pastiche" to please King; [[Robin Gibb]]'s voice was apparently King's favourite at the time.<ref>Banks 2007, 29.</ref> The records made little impact; the album sold just 649 copies "and we knew all of those people personally," wrote Banks. King slowly lost interest in the band. Their next demo was even less "poppy"; the more complicated the songs, the less King liked them.<ref name=Banks2007p52>Banks 2007, 52.</ref> Genesis left King in 1970 for [[Tony Stratton-Smith]]'s [[Charisma Records]], were joined by [[Phil Collins]] and [[Steve Hackett]]—and, after another two unsuccessful albums, released ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972) to critical acclaim.<ref>White, Timothy (1986).

In those days, to get any sort of record contract, was really magical. And he gave us a chance to do a whole record. You've got a bunch of musicians who were really amateur, could barely play well, were barely a group, and were able to go in one summer holiday and make a record."<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Mike Rutherford interviewed by Dan Neer |year=1985 |title=Mike on Mike |url=http://www.discogs.com/Mike-The-Mechanics-Mike-On-Mike-Exclusive-Candid-Interview/release/2651552 |access-date=22 January 2014 |format=Vinyl, 12" Promo interview recording |publisher=Atlantic Recording Corporation|ref=Altlantic – PR820}}</ref>}}

When King graduated from Cambridge in June 1967, the press covered his graduation ceremony: "Jonathan King becomes M.A. (Cantab.)".<ref>"Jonathan King becomes M.A. (Cantab.)", [[Londoner's Diary]], ''London Evening Standard'', 23 June 1967.</ref> Shortly afterwards Tony Firth, an [[Associated Television|ATV]] producer and Trinity graduate, asked King to present ''Good Evening'', a weekly television show that ran nationally on ATV at 6:30&nbsp;pm on Saturdays from October 1967 to 1968.<ref>''Billboard'', 14 October 1967, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qiIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64 64]; for ATV, ''London Magazine'', 7, 1967, 59.</ref><ref>For 1968, Wale, Michael (1972).

"[[It's Good News Week]]" (1965) was the last big hit King had for four years. Then his cover of "[[Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out)|Let It All Hang Out]]" (1969) made the top 30 in January 1970, and he went on to become the top singles producer of 1971 and 1972,<ref name=Billboard27May1972>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA51&lpg=RA1-PA51 "UK Producer King Launches Own Label"], ''Billboard'', 27 May 1972, 51.</ref> beginning with "[[It's the Same Old Song]]". Released by [[B&C Records]] in December 1970 under a pseudonym, the Weathermen, it moved into the charts a month later. Using pseudonyms meant more airtime: radio producers might play several songs by the same artist during a programme without realizing they had devoted so much airtime to one person.<ref name=King12/>

King's 1971 releases included a version of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Mama, You Been on My Mind|Baby, You've Been On My Mind]]", released as Nemo, which failed to chart; ''[[The Sun Has Got His Hat On]]'', also as Nemo; "[[Sugar, Sugar]]" as Sakkarin; "[[Leap Up and Down (Wave Your Knickers in the Air)]]" by St Cecelia (this one a real band, rather than a pseudonym), which went to number 12; and "[[Lazy Bones]]", "[[Flirt]]" and "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]" – all released under his own name.<ref name=King12/>

[[Bell Records]] asked King to produce four songs for the [[Bay City Rollers]], including their first hit, "[[Keep on Dancing (The Gentrys song)|Keep on Dancing]]", on which King sang the 13 backing vocals himself. Released in May 1971, the single reached number nine.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bay City Babylon: The Unbelievable But True Story of the Bay City Rollers|last=Coy |first=Wayne|year= 2005|isbn= 978-1587364631|at=[https://books.google.com/books?id=X3841RiPCqUC&pg=PA23 23–27]}}</ref>

"Hooked on a Feeling", a country song that King had turned into a pop hit, adding "ooga chaka ooga ooga" to the intro, was a Top Thirty hit. King's arrangement later gave Swedish group [[Blue Swede]] a US number one in April 1974.<ref>Bronson, Fred (2003).

Another top three 1971 hit was "[[Johnny Reggae]]", a [[ska]] pop song about a [[skinhead]], written by King after he was introduced to a Johnny Reggae at the [[Walton Hop]] disco in Surrey.<ref name=King12/> It was sung by King and middle-aged session singers pretending to be teenagers, credited to [[The Piglets]] and released by Bell.<ref name=King12/><ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/bll1180 "Record Details"], www.45cat.com.</ref> John Stratton writes that "Johnny Reggae" was the "first British hit with a ska beat to have been written by a white Englishman&nbsp;... and performed by white English singers and musicians."<ref>Stratton, John (2016).

The UK Records New York office on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] was turned into an apartment, and King set about building a new career in writing and broadcasting. He was given a weekly five-minute slot on BBC Radio 1 called "A King in New York", a "Postcard from America" slot in Radio 4, and he reported for Radio 1 on the 1980 presidential election.<ref>King, ''65 My Life So Far'', ch.&nbsp;15.</ref> In December 1980, watching television in bed, he heard there had been a shooting outside the [[The Dakota|Dakota Apartments]].

King has complained about his media coverage since his 2001 conviction. In 2005 he went to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] about an article in the ''[[News of the World]]'' that said he had gone to a park to "ogle" boys. In fact he had gone there at the request of a documentary maker. The complaint was not upheld, but [[Roy Greenslade]] argued that King had a good case.<ref>Greenslade, Roy (4 July 2005). [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/04/newsoftheworld.mondaymediasection "King had cause for complaint"], ''The Guardian''.</ref> In October 2011 then BBC [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]] [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] apologised to King for the removal of King's performance of "[[It Only Takes a Minute]]" from a repeat, on [[BBC Four]], of a 1976 episode of ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. King described the cut as a "Stalinist revision approach to history".<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC apology to Jonathan King after he is cut from repeat |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8835884/BBC-apology-to-Jonathan-King-after-he-is-cut-from-repeat.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 October 2011}}</ref> When asked by a newspaper in 2012 if he believed he had anything to apologise for, to anybody from his past, King replied, "The only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction.

===After prison===
Journalist Robert Chalmers wrote that King's creative output after he left prison "resembled a primal scream of rage".<ref name=Chalmers22April2012/><ref name=walker/> Two novels appeared: ''Beware the Monkey Man'' (2010), under the pen name Rex Kenny, and ''Death Flies, Missing Girls and Brigitte Bardot'' (2013), under his real name, Kenneth George King. He also published a diary, ''Three Months'' (2012), and two volumes of his autobiography, ''Jonathan King 65: My Life So Far'' (2009) and ''70 FFFY'' (2014).

King maintained an interest in prison issues and writes a column for ''[[Inside Time]]'', the national newspaper for prisoners.<ref>[http://www.insidetime.org/?s=%22Jonathan+King%22 "Jonathan King"], ''Inside Time''.</ref>

He released ''Earth to King'' in 2008. One of the new songs on the album, "The True Story of Harold Shipman" was about the serial killer Dr. [[Harold Shipman]], in which King suggested that Shipman may have been a victim of the media.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6896298.stm "Families' anger over Shipman song"], BBC News, 12 July 2007.</ref> He also produced three films. ''Vile Pervert: The Musical'' (2008), available for free download, is a 96-minute film in which King plays all 21 parts and presents his version of events surrounding his prosecution.  He portrays his viewpoint of the events responsible for his troubles.<ref name=vp>{{cite news |title= Jonathan King makes Vile Pervert: The Musical |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1958447/Jonathan-King-makes-Vile-Pervert-The-Musical.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 May 2008 |first=Matthew |last=Moore}}</ref> In one scene King, dressed as [[Oscar Wilde]], sings that there is "nothing wrong with buggering boys".<ref name=vp/> [[Rod Liddle]] called it "a fantastically berserk, bravado performance".<ref>{{cite news |last=Liddle |first=Rod |title=The King strikes back |url= http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/rod-liddle/2011/10/the-king-strikes-back/ |work=The Spectator|date=22 October 2011}}</ref> ''Me Me Me'' (2011) was described at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] as "a re-telling of ''Romeo and Juliet''".<ref>Sharp, Rob (12 May 2011).

===2018 trial===
In August 2015, King wrote an article for ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine concerning [[Sir Edward Heath]], the subject of the now-discredited [[Operation Midland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/08/edward-heath-wasnt-gay-trust-me-i-tried-and-failed-to-seduce-him/|title=Why I don’t believe that Ted Heath was gay|date=7 August 2015|website=Blogs.spectator.co.uk}}</ref> In September 2015, King was arrested as part of [[Operation Yewtree#Operation Ravine|Operation Ravine]], a further investigation into claims of sexual abuse at the [[Walton Hop]] disco in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34205654|title=Jonathan King arrested in child sex offences probe |work= BBC News |date=10 September 2015}}</ref> He was later released on bail.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34214022 "Jonathan King freed on bail over sex offence claims"].

On 6 August 2018, King received an apology for the collapse of the trial, with Judge Deborah Taylor saying that Surrey Police had made "numerous, repeated and compounded" errors during the investigation, describing the situation as a "debacle". In her ruling she said "I have concluded that this is a case where even if it were possible to have a fair trial, it is in the rare category where the balance, taking account of the history, the failures and misleading of the Court, is in favour of a stay on the basis that following what has occurred, continuation would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice".<ref>[http://www.chrissaltrese.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/King-Further-abuse-ruling-redactedapproved.pdf Further ruling on application for a stay] ''R v Kenneth King''. Retrieved 9 September 2018.</ref> Taylor said that the case against King had been motivated by "concerns about reputational damage to Surrey Police" following the allegations of sexual abuse against [[Jimmy Savile]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Christopher|last=McKeon|url= https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-police-failures-jonathan-king-15070657|title=Surrey Police failures in Jonathan King child sex abuse investigation 'undermined criminal justice system'|work=SurreyLive |date=30 August 2018|access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> Surrey Police "wholeheartedly apologised" to King, saying: "We deeply regret that despite these efforts we did not meet the required standards to ensure a fair trial."<ref name = "2018_trial">{{cite news |first=Victoria|last=Ward|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/06/surrey-police-apologise-judgment-reveals-disclosure-failings/|title=Surrey Police apologise after judgment reveals disclosure failings in Jonathan King sex abuse case |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=6 August 2018|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> King refused to accept the apology, and criticised Surrey Police for "deep, institutional faults".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-45134168|title=Music mogul Jonathan King slams police apology|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 August 2018|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref><ref name= "finkelstein" /> He urged both the [[Surrey Police#Chief Constables|Chief Constable]] and the [[Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner|Police and Crime Commissioner]] to go.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.farnhamherald.com/article.cfm?id=134078&headline=Former+DJ+King+calls+for+Munro+to+step+down&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2019|title=Former DJ King calls for Munro to step down|newspaper=Farnham Herald}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/chief-constable-nick-ephgrave-leave-15549383|title=Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave to leave Surrey Police for Met|first=Christopher|last=McKeon|date=13 December 2018|website=getsurrey}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.farnhamherald.com/article.cfm?id=135316&headline=Munro+loses+crime+commissioner+vote&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2019|title=Munro loses crime commissioner vote|newspaper=Farnham Herald}}</ref>

After the "debacle", as Judge Taylor described the 2018 trial, many respected commentators started to question the verdict of the 2001 trial including [[Bob Woffinden]] in his book ''The Nicholas Cases'' and [[Daniel Finkelstein]] in'' [[The Times]]''; the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] announced it was reopening an investigation into it, after fresh evidence emerged during the 2018 prosecution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thejusticegap.com/proof-magazine-media-betrays-us-daily-basis/ |title=The media betrays us every day – The Justice Gap |access-date=7 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://barristerblogger.com/2018/08/08/the-collapse-of-jonathan-kings-trial-raises-questions-about-surrey-police-that-go-beyond-disclosure-failures/ |title=The collapse of Jonathan King's trial raises questions about Surrey Police that go beyond disclosure failures |date=8 August 2018 |access-date=7 May 2020}}</ref>

In August 2019 Chief Constable Stephens, who had replaced Ephgrave, announced that, in the year since King's acquittal, the Surrey Police success rate for convictions in sex abuse cases had dropped from 20% to "under 4%".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-49350013|title=Backlog of child sex offences 'significant'|date=14 August 2019|work=BBC News}}</ref> On 22 November 2019, an independent review into the police investigation leading to the trial was published. It was critical of the handling of disclosure of documents to King's defence prior to the trial, and questioned whether some of the staff involved had been qualified or experienced enough to handle the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-50518077|title=Jonathan King child abuse trial: Surrey Police criticised over collapse|work=[[BBC News]]|date=22 November 2019|access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.surrey.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/media/downloads/surrey/news/operation-ravine-peer-review-report-november-2019.pdf Operation Ravine Peer Review Report] Surrey Police, 22 November 2019.</ref>

In 2020 King's complaint to the [[Independent Office for Police Conduct]] (IOPC) about Surrey Police's Professional Standards Department's examination of the handling of Operation Ravine was upheld. His appeal to the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (CCRC) regarding the 2001 conviction is still being examined after fresh evidence was disclosed in 2018. The new Director General of the BBC confirmed that King was welcome to appear on the network.<ref>https://twnews.co.uk/gb-news/new-bbc-boss-tim-davie-reassures-paedophile-jonathan-king-they-still-play-his-music</ref><ref>https://independenteagle.com/new-bbc-boss-tim-davie-reassures-paedophile-jonathan-king-they-still-play-his-music/?fbclid=IwAR1iok9l5dqQdD5gvxPGgHUuVjdrrP8IrZJ4pMEu3I8wVvxGF1ChQQCS-Tk</ref>
