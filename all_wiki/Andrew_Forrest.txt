===Speaking about human trafficking===
Forrest's daughter, Grace volunteered at an [[orphanage]] in [[Nepal]] and discovered the children she had looked after had been [[human trafficking|trafficked]] to be [[Sexual slavery|sex slaves]] in the [[Middle East]].

===Global Freedom Network===
Forrest founded the [[Global Freedom Network]] which the [[Pope]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and the [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]] will lead. The Global Freedom Network will work together to stop all religious faiths from using organisations involved with slavery in their [[supply chain]].<ref name=Miller/> 
{{Quotation|When I heard the news [that all parties had agreed to the venture] I have to admit I became emotional. This is going to change everything.  This is set up like a high-achieving, measurement-driven, totally target-oriented company, it's like a hard-edged business. We are out to defeat slavery, we are not out to feel good. This is our mission.  You see the complete hopelessness in the eyes [of enslaved people]. It’s like I’m stuck, I will never get help, I am dirt. Then you know that you can’t rest until you free them.|Andrew Forrest, interviewed in 2014}}

==Interfaith declaration==
Andrew and Grace Forrest took part in a meeting held in 2014 in the Vatican.

{{Quotation|We, the undersigned, are gathered here today for a historic initiative to inspire spiritual and practical action by all global faiths and people of goodwill everywhere to eradicate modern slavery across the world by 2020 and for all time.  In the eyes of God, each human being is a free person, whether girl, boy, woman or man, and is destined to exist for the good of all in equality and fraternity. Modern slavery, in terms of human trafficking, forced labour and prostitution, organ trafficking, and any relationship that fails to respect the fundamental conviction that all people are equal and have the same freedom and dignity, is a crime against humanity.  We pledge ourselves here today to do all in our power, within our faith communities and beyond, to work together for the freedom of all those who are enslaved and trafficked so that their future may be restored. Today we have the opportunity, awareness, wisdom, innovation and technology to achieve this human and moral imperative.}}  The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Justin Welby, urged consumers to demand more information about whether forced labour was involved in goods they bought.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/religious-leaders-pope-vatican-slavery-declaration Pope and Welby joined by imams and rabbis for anti-slavery declaration]</ref>
