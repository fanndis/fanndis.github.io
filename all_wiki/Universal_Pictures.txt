Universal Studios was founded by [[Carl Laemmle]], Mark Dintenfass, [[Charles O Baumann|Charles O. Baumann]], Adam Kessel, [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], William Swanson, [[David Horsley]], Robert H. Cochrane{{efn|Robert H. Cochrane (1879–1973) formed the Cochrane Advertising Agency in Chicago in 1904. He joined the Laemmle Film Service as advertising manager in 1906, and for the next 30 years devoted himself to promoting Carl Laemmle as the 'star' of various motion picture enterprises. In 1912 Cochrane was elected vice-president of the Universal Film manufacturing Company, and served as president of Universal in 1936–37 after Laemmle sold his interests.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cochrane |first=Robert H. |date=2007 |title=Beginning of motion picture press agenting |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/film_history/v019/19.3cochrane.html |journal=Film History: An International Journal |publisher=Indiana University Press |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=330–332 |doi= 10.2979/fil.2007.19.3.330|access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>}} and [[Jules Brulatour]]. One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours, counting patrons and calculating the day's takings. Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up [[dry goods]] to buy the first several [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeons]]. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] (or the "Edison Trust") meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed. Based on the [[Latham Loop]] used in cameras and projectors, along with other patents, the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition, and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution.

Soon, Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures. In June 1909, Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners [[Abe Stern]] and [[Julius Stern (producer)|Julius Stern]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Vander Hook |first1=Sue |url=https://archive.org/details/stevenspielbergg0000vand |url-access=registration |title=Steven Spielberg: Groundbreaking Director |publisher=ABDO Publishing Company |year=2010 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stevenspielbergg0000vand/page/35 35] |isbn=978-1617852527 |access-date=2018-04-12 }}</ref> That company quickly evolved into the [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]] (IMP), with studios in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], where many early films in [[America's first motion picture industry]] were produced in the early 20th century.<ref>{{citation   | last = Rose   | first = Liza   | title = 100 years ago, Fort Lee was the first town to bask in movie magic   | newspaper = The Star-Ledger   | date = April 29, 2012   | url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/100_years_ago_fort_lee_was_the.html   | access-date = November 11, 2012   }}</ref><ref>{{Citation   | last = Koszarski   | first = Richard      | title = Fort Lee: The Film Town   | place = Rome, Italy   | publisher = John Libbey Publishing -CIC srl    | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5w0r8YKan04C&printsec=frontcover    | isbn=  0-86196-653-8    | year = 2004      }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title = Studios and Films   | publisher = Fort Lee Film Commission   | url = http://www.fortleefilm.org/studios.html   | access-date = May 30, 2011   }}</ref><ref>{{Citation   | last = Fort Lee Film Commission   | title = Fort Lee Birthplace of the Motion Picture Industry   | publisher = Arcadia Publishing   | year = 2006   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ViR3b72xkK0C&printsec=frontcover   | isbn = 0-7385-4501-5   }}</ref> Laemmle broke with Edison's custom of refusing to give [[billing (filmmaking)|billing]] and [[motion picture credits|screen credits]] to performers. By naming the movie stars, he attracted many of the leading players of the time, contributing to the creation of the [[star system (filmmaking)|star system]]. In 1910, he promoted [[Florence Lawrence]], formerly known as "[[Biograph Girl|The Biograph Girl]]", and actor [[King Baggot]], in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing.

[[File:Ivanhoe-Baggot-1913-Poster.jpg|right|thumb|Poster for ''[[Ivanhoe (1913 U.S. film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1913) ]]

The '''Universal Film Manufacturing Company''' was incorporated in New York on April 30, 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://universal.filmmakersdestination.com/about-us/ |title=About Us: Universal Studios History |website=The Filmmakers Destination |publisher=[[NBCUniversal]] |access-date=2016-02-12}}</ref> Laemmle, who emerged as president in July 1912, was the primary figure in the partnership with Dintenfass, Baumann, Kessel, Powers, Swanson, Horsley, and Brulatour. The company was established June 8, 1912 formed in a merger of [[Independent Moving Pictures]] (IMP), the [[Powers Motion Picture Company]], [[Rex Motion Picture Manufacturing Company]], [[Champion Film Company]], [[Nestor Film Company]], and the [[New York Motion Picture Company]].<ref>http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n85138017.html</ref> Eventually all would be bought out by Laemmle. The new Universal studio was a [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated company]], with movie production, distribution and exhibition venues all linked in the same corporate entity, the central element of the [[Studio system]] era.

[[File:A Great Love - Clifford S. Elfelt - 1916, Universal Big U - EYE FLM25830 - OB 685649.webm|thumb|Melodrama ''A Great Love'' (1916) by [[Clifford S. Elfelt]] for Universal Big U. Dutch intertitles, 12:33. Collection [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]].]]

Following the westward trend of the industry, by the end of 1912 the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area.

On March 15, 1915,<ref name="Universal Story"/>{{Rp|8}} Laemmle opened the world's largest motion picture production facility, [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]], on a 230-acre (0.9-km<sup>2</sup>) converted farm just over the [[Cahuenga Pass]] from Hollywood. Studio management became the third facet of Universal's operations, with the studio incorporated as a distinct subsidiary organization. Unlike other movie moguls, Laemmle opened his studio to tourists. Universal became the largest studio in Hollywood, and remained so for a decade. However, it sought an audience mostly in small towns, producing mostly inexpensive [[melodrama]]s, [[western (genre)|westerns]] and [[serial film|serials]].

In its early years Universal released three brands of feature films—Red Feather, low-budget programmers; Bluebird, more ambitious productions; and Jewel, their prestige motion pictures. Directors included [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]], [[John Ford]], [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], [[Robert Z. Leonard]], [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]] and [[Lois Weber]], one of the few women directing films in Hollywood.<ref name="Universal Story">{{cite book |last=Hirschhorn |first=Clive |author-link=Clive Hirschhorn |date=1985 |orig-year=1983 |title=The Universal Story |location=New York |publisher=Crown Publishers  |isbn=0-7064-1873-5}}</ref>{{Rp|13}}

Despite Laemmle's role as an innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals [[Adolph Zukor]], [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]], and [[Marcus Loew]], Laemmle chose not to develop a [[theater chain]]. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director [[Erich von Stroheim]] insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films ''[[Blind Husbands]]'' (1919) and ''[[Foolish Wives]]'' (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational [[ad campaign]] that attracted moviegoers. [[Character actor]] [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] became a drawing card for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two biggest hits for Universal were ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to [[Irving Thalberg]]. Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief, Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class, but [[MGM]]'s head of production [[Louis B. Mayer]] lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay. Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio, and would remain so for several decades.

In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of [[Joe Pasternak]]. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of [[Hitler]]'s increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.

In the early years, Universal had a "clean picture" policy. However, by April 1927, Carl Laemmle considered this to be a mistake as "unclean pictures" from other studios were generating more profit while Universal was losing money.<ref>Leonard Leff and Jerold Simmons ''The Dame in the Kimono'', 1990 (original edition)</ref>

===Oswald the Lucky Rabbit===
In early 1927, Universal had been negotiating deals with cartoon producers since they wanted to get back into producing them. On March 4, [[Charles Mintz]] signed a contract with Universal in the presence of its vice president, R. H. Cochrane. Mintz's company, Winkler Pictures, was to produce 26 "[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]" cartoons for Universal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/movingpicturewor85marm/page/n123|title=Universal Announces Release Of "Oscar, the Rabbit" Cartoons|publisher=[[Moving Picture World]]|date=1927-03-12|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> [[Walt Disney]] and [[Ub Iwerks]] created the character and the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Studio]] provided the animation for the cartoons under Winkler's supervision.

The films enjoyed a successful theatrical run, and Mintz would sign a contract with Universal ensuring three more years of Oswald cartoons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionnew37moti#page/n579/|title=Universal Signs for 3 More Years of Oswald|publisher=[[Motion Picture News]]|date=1928-02-18|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> However, after Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the films, Mintz took most of Walt's [[animators]] to work at his own studio. Disney and Iwerks would create [[Mickey Mouse]] in secret while they finished the remaining Oswald films they were contractually obligated to finish. Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by [[Walter Lantz]].

In February 2006, [[NBCUniversal]] sold all the Disney-animated Oswald cartoons, along with the rights to the character himself, to [[The Walt Disney Company]]. In return, Disney released [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sportscaster [[Al Michaels]] from his contract so he could work on NBC's recently acquired [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night NFL football package]]. Universal retained ownership of the remaining Oswald cartoons.

===Keeping leadership of the studio in the family===
[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935)]]
In 1928, Laemmle, Sr. made his son, [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.|Carl, Jr.]] head of Universal Pictures as a 21st birthday present. Universal already had a reputation for [[nepotism]]—at one time, 70 of Carl, Sr.'s relatives were supposedly on the payroll. Many of them were nephews, resulting in Carl, Sr. being known around the studios as "Uncle Carl." [[Ogden Nash]] famously quipped in rhyme, "Uncle Carl Laemmle/Has a very large faemmle." Among these relatives was future Academy Award-winning director/producer [[William Wyler]].

"Junior" Laemmle persuaded his father to bring Universal up to date. He bought and built theaters, converted the studio to sound production, and made several forays into high-quality production. His early efforts included the critically panned [[part-talkie]] version of [[Edna Ferber]]'s novel ''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1929), the lavish musical ''[[Broadway (1929 film)|Broadway]]'' (1929) which included [[Technicolor]] sequences; and the first all-color musical feature (for Universal), ''[[King of Jazz]]'' (1930). The more serious ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930), won its year's [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] [[Academy Award|Oscar]].

Laemmle, Jr. created a niche for the studio, beginning a series of [[horror film]]s which extended into the 1940s, affectionately dubbed [[Universal horror|Universal Horror]]. Among them are ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933). Other Laemmle productions of this period include ''[[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1934) and ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'' (1936).

===The Laemmles lose control===
Universal's forays into high-quality production spelled the end of the Laemmle era at the studio. Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky, and for a time Universal slipped into [[receivership]]. The theater chain was [[scrapped]], but Carl, Jr. held fast to distribution, studio and production operations.

The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish version of ''[[Show Boat (1936 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1936), a remake of its earlier 1929 [[part-talkie]] production, and produced as a high-quality, big-budget film rather than as a [[B-picture]]. The new film featured several stars from the Broadway stage version, which began production in late 1935, and unlike the 1929 film was based on the Broadway musical rather than the novel. Carl, Jr.'s spending habits alarmed company stockholders. They would not allow production to start on ''Show Boat'' unless the Laemmles obtained a loan. Universal was forced to seek a $750,000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation, pledging the Laemmle family's controlling interest in Universal as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. It was the first time Universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26-year history. The production went $300,000 over budget; Standard called in the loan, cash-strapped Universal could not pay, Standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on April 2, 1936.

Although Universal's 1936 ''Show Boat'' (released a little over a month later) became a critical and financial success, it was not enough to save the Laemmles' involvement with the studio. They were unceremoniously removed from the company they had founded. Because the Laemmles personally oversaw production, ''Show Boat'' was released (despite the takeover) with Carl Laemmle and Carl Laemmle Jr.'s names on the credits and in the advertising campaign of the film. Standard Capital's [[John Cheever Cowdin|J. Cheever Cowdin]] had taken over as president and chairman of the board of directors, and instituted severe cuts in production budgets. Gone were the big ambitions, and though Universal had a few big names under contract, those it had been cultivating, like [[William Wyler]] and [[Margaret Sullavan]], left.

Meanwhile, producer [[Joe Pasternak]], who had been successfully producing light musicals with young sopranos for Universal's German subsidiary, repeated his formula in America. Teenage singer [[Deanna Durbin]] starred in Pasternak's first American film, ''[[Three Smart Girls]]'' (1936). The film was a box-office hit and reputedly resolved the studio's financial problems. The success of the film led Universal to offer her a contract, which for the first five years of her career produced her most successful pictures.

[[File:Destry-Rides-Again-1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] in ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939)]]
When Pasternak stopped producing Durbin's pictures, and she outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles, the studio signed 13-year-old [[Gloria Jean]] for her own series of Pasternak musicals from 1939; she went on to star with [[Bing Crosby]], [[W. C. Fields]], and [[Donald O'Connor]]. A popular Universal film of the late 1930s was ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' (1939), starring [[James Stewart]] as Destry and [[Marlene Dietrich]] in her comeback role after leaving [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]].

By the early 1940s, the company was concentrating on lower-budget productions that were the company's main staple: westerns, melodramas, serials and [[sequels]] to the studio's horror pictures, the latter now solely B pictures. The studio fostered many series: [[The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys]] action features and serials (1938–43); the comic adventures of infant Baby Sandy (1938–41); comedies with [[Hugh Herbert]] (1938–42) and [[The Ritz Brothers]] (1940–43); musicals with [[Robert Paige]], [[Jane Frazee]], [[The Andrews Sisters]], and [[The Merry Macs]] (1938–45); and westerns with [[Tom Mix]] (1932–33), [[Buck Jones]] (1933–36), [[Bob Baker (actor)|Bob Baker]] (1938–39), [[Johnny Mack Brown]] (1938–43); [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]] (1944–45), and [[Kirby Grant]] (1946–47).

Universal could seldom afford its own stable of stars, and often borrowed talent from other studios, or hired freelance actors. In addition to Stewart and Dietrich, [[Margaret Sullavan]], and [[Bing Crosby]] were two of the major names that made a couple of pictures for Universal during this period. Some stars came from radio, including [[Edgar Bergen]], [[W. C. Fields]], and the comedy team of [[Abbott and Costello]] ([[Bud Abbott]] and [[Lou Costello]]). Abbott and Costello's military comedy ''[[Buck Privates]]'' (1941) gave the former [[burlesque]] [[comedians]] a national and international profile.

During the war years Universal did have a co-production arrangement with producer [[Walter Wanger]] and his partner, director [[Fritz Lang]], lending the studio some amount of prestige productions. Universal's core audience base was still found in the [[neighborhood movie theaters]], and the studio continued to please the public with low- to medium-budget films. [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]] in new ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' mysteries (1942–46), teenage musicals with [[Gloria Jean]], [[Donald O'Connor]], and [[Peggy Ryan]] (1942–43), and screen [[adaptations]] of radio's ''[[Inner Sanctum Mysteries]]'' with [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] (1943–45). [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was also borrowed for two films from [[Selznick International Pictures]]: ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) and ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).

As Universal's main product had always been lower-budgeted films, it was one of the last major studios to have a contract with [[Technicolor]]. The studio did not make use of the [[three-strip Technicolor]] process until ''[[Arabian Nights (1942 film)|Arabian Nights]]'' (1942), starring [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] and [[Maria Montez]]. Technicolor was also utilised for the studio's remake of their 1925 horror melodrama, ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1943) with [[Claude Rains]] and [[Nelson Eddy]]. With the success of their first two pictures, a regular schedule of high-budget, Technicolor films followed.

===Universal-International and Decca Records takes control===
In 1945, the British entrepreneur [[J. Arthur Rank]], hoping to expand his American presence, bought into a four-way merger with Universal, the independent company International Pictures, and producer Kenneth Young. The new combine, United World Pictures, was a failure and was dissolved within one year. Rank and International remained interested in Universal, however, culminating in the studio's reorganization as Universal-International; the merger was announced on July 30, 1946.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Pictures and the merger with Universal Pictures|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/international_universal.htm|website=cobbles.com|access-date=8 November 2017}}</ref> [[William Goetz]], a founder of International along with [[Leo Spitz]], was made head of production at the renamed '''Universal-International Pictures''', a subsidiary of '''Universal Pictures Company, Inc.''' which also served as an import-export subsidiary, and copyright holder for the production arm's films. Goetz, a son-in-law of [[Louis B. Mayer]] decided to bring "prestige" to the new company. He stopped the studio's low-budget production of [[B movie]]s, [[serial (film)|serials]] and curtailed Universal's horror and "[[Arabian Nights]]" cycles. He also reduced the studio's output from its wartime average of fifty films per year (which was nearly twice the major studio's output) to thirty-five films a year.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNIVERSAL-INTERNATIONAL AND THE EARLY MCA YEARS|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Universal-UNIVERSAL-INTERNATIONAL-ANDTHE-EARLY-MCA-YEARS.html|website=filmreference.com|access-date=8 November 2017}}</ref> Distribution and copyright control remained under the name of Universal Pictures Company Inc.

[[File:Universal International Studio 1955.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2|Universal-International Studio, 1955]]
Goetz set out an ambitious schedule. Universal-International became responsible for the American distribution of Rank's British productions, including such classics as [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1948). Broadening its scope further, Universal-International branched out into the lucrative non-theatrical field, buying a majority stake in home-movie dealer [[Castle Films]] in 1947, and taking the company over entirely in 1951. For three decades, Castle would offer "highlights" reels from the Universal film library to home-movie enthusiasts and collectors. Goetz licensed Universal's pre–Universal-International film library to Jack Broeder's [[Realart Pictures]] for cinema re-release but Realart was not allowed to show the films on television.

The production arm of the studio still struggled. While there were to be a few hits like ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946) and ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), Universal-International's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office. By the late 1940s, Goetz was out, and the studio returned to low-budget and series films. The inexpensive ''[[Francis (1950 film)|Francis]]'' (1950), the first film of a series about a talking mule and ''[[Ma and Pa Kettle (film)|Ma and Pa Kettle]]'' (1949), part of a series, became mainstays of the company. Once again, the films of Abbott and Costello, including ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948), were among the studio's top-grossing productions. But at this point Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor [[Milton Rackmil]], whose [[Decca Records]] would take full control of Universal in 1952. Besides Abbott and Costello, the studio retained the [[Walter Lantz]] cartoon studio, whose product was released with Universal-International's films.

In the 1950s, Universal-International resumed their series of Arabian Nights films, many starring [[Tony Curtis]]. The studio also had a success with monster and [[science fiction]] films produced by [[William Alland]], with many directed by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]]. Other successes were the  [[melodrama]]s directed by [[Douglas Sirk]] and produced by [[Ross Hunter]], although for film critics they were not so well thought of on first release as they have since become. Among Universal-International's stable of stars were [[Rock Hudson]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], [[Audie Murphy]], and [[John Gavin]].

Although Decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean, it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business, as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 ''[[U.S. vs. Paramount Pictures, et al.]]'' decision. Leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose, and in 1950 [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] agent [[Lew Wasserman]] made a deal with Universal for his client [[James Stewart]] that would change the rules of the business. Wasserman's deal gave Stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary. When one of those films, ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950), proved to be a hit, the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at Universal, and eventually at other studios as well.

===MCA takes over===
[[File:2004-04-04 - 10 - Universal Studios.jpg|thumb|200px|Ceremonial gate to Universal Studios Hollywood (the theme park attached to the studio lot)]]

In the early 1950s, Universal set up its own distribution company in [[France]], and in the late 1960s, the company also started a production company in [[Paris]], '''Universal Productions France S.A.''', although sometimes credited by the name of the distribution company, '''Universal Pictures France'''. Except for the two first films it produced, [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''Le scandale'' (English title ''[[The Champagne Murders]]'', 1967) and [[Romain Gary]]'s ''Les oiseaux vont mourir au Pérou'' (English title ''Birds in Peru''), it was only involved in French or other European co-productions, including [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[Lacombe, Lucien]]'', [[Bertrand Blier]]'s ''Les Valseuses'' (English title ''[[Going Places (1974 film)|Going Places]]'', 1974), and [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[The Day of the Jackal (film)|The Day of the Jackal]]'' (1973). It was only involved in approximately 20 French film productions. In the early 1970s, the unit was incorporated into the French [[Cinema International Corporation]] arm.

By the late 1950s, the motion picture business was again changing. The combination of the studio/theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions. The [[MCA Inc.|Music Corporation of America]] (MCA), the world's largest talent agency, had also become a powerful television producer, renting space at [[Republic Studios]] for its [[Revue Productions]] subsidiary. After a period of complete shutdown, a moribund Universal agreed to sell its 360-acre (1.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) studio lot to MCA in 1958, for $11&nbsp; million, renamed [[Revue Studios]]. MCA owned the studio lot, but not Universal Pictures, yet was increasingly influential on Universal's product. The studio lot was upgraded and modernized, while MCA clients like [[Doris Day]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Cary Grant]], and director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] were signed to Universal contracts.

The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA, Inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the MCA-[[Decca Records]] merger. The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures from Universal-International. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964, MCA formed '''Universal City Studios, Inc'''., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as [[Universal Television]] in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with [[leading actors]] and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a [[Studio Tour|studio tour]] subsidiary launched in 1964.

Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which much later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; [[#NBC Universal|see below]]) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons. An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie. In 1982, Universal became the studio base for many shows that were produced by [[Norman Lear|Norman Lear's]] [[Tandem Productions]]/[[Embassy Television]], including ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', and ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' which premiered on [[NBC]] that same fall.

At this time, [[Hal B. Wallis]], who had recently worked as a major producer at Paramount, moved over to Universal, where he produced several films, among them a lavish version of [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'' (1969), and the equally lavish ''[[Mary, Queen of Scots (1971 film)|Mary, Queen of Scots]]'' (1971). Although neither could claim to be a big financial hit, both films received Academy Award nominations, and ''Anne'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Richard Burton]]), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] ([[Geneviève Bujold]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Anthony Quayle]]). Wallis retired from Universal after making the film ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]'' (1975), a sequel to ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), which Wallis had produced at Paramount. ''Rooster Cogburn'' co-starred [[John Wayne]], reprising his Oscar-winning role from the earlier film, and [[Katharine Hepburn]], their only film together. The film was only a moderate success.

In the early 1970s, Universal teamed up with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] to form [[Cinema International Corporation]], which distributed films by Paramount and Universal outside of the US and Canada. Although Universal did produce occasional hits, among them ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973), ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (also 1973), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), and a big box-office success which restored the company's fortunes: ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), Universal during the decade was primarily a television studio. When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] purchased [[United Artists]] in 1981, MGM could not drop out of the CIC venture to merge with United Artists overseas operations. However, with future film productions from both names being released through the MGM/UA Entertainment plate, CIC decided to merge UA's international units with MGM and reformed as [[United International Pictures]]. There would be other film hits like ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985), ''[[An American Tail]]'' (1986), ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' (1988), ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), but the film business was financially unpredictable. UIP began distributing films by start-up studio [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 1997, due to connections the founders have with Paramount, Universal, and Amblin Entertainment. In 2001, MGM dropped out of the UIP venture and went with [[20th Century Fox]]'s international arm to handle distribution of their titles, an arrangement which remains ongoing.

===Matsushita, Seagram, Vivendi and NBCUniversal===
[[File:Gate2universalstudios.JPG|thumb|right|Gate 2, Universal Studios (as it appears when closed on weekends)]]
Anxious to expand the company's broadcast and cable presence, longtime MCA head [[Lew Wasserman]] sought a rich partner. He located [[Japan]]ese electronics manufacturer Matsushita Electric (now known as [[Panasonic]]), which agreed to acquire MCA for $6.6&nbsp;billion in 1990.

Matsushita provided a cash infusion, but the clash of cultures was too great to overcome, and five years later Matsushita sold an 80% stake in MCA/Universal to Canadian drinks distributor [[Seagram]] for $5.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/10/business/mca-sale-deal-seagram-puts-finishing-touches-its-5.7-billion-acquisition-mca.html|title=THE MCA SALE: THE DEAL; Seagram Puts the Finishing Touches on Its $5.7 Billion Acquisition of MCA|last=Fabrikant|first=Geraldine|date=1995-04-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Seagram sold off its stake in [[DuPont]] to fund this expansion into the entertainment industry. Hoping to build an entertainment empire around Universal, Seagram bought [[PolyGram]] in 1999 and other entertainment properties, but the fluctuating profits characteristic of Hollywood were no substitute for the reliable income stream gained from the previously held shares in DuPont.

To raise money, Seagram head [[Edgar Bronfman Jr.]] sold Universal's television holdings, including cable network [[USA Network|USA]], to [[Barry Diller]] (these same properties would be bought back later at greatly inflated prices). In June 2000, Seagram was sold to [[France|French]] water utility and media company [[Vivendi]], which owned [[StudioCanal]]; the conglomerate then became known as Vivendi Universal. Afterward, Universal Pictures acquired the United States distribution rights of several of StudioCanal's films, such as [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001) and ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (2001) which became the second-highest-grossing [[French language]] film in the United States since 1980. Universal Pictures and StudioCanal also co-produced several films, such as ''[[Love Actually]]'' (2003) a $40&nbsp;million-budgeted film that eventually grossed $246&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=loveactually.htm|title=Love Actually (2003) – Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> In late 2000, the [[New York Film Academy]] was permitted to use the Universal Studios backlot for student film projects in an unofficial partnership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/los-angeles/#universal-studios|title=New York Film Academy – Los Angeles|work=nyfa.edu}}</ref>

Burdened with debt, in 2004 Vivendi Universal sold 80% of Vivendi Universal Entertainment (including the studio and theme parks) to [[General Electric]] (GE), parent of [[NBC]]. The resulting media super-conglomerate was renamed [[NBCUniversal]], while Universal Studios Inc. remained the name of the production subsidiary. After that deal, GE owned 80% of NBC Universal; Vivendi held the remaining 20%, with an option to sell its share in 2006.

In late 2005, Viacom's [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks SKG]] after acquisition talks between GE and DreamWorks stalled. Universal's long-time chairperson, Stacey Snider, left the company in early 2006 to head up DreamWorks. Snider was replaced by then-Vice Chairman [[Marc Shmuger]] and [[Focus Features]] head [[David Linde]]. On October 5, 2009, Marc Shmuger and David Linde were ousted and their co-chairperson jobs consolidated under former president of worldwide marketing and distribution Adam Fogelson becoming the single chairperson. Donna Langley was also upped to co-chairperson.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.deadline.com/hollywood/adam-fogelson-named-new-chairman-of-universal-pictures|title='Two And A Half Men' Cast's Holiday Gifts For The Show's Crew And Staff|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|magazine=Deadline|date=October 5, 2009}}</ref> In 2009, Stephanie Sperber founded Universal Partnerships & Licensing within Universal to license consumer products for Universal.<ref name=tw>{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Lindsay|title=Universal Partnerships & Licensing to Expand to Consumer Products Covering NBC and Sprout|url=https://www.thewrap.com/universal-partnerships-licensing-to-expand-to-consumer-products-covering-nbc-and-sprout/|access-date=June 27, 2014|work=The Wrap|date=June 19, 2014}}</ref>

===Comcast era (2011–present)===
[[File:Universal Studios Gate 3 Lankershim 2015-04-19.jpg|thumb|left|Gate 3 with signs for [[KNBC]] and [[Telemundo]]]]
GE sold 51% of the company to cable provider [[Comcast]] in 2011.  Comcast merged the former GE subsidiary with its own cable-television programming assets, creating the current NBCUniversal. Following [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval, the Comcast-GE deal was closed on January 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lafayette|first=Jon|title=Comcast Competes Deal|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/463142-Comcast_Completes_Deal.php|access-date=May 21, 2011|newspaper=Multichannel News|date=January 29, 2011}}</ref> In March 2013, Comcast bought the remaining 49% of NBCUniversal for $16.7 billion.<ref name="dl">{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/03/comcast-completes-acquisition-nbcuniversal/ |title=Comcast Completes Acquisition Of GE’s 49% Stake In NBCUniversal |last=Lieberman |first=David |date=19 March 2013 |website=Deadline |access-date=9 June 2020}}</ref>

In September 2013, Adam Fogelson was ousted as co-chairman of Universal Pictures, promoting Donna Langley to sole-chairman. In addition, NBCUniversal International Chairman, [[Jeff Shell]], would be appointed as Chairman of the newly created Filmed Entertainment Group. Longtime studio head [[Ronald Meyer|Ron Meyer]] would give up oversight of the film studio and appointed Vice Chairman of NBCUniversal, providing consultation to CEO Steve Burke on all of the company's operations. Meyer retained oversight of Universal Parks and Resorts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2013/09/shocker-adam-fogelson-out-in-universal-shakeup-582309/ |title=UNIVERSAL SHAKEUP: Adam Fogelson Out, Donna Langley Sideways, Jeff Shell In, And Ron Meyer Up As Studio Taken By Surprise |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |date=9 September 2013 |website=Deadline |access-date=9 June 2020}}</ref>

In June 2014, Universal Partnerships took over licensing consumer products for [[NBC]] and [[Universal Kids#Sprout|Sprout]] with expectation that all licensing would eventually be centralized within NBCUniversal.<ref name=tw/> 
In May 2015, [[Gramercy Pictures]] was revived by Focus Features as a genre label that concentrated on action, sci-fi, and horror films.<ref>{{cite news|title=Focus Revives Gramercy Pictures Label For Genre Films|url=https://www.deadline.com/2015/05/focus-features-revives-gramercy-pictures-label-genre-films-1201430500/|date=May 20, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=2015-05-20}}</ref>

In December 2019, Universal Pictures entered early negotiations to distribute upcoming feature film properties based on the [[Lego]] toys.
