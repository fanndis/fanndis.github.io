{{Ed Miliband sidebar}}
'''Edward Samuel Miliband''' (born 24 December 1969) is a British politician serving as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] since 2020, and has served as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]] since [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]]. He was previously [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] between 2010 and 2015, resigning after Labour's defeat at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]]. Alongside his brother, [[Foreign Secretary]] [[David Miliband]], he served in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] from 2007 to 2010 under [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]].

Miliband was born in the [[Fitzrovia]] district of [[Central London]] to Polish Jewish immigrants [[Marion Kozak]] and [[Ralph Miliband]], a Marxist intellectual and native of Brussels who fled Belgium during World War II. He graduated from [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] and later from the [[London School of Economics]]. Miliband became first a television journalist, then a Labour Party [[Senior researcher|researcher]] and a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]], before rising to become one of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] Gordon Brown's confidants and Chairman of [[HM Treasury]]'s Council of Economic Advisers.

Miliband was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 2005. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] made Miliband [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Cabinet Office]] in May 2006. When Gordon Brown became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2007, he appointed Miliband [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. Miliband was subsequently promoted to the new post of [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]], a position he held from 2008 to 2010.

After the Labour Party was defeated at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Brown resigned as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]; in September 2010, Miliband was [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|elected to replace him]]. His tenure as Labour leader was characterised by a leftward shift in his party's policies under the "[[One Nation Labour]]" branding, and by opposition to the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government]]'s cuts to the [[public sector]]. He led his party into several elections, including the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European Parliament election]]. Following Labour's defeat by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Miliband announced his resignation as leader on 8 May 2015. He was succeeded after a leadership election by [[Jeremy Corbyn]]. On 6 April 2020, new Labour leader [[Keir Starmer]] appointed Miliband [[Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], succeeding [[Rebecca Long-Bailey]].

In March 2009, while Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Miliband attended the UK premiere of climate change film ''[[The Age of Stupid]]'', where he was ambushed by actor [[Pete Postlethwaite]], who threatened to return his [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] and vote for any party other than Labour if the [[Kingsnorth 2|Kingsnorth coal-fired power station]] were to be given the go-ahead by the government.<ref>{{cite news|title=The night Ed Miliband said 'I'm with Stupid, but...' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/mar/16/the-age-of-stupid-renewableenergy |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Lucy |last=Siegle |date=16 March 2009 |archive-date=21 March 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321092603/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/mar/16/the-age-of-stupid-renewableenergy |df=dmy }}</ref> A month later, Miliband announced to the House of Commons a change to the government's policy on coal-fired power stations, saying that any potential new coal-fired power stations would be unable to receive government consent unless they could demonstrate that they would be able to effectively capture and bury 25% of the emissions they produce immediately, with a view to seeing that rise to 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a government source told ''[[the Guardian]]'', effectively represented "a complete rewrite of UK energy policy for the future".<ref>{{cite news|first1=John |last1=Vidal |first2=Juliette |last2=Jowit |title=Ed Miliband promises new era of clean coal&nbsp;– but who will pay? |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 April 2009 |quote=Instead of a laissez-faire system where companies told government what they wanted to build and where, government has decided that reducing climate change emissions cannot be left to the market. |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/24/energy-coal-carbon-capture-environment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426100029/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/24/energy-coal-carbon-capture-environment |archive-date=26 April 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

Miliband represented the UK at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 Copenhagen Summit]], from which emerged a global commitment to provide an additional US$10&nbsp;billion a year to fight the effects of [[climate change]], with an additional $100&nbsp;billion a year provided by 2020.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ed |last=Miliband |date=20 December 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/20/copenhagen-climate-change-accord |location=London |title=The road from Copenhagen |archive-date=22 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222084134/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/20/copenhagen-climate-change-accord |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The conference was not able to achieve a legally binding agreement.

During the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 parliamentary expenses scandal]], Miliband was named by the ''Daily Telegraph'' as one of the "saints" of the scandal, due to his claiming one of the lowest amounts of expenses in the House of Commons and submitting no claims that later had to be paid back.<ref>{{cite news|access-date=13 August 2009 |location=London |date=18 May 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=8 |title=MPs' expenses: The saints |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521124729/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=8 |archive-date=21 May 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Leadership of the Labour Party==

===Leadership election===
[[File:Ed Miliband on August 27, 2010.jpg|thumb|Miliband in his leadership campaign, 2010.]]
Following the [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|formation]] of the [[Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government]] on 11 May 2010, Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader]] Harriet Harman took over as Acting Leader and became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. On 14 May, Miliband announced that he would stand as a candidate in the [[2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|forthcoming leadership election]].<ref>{{cite news|url-status=live |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8684063.stm |title=Ed Miliband to take on brother David in leader battle |work=BBC News |date=16 May 2010 |access-date=9 June 2010 |archive-date=9 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209144714/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8684063.stm |df=dmy }}</ref> He launched his campaign during a speech given at a [[Fabian Society]] conference and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs.

On 23 May, former Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]] announced that he would endorse Ed Miliband's campaign, saying that he had "the capacity to inspire people" and that he had "strong values and the ability to 'lift' people".<ref>{{cite news|access-date=13 September 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/23/ed-miliband-neil-kinnock-labour-leadership |title=Ed Miliband wins crucial backing from Neil Kinnock in Labour leadership race |publisher=The Guardian |work=The Observer |date=23 May 2010 |location=London |first=Toby |last=Helm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524172850/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/23/ed-miliband-neil-kinnock-labour-leadership |archive-date=24 May 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Other senior Labour figures who backed the younger Miliband included Tony Benn and former deputy leaders [[Roy Hattersley]] and [[Margaret Beckett]]. By 9 June, the deadline for entry into the leadership election, Miliband had been nominated by just over 24% of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], double the threshold. By September, Miliband had received the support of six trade unions, including both [[Unite the Union|Unite]] and [[UNISON]], 151 of 650 [[Constituency Labour Party|Constituency Labour Parties]], three affiliated socialist societies, and half of Labour [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labourlist.org/ed-milibands-plp-support---running-totals |title=Ed Miliband's support: 73 MPs, 6 MEPs, 151 CLPs, 6 TUs, 3 SSocs |publisher=[[Labour List]] |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=20 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525050213/http://www.labourlist.org/ed-milibands-plp-support---running-totals |archive-date=25 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

On becoming Leader of the Labour Party on 25 September 2010, Miliband also became Leader of the Opposition. At 40, he was the youngest leader of the party ever.

He also called for the [[Press Complaints Commission]] to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and [[Nick Clegg]] – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former ''News of the World'' editor [[Andy Coulson]] to be his [[director of communications]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14027879 |title=Rebekah Brooks must go over Milly 'hacking' – Miliband |work=BBC News |date=5 July 2011 |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140917/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14027879 |archive-date=8 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Cameron later took the unusual step of saying that the government would back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14127282 |title=Phone hacking: Rupert Murdoch could face MPs |work=BBC News |date=12 July 2011 |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713132357/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14127282 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=13 July 2011 |access-date=15 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14142307 |title=News Corp withdraws bid for BSkyB |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713201639/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14142307 |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

Following the [[2011 England riots|riots in England]] in August 2011, Miliband called for a public inquiry into the events, and insisted society had "to avoid simplistic answers". The call for an inquiry was rejected by David Cameron, prompting Miliband to say he would set up his own. In a BBC Radio 4 interview shortly after the riots, Miliband spoke of an irresponsibility that applied not only to the people involved in the riots, but "wherever we find it in our society. We've seen in the past few years...MPs' expenses, what happened in the banks". Miliband also said Labour did not do enough to tackle moral problems during its 13 years in office.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14503023 |work=BBC News |title=Riots: Miliband blames 'me first' culture |date=12 August 2011 |access-date=10 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813032445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14503023 |archive-date=13 August 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> In December 2011 Miliband appointed Tim Livesey, a former adviser to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to be his full-time chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wintour |first=Patrick |access-date=6 February 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/dec/21/ed-miliband-appoints-archbishop-adviser |title=Ed Miliband appoints archbishop's adviser as chief of staff |location=London |date=21 December 2011 |archive-date=25 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725012351/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/dec/21/ed-miliband-appoints-archbishop-adviser |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

In his first speech of 2012, Miliband said that if Labour won the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] times would be difficult economically, but Labour was still the only party capable of delivering "fairness".

Cameron refused, saying it was a matter for the RBS board, leading Miliband to announce that Labour would force a Commons vote on whether or not the government should block it.

At the Labour conference in September 2013, Miliband highlighted his party's stance on the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] and announced if elected Labour would abolish the [[Under-occupancy penalty|bedroom tax]]. The conference included several 'signature' policies, such as strengthening the [[Minimum wage in the United Kingdom|minimum wage]], freezing business rates, building 200,000 houses a year, lowering the [[Voting age#United Kingdom|voting age]] to 16, and the provision of childcare by primary schools between 8{{nbsp}}am and 6{{nbsp}}pm. The policy that attracted the most attention was the commitment to help tackle the 'cost-of-living crisis' by freezing gas and electricity prices until 2017 to give time to 'reset the market' in favour of consumers.{{sfn|Bale|2015|pp = 194–201}} In January 2014, Miliband extended the concept of reform to include the 'big five' banks, in addition to the 'big six' utility companies, and discussed the impact of the cost-of-living on the 'squeezed middle', saying "the current cost-of-living crisis is not just about people on [[tax credit]]s, [[zero-hour contract]]s and the minimum wage. It is about the millions of middle-class families who never dreamt that life would be such a struggle".<ref>{{cite news|title = Ed Miliband: I can save the middle class|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10569973/Ed-Miliband-I-can-save-the-middle-class.html|access-date = 6 June 2015|date = 13 January 2014|website = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|first = James|last = Kirkup|archive-date = 7 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150607061407/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10569973/Ed-Miliband-I-can-save-the-middle-class.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

Throughout 2014, Miliband changed Labour's policy on [[immigration]], partly in response to [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]'s performance in the European and local elections in May, and the close result in the [[2014 Heywood and Middleton by-election|Heywood and Middleton by-election]] in October. Miliband committed to increase funding for border checks, tackle exploitation and the undercutting of wages, require employers who recruit abroad to create apprenticeships, and ensure workers in public-facing roles have minimum standards of English. In November 2014, Labour announced plans to require new EU migrants wait two years before claiming benefits.<ref>{{cite web|title = Our Immigration Reform Bill will set out our new approach to make a real difference.|url = http://www.labour.org.uk/blog/entry/our-immigration-reform-bill-will-set-out-our-new-approach-to-make-a-real-di|website = The Labour Party|access-date = 6 June 2015|date = 23 October 2014|last = Miliband|first = Ed|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150607013112/http://www.labour.org.uk/blog/entry/our-immigration-reform-bill-will-set-out-our-new-approach-to-make-a-real-di|archive-date = 7 June 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = EU migrants would wait two years for jobless benefits, Labour says|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30102310|access-date = 6 June 2015|date = 18 November 2014|archive-date = 19 February 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150219095356/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30102310|url-status = live}}</ref>

Miliband campaigned in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]] with the cross-party [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign, supporting [[Scotland]]'s membership of the United Kingdom. Opinion polls showed solid leads for the 'no' campaign, with a 20 point-lead on 19 August. However, by the end of the month, the lead had fallen to just 6 points, with YouGov analysis showing a big shift in support among Labour supporters. Miliband made an unplanned visit to [[Lanarkshire]] to draw a contrast between a Labour and Conservative future for Scotland within the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title = Ed Miliband causes rift in Better Together campaign|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11076115/Ed-Miliband-causes-rift-in-Better-Together-campaign.html|access-date = 6 June 2015|date = 5 September 2015|website = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last = Cochrane|first = Alan|last2 = Johnson|first2 = Simon|archive-date = 7 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150607061453/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11076115/Ed-Miliband-causes-rift-in-Better-Together-campaign.html|url-status = live}}</ref> A poll on 7 September showed a 2-point lead for the 'yes' campaign, leading to a joint commitment by Miliband, Cameron and Clegg for greater devolution to Scotland through a version of home rule.<ref>{{cite news|title = Scottish independence: Cameron, Miliband and Clegg sign 'No' vote pledge|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29213418|access-date = 6 June 2015|date = 16 September 2014|archive-date = 30 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150630003108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29213418|url-status = live}}</ref> The results on 19 September showed victory for the 'no' campaign, 55.3% to 44.7%.<ref>{{cite web|title = Scottish independence referendum – Results|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results|website = BBC News|access-date = 6 June 2015|archive-date = 12 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512171429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/results|url-status = live}}</ref>

The day after the referendum, Cameron raised the issue of 'English votes for English laws', with Miliband criticising the move as a simplistic solution to a complex problem, eventually coming out in favour for a constitutional convention to be held after the general election.{{sfn|Bale|2015|p = 246}}<ref>{{cite web|title = Labour proposes devolution settlement to 'shape own futures'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/labour-ed-miliband-constitutional-convention|website = [[The Guardian]]|access-date = 6 June 2015|first = Patrick|last = Wintour|date = 19 September 2014|archive-date = 24 April 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424172205/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/labour-ed-miliband-constitutional-convention|url-status = live}}</ref>

The first [[2010 Labour Party (UK) Shadow Cabinet election|election to the Shadow Cabinet]] that took place under Miliband's leadership was on 7 October 2010. Ending days of speculation, David Miliband announced that he would not seek election to the Shadow Cabinet on 29 September, the day nominations closed, saying he wanted to avoid "constant comparison" with his brother Ed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/29/david-miliband-quits-frontline-politics |title=David Miliband quits frontline politics |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 September 2010 |access-date=15 July 2011 |location=London |first=Helene |last=Mulholland |archive-date=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001084844/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/29/david-miliband-quits-frontline-politics |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The three other defeated candidates for the Labour leadership all stood in the election, though Diane Abbott failed to win enough votes to gain a place. Following the election, Miliband unveiled his [[Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband|Shadow Cabinet]] on 8 October 2010. Among others, he appointed [[Alan Johnson]] as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Yvette Cooper was chosen as Shadow Foreign Secretary, and both defeated Labour leadership candidates Ed Balls and Andy Burnham were given senior roles, becoming [[Shadow Home Secretary]] and Shadow Education Secretary respectively. Burnham was also given responsibility for overseeing Labour's election co-ordination.

[[Sadiq Khan]], who managed Miliband's successful leadership campaign, was appointed [[Secretary of State for Justice|Shadow Justice Secretary]] and [[Lord Chancellor|Shadow Lord Chancellor]], and continuing Deputy Leader Harriet Harman continued to shadow [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] Nick Clegg, as well as being made [[Secretary of State for International Development|Shadow International Development Secretary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.labour.org.uk/labours-new-shadow-cabinet |title=Labour's New Shadow Cabinet |publisher=[[Labour Party (UK)]] |access-date=16 October 2010 |archive-date=10 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010195841/http://www2.labour.org.uk/labours-new-shadow-cabinet |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> Alan Johnson would later resign, stepping down for "personal reasons" on 20 January 2011, necessitating Miliband's first reshuffle, in which he made Balls Shadow Chancellor, Cooper Shadow Home Secretary and Douglas Alexander Shadow Foreign Secretary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12242397 |title=Alan Johnson 'to quit front-line politics' |work=BBC News Online |date=20 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121050223/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12242397 |archive-date=21 January 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

On 24 June 2011, it was reported that Miliband was seeking to change the decades-old rule that Labour's Shadow Cabinet would be elected every two years, instead wanting to adopt a system where he alone had the authority to select its members.

Miliband's first electoral tests as Labour Leader came in the elections to the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|Scottish Parliament]], [[2011 National Assembly for Wales election|Welsh Assembly]] and [[2011 United Kingdom local elections|various councils]] across England, excluding London, on 5 May 2011. The results for Labour were described as a "mixed bag", with the party performing well in Wales – falling just one seat short of an overall majority and forming the next [[Welsh Government]] on its own – and making large gains from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in northern councils, including [[Sheffield]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]].

Results were less encouraging in the south of England, and results in Scotland were described as a "disaster", with Labour losing nine seats to the SNP, which went on to gain the Parliament's first ever majority.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13310842 |work=BBC News |title=Vote 2011: Labour 'on way back', says Miliband |date=6 May 2011 |archive-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310162732/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13310842 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Miliband said that following the poor showings in Scotland "lessons must still be learnt".<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite news|location=London |last=Rainsborough |first=Thomas |date=23 May 2011 |url=http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2011/05/12336/ |title=Is Ed's head already on the chopping block? |newspaper=[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312141935/http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2011/05/12336/ |archive-date=12 March 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=29 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Miliband launched Labour's campaign for the [[2012 United Kingdom local elections|2012 local elections]] with a speech in [[Birmingham]], accusing the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] of "betrayal", and claiming that it "lacked the values" that Britain needed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Geoghegan |first=Ben |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17580718 |title=Ed Miliband launches Labour's local election campaign |work=BBC News |date=2 April 2012 |access-date=19 April 2012 |archive-date=2 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402175458/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17580718 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> The Labour results were described as a success, with the party building on its performance the previous year in the north of England and Wales, consolidating its position in northern cities and winning control of places such as [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]].<ref name="localelec2012"/> Labour performed well in the Midlands and South of England, winning control of councils including Birmingham, [[Norwich]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Southampton]].<ref name=localelec2012/> Labour was less successful in Scotland than England and Wales, but retained control of [[Glasgow]] despite predictions it would not.<ref name=localelec2012/> Overall, Labour gained over 800 councillors and control of 22 councils.<ref name=localelec2012>{{cite news|work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17946745 |title=At-a-glance: Elections 2012 |date=4 May 2012 |access-date=4 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504104940/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17946745 |archive-date=4 May 2012 }}</ref>

In April 2013, Miliband pledged ahead of the [[2013 United Kingdom local elections|upcoming county elections]] that Labour would change planning laws to give local authorities greater authority to decide what shops can open in their high streets.

In May 2014, Miliband led Labour through the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament elections]], where the party increased its number of [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] from 13 to 20. Labour came second with 24.4% of the vote, finishing ahead of the Conservatives but behind the [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]. This was the first time since the [[1984 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1984]] that the largest opposition party had failed to win the most seats in European elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1268952/european-elections-ukip-tops-british-polls|title=European Elections: UKIP Tops British Polls|date=28 April 2015|work=Sky News|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-date=27 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527092300/http://news.sky.com/story/1268952/european-elections-ukip-tops-british-polls|url-status=live}}</ref> On the same day, Labour polled ahead of all other parties at the [[2014 United Kingdom local elections|local elections]], winning 31% of the vote and taking control of six additional councils.

On 30 March 2015, the Parliament of the United Kingdom dissolved and [[2015 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] was called for 7 May. Miliband began his campaign by launching a "manifesto for business", stating that only by voting Labour would the UK's position within the European Union be secure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2015-32057645|title=Election Live – 30 March|work=BBC News|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-date=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402043505/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2015-32057645|url-status=live}}</ref> Miliband subsequently unveiled five pledges at a rally in Birmingham which would form the focus of a future Labour government, specifically identifying policies on deficit reduction, living standards, the NHS, immigration controls and tuition fees.

Throughout the campaign for the 7 May elections, Miliband insisted that [[David Cameron]] should debate him one on one as part of a televised election broadcast <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32345462|title=Ed Miliband to David Cameron: 'Debate me one on one'|work=BBC News|access-date=8 May 2015|archive-date=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419005630/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32345462|url-status=live}}</ref> in order to highlight differences in policies between the two major parties, but this was never to happen, with the pair instead being interviewed separately by [[Jeremy Paxman]] as part of the first major televised political broadcast of the election involving multiple parties.

Despite opinion polls leading up to the general election predicting a tight result, Labour decisively lost the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|7 May general election]] to the Conservatives. Although gaining 22 seats, Labour lost all but one of its MPs in Scotland and ended up with a net loss of 26 seats, failing to win a number of key marginal seats that it had expected to win comfortably. After being returned as MP for [[Doncaster North]], Miliband stated that it had been a "difficult and disappointing" night for Labour.<ref>{{cite web|title = Results of the 2015 General Election|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results/|website = BBC News|access-date = 3 June 2015|archive-date = 4 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150604062523/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2015/results|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Election results: Conservatives win majority|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32633099|access-date=29 July 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=8 May 2015|archive-date=29 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729125603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32633099|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=The marginal seats that swung the wrong way for Labour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/general-election-uk-marginal-seats-swung-wrong-way-labour-bolton-west|access-date=29 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 March 2015|archive-date=9 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809200321/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/general-election-uk-marginal-seats-swung-wrong-way-labour-bolton-west|url-status=live}}</ref> Following David Cameron's success in forming a majority government, Miliband resigned as Leader of the Labour Party on 8 May, with [[Harriet Harman]] becoming acting leader while a [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|leadership election]] was initiated.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ed-miliband-to-resign-as-labour-leader|title=Ed Miliband resigns as Labour leader|last1=Wintour|first1=Patrick|last2=Mason|first2=Rowena|date=8 May 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-date=9 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509080420/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/ed-miliband-to-resign-as-labour-leader|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/how-many-seats-did-labour-win-10233557.html|title=How many seats did Labour win?|first=Sophie|last=McIntyre|date=8 May 2015|work=The Independent|access-date=20 September 2017|archive-date=10 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510003244/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/how-many-seats-did-labour-win-10233557.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Jeremy Corbyn]] succeeded Miliband as leader.

==Policies and views==

Miliband described himself as a new type of Labour politician, looking to move beyond the divisiveness of [[Blairism]] and [[Brownism]], and calling for an end to the "factionalism and psychodramas" of Labour's past. He also repeatedly spoke of the need for a "new politics".<ref>{{cite news|location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8025055/Ed-Miliband-Self-confessed-maths-geek-with-a-talent-for-diplomacy.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |first=Melissa |last=Kite |title=Ed Miliband: Self-confessed maths 'geek' with a talent for diplomacy |date=25 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724234433/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8025055/Ed-Miliband-Self-confessed-maths-geek-with-a-talent-for-diplomacy.html |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

During his time as Labour leader, Miliband criticised then-[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Leader]] and Prime Minister David Cameron for "sacrificing everything on the altar of deficit reduction", and has accused him of being guilty of practising "old politics", citing alleged broken promises on areas such as crime, policing, bank bonuses, and child benefit.<ref name=http>{{cite news

Miliband was also particularly critical of former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat Leader]] and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg following the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, accusing him of "betrayal" and of "selling-out" his party's voters. In 2010, he stated that he would demand Clegg's resignation as a precursor to any future Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition under his own leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11016944 |work=BBC News |date=18 August 2010 |title=Ed Miliband 'won't work in coalition with Clegg' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818193507/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11016944 |archive-date=18 August 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> In the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|2011 Alternative Vote referendum]] campaign he refused to share a platform with Clegg, stating that he had become "too toxic" a brand and that he would harm the "Yes to AV" campaign.

Following the death of former Prime Minister and Conservative Leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, Miliband spoke in a House of Commons sitting specially convened to pay tributes to her. He noted that, although he disagreed with a few of her policies, he respected "what her death means to the many, many people who admired her". He also said that Thatcher "broke the mould" in everything she had achieved in her life, and that she had had the ability to "overcome every obstacle in her path".<ref>{{cite news|date=10 April 2013 |access-date=10 April 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/apr/10/cameron-miliband-tribute-thatcher-video |title=David Cameron and Ed Miliband pay tribute to Baroness Thatcher |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411053750/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2013/apr/10/cameron-miliband-tribute-thatcher-video |archive-date=11 April 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> He had previously praised Thatcher shortly before the Labour Party Conference in September 2012 for creating an "era of aspiration" in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ross |first=Tim |title=Ed Miliband: it's good to be rich 'if you make it the hard way' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/9544538/Ed-Miliband-its-good-to-be-rich-if-you-make-it-the-hard-way.html |access-date=22 December 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=14 September 2012 |archive-date=14 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914235059/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/9544538/Ed-Miliband-its-good-to-be-rich-if-you-make-it-the-hard-way.html |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Media portrayal===
Miliband was portrayed during Labour's 2015 election campaign as being genuine in his desire to improve the lives of working people and to display progression from [[New Labour]], but was unable to defeat interpretations of him as being ineffectual, or even cartoonish in nature.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Political illustrators perceived a resemblance to Wallace of the British animation [[Wallace and Gromit]] and greatly exaggerated this in caricatures; various images circulated in the press and online media of Miliband performing day-to-day activities such as [[Ed Miliband bacon sandwich photograph|eating a bacon sandwich]], donating money to a beggar, and giving a kiss to his wife, all while displaying apparently awkward facial expressions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In a March 2015 ''[[Newsnight]]'' election debate, he was challenged by [[Jeremy Paxman]] as to whether or not he was 'tough enough' to be Prime Minister, responding, "Hell yes, I'm tough enough", in reference to his reluctance to support air strikes against extremist targets in Syria.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32080184|title=Analysis: 'Hell yes, I'm tough enough to be PM'|newspaper=BBC News|date=27 March 2015|last1=Hawkins|first1=Ross|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-date=22 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822030000/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32080184|url-status=live}}</ref>
