The '''University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences''' (also known as '''SAS''') is the home of the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], and [[natural sciences]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Formerly known as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, SAS is an umbrella organization that is divided into three main academic components.

The '''[[University of Pennsylvania College of Arts & Sciences|College of Arts & Sciences]]''' (CAS) is Penn's undergraduate liberal arts school. The Graduate Division offers post-undergraduate M.A., M.S., and Ph.D. programs. Finally, the College of Liberal and Professional Studies (LPS) is Penn's non-traditional continuing and professional education division.

==History==
The 1755 charter of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s [[College of Philadelphia]] paved the way to form the [[University of Pennsylvania College of Arts & Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]], which was originally for men only. In 1933, Penn established the College of Liberal Arts for Women, which was meant to provide women with a formal liberal arts education to women rather than one designed specifically for teachers.<ref name=college>{{cite web |url=https://www.college.upenn.edu/college-history |title=History of the College |publisher=[[Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref> Female education remained formally separate until 1974 when it merged with CAS, LPS, and four social science departments in the [[University of Pennsylvania Wharton School|Wharton School]] to form the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. This was renamed the School of Arts and Sciences two years later.<ref name=history/>

The Graduate Division's origins date back to 1882 when Penn first appointed faculty to form a philosophy department. Penn first began offering courses for teachers in 1892, paving way for the eventual founding of the LPS school, which was originally called the College of General Studies.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/about/history |title=Our History |publisher=[[Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=February 12, 2018}}</ref>

==Research==
Research at SAS is funded by the Center for Undergraduate Research and Fellowships (CURF), as well as the University Research Foundation.
