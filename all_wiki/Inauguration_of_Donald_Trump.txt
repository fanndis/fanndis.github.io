A luncheon at the U.S. Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing president and first lady). The menu for the 2017 inaugural luncheon, which in the past has often featured dishes representative of the home states of the new president and vice president, included more traditional dishes from around the country.<ref name="menu">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/trump-inaugural-lunch-menu/ |title=Here's Donald Trump's inaugural lunch menu |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |date=January 17, 2017 |author=Mueller, Eleanor |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121114047/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/trump-inaugural-lunch-menu/ |archivedate=January 21, 2017  }}</ref> The first course consisted of [[Maine lobster]] and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, accompanied by a [[J.
