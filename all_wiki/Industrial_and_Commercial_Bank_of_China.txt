ICBC was simultaneously listed on both the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] on 27 October 2006. It was the world's largest [[initial public offering|IPO]] at that time valued at US$21.9 billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4 billion IPO by [[Japan]]'s [[NTT DoCoMo]] in 1998.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/BUSINESS/09/27/china.icbc.reut/index.html] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2010, [[Agricultural Bank of China]] broke ICBC's IPO record when it raised $22.1 billion. China's largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.

ICBC raised at least US$14 billion in [[Hong Kong]] ([[H-shares]]) and another US$5.1 billion in [[Shanghai]] ([[A-share (mainland China)|A-shares]]). Due to heavy subscriptions, the [[greenshoe]] (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and ICBC's take rose to US$21.9 billion (17% of ICBC's market value before the IPO), divided in US$16 billion in Hong Kong and US$5.9 billion in Shanghai. Following the global offering, the [[free float]] of shares was 22.14% of the [[market capitalization]].

At the end of its first day of trading, the bank's shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in Hong Kong, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], ICBC's [[market capitalisation]] at the end of trade based on its Hong Kong shares was US$156.3 billion, making its equity the world's fifth highest among banks, just behind [[JPMorgan Chase]]. Meanwhile, ICBC's Shanghai-listed A-shares recorded more modest gains and ended up 5.1% from the offering price of RMB 3.12.

During July 2007 ICBC was ranked 30th in the world in terms of revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.hereisthecity.com/news/business_news/6935.cntns|title=HITC Business - News|website=News.hereisthecity.com|accessdate=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311110100/http://news.hereisthecity.com/news/business_news/6935.cntns|archive-date=11 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>
