==Background and composition==
"Should've Said No" is an up-tempo song,{{Sfn|Murphy|2013|p=197}} in which Swift addresses a former lover who has cheated on her, telling him that he "should've said no" to the woman who has taken her place in his life ("You should've said no/You should've gone home/You should've thought twice before you let it all go/You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her would get back to me"). Swift wrote the song when she was sixteen years old<ref name="Country Weekly">{{cite journal |last=Horner |first=Marianne |date=October 20, 2008 |title=Story Behind the Song: Don't Cheat on a Songwriter |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=15 |issue=21 |page=14}}</ref> because "something really, really dramatic and crazy" was happening to her, and she felt that she needed "to address it in the form of music".<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite news|last1=Scaggs|first1=Austin|title=Taylor's Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|accessdate=July 15, 2015|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 25, 2010}}</ref> According to the ''[[Country Weekly]]'' magazine, she was inspired to write it after she discovered that her boyfriend at the time had cheated on her. The first line that came to her was the title, and she wrote the chorus in five minutes. Swift has also said that many of the lyrics were based on actual words that she used when confronting her ex-boyfriend.<ref name="Country Weekly" /> She compared the song to her previous single "[[Picture to Burn]]". While "Picture to Burn" has an "angry and I'm-done-with-him attitude", "Should've Said No" is "more of a moral statement. It's an 'I love you, we were awesome and great together, but you messed this up and I would still be with you' kinda thing. You said yes, and you should've said no."<ref>{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift Says Yes To "No"|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/cda/article_print/0,3008,GAC_26063_5869535_DS-ARTICLE-RIGHT-RAIL,00.html|publisher=[[Great American Country]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122060805/http://www.gactv.com/gac/cda/article_print/0,3008,GAC_26063_5869535_DS-ARTICLE-RIGHT-RAIL,00.html|archivedate=November 22, 2008|date=May 19, 2008}}</ref> The song was a last-minute addition to ''Taylor Swift''—Swift wrote the song two days before the [[audio mastering|mastering]] was scheduled, and booklets were about to be printed. She then called her producer and completed the song overnight.<ref name="Rolling Stone" /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Mullins|first1=Jenna|title=45 Things You Didn't Know About Taylor Swift Songs|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/596115/45-things-you-didn-t-know-about-taylor-swift-songs|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015|date=November 13, 2014}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
"Should've Said No" received critical acclaim along with "[[Picture to Burn]]". Roger Holland of [[PopMatters]] said that "Should've Said No" is "a truly splendid [[pop-rock]] song wrapped up in an almost entirely spurious country arrangement."<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/taylor-swift-taylor-swift/|title=Taylor Swift: Taylor Swift|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|first=Roger|last=Holland|date=November 9, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref> Chris Neal of ''[[Country Weekly]]'' believed "Should've Said No" and her previous single "[[Picture to Burn]]", were the most immediately striking songs on ''Taylor Swift''.<ref name="weekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/taylor_swift/reviews/348|title=''Taylor Swift'' review|last=Neal|first=Chris|date=4 December 2006|work=Country Weekly|accessdate=March 31, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722135746/http://www.countryweekly.com/reviews/taylor-swift|archivedate=July 22, 2012}}</ref> Alison Bonaguro of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' named the song along with "[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]" and "Invisible" as "revenge songs," and commented that Swift's themes stayed the same throughout the concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-02-04/features/0802030083_1_taylor-swift-acoustic-miley-cyrus|title=Taylor Swift a prodigy who's coming of age|first=Alison|last=Bonaguro|date=February 4, 2008|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> Country music blog Engine 145 gave the song a "thumbs down" review. Reviewer Matt C. criticized the production as being [[Loudness war|"too loud"]], and thought that Swift's vocals were overly reliant on pitch correction and "not amenable" to the song's concept.<ref name="engine145">{{cite web |url=http://www.engine145.com/taylor-swift-shouldve-said-no/ |title=Taylor Swift - "Should've Said No" |accessdate=July 13, 2008 |last=C. |first=Matt |date=May 14, 2008 |work=Engine 145 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218103741/http://www.engine145.com/taylor-swift-shouldve-said-no/ |archivedate=December 18, 2014 }}</ref>
