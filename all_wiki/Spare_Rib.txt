'''''Spare Rib''''' was a [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave]] [[:Category:Feminist magazines|feminist magazine]] in the United Kingdom that emerged from the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture]] of the late 1960s as a consequence of meetings involving, among others, [[Rosie Boycott]] and [[Marsha Rowe]]. ''Spare Rib'' is now recognised as an iconic magazine, which shaped debate about [[feminism in the UK]], and as such it was digitised by the [[British Library]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Spare Rib Digitisation Project|url=https://www.bl.uk/spare-rib/about-the-project|website=The British Library|accessdate=4 April 2018|language=en}}</ref> The magazine contained new writing and creative contributions which challenged stereotypes and supported collective solutions. It was published between 1972 and 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=A short history of the most radical DIY magazines|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/30762/1/orlando-magazine-on-a-short-history-of-the-most-radical-diy-magazines|accessdate=5 October 2016|work=Dazed}}</ref> The title derives from [[Eve#Creation|the Biblical reference to Eve]], the first woman, created from Adam's rib.

==History==
''Spare Rib''{{'}}s first issue was published in June 1972.<ref name=grf/> At the time, some newsagents refused to stock it, including [[WHSmith|W. H. Smith]]. Selling at first around 20,000 copies per month, it was circulated more widely through women's groups and networks.

Its purpose, as described in its editorial, was to investigate and present alternatives to the traditional gender roles for women of virgin, wife or mother.<ref>[http://womenshistorynetwork.org/blog/?p=769 "Women’s History Month: Spare Rib"], Women's History Network, 22 March 2011.</ref>

The name ''Spare Rib'' started as a joke, with its play on words about the Biblical Eve fashioned out of Adam’s rib, implying that a woman had no independence from the beginning of time. This held the witty, subversive connotations the editors had been looking for.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2015/may/the-design-of-spare-rib/|title=The design of Spare Rib|work=Creative Review|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref>

The ''Spare Rib'' Manifesto stated: <blockquote>"The concept of Women’s Liberation is widely misunderstood, feared and ridiculed. Many women remain isolated and unhappy. We want to publish Spare RIB to try to change this. We believe that women’s liberation is of vital importance to women now and, intrinsically, to the future of our society. Spare RIB will reach out to all women, cutting across material, economic and class barriers, to approach them as individuals in their own right".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/facsimile-of-spare-rib-manifesto|title=Facsimile of Spare Rib manifesto|work=The British Library|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref></blockquote>Early articles were linked closely with left-leaning political theories of the time, especially [[anti-capitalism]] and the exploitation of women as consumers through fashion. The covers were often of a striking design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/life/best-of-spare-rib|title=The Best of Spare Rib|work=Stylist Magazine|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref>
  
As the [[women's movement]] evolved during the 1970s, the magazine became a focus for sometimes acrimonious debate between the many streams that emerged within the movement, such as [[socialist feminism]], [[radical feminism]], revolutionary feminism, [[lesbian feminism]], [[liberal feminism]] and [[black feminism]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Sue|title=Feminists and Flourbombs |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/F/flourbombs/essay.html|publisher=Channel 4 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916221109/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/F/flourbombs/essay.html |archivedate=16 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It included contributors from well-known international feminist writers, activists and theorists as well as the stories of ordinary women in their own words.

''Spare Rib'' articles tackled many different threads of feminism from many different angles.  Subjects included: “liberating orgasm”, “kitchen sink racism”, [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] and the practice of  [[Female genital mutilation in the United Kingdom|female genital mutilation]]. The ensuing debates were often acrimonious, and the magazine reflected the sometimes turbulent debates within the collective on how best to tackle issues such as sexuality and racism.<ref name=":0"/>

Suffering from the effects of falling subscriptions and advertising revenue ''Spare Rib'' ceased publication in 1993.<ref name="grf">{{cite web|title=Spare Rib (Magazine, 1972-1993)|url=http://www.grassrootsfeminism.net/cms/node/234|work=Grassroots Feminism|accessdate=10 August 2015|date=7 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Elke Zobl|author2=Ricarda Drüeke|title=Feminist Media: Participatory Spaces, Networks and Cultural Citizenship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLPJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA56|accessdate=27 October 2015|date=March 2014|publisher=Transcript Verlag|isbn=978-3-8394-2157-4|page=56}}</ref>

== Editors ==
[[File:Spare-rib-manifesto.jpg|thumb|The founders of ''Spare Rib'' set out to set the record straight on Women’s Liberation.  They sought to reach out to all women and in their manifesto they explain what was wrong with contemporary women’s magazines and how their alternative would offer realistic solutions to the problems experienced by women - See more at: <nowiki>http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/facsimile-of-spare-rib-manifesto#sthash.R3Kuul6I.dpuf</nowiki>]]
''Spare Rib'' became a collective by the end of 1973 (see ''Spare Rib Reader'', edited by [[Marsha Rowe]], and [[Rosie Boycott]], ''A Nice Girl Like Me''). The collective editorial policy was to: "collectively decide on articles that they publish, and work closely with the contributors. Accept articles from men only when there is no other resource available. 35p per copy."<ref name="grf"/>

==Design==
According to Marsha Rowe, one of the original magazine designers, the "look" of ''Spare Rib'', which resulted in so many iconic and striking covers, was born out of necessity. It had to look like a [[List of women's magazines|women’s magazine]], yet with contents that did not reflect the conformist stereotyping of women. ''Spare Rib'' covers were often controversial. It had to suggest the familiarity of women’s magazines – 'like a good friend, intimate, loyal, supportive – while also being challenging, questioning, exciting and radical'.<ref name=":1"/> The designers had to transform the name ''Spare Rib'' into a magazine title. They had to create the front cover look, and an overall style for the pages inside the magazine. The design had to be both stable and flexible, to allow for future change while retaining the feel and basic identity. Integral to every decision was cost. "Money and professionalism went hand in hand."<ref name=":1"/>

New, young illustrators and photographers were keen to work for the magazine, enjoying the challenge of finding a [[visual language]] to express the new ideas of the magazine. 

Finding non-sexist advertising in accordance with the values of the magazine was another challenge.

==Legacy==
It was reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in April 2013 that the magazine was due to be relaunched, with the journalist [[Charlotte Raven]] at the helm.<ref>Ben Dowell, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/25/sarah-raven-relaunch-spare-rib "Spare Rib magazine to be relaunched by Charlotte Raven"], ''The Guardian'', 25 April 2013.</ref> It was subsequently announced that while a magazine and website were to be launched, it would now have a different name.<ref>Charlotte Raven, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10138461/My-wounding-battle-with-Spare-Rib-founders-over-feminism-2.0.html "My 'wounding' battle with Spare Rib founders over feminism 2.0"], ''The Telegraph'', 24 June 2013.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/spare-rib-founders-threaten-legal-action-over-magazine-relaunch-8658161.html|title='Spare Rib' founders threaten legal action over magazine relaunch|work=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref>

In May 2015, the [[British Library]] put its complete archive of ''Spare Rib'' online.<ref name=":0">[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/28/british-library-spare-rib-feminist-magazine-online Spare Rib goes digital: 21 years of radical feminist magazine put online] ''The Guardian''. 28 May 2015. Retrieved 10 August 2015.</ref> The project was led by [[Polly Russell]], the curator behind an [[oral history]] of the [[women's liberation movement]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Women's Liberation Movement|url=https://www.bl.uk/events/secondary-womens-liberation-movement|website=The British Library|accessdate=4 April 2018|language=en|quote=Join Polly Russell, Lead Curator for Contemporary Archives and Manuscripts, for a discussion on feminism. Polly was the British Library lead on Sisterhood and After, a project and website to create the UK’s first ever oral history archive of the Women’s Liberation Movement. Polly was also the lead for a project which digitised and made freely available the feminist magazine Spare Rib.}}</ref> The archive is presented with new views on the subject matter and themes curated by expert commentators. The British Library website describes the value of ''Spare Rib'' for current readers and researchers: <blockquote>"''Spare Rib'' was the largest feminist circulating magazine of the Women’s Liberation Movement (WLM) in Britain of the 1970s and 80s. It remains one of the movement’s most visible achievements. The trajectory of Spare Rib charted the rise and demise of the Women’s Liberation Movement and as a consequence is of interest to feminist historians, academics and activists and to those studying social movements and media history".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/spare-rib/about-the-project#sthash.0S06JNgE.dpuf|title=About the Spare Rib Digitisation Project|work=The British Library|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

In February 2019 the British Library announced a possible suspension of access to the archive in the event of a no-deal [[Brexit]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/socialscience/2019/02/spare-rib-archive-possible-suspension-of-access.html|title=Possible Suspension of Access|work=The British Library|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/25/spare-rib-digital-archive-no-deal-brexit-british-library|work=The Guardian|title=Spare Rib digital archive faces closure in event of no-deal Brexit|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|date=25 February 2019}}</ref>
