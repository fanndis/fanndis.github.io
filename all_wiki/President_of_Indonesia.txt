== History ==

=== Sukarno era ===
The Indonesian presidency was established during the formulation of the [[Constitution of Indonesia|1945 Constitution]] by the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when [[Sukarno]] was elected by acclamation by the [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence]] (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the Constitution, "the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI." Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR), had not yet been formed.<ref name="KAHIN138">Kahin, George McTurnan (1952) ''Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia'', Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|0-8014-9108-8}} p138</ref> On 16 October 1945, Vice President [[Mohammad Hatta]] announced a vice-presidential [[Vice-Presidential Edict No.X|decree]] which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.<ref name="KAHIN152">Kahin, George McTurnan (1952) ''Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia'', Cornell University Press, {{ISBN|0-8014-9108-8}} p152</ref>  On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a [[de facto]] parliamentary democracy with the president as a ceremonial Head of State whose function was to ask the prime minister as the Head of the Government to form a new Cabinet.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], both Sukarno and Hatta were captured by the Dutch in [[Yogyakarta]] on 18 December 1948. Sukarno then gave a mandate for [[Sjafruddin Prawiranegara]] to form an emergency Government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/urangawak@yahoogroups.com/msg01229.html|title=[Urangawak&#x5D; Peran PDRI Akhirnya Diakui<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=12 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011014520/http://www.mail-archive.com/urangawak@yahoogroups.com/msg01229.html|archive-date=11 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.<ref>{{cite web|last=Djalal |first=Hasjim |url=http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0208/16/opini/meng27.htm |title=Mengenang Dubes Palar dan Diplomasi Indonesia |work=Kompas |date=16 August 2002 |accessdate=12 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316075544/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0208/16/opini/meng27.htm |archivedate=16 March 2005 }}</ref> On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to [[Assaat]].<ref>[http://www.dataphone.se/~ahmad/991128.htm 991128<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413055132/http://www.dataphone.se/~ahmad/991128.htm|date=13 April 2007}}</ref> When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a [[unitary state]], Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.

Indonesia now adopted the constitution that had been intended for RIS. Officially known as the Provisional Constitution, the document confirmed the president's role as the head of state, but limited him to a mostly ceremonial role.  He appointed a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjdih.depkeu.go.id/fulltext/1950/UUDSTAHUN~1950UUDS.HTM|title=Temporal Constitution of Indonesia 1950|publisher=Ministry of Finance of Indonesia|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=15 August 1950}}</ref>

Despite his limited constitutional role, Sukarno commanded great moral authority.  Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy. In the early 1950s, he began calling for the implementation of "[[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy]]," in which decisions would be made after lengthy deliberation with a view toward achieving a consensus under presidential "guidance."

The rest of the decade saw a series of unstable governments.  Taking advantage of the situation, Sukarno made a speech in April 1959 and suggested that Indonesia return to the 1945 Constitution.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.republika.co.id/koran_detail.asp?id=30554&kat_id=84&kat_id1=&kat_id2=|title=Republika Online|website=Republika Online}}</ref> The People reacted enthusiastically and there was strong pressure on the [[Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia|Constitutional Assembly]], the body responsible for formulating a new constitution, to adopt the 1945 Constitution. When the assembly did not budge, Sukarno issued a [[President Sukarno's 1959 Decree|presidential decree]] on 5 July 1959 declaring that Indonesia was returning to the 1945 Constitution.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  That document made the president head of government as well as head of state.  In May 1963, the People's Consultative Assembly appointed Sukarno [[president for Life]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Ricklefs| first = M.C. | author-link = M. C.

Although Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, it did not mean that it was strictly adhered to. The MPR, which at this stage was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status. In 1967, Sukarno was forced to resign as president, and army chief of staff [[Suharto]] was appointed as acting president.

=== Suharto era ===
Suharto was appointed president in his own right in 1968. During his rise to power, Suharto seemed determined to observe at least the forms of the constitution, and this continued when he became president. Suharto allowed the MPR to execute its constitutional duty of formulating the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN); as president, he was responsible for implementing them. Suharto also made it a presidential obligation to deliver accountability speeches near the end of his terms. During the speech, Suharto outlined the achievements that his administration had made and how those achievements had adhered to the GBHN set by the MPR. Despite the constitutional and democratic façade, Suharto made sure that the MPR was also subservient to him. In 1969, a law was passed that required appointments to the MPR to be made official by the president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hukumonline.com/pusatdata/download/lt4c330d2473f3d/node/24788|title=Law of Indonesia Number 6 Year 1969 (UU No.6/1969) about The composition and rating of People's Consultative Assembly, People's Representative Council and Regional People's Representative Council|publisher=Hukum Online|date=17 December 1969|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> He also took measures that largely emasculated the opposition parties. For example, he had the power to issue governmental regulations in lieu of law, which nominally had to be approved by the House of People's Representatives (DPR, the pre-2004 legislative branch).  However, given the DPR's infrequent sessions and the near-total dominance of the pro-government political grouping, [[Golkar]], such approval was a mere formality.  Thus, for all intents and purposes, Suharto ruled by decree for most of his tenure.  For the better part of Suharto's rule, he effectively held all governing power in the nation.

=== Reform era ===
Suharto [[Fall of Suharto|fell from power]] in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, [[B. J. Habibie]] had his only accountability speech rejected.<ref>Friend, Theodore (2003) ''Indonesian Destinies'', The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-674-01834-6}}, p461</ref> [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his Vice President, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/26/gender.uk1|title=Special report: Indonesia and East Timor|author=John Aglionby|date=July 2001|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>

During the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/indonesian/archive/2001-11/a-2001-11-06-1-1.cfm|title= MPR dan Pemilihan Presiden Langsung|date=6 November 2001|publisher=VOA Indonesia|access-date=20 July 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825164529/http://www.voanews.com/indonesian/archive/2001-11/a-2001-11-06-1-1.cfm|archivedate=25 August 2006}}</ref> In 2004 [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.

The 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law [[Prabowo Subianto]] against the governor of Jakarta, [[Joko Widodo]]. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, [[Jusuf Kalla]], were sworn-in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.
