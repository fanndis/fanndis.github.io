{{Politics of Ukraine}}

The '''Constitution of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Конституція України}}) is the [[constitution|fundamental law]] of Ukraine. The constitution was adopted and ratified at the 5th session of the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (parliament) of [[Ukraine]] on June 28, 1996.<ref name="UNIANCD28616"/> The constitution was passed with 315 ayes out of 450 votes possible (300 ayes minimum).<ref name="UNIANCD28616">[http://www.unian.info/society/1389415-ukraine-celebrating-20th-anniversary-of-constitution.html Ukraine celebrating 20th anniversary of Constitution], [[UNIAN]] (28 June 2016)</ref>

All other laws and other normative legal acts of Ukraine must conform to the constitution. The right to amend the constitution through a special legislative procedure is vested exclusively in the parliament. The only body that may interpret the constitution and determine whether legislation conforms to it is the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]].

Since 1996 the [[public holiday]] [[Constitution Day (Ukraine)|Constitution Day]] is celebrated on June 28.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38117 Yulia Tymoshenko Goes On Trial A Day Before Constitution Day], [[Eurasia Daily Monitor]] (30 July 2011)</ref><ref name=UW29121996>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1996/529606.shtml 1996: THE YEAR IN REVIEW], [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] (29 December 1996)</ref>

In 2004, amendments were adopted that significantly changed Ukraine's political system. These changes are sometimes erroneously referred to as the "2004 Constitution". In 2010, then-[[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] reverted these changes on the basis of a ruling made by the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]]. Following the events of [[Euromaidan]], the 2004 amendments were reinstated.

==History==

Until June 8, 1995, Ukraine's supreme law was the [[Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR|Constitution]] (Fundamental Law) of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] (adopted in 1978, with numerous later amendments). On June 8, 1995, President [[Leonid Kuchma]] and Speaker [[Oleksandr Moroz]] (acting on behalf of the parliament) signed the Constitutional Agreement for the period until a new constitution could be drafted.

The first constitution since independence was adopted during an overnight parliamentary session after almost 24 hours of debate of June 27–28, 1996,<ref name="UNIANCD28616"/> unofficially known as "the constitutional night of 1996." The Law No. 254/96-BP ratifying the constitution, nullifying previous constitutions and the Agreement was ceremonially signed and promulgated in mid-July 1996. However, according to a ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]], the constitution took force at the moment when the results of the parliamentary vote were announced on June 28, 1996 at approx. 9 a.m. [[Kyiv]] Time.<ref name="UNIANCD28616"/> Ukraine was the last of the [[post-Soviet states]] to adopt its own constitution.<ref name="UNIANCD28616"/> On Constitution Day 2018, President [[Petro Poroshenko]] remarked that the 1710 [[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]] is the predecessor of Ukraine's current constitution.<ref>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/514896.html Ukraine's leaders congratulate Ukrainians on Constitution Day], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (28 June 2018)</ref>

On  February 7, 2019, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] voted to amend the constitution to state Ukraine's strategic objectives as joining the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10437570-ukraine-s-parliament-backs-changes-to-constitution-confirming-ukraine-s-path-toward-eu-nato.html|title=Ukraine's parliament backs changes to Constitution confirming Ukraine's path toward EU, NATO|website=www.unian.info|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref>

==Amendments==
In accordance with [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Chapter XIII: Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine|Chapter XIII: Ukraine's Constitution]] can only be amended with the consent of no less than two-thirds of the constitutional composition (the 450 [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|Ukrainian lawmakers]]) of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.<ref>[https://www.unian.info/m/society/10168736-ukraine-marks-constitution-day-on-june-28.html Ukraine marks Constitution Day on June 28], [[UNIAN]] (28 June 2018)</ref><ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/96010/ BYT not to vote for prolonging term of parliament, president], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 31, 2011)</ref>

In addition amendments to Chapter I — "General Principles," Chapter III — "Elections. Referendum," and Chapter XIII — "Introducing Amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine," can only be amended by the parliament of Ukraine on the condition that it is also approved by an All-Ukrainian referendum designated by the President of Ukraine.

In May 2012 [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] set up the [[Constitutional Assembly of Ukraine]]; a special auxiliary agency under the President for drawing up bills of amendments to the Constitution, the president then will introduce them in parliament.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/klitschko-udar-wont-join-work-of-constitutional-assembly-317307.html Klitschko:UDAR won't join work of Constitutional Assembly], [[Kyiv Post]] (7 December 2012)</ref>

===2004 and 2010 amendments and 2014 return to 2004 amendments===
{{details|Imperative mandate (provision in the Constitution of Ukraine)}}
On December 8, 2004, the parliament passed Law No. 2222-IV amending the constitution.<ref>{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=Verkhovna Rada decree|number=2222-IV|law=2222-15|name=About the amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine|date=2004-12-08}}</ref> The law was approved with a 90 percent majority (402 ayes, 21 nays, and 19 abstentions; 300 ayes required for passage) simultaneously with other legislative measures aimed at resolving the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential election crisis]]. It was signed almost immediately in the parliamentary chamber by the outgoing President [[Leonid Kuchma]] and promulgated on the same day.

These amendments weakened the power of the [[President of Ukraine]]; he/she lost the power to nominate the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] and this became the task of the parliament solely.<ref name=HPCEE/> The President could only appoint the [[Minister of Defence of Ukraine|Minister of Defence]] and [[Foreign Minister of Ukraine|Foreign Minister]].<ref name=HPCEE/> The President also lost the right to dismiss members of the [[Cabinet of Ukraine]] but gained the right to dissolve parliament.<ref name=HPCEE>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmtuqFnuDZwC&pg=PA732&dq=Constitution+of+Ukraine+2004&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=MhDkUuLoOeWa0QXPvoGYDw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Constitution%20of%20Ukraine%202004&f=false The Handbook of Political Change in Eastern Europe], [[Edward Elgar Publishing]], 2013, {{ISBN|0857935372}} (page 732)</ref> If no coalition in parliament could be formed to appoint a Prime Minister, the President would have no choice but to call new [[Parliamentary elections in Ukraine|parliamentary elections]].<ref name=JT26306/>

The 2004 constitutional amendments were passed in the Parliament only with limited consultation and discussion between political forces, in the context of the [[Orange Revolution]]. They therefore attracted criticism from several internal (Ukrainian political parties) and external bodies (the [[Council of Europe]], the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Venice Commission]]).<ref name=EUObs>[http://euobserver.com/7/30970 EUObserver], 16 October 2010</ref>

The amendments took force unconditionally on January 1, 2006.<ref name=JT26306>[http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/060compecon/Soviet/Ukraine/060329elect3.txt ELECTION DEFEAT A COLD SHOWER FOR YUSHCHENKO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084720/http://courses.wcupa.edu/rbove/eco343/060compecon/Soviet/Ukraine/060329elect3.txt |date=2016-03-05 }}, [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (29 March 2006)</ref> The remaining amendments took force on May 25, 2006, when the new parliament assembled after the [[2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2006 elections]].

As Constitutional Courts are bound by the Constitution and do not stand above it, such decisions raise important questions of democratic legitimacy and the rule of law".<ref>OPINION ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL SITUATION IN UKRAINE dated December 20, 2010 - Source [[Venice Commission]] http://www.venice.coe.int/WebForms/documents/?pdf=CDL-AD(2010)044-e</ref>
