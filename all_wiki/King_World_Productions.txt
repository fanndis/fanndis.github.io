'''King World Productions, Inc.''' (also known as '''King World Entertainment''', '''King World Enterprises''', or simply '''King World''') is a production company and a syndicator of television programming in the [[United States]] independently established in 1964 until acquired by [[CBS]] in 2000, with its eventual 2007 incorporation into [[CBS Television Distribution]]. The company continues to exist on paper as an intellectual property holder and under the moniker of '''KWP Studios''' to hold the copyright for TV shows like the ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]'' show. 

==History==

===Founding with ''The Little Rascals''===
The division was started in 1964 by Charles King (1912–1972). It was a company that expressly handled television distribution of the [[Hal Roach]]-produced ''[[Our Gang]]'' short comedy films from the 1930s. When Roach lost the rights to the name ''Our Gang'' (it was retained by the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] movie studio, who bought the series from Roach in 1938), the shorts were retitled as ''[[Our Gang|The Little Rascals]]''. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

It was through this acquisition that the comedy shorts made from 1929 through 1938 have been made available to audiences for the past fifty years. King World later co-produced an [[The Little Rascals (animated TV series)|The Little Rascals]] as a TV series with [[Hanna-Barbera]]. King died in 1972 and the company was taken over by King's children: [[Roger King (producer)|Roger M. King]] (1944-2007), Michael (1948-2015),<ref name="Denise Petski">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/michael-king-dead-oprah-syndication-king-world-1201433844/|title=Michael King Dead: TV Exec Who Helped Launch 'Oprah' Show Was 66|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=2015-05-28|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> Robert, Diana (1949-2019),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=diana-king&pid=191206968|title=DIANA KING Obituary|date=2019-01-09|website=Legacy.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Richard, and Karen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Camelot Entertainment Sales and Harpo Productions===
In 1984, King World formed an ad-sales barter division called '''Camelot Entertainment Sales'''. A year later, company chairmen / brothers [[Roger King (producer)|Roger King]] (1944-2007), a producer; and together with brothers: Michael, and Robert acquired the syndication rights to [[Merv Griffin]]'s famous game show, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' when no other studio would step in. The acquisition paid off, and ''Wheel of Fortune'' became the most popular show in the history of TV [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]], and has continued to be for over a quarter of a century since. At one point, the program was generating a 21% of the audience national rating. The same year, the KWP company acquired the syndication rights of ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' from [[Metromedia]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A year later, King World bought the syndication rights to another Griffin show, ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and the latest version of the series (with longtime host [[Alex Trebek]]), which has since become the number-two show in syndication. The company co-produced two pilots of the game show; one in September 1983 and the other on January 9, 1984. Robert King, (son of Charles, brother of producer Roger M.) and the president of King World Productions left the company to form [[Coca-Cola Telecommunications]]; a television syndication company that was founded on October 15 as a joint venture between King, Alan Bennett, and [[Columbia Pictures Television]].<ref name="broadcasting19841015">{{cite journal|date=1984-10-15|title=In Brief|journal=Broadcasting|page=96}}</ref>

On August 6, 1984, King World Productions acquired Leo A. Gutman, Inc. which included 66 feature films including ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'', [[Anna Karenina (1948 film)|''Anna Karenina'']], 14 [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|Sherlock Holmes]] movies and 13 [[East Side Kids]] movies/shorts films and two late 1960s westerns television shows, ''[[Branded (TV series)|Branded]]'' (with [[Chuck Connors]]) and ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'' (with [[Walter Brennan]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1984/BC-1984-08-06.pdf|title=In Brief: King World Productions acquired Leo A. Gutman Inc. for $5 million in cash |page= 98|date=August 6, 1984|work=Broadcasting Magazine}}</ref>

Shortly after this, King World in partnership with [[Oprah Winfrey]] launched [[Harpo Productions]], and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 1986, which eventually led to the creation of the spin-off series ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', in 2002 as well as the latest Harpo Productions contribution, ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]''.

On February 11, 1985, King World formed the King World Enterprises division to develop joint-venture programs with advertisers and station groups and to handle international distribution for King World and Camelot.<ref name="broadcasting19850211">{{cite journal|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1985/BC-1985-02-11.pdf |date=1985-02-11|title=In Brief|journal=Broadcasting|page=94|access-date=2013-06-29}}</ref>

===1990s: King World Direct and KWP===
In the 1990s, King World operated an "[[As seen on TV|As Seen on TV]]" VHS service called '''King World Direct'''.

Stuart Hersch, a lawyer by trade, was the financial expert who helped to take the company public, making it one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street at the time. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The company traded as "KWP". King World had virtually no debt and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues after going public. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Television stations that broadcast King World programming had first choice on any series King World offered to distribute.

On November 25, 1991, King World acquired the ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' format rights from [[Orion Pictures]] after Orion closed down its television division.<ref name="broadcasting19911125">{{cite journal|date=1991-11-25|title=KING GETS THE SQUARE|journal=Broadcasting|page=26}}</ref>

In 1996, King World began co-distributing ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'' (later ''The Geraldo Rivera Show'') with [[Tribune Entertainment]], and would continue co-distributing the show until its cancellation in 1998.

On September 28, 1998, King World acquired the worldwide leasing rights to the solo-developed game shows by Merrill Heatter Productions for a limited time.<ref name="PRN Newswire 1998-9-28">[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=17492 KING WORLD INTERNATIONAL ACQUIRES EXCLUSIVE INTERNATIONAL FORMAT RIGHTS TO GAME SHOW CATALOGUE FROM MERRILL HEATTER PRODUCTIONS, INC.], prnewswire.co.uk</ref>

===CBS and Viacom acquisition===
On January 19, 2000, King World was acquired by [[CBS]]. After CBS' purchase of the company, ''Eyemark Entertainment'', the successor to [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] following the CBS/[[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] merger, was folded into King World.<ref>"The Free Library" [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CBS+Television+Merges+King+World+Productions,+Eyemark+Entertainment...-a058678266 CBS Television Merges King World Productions, Eyemark Entertainment and CBS Broadcast International to Create New Worldwide Distribution Organization.] thefreelibrary.com, Retrieved on January 31, 2013</ref> CBS Enterprises was bought by [[Viacom (1952–2006)|Viacom, Inc.]] around the time of CBS's acquisition of King World, thus becoming owned by the post-split [[CBS Corporation]] as well as all of Viacom's former TV production and distribution operations.

In its latter days, King World was considered the syndication branch of the CBS network (a role Viacom actually first served upon its creation), having succeeded Eyemark in that role. King World, however, distributed newer CBS shows such as ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' while the older shows were syndicated by corporate affiliate [[CBS Studios|CBS Paramount Television]], the successor to the original distributor [[Viacom (original)|Viacom Enterprises]]. Additionally, from 2000 to 2006, King World distributed archive programs from Group W, such as ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''.

On September 26, 2006, CBS announced that King World and CBS Paramount Television's syndication operations would be combined to form the [[CBS Television Distribution]] Group (CTD). Roger King was announced as CEO of the new entity. However, he died on December 8, 2007, after suffering a [[stroke]] the previous day. Paul Franklin currently serves as President of CTD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/paul-franklin-armando-nunez-cbs-television-distribution-president-1201809231/|title=Paul Franklin to Head CBS Television Distribution, Armando Nunez Returns Focus to International|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2016-07-06|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>

For one year, the King World on-screen identity was kept for the programs it distributed at its closure. However, most of the programs handled by King World were distributed under CTD. On September 27, 2007, CBS Television Distribution introduced a new closing logo to replace the old logos of King World, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, and its predecessors.

==Programming==

King World was responsible for the highest rated shows in syndication for over two decades. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} They also had the television rights to a large library of theatrical films. When it was acquired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] in 2000, it distributed a number of [[CBS]]-produced series for syndication, such as ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' (ancillary rights to this series are owned by [[HBO]]), ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]],'' ''[[CSI: NY]]'', and ''[[CSI: Miami]]''. King World turned part of its attention to producing in-house newsmagazines including ''[[American Journal]]'' and ''[[Inside Edition]]''.
