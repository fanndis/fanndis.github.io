'''Stevland Hardaway Morris''' ([[Birth name|né]] '''Judkins'''; born May 13, 1950), known professionally as '''Stevie Wonder''', is an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. A prominent figure in [[popular music]] during the second half of the 20th century, Wonder is one of the [[most successful musicians|most successful songwriters and musicians]]. A virtual [[one-man band]], his use of [[synthesizer]]s and further [[electronic musical instrument]]s during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. He also helped drive the genre into the [[album era]], crafting his [[LP record|LPs]] as cohesive, consistent socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Wonder is often hailed as a "[[genius]]", and has been credited as a pioneer and influence to musicians of various genres including [[rhythm and blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[funk]] and [[jazz]].

Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a [[child prodigy]] known as '''Little Stevie Wonder''', leading him to sign with [[Motown]]'s [[Tamla]] label at the age of 11. In 1963, the single "[[Fingertips (song)|Fingertips]]" was a number-one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] when Wonder was 13, making him the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Age records|youngest artist ever]] to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His "classic period" began in 1972 with the releases of ''[[Music of My Mind]]'' and ''[[Talking Book]]'', the latter featuring "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the [[Clavinet|Hohner Clavinet]] keyboard. His works ''[[Innervisions]]'' (1973), ''[[Fulfillingness' First Finale]]'' (1974) and ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' (1976) all won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], making him the tied-record holder for the most [[Grammy Award records#Most Album of the Year wins|Album of the Year wins]], with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases.

Wonder's "classic period", which culminated in 1976, was noted for his funky style of playing on the keyboard, personal control of production, and series of songs integrated with one another to make a [[concept album]]. In 1979, Wonder made use of the early music sampler [[Computer Music Melodian]] through his composition of the soundtrack album ''[[Stevie Wonder's Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"]]''. It was also his first [[digital recording]], and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings. Wonder's 1970s albums are widely regarded by writers as very influential, as his pioneering stylistic approach to his music helped shaping the sound of pop music in the following [[1980s in music|decade]].

Wonder has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. He has won 22 [[Grammy Awards]]. He was the first Motown artist and second African-American musician to win an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]], for the 1984 film ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]''. Wonder has been inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]], [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Rock Hall of Fame]] and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and has received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday a [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|federal holiday]] in the United States. In 2009, he was named a [[United Nations Messengers of Peace|United Nations Messenger of Peace]]. In 2014, he was honored with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

==Early life==
Wonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], on May 13, 1950,<ref name="blindfaith">{{cite book|first1=Dennis |last1= Love| first2= Stacy| last2= Brown |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2I_vHgAACAAJ |title=Blind Faith: The Miraculous Journey of Lula Hardaway, Stevie Wonder's Mother|publisher= Simon & Schuster|year= 2007| isbn= 978-1-4165-7785-0}}</ref> the third of six children born to Calvin Judkins and songwriter [[Lula Mae Hardaway]]. He was born six weeks premature which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in [[retinopathy of prematurity]], a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes the [[retina]]s to detach, so he became blind.<ref name="incubator">{{cite news|title=Stevie Wonder: Blind faith|work=[[The Independent]] |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stevie-wonder-blind-faith-865838.html |date= July 12, 2008|accessdate=July 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Larry King interview 2010">{{cite web |url= http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1011/30/lkl.01.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110708171546/http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1011/30/lkl.01.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= July 8, 2011 |title=Transcript of interview: Larry King and Stevie Wonder |date=November 30, 2010 |work=Larry King Live |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=January 4, 2011 }}</ref>

When Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved with her children to [[Detroit, Michigan]], where Wonder sang as a child in a choir at the Whitestone Baptist Church.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://archive.org/details/steviewonder00cons | url-access= registration |title= Stevie Wonder| first= Constanze |last= Elsner| date= December 29, 1977|publisher=Popular Library |via=Internet Archive|isbn= 9780445043244}}</ref> She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son's surname to Morris, partly because of relatives. Wonder has retained Morris as his legal surname. He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners and occasionally at parties and dances.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YNae0zmGow4C&pg=PA312 |page=312|title=Icons of R&B and Soul| first= Bob |last= Gulla |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2008|isbn=9780313340468}}</ref>

===1961–1969: Sixties singles===
[[File:Stevie Wonder 1967 (1).jpg|thumb|Wonder rehearsing for a performance on Dutch television in 1967|alt=|273x273px]]

In 1961, when aged 11, Wonder sang his own composition, "Lonely Boy", to [[Ronald White|Ronnie White]] of [[the Miracles]];<ref name="Werner, Craig 2004">{{cite book|first= Craig |last= Werner|title= Higher Ground|publisher= Crown Publishers|year= 2004}}</ref><ref name=Icon313/> White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition at [[Motown]], where CEO [[Berry Gordy]] signed Wonder to Motown's Tamla label.<ref name="blindfaith"/> Before signing, producer [[Clarence Paul]] gave him the name '''Little Stevie Wonder'''.<ref name="incubator"/> Because of Wonder's age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21. He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 ({{Inflation|US|2.5|1961|r=2|fmt=eq}}) per week, and a private tutor was provided for when Wonder was on tour.<ref name=Icon313>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YNae0zmGow4C&pg=PA313 |page=313|title=Icons of R&B and Soul|last=Gulla| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2008|isbn=9780313340468}}</ref>

Wonder was put in the care of producer and songwriter Clarence Paul, and for a year they worked together on two albums. ''[[Tribute to Uncle Ray]]'' was recorded first, when Wonder was still 11 years old. Mainly covers of [[Ray Charles]]'s songs, the album included a Wonder and Paul composition, "Sunset". ''[[The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie]]'' was recorded next, an instrumental album consisting mainly of Paul's compositions, two of which, "Wondering" and "Session Number 112", were co-written with Wonder.<ref name=Icon314>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YNae0zmGow4C&pg=PA314 |page=314|title=Icons of R&B and Soul|last= Gulla|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2008|isbn=9780313340468}}</ref> Feeling Wonder was now ready, a song, "Mother Thank You", was recorded for release as a single, but then pulled and replaced by the Berry Gordy song "I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues" as his début single;<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXSaGI4-SZ8C&pg=PA26 |page=26|title=Stevie Wonder: Rhythms of Wonder|first= Sharon |last= Davis| publisher= Robson| year= 2006|isbn=9781861059659}}</ref> released summer 1962,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JRHnCMUVb8C&pg=PA194 |page=194|title=Motown: The Golden Years|first= Bill |last= Dahl|publisher=Krause Publications|date= February 28, 2011|isbn=9781440227837}}</ref> it almost broke into the ''Billboard'' 100, spending one week of August at 101.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sophomore slumps|page=176|first= Christopher |last=Golden|publisher=Carol Pub.

{{quote box

| quote = Most of these songs hit the charts in a big way before Stevie turned twenty-one [in 1971]. Because he's grown up fast, the love lyrics are less teen-specific than a lot of early [[Smokey Robinson|Smokey]], say, but the music is pure [[puberty]]. Stevie's rockers are always one step ahead of themselves—their gawky groove is so disorienting it makes you pay attention, like a voice that's perpetually changing. The ballads conceive [[coming of age]] more conventionally, and less felicitously. But he sure covered [[Tony Bennett]] better than [[the Supremes]] or [[the Temptations|the Tempts]] could have, now didn't he?

Dropping the "Little" from his name, Moy and Wonder worked together to create the hit "[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]",<ref name=Tenley30/> and Wonder went on to have a number of other hits during the mid-1960s, including "With a Child's Heart", and "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]",<ref name=Gilliland/> a [[Bob Dylan]] cover, co-sung by his mentor, producer Clarence Paul.<ref name=pc50>{{Pop Chronicles|50|2}}</ref> He also began to work in the Motown songwriting department, composing songs both for himself and his label mates, including "[[The Tears of a Clown]]", a No. 1 hit for [[Smokey Robinson and the Miracles]] (it was first released in 1967, mostly unnoticed as the last track of their ''[[Make It Happen (Smokey Robinson & The Miracles album)|Make It Happen]]'' LP, but eventually became a major success when re-released as a single in 1970, which prompted Robinson to reconsider his intention of leaving the group).<ref name=Tenley36>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=V6Cu3SEKObkC&pg=PA36 |page=36|title=Stevie Wonder |last= Williams|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date= January 1, 2002|isbn=9781438122632}}</ref>

In 1968 he recorded an album of instrumental soul/jazz tracks, mostly harmonica solos, under the title ''[[Eivets Rednow]]'', which is "Stevie Wonder" spelled backward.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HISHiLVxVnIC&pg=PA13 |page=13|title=The Sound of Stevie Wonder: His Words and Music|first= James E. |last= Perone|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date= January 1, 2006|isbn=9780275987237}}</ref> The album failed to get much attention, and its only single, a cover of "[[Alfie (Burt Bacharach song)|Alfie]]", only reached number 66 on the U.S. Pop charts and number 11 on the US Adult Contemporary charts.

===1970–1979: Seventies albums and classic period===
In September 1970, at the age of 20, Wonder married [[Syreeta Wright]], a songwriter and former Motown secretary.

As both albums had similar ambitions and themes, they have been compared; in a contemporaneous review by [[Vince Aletti]] in ''Rolling Stone'', Gaye's was seen as successful, while Wonder's was seen as failing due to "self-indulgent and cluttered" production, "undistinguished" and "pretentious" lyrics, and an overall lack of unity and flow.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/where-im-coming-from-19710805 |title=Review: Where I'm Coming From and What's Going On |date=August 5, 1971|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|author-link=Vince Aletti|first= Vince |last= Aletti}}</ref> Also in 1970, Wonder co-wrote, and played numerous instruments on the hit "[[It's a Shame (The Spinners song)|It's a Shame]]" for fellow Motown act [[The Spinners (U.S. band)|the Spinners]]. His contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with Gordy about creative autonomy.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Very Best of Spinners |others=The Spinners |year=1993 |first=Kevin|last= Phinney |page=3 |type=CD booklet |publisher= Rhino Records}}</ref> Reaching his 21st birthday on May 13, 1971, he allowed his Motown contract to expire.<ref name="Posner p254">Posner, Gerald.

During this period, Wonder independently recorded two albums and signed a new contract with [[Motown]] Records. The 120-page contract was a precedent at Motown and gave Wonder a much higher [[Music Royalties|royalty]] rate.<ref name="rshrr80"/> Wonder returned to Motown in March 1972 with ''[[Music of My Mind]]''.

The double album-with-extra-[[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' was released in September 1976.

Until 1979's ''[[Stevie Wonder's Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"]]'' his only release was the retrospective three-disc album ''[[Looking Back (Stevie Wonder album)|Looking Back]]'', an anthology of his early Motown period.

===1980–1990: Commercial period===
The 1980s saw Wonder achieving his biggest hits and highest level of fame; he had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations, political impact, and television appearances. The 1979 mainly instrumental soundtrack album ''[[Stevie Wonder's Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"]]'' was composed using an early music sampler, a [[Computer Music Melodian]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/28/whats-that-sound-sampler| first=David |last= McNamee | date = September 28, 2009 | title =Hey, what's that sound: Sampler | work =[The Guardian }}</ref> It was also his first [[digital recording]], and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings. Wonder toured briefly with an orchestra in support of the album, and used a [[Fairlight CMI]] sampler on stage.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andy |last=Stewart|title=Name Behind the Name: Bruce Jackson – Apogee, Jands, Lake Technology |journal=Audio Technology |issue=40}}</ref> In this year Wonder also wrote and produced the dance hit "[[Let's Get Serious (song)|Let's Get Serious]]", performed by [[Jermaine Jackson]] and (ranked by ''Billboard'' as the No. 1 R&B single of 1980).

''[[Hotter than July]]'' (1980) became Wonder's first platinum-selling single album, and its single "[[Happy Birthday (Stevie Wonder song)|Happy Birthday]]" was a successful vehicle for his campaign to establish Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday as a [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|national holiday]]. The album also included "[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]]", "[[I Ain't Gonna Stand for It]]", and the sentimental ballad, "[[Lately (Stevie Wonder song)|Lately]]".

In 1982, Wonder released a retrospective of his 1970s work with ''[[Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium]]'', which included four new songs: the ten-minute [[funk]] classic "[[Do I Do]]" (which featured [[Dizzy Gillespie]]), "[[That Girl (Stevie Wonder song)|That Girl]]" (one of the year's biggest singles to chart on the [[R&B]] side), "[[Front Line (song)|Front Line]]", a narrative about a soldier in the [[Vietnam War]] that Wonder wrote and sang in the first person, and "[[Ribbon in the Sky]]", one of his many classic compositions. He also gained a No. 1 hit that year in collaboration with [[Paul McCartney]] in their paean to racial harmony, "[[Ebony and Ivory]]".

In 1983, Wonder performed the song "Stay Gold", the theme to [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film adaptation of [[S. E. Hinton]]'s novel ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]''. Wonder wrote the lyrics. In 1983, he scheduled an album to be entitled ''People Work, Human Play''. The album never surfaced and instead 1984 saw the release of Wonder's soundtrack album for ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]''. The lead single, "[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]", was a No. 1 pop and R&B hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was placed 13th in the list of best-selling singles in the UK published in 2002. It went on to win an [[Academy award for best song]] in 1985. Wonder accepted the award in the name of [[Nelson Mandela]] and was subsequently banned from all South African radio by the [[Government of South Africa]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Stevie Wonder Music Banned in South Africa|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/arts/stevie-wonder-music-banned-in-south-africa.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = March 27, 1985|access-date = October 5, 2015|issn = 0362-4331}}</ref> Incidentally, on the occasion of his 35th birthday, Stevie Wonder was honored by the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761|United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid]] for his stance against racism in South Africa that same year (1985).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13 |title=Jet|last=Company|first=Johnson Publishing|date=May 27, 1985|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref> The album also featured a guest appearance by [[Dionne Warwick]], singing the duet "It's You" with Stevie and a few songs of her own. Following the success of the album and its lead single, Wonder made an appearance on [[The Cosby Show]], in the episode "A Touch of Wonder" where he demonstrated his ability to sample. The following year's ''[[In Square Circle]]'' featured the No. 1 pop hit "[[Part-Time Lover]]". The album also has a Top 10 Hit with "Go Home." It also featured the ballad "[[Overjoyed (Stevie Wonder song)|Overjoyed]]", which was originally written for ''Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"'', but did not make the album. He performed "Overjoyed" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' when he was the host. He was also featured in [[Chaka Khan]]'s cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[I Feel For You]]", alongside [[Melle Mel]], playing his signature harmonica. In roughly the same period he was also featured on harmonica on [[Eurythmics]]' single, "[[There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)]]" and [[Elton John]]'s "[[I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues]]".

Wonder was in a featured duet with [[Bruce Springsteen]] on the all-star charity single for African Famine Relief, "[[We Are the World]]", and he was part of another charity single the following year (1986), the AIDS-inspired "[[That's What Friends Are For]]". He played harmonica on the album ''[[Dreamland Express]]'' by [[John Denver]] in the song "If Ever", a song Wonder co-wrote with Stephanie Andrews; wrote the track "I Do Love You" for [[the Beach Boys]]' 1985 [[The Beach Boys (album)|self-titled album]]; and played harmonica on "Can't Help Lovin' That Man" on ''[[The Broadway Album]]'' by [[Barbra Streisand]]. In 1987, Wonder appeared on [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' album, on the duet "Just Good Friends". Michael Jackson also sang a duet with him entitled "Get It" on Wonder's 1987 album ''[[Characters (Stevie Wonder album)|Characters]]''. This was a minor hit single, as were "Skeletons" and "You Will Know".

After 1987's ''Characters'' album, Wonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace. He recorded a soundtrack album for [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[Jungle Fever]]'' in 1991. From this album, singles and videos were released for "Gotta Have You", "Fun Day" (remix only), "These Three Words" and "Jungle Fever". The B-side to the "Gotta Have You" single was "Feeding Off The Love of the Land", which was played during the end credits of the movie ''Jungle Fever'' but was not included on the soundtrack. A piano and vocal version of "Feeding Off The Love of the Land" was also released on the ''[[Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal]]'' compilation. ''[[Conversation Peace]]'' and the live album ''[[Natural Wonder]]'' were released in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/333/stevies_in_town/ |title=Stevie Wonder interview by Pete Lewis |magazine=Blues & Soul |date= March 1995|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

Wonder's first new album in ten years, ''[[A Time to Love (album)|A Time to Love]]'', was released in October 2005 to lower sales than previous albums, and lukewarm reviews—most reviewers appearing frustrated at the end of the long delay to get an album that mainly copied the style of Wonder's "classic period" without doing anything new.<ref name="Brown">{{cite book|page=87|title=Stevie Wonder: Musician|first= Jeremy K. |last= Brown|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year= 2010}}</ref> The first single, "[[So What the Fuss]]", was released in April.
