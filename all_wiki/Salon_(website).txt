'''''Salon''''' is an American [[Progressivism in the United States|politically progressive]]/[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] news and opinion website, created by [[David Talbot]] in 1995. It publishes articles on [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]], culture, and current events.<ref name="politico20160527">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/05/the-fall-of-saloncom-004551 |title=The fall of Salon.com |first1=Kelsey |last1=Sutton |first2=Peter |last2=Sterne |website=[[Politico]]|date=March 27, 2016 |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Kelsey|last=Sutton|url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/08/new-salon-very-different-from-the-old-salon-004705|title=The new Salon – very different from the old Salon|website=[[Politico]]|date=August 10, 2016|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Callum|last= Borchers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/20/note-to-liberal-media-outlets-opposition-to-syrian-refugees-is-not-a-fringe-position/|title=Note to liberal media outlets: Opposition to Syrian refugees is not a fringe position|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington DC|date=November 20, 2015|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Howard|last=Kurtz|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/05/11/salons-clickbait-strategy-phantom-fight-against-fox-news.html|title=Salon's clickbait strategy: The phantom fight against Fox News|website=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp.]]|date=May 11, 2015|access-date=March 29, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> 

== Content and coverage ==
''Salon'' covers a variety of topics, including reviews and articles about books, films, and music;<ref name=about>{{cite web|work=Salon|url=http://www.salon.com/about/|title=About Salon}}</ref> articles about "modern life", including friendships, human sexual behavior, and relationships; and reviews and articles about technology, with a particular focus on the [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS) movement.

According to the senior contributing writer for the ''[[American Journalism Review]]'', Paul Farhi, ''Salon'' offers "provocative (if predictably liberal) political commentary and lots of sex."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul|last=Farhi|url=http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=314 |title=Can Salon Make It?|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]]|location=[[College Park, Maryland]]|date=March 2001 |access-date=May 24, 2015 }}</ref>

In 2008, ''Salon'' launched the interactive initiative ''[[Open Salon]]'', a social content site/blog network for its readers. Originally a curated site with some of its content being featured on ''Salon'', it fell into editorial neglect and was closed in March 2015.<ref name=OS>{{cite web|work=[[Open Salon]]|author=Open Salon Staff|date=March 10, 2015|title=News about Open Salon|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/open_staff/2015/03/09/news_about_open_salon}}</ref>

Responding to the question, "How far do you go with the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] sensibility to get readers?," former Salon.com editor-in-chief [[David Talbot]] said:
{{quote|Is ''Salon'' more tabloid-like? Yeah, we've made no secret of that. I've said all along that our formula here is that we're a smart tabloid. If by tabloid what you mean is you're trying to reach a popular audience, trying to write topics that are viscerally important to a readership, whether it's the story about [[Andrea Yates|the mother in Houston who drowned her five children]] or the story on the missing intern in Washington, [[Chandra Levy]].<ref name="journalism jobs" />|}}

== History ==
''Salon'' was created in the wake of the [[San Francisco newspaper strike of 1994]], by former ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Examiner]]'' arts and features editor [[David Talbot]] who wished to explore the potential of [[World Wide Web|Web]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pogash |first=Carol |title=Cyberspace Journalism |journal=American Journalism Review |access-date=July 8, 2011 |date=June 1, 1996 |url=http://www.enews.com/magazines/ajr/archive/960601-001.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961228232313/http://www.enews.com/magazines/ajr/archive/960601-001.html |archive-date=December 28, 1996 }}</ref><ref name=herhold>{{cite web|last=Herhold |first=Scott |title=Net magazine Salon epitomizes fate of mind over matter |work=San Jose Mercury News |access-date=July 7, 2011 |date=December 28, 1997 |url=http://www5.mercurycenter.com/business/center/salon122997.htm# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990221024841/http://www5.mercurycenter.com/business/center/salon122997.htm%23 |archive-date=February 21, 1999 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It launched as salonmag.com<ref>Vaughn, Seven L. ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism'' (2008) Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-96950-5}}</ref> in November 1995. In its early days, readers noticed a specifically Northern California flavor. In 1996, Talbot agreed: "We swim in the soup of San Francisco. There are a lot of odd fish we've plucked out of the bay here and it gives us some of that Left Coast, Weird Coast style."<ref>Adam Begley, "Reading Bytes," San Francisco magazine [formerly San Francisco Focus], October 1997, p. 128.</ref> ''Time'' magazine named it one of the Best Web Sites of 1996.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,135245,00.html|title=The Best Web Sites of 1996 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |magazine=Time |access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref>

''Salon'' purchased the [[virtual community]], [[WELL (virtual community)|The WELL]], in April 1999 (switching to its current URI salon.com at roughly that time), and made its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) of Salon.com on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange on June 22 of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=940074|title=SALON INTERNET INC|website=www.nasdaq.com|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref> Subsequently, for the month of October 1999, [[Nielsen NetRatings|Nielsen/NetRatings]] reported that ''Salon'' had over 2 million users.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/11/business/fi-64019|title=Salon.com Wins Credibility Online With Intelligent and Stylish Content|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=April 28, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

''Salon Premium'', a pay-to-view (online) content subscription was introduced on April 25, 2001. The service signed up 130,000 subscribers and staved off discontinuation of services. However, in November 2002, the company announced it had accumulated cash and non-cash losses of $80 million, and by February 2003 it was having difficulty paying its rent and made an appeal for donations to keep the company running.
[[File:Salon.com screenshot.png|thumb|left|Front-page design in 2006]]
On October 9, 2003, Michael O'Donnell, the [[Chief executive officer|chief executive]] and president of Salon Media Group, said he was leaving the company after seven years because it was "time for a change." When he left, Salon.com had accrued $83.6 million in losses since its inception, and its stock traded for 5¢ on the [[OTC Bulletin Board]]. David Talbot, ''Salon''<nowiki/>'s chairman and editor-in-chief at the time, became the new chief executive. Elizabeth "Betsy" Hambrecht, then ''Salon''<nowiki/>'s [[Chief Financial Officer|chief financial officer]], became the president.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Salon-chief-calling-it-quits-after-7-years-2583386.php|title=Salon chief calling it quits after 7 years|work=SFGate|access-date=January 4, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2008, ''Salon'' launched ''Open Salon'', a "social content site" and "curated blog network."<ref name="open salon 1" /> It was nominated for a 2009 National Magazine Award<ref name="open salon 2" /> in the category "best interactive feature." On March 9, 2015, ''Salon'' announced it would be closing ''Open Salon'' after six years of hosting a community of writers and bloggers.<ref name=OS />

''Salon'' closed its online chat board "Table Talk" without stating an official reason for ending that section of the site on June 10, 2011.<ref>{{cite web| last = Williams| first = Mary Elizabeth| work=Salon|title = Au revoir, Table Talk| date = June 10, 2011|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/06/10/requiem_for_table_talk/}}</ref>

On July 16, 2012, ''Salon'' announced that it would be featuring content from ''[[Mondoweiss]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/topic/mondoweiss/|work=Salon|title=Mondoweiss}}</ref>

Salon Media Group sold [[The WELL]] to the group of members in September 2012.<ref>{{cite web|website=Well.com|url=http://www.well.com/p-release/pr_20120920.pdf|title=Salon Media Group Sells The WELL to The Well Group|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115163522/http://www.well.com/p-release/pr_20120920.pdf|archive-date=November 15, 2012}}</ref>

=== Business model and operations ===

''Salon'' has been unprofitable through its entire history.  Since 2007, the company has been dependent upon repeated cash injections from board Chairman [[John Warnock]] and [[William Hambrecht]], father of former ''Salon'' CEO Elizabeth Hambrecht.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wrhambrecht.com/about/|title=About WR Hambrecht + Co|website=wrhambrecht.com|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insiders.morningstar.com/trading/board-of-directors.action?t=0P000004T4&culture=en-US|title=Salon Media Group Inc Board of Directors|website=insiders.morningstar.com|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/about/staff|title=Salon.com – News, Politics, Business, Technology & Culture|website=www.salon.com|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Salon-com-beats-the-odds-S-F-online-magazine-2558829.php|title=Salon.com beats the odds / S.F. online magazine courses into its second decade|date=December 1, 2005|website=sfgate.com|access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> During the nine months ending in December 31, 2012, these cash contributions amounted to $3.4 million, compared to revenue in the same period of $2.7 million.<ref name="Form 10-Q, Salon Media Group, Inc">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084332/000143774913001586/smg_10q-123112.htm|title=Form 10-Q, Salon Media Group, Inc.|date=February 14, 2013|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref> In December 2016 and January 2017, the company was evicted from its New York offices at 132 West 31st Street, a block from [[Madison Square Garden]], for non-payment of $90,000 in back rent.<ref name="NYPost-Eviction">{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/03/salon-struggling-to-pay-its-rent/|title=Salon struggling to pay its rent|last1=Kelly|first1=Keith J.|date=August 3, 2017|access-date=September 5, 2018|newspaper=New York Post}}</ref><ref name="10-K 2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084332/000143774917011772/slnm20170331_10k.htm|title=Form 10-Q, Salon Media Group, Inc. |date=June 23, 2017 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref>  In February 2017, Spear Point Capital invested $1 million into Salon, taking a 29% equity stake and three seats on the company's board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foliomag.com/spear-point-invests-1-million-salon-media-group/|title=Spear Point Invests $1 Million into Salon Media Group|date=February 2, 2017|website=Folio|language=en-US|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref>  As of April 2019, the company had failed to file its form 10-K for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.

Aspects of the Salon.com site offerings, ordered by advancing date:
* Free content: around 15 new articles posted per-day, revenues wholly derived from in-page advertisements.
** Per-day new content was reduced for a time.
* ''Salon Premium'' subscription: Approximately 20 percent of new content was made available to subscribers only. Other subscription benefits included free magazines and ad-free viewing. Larger, more conspicuous ad units were introduced for non-subscribers.
* A hybrid subscription model: Readers can now read content by viewing a 15-second full screen advertisement to earn a "day pass" or gain access by subscribing to ''Salon Premium''.
* ''Salon Core'': After ''Salon Premium'' subscriptions declined from about 100,000 to 10,000, it was rebranded in 2011 as ''Salon Core'' subscriptions featuring a different mix of benefits.<ref name="relaunchhufpo" />
* In 2018, Salon launched a beta program allowing customers to opt out of advertising in exchange for mining cryptocurrency.<ref name="SalonMiningFAQ">{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/about/faq-what-happens-when-i-choose-to-suppress-ads-on-salon/|title="FAQ: What happens when I choose to "Suppress Ads" on Salon?"}}</ref>
