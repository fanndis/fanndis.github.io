The '''2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton''' was announced in a [[YouTube]] video, on April 12, 2015.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uY7gLZDmn4 |title=Getting Started |first=Hillary |last=Clinton |date=April 12, 2015 |via=YouTube}}</ref> [[Hillary Clinton]] was the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State]] and served during the first term of the [[Obama administration]], 2009 to 2013. She was previously a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], 2001 to 2009, and is the wife of former President [[Bill Clinton]], serving as [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001.

Clinton's main competitor in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic primary election]] was Vermont Senator [[Bernie Sanders]]. She received the most support from middle aged and older voters, and from black, Latino, and older female voters. She focused her platform on several issues, including expanding racial, [[LGBT]], and women's rights, raising wages and ensuring equal pay for women, and improving healthcare.

The [[Associated Press]] declared Clinton the [[presumptive nominee]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] after she reached the required number of delegates, including both pledged delegates and [[superdelegate]]s on June 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4c9c850385c84b12ad5b85fda49743f9/after-weekend-wins-clinton-cusp-democratic-nomination |title=AP count: Clinton has delegates to win Democratic nomination |publisher=Associated Press|date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Sanders endorsed Clinton's campaign for president on July 12.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton.html |title=Bernie Sanders Endorses Hillary Clinton, Hoping to Unify Democrats |first1=Amy |last1=Chozick |first2=Patrick |last2=Healy |first3=Yamiche |last3=Alcindor |date=July 12, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Clinton announced that U.S. Senator [[Tim Kaine]] would be her [[2016 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection|vice presidential]] running mate on July 22.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Amy |last1=Chozick |first2=Alan |last2=Rappaport |first3=Jonathan |last3=Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/tim-kaine-hillary-clinton-vice-president.html |title=Hillary Clinton Selects Tim Kaine, a Popular Senator From a Swing State, as Running Mate |date=July 23, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Clinton and Kaine were officially nominated at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]] on July 26.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nolan D. |last=McCaskill |date=July 26, 2016 |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dnc-kicks-off-roll-call-vote-to-nominate-clinton-226239 |title=Hillary Clinton breaks the glass ceiling |work=Politico}}</ref>

Clinton conceded the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] to Republican [[Donald Trump]] on November 9 after media outlets declared Trump had exceeded the 270 [[United States electoral college|electoral college]] vote threshold needed to win the election and ending the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hillary Clinton concedes|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/election-day-2016-highlights/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref>

== Background ==

=== Post-2008 primary election campaign ===
As soon as Clinton ended her [[Hillary Clinton presidential primary campaign, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primary election campaign]] and conceded to Barack Obama, there was talk of her running again in 2012 or 2016.<ref>{{cite web |first=Taegan |last=Goddard |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/256781/did-hillary-clinton-ever-stop-running-for-president |title=Did Hillary Clinton ever stop running for president? |work=[[The Week]] |date=February 21, 2014}}</ref> After she ended her tenure as Secretary of State in 2013, speculation picked up sharply, particularly when she listed her occupation on social media as "TBD". In the meantime, Clinton earned over $11 million giving 51 paid speeches to various organizations, including [[Goldman Sachs]] and other [[Wall Street]] banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-earn-more-than-25-million-in-speaking-fees-since-january-2014/2015/05/15/52605fbe-fb4d-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html |title=Clintons have made more than $25 million for speaking since January 2014 |date=May 15, 2015 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |last=Gold |first=Matea |last2=Helderman |first2=Rosalind S. |last3=Gearan |first3=Anne}}</ref> The speeches, and Clinton's not releasing their transcripts, would be raised as an issue by her opponents during the upcoming primary<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Hillary Clinton's Paid Speeches to Wall Street Animate Her Opponents|first1=Nicholas |last1=Confessore  |first2=Jason |last2=Horowitz|date=January 21, 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/politics/in-race-defined-by-income-gap-hillary-clintons-wall-street-ties-incite-rivals.html}}</ref> and general election campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-speeches-wikileaks.html|date=October 7, 2016|title=Leaked Speech Excerpts Show a Hillary Clinton at Ease With Wall Street|first1=Amy |last1=Chozick |first2=Nicholas |last2=Confessore |first3=Michael |last3=Barbaro}}</ref> In October 2016, [[WikiLeaks|leaked excerpts]] from a Goldman Sachs Q&A session cast doubts about her support for the 2010 [[Dodd–Frank]] financial oversight legislation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/us/politics/wikileaks-hack-hillary-clinton-emails.html |title=Hacked Transcripts Reveal a Genial Hillary Clinton at Goldman Sachs Events |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first1=Amy |last1=Chozick |first2=Nicholas |last2=Confessore |date=October 15, 2016 |access-date=November 14, 2016 |quote=Most strikingly, Mrs. Clinton did not defend the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight legislation, a major achievement of President Obama and congressional Democrats in the wake of the crisis—and a target of Wall Street lobbying ever since. Instead, Mrs. Clinton suggested that it had been passed for "political reasons" by lawmakers panicked by their angry constituents.}}</ref>

Anticipating a future run, a "campaign-in-waiting" began to take shape in 2014, including a large [[Political campaign financing|donor network]], experienced [[Political consulting|operatives]], the [[Ready for Hillary]] and [[Priorities USA Action]] campaign [[political action committees]] (PACs), and other [[Political campaign staff|campaign infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/933/can-anyone-stop-hillary/ |title=Can Anyone Stop Hillary? |last=Von Drehle |first=David |work=Time |date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

By September 2013, amid continual political and media speculation, Clinton said she was considering a run but was in no hurry to decide.<ref name="cnn-run">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/22/politics/hillary-clinton-magazine-interview/ |title=Hillary Clinton on possible presidency: 'I'm realistic' |last=Carter |first=Chelsea J. |publisher=CNN |date=September 23, 2013}}</ref> In late 2013, Clinton told [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Barbara Walters]] that she would "look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision sometime next year";<ref>{{cite news |first=Cheryl K. |last=Chumley |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/19/hillary-clinton-ill-announce-2014-if-im-running/ |title=Hillary Clinton: I'll announce in 2014 if I'm running |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> and told ABC's [[Diane Sawyer]] in June 2014 that she would "be on the way to making a decision before the end of the year."<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Good |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-reveals-2016-timetable-shell-testify-benghazi/story?id=24036584 |title=Hillary Clinton Reveals 2016 Timetable, Won't Say Whether She'll Testify On Benghazi |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>

=== Decision-making process ===
While many political analysts came to assume during this time that Clinton would run, she took a long time to make the decision.<ref name="ap-decision">{{cite news |url= http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a5a12258747440d3b22b5e50fae2b932/clintons-decision-long-road-second-campaign |title=Clinton's second act: Her long road to 2016 decision |first=Julie |last=Pace |work= The Big Story |agency= Associated Press |date= April 13, 2015}}</ref> While Clinton said she spent much of the two years following her tenure, as Secretary of State, thinking about the possibility of running for president again, she was also noncommittal about the prospect, and appeared to some as reluctant to experience again the unpleasant aspects of a major political campaign.<ref name="pol-decision">{{cite news |url= http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-2016-announcement-slow-walk-to-yes-116887.html |title= Hillary Clinton's slow walk to 'yes' |first=Glenn |last=Thrush |first2= Annie |last2=Karni |first3= Gabriel |last3= Debenedetti |work= Politico |date= April 12, 2015}}</ref> Those around her were split in their opinions, reportedly, with Bill Clinton said to be the most in favor of her running again, [[Chelsea Clinton]] leaning towards it, but several of her closest aides against it.<ref name="ap-decision"/><ref name="pol-decision"/> She reportedly studied Obama's 2008 campaign to see what had gone right for Obama as compared to her own campaign.<ref name="pol-decision"/> Not until December 2014, around the time of the Clintons' annual winter vacation in the [[Dominican Republic]], did she say she decided for sure that she would indeed run again.<ref name="ap-decision"/><ref name="pol-decision"/>

=== Expectations ===
According to [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Democratic Party 2016 presidential primaries|nationwide opinion polls]] in early 2015, Clinton was considered the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.<ref name="cnn-run"/><ref name="cbs-next">{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-hillary-clinton-closing-the-door-on-politics/ |title= Is Hillary Clinton closing the door on politics? |last=Miller |first=Jake |work= CBS News |date=January 29, 2013}}</ref><ref name="reut-depart">{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/16/us-usa-politics-hillary-idUSBRE90F0A820130116 |title= Hillary Clinton leaving world stage, but for how long? |last=Holland |first=Steve |publisher=Reuters |date= January 16, 2013}}</ref> She had gained a broader sweep of early endorsements from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] establishment in the 2016 race than she did in 2008,<ref>{{cite web |first=Patrick |last=Caldwell |url= https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/11/hillary-clinton-2016-superdelegates-endorse |title= Future Superdelegates Are Already Kissing Up to Hillary 2016 |work= [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date= November 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Jasmine |last1=Sachar |first2=Bob |last2=Cusack |url= http://thehill.com/homenews/presidential-campaign/196586-dems-surging-toward-hillary |title=60 Dems endorse Hillary for 2016 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 28, 2014}}</ref> although she did face [[Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016|several primary election challengers]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/2016-polls-show-clinton-leads-key-states-gop-field-wide-n306106 |title=2016 Polls Show Clinton Leads in Key States, GOP Field Wide Open |date=February 15, 2015 |work=NBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/despite-sustaining-hits-hillary-clinton-remains-formidable-2016-nbc-wsj-n353386 |title=Despite Sustaining Hits, Hillary Clinton Remains 'Formidable' in 2016 NBC/WSJ Poll |date=May 4, 2015 |work=NBC News}}</ref> and, in August 2015 Vice President [[Joe Biden]] was reported to be seriously considering a possible challenge to Clinton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/us/politics/joe-biden-on-beach-vacation-wades-further-into-16-bid.html |first1=Jonathan |last1=Martin |first2=Amy |last2=Chozick |title=Joe Biden Wades Further Into '16 Bid |work=The New York Times |date=August 13, 2015}}</ref>

Clinton had a very high name recognition of an estimated 99% (only 11% of all voters said they did not know enough about her to form an opinion) and according to Democratic [[pollster]] [[Celinda Lake]], she has had strong support from African-Americans, and among college-educated women and single women.<ref name=NYT51915>{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Chozick |title=Hillary Clinton will Need a Second Chance to Make an Impression |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/us/politics/hillary-clinton-may-not-need-a-second-chance-to-make-a-first-impression.html |work=The New York Times |date=May 19, 2015}}</ref>

In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's 2015 list of "The 100 Most Influential People", Clinton praised Massachusetts Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]], who herself was considered as a potential challenger to Clinton, for being a "progressive champion".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/3823064/elizabeth-warren-2015-time-100/ |title=Elizabeth Warren |date=April 16, 2015 |work=Time |last=Clinton |first=Hillary}}</ref> Warren decided not to run for president, despite pressure from some [[progressives]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-im-not-running-im-not-running-2015-3 |title=Elizabeth&nbsp;Warren:&nbsp;'I'm not running, I'm not running' |date=April 16, 2015 |work=[[Business Insider]] |last=Campbell |first=Colin}}</ref>

Clinton held her first major [[campaign rally]] June 13, 2015, at [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park]] on the southern tip of [[New York City]]'s [[Roosevelt Island]].

In her speech, Clinton addressed [[income inequality in the United States]], specifically endorsed universal [[pre-kindergarten]], paid [[Parental leave|family leave]], [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] for women, college affordability, and incentives for companies that provide [[profit sharing]] to employees.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kirsch |first=Richard |title=The Economic Narrative in Hillary Clinton's Launch Speech |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=June 16, 2016 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-kirsch/the-economic-narrative-in_b_7598016.html}}</ref> She did not address [[United States free trade agreements|free trade agreements]] during the kickoff speech,<ref name=NYT61315>{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Chozick |title=Hillary Clinton, in Roosevelt Island Speech, Pledges to Close Income Gap |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/us/hillary-clinton-attacks-republican-economic-policies-in-roosevelt-island-speech.html |work=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2015 |quote=Mrs. Clinton specified policies she would push for, including universal prekindergarten, paid family leave, equal pay for women, college affordability and incentives for companies that provide profit-sharing to employees.}}</ref> but made statements the next day suggesting that the current negotiations should be abandoned unless improved.<ref name=NYT61715>{{cite news |first1=Michael D. |last1=Shear |first2=Amy |last2=Chozick |title=Trade Deal Comments Put Hillary Clinton at Odds With Her Former Boss |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/us/politics/hillary-clinton-walks-the-line-between-presidential-ally-and-aspirant.html |work=The New York Times |date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>

Clinton focused her candidacy on several themes, including raising middle class incomes, expanding women's rights, instituting campaign finance reform, and improving the [[Affordable Care Act]].

In March 2016, she laid out a detailed economic plan, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "optimistic" and "wide-ranging".<ref name=offersecplan>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/us/politics/hillary-clinton-offers-economic-plan-focused-on-jobs.html |title=Clinton Offers Economic Plan Focused on Jobs |first=Amy |last=Chozick |work=The New York Times |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Basing her economic philosophy on [[inclusive capitalism]], Clinton proposed a "clawback" which would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an "exit tax" on companies that move their headquarters out of America in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.<ref name=offersecplan/> Clinton opposes the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)]], supports the [[Export–Import Bank of the United States|U.S. Export-Import Bank]], and holds that "any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security".<ref name=":29">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/campaign2016/hillary-clinton/on-trade |title=Hillary Clinton on Trade |series=Campaign 2016 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |access-date=August 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822113931/http://www.cfr.org/campaign2016/hillary-clinton/on-trade |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/campaign2016/hillary-clinton/donald-trump/on-trade |title=Compare Clinton and Trump on Trade |series=Campaign 2016 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |access-date=August 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725131855/http://www.cfr.org/campaign2016/hillary-clinton/donald-trump/on-trade |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's [[Citizens United decision]], Clinton has called for a [[constitutional amendment]] to limit "unaccountable money" in politics.<ref name="AP outset"/> In July 2016, she has "committed" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision.<ref name=merica>

Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East. She opposes Trump's call to ban Muslims from the United States as "shameful" and "dangerous".

Clinton campaign strategists reportedly believed that a strong [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign would mobilize the same voters who swept Barack Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012.

== Fundraising ==
Throughout the general election campaign, Clinton consistently led Trump in fundraising. Through August 2016, Clinton, the [[Democratic National Committee]] and Clinton's main super PAC, [[Priorities USA Action]], had raised more than $700 million, while Trump had brought in $400 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blumenthal |first1=Paul |title=Hillary Clinton Continues To Build Campaign Money Advantage Over Donald Trump |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-campaign-money_us_57e2163ee4b0e28b2b511a7f |work=Huffington Post |date=September 21, 2016}}</ref> According to a September 2016 analysis by the [[Center for Public Integrity]], "More than 1,100 elite moneymen and women have collectively raised more than $113 million" for Clinton's campaign. These bundlers, who collected checks from friends or associates and gave them to the campaign, included "lawmakers, entertainment icons and titans of industry"; among them were [[Ben Affleck]], [[George Lucas]], [[Marissa Mayer]], and [[Sheryl Sandberg]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Beckel |first1=Michael |title=Elite 'bundlers' raise more than $113 million for Hillary Clinton |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/09/23/20254/elite-bundlers-raise-more-113-million-hillary-clinton?platform=hootsuite |publisher=Center for Public Integrity |date=September 23, 2016}}</ref>

According to an article in ''The Washington Post'', Clinton's presidential campaign benefited from a network of donors whom the Clintons had "methodically cultivated... over 40 years, from Little Rock to Washington and then across the globe. Their fundraising methods have created a new blueprint for politicians and their donors."<ref name=WP11915>{{cite news |first1=Matea |last1=Gold |first2=Tom |last2=Hamburger |first3=Anu |last3=Narayanswamy |title=Two&nbsp;Clintons. 41&nbsp;years. $3&nbsp;Billion. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/clinton-money/ |work=The Washington Post |date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> By the end of September 2015, the campaign's fundraising effort for "Clinton's 2016 White House run{{nbsp}}... has already drawn $110{{nbsp}}million in support".<ref name=WP11915/>

In response to the article, a campaign spokesman said that "it would be misleading, at best, to conflate donations to a philanthropy with political giving.... And regarding the campaign contributions, the breadth and depth of their support is a testament to the fact that they have both dedicated their lives to public service and fighting to make this country stronger."<ref name=WP11915/> As the ''Post'' article pointed out, fundraising for the 2016 presidential campaign existed "in a dramatically different environment" than in the past, and the 2010 ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' decision and ruling by "the Supreme Court has made it easier for wealthy individuals, corporations and unions to spend huge, unregulated sums on political activity".<ref name=WP11915/>

In August 2015, the Clinton campaign announced that it had signed a joint fundraising agreement with the [[Democratic National Committee]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dovere |first1=Edward-Isaac |last2=Debenedetti |first2=Gabriel |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/dnc-democratic-committee-hillary-clinton-fundraising-agreement-2016-121813 |title=DNC announces fundraising agreement with Clinton campaign |work=Politico |date=August 27, 2017 |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> The campaign set up a joint fundraising committee with the DNC, the [[Hillary Victory Fund]], and 32 state committees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gold |first1=Matea |last2=Hamburger |first2=Tom |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-party-fundraising-effort-helps-clinton-find-new-donors-too/2016/02/19/b8535cea-d68f-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html |title=Democratic Party fundraising effort helps Clinton find new donors, too |date=February 20, 2016 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> The Clinton campaign sent the DNC a [[memorandum of understanding]] in which the campaign agreed to help the DNC pay off debt in exchange for "joint authority over strategic decisions over the staffing, budget, expenditures, and general election related communications, data, technology, analytics, and research."

In the debate between Sanders and Clinton in New Hampshire prior to the New Hampshire primary Clinton, objecting to the inference that campaign contributions or speaking fees from the financial sector would influence her political decisions, characterized Sanders's references to her Wall Street connections as a "'very artful smear' campaign."<ref name="CBS02716">{{cite news |first=Reena |last=Flores |title=Hillary Clinton calls out Bernie Sanders' "artful smear" in Democratic debate |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-calls-out-bernie-sanders-artful-smear-in-democratic-debate/ |work=CBS News |date=February 4, 2016 |quote=On the offensive after Sanders tied her campaign fundraising to Wall Street, Clinton called out the Vermont senator for conducting a "very artful smear" campaign.}}</ref> He responded by saying, "It's a fact.

=== Super PACs supporting Clinton ===
In May 2015, it was reported that the Clinton campaign lagged behind opposing Republican campaigns in gaining large donations from wealthy donors to supportive [[Super PACs]].

[[Priorities USA Action]], the main super PAC supporting Clinton, raised $23.4 million in August 2016. More than half of that amount came from its top five donors, and the amount included 11 seven-figure checks.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Arnsdorf |first1=Isaac |title=Big money fuels Clinton super PAC surge |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/clinton-super-pac-funds-228433 |work=Politico |date=September 20, 2016}}</ref>

== Effectiveness ==
After a loss that was widely perceived as a surprise, critics alleged that the Clinton team ran an ineffective campaign. Several issues have been highlighted. A study by [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan Media Project]] has shown that Clinton's TV ads "were almost entirely policy-free". The researchers wrote that "misallocated advertising funds" and "lack of policy messaging in advertising may have hurt Clinton enough to have made a difference".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/8/14848636/hillary-clinton-tv-ads|title=Study: Hillary Clinton’s TV ads were almost entirely policy-free|author=Jeff Stein|date=8 March 2017|website=Vox}}</ref> In ''[[Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign]]'', reporters [[Jonathan Allen]] and Amie Parnes state that the campaign had "little vision or inspiration", an "ineffective" strategy that focused on "turnout, not persuasion" and reliance on a "faulty analytic model", amongst other issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hillary-clinton-failed-us-presidential-campaign-five-things-learn-book-shattered-jonathan-allen-allison-parnes-a7715991.html|title=Five things we've learned about Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign from new inside account|website=The Guardian|date=4 May 2017}}</ref> Political scientist [[Stan Greenberg]] stated that Clinton focused on "[her] base and identity at the expense of class", that she did not call out "big-money special interests", and that her campaign focused too heavily on "data analytics", pointing out that "the campaign conducted no state polls in the final three weeks of the general election and relied primarily on data analytics to project turnout and the state vote".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prospect.org/power/lost/|title=How She Lost|website=The American Prospect|author=Stan Greenberg|date=21 September 2017}}</ref>

Despite this, political scientists John Sides, Michael Tesler and [[Lynn Vavreck]] dispute the criticism that Clinton ran an inept campaign, saying that this is a "myth" and there is little evidence to support the criticism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/myths-about-the-2016-presidential-election/2018/10/05/4e07a22a-c808-11e8-b2b5-79270f9cce17_story.html|title=Perspective {{!}} Five myths about the 2016 election|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref> A common critique of the Clinton campaign is that it did not campaign in Wisconsin (which Trump narrowly won); however, according to a study by political scientist Christopher J. Devine, it is "unclear" from the evidence "whether Clinton also would have gained votes, or even won, in Wisconsin had she campaigned in that state."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devine|first=Christopher J.|date=2018-07-26|title=What if Hillary Clinton Had Gone to Wisconsin?
