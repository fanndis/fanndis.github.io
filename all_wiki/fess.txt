In [[heraldry]], a '''fess''' or '''fesse''' (from [[Middle English]] ''fesse'', from [[Old French]], from [[Latin]] ''fascia'', "band")<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/94/F0089400.html |title=Fess 1. |work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed |year=2000 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |accessdate=2009-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050926182954/http://bartleby.com/61/94/F0089400.html |archivedate=2005-09-26 }}</ref> is a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] on a [[coat of arms]] (or [[flag]]) that takes the form of a band running horizontally across the centre of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].<ref name="Oxford60">Woodcock & Robinson (1988), ''Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', p. 60.</ref>  Writers disagree in how much of the shield's surface is to be covered by a fess or other [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]], ranging from one-fifth to one-third.  The ''Oxford Guide to Heraldry'' states that earlier writers including Leigh, Holme, and Guillim favour one-third, while later writers such as Edmondson favour one-fifth "on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable."<ref name="Woodcock">Woodcock & Robinson (1988), ''Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', p. 58.</ref>  A fess is likely to be shown narrower if it is ''uncharged'', that is, if it does not have other charges placed on it, and/or if it is to be shown with charges above and below it; and shown wider if ''charged''. The fess or bar, termed ''fasce'' in [[French heraldry]], should not be confused with ''[[fasces]]''.

==Diminutives==
In [[English heraldry]], two or more such charges appearing together on a shield are termed ''bars'', though there are no definitive rules setting the width of the fess, the bar, nor their comparative width.<ref name="Oxford60" />  A shield of (often six or eight) horizontal stripes of alternating colour is called ''barry''.  Narrower versions of the bar are called ''barrulets'' ("little bars"), and when a shield of horizontal stripes alternating colour is composed of ten or more stripes, it is called ''barruly'' or ''burely'' instead of ''barry''.<ref name="Oxford60" />  A ''cotise'', defined as half the width of a barrulet, may be borne alongside a fess, and often two of these appear, one on either side of the fess.<ref name="Oxford60" />  This is often termed "a fess cotised" (also ''cottised'', ''coticed'' or ''cotticed'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglossc.htm |title=Cottise |work=A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry |last=Parker |first=James |year=1894 |accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref>  Another diminutive of the fess called a ''closet'' is said to be between a bar and barrulet, but this is seldom found.<ref name="Oxford60" />  A fess when ''couped'' ("cut off" at either end, and so not reaching the sides of the shield) can be called ''humetty'', but this term is very rare in the Anglophone heraldries and is most often used of the [[cross]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

A shield ''party per fess'' (or simply ''per fess'') is divided in half horizontally (''in the manner of a fess'').  A charge placed horizontally may be termed ''fesswise'' or ''fessways'', and two or more charges arranged in a horizontal row are blazoned ''in fess'' or ''in bar''.

A ''mural fess'', that is a fess [[Line (heraldry)#Embattled and variants|embattled]] and [[Variation of the field#Masoned|masoned]] of the field, can be seen in the arms of Suzanne Elizabeth Altvater.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=930&ShowAll=1 |title=Suzanne Elizabeth Altvater Grant of Arms |work=The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada |publisher=The Canadian Heraldic Authority |date=1998-10-29 |accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref>

The arms of [[Baroness Fritchie]] provide an example of ''three Barrulets fracted and there conjoined to a Chevronel''.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75720250/ep-06-Issue |title=Heraldry of New Life Peers |publisher=The Heraldry Society |journal=The Heraldry Gazette |issue=June 2007 |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |page=3}}</ref>

A flag which has a central ''horizontal'' stripe that is half the height of the flag is sometimes said to have a [[Spanish fess]]. The name is based on the most well-known example of this style of flag, the [[flag of Spain]].
