{{Politics of Spain}}
The '''Government of Spain''' ({{lang-es|Gobierno de España}}) is the [[central government]] which leads the [[executive branch]] and the [[General State Administration]] of the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]]. It is also commonly referred to as the '''Government of the Nation''',<ref>Article 24 of the [https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1997-25336 Government Act of 1997]. In its sentences about competences, the Constitutional Court use the term "Government of the Nation" ([https://www.boe.es/buscar/boe.php?campo%5B0%5D=ORI&dato%5B0%5D%5B1%5D=1&dato%5B0%5D%5B2%5D=2&dato%5B0%5D%5B3%5D=3&dato%5B0%5D%5B4%5D=4&dato%5B0%5D%5B5%5D=5&dato%5B0%5D%5BT%5D=T&operador%5B0%5D=and&campo%5B1%5D=DOC&dato%5B1%5D=&operador%5B1%5D=and&campo%5B2%5D=TIT&dato%5B2%5D=Gobierno+de+la+Naci%F3n&operador%5B2%5D=and&campo%5B3%5D=DEM&dato%5B3%5D=&operador%5B3%5D=and&campo%5B4%5D=NBO&dato%5B4%5D=&operador%5B4%5D=and&campo%5B5%5D=NOF&dato%5B5%5D=&operador%5B5%5D=and&operador%5B6%5D=and&campo%5B6%5D=FPU&dato%5B6%5D%5B0%5D=&dato%5B6%5D%5B1%5D=&page_hits=50&sort_field%5B0%5D=fpu&sort_order%5B0%5D=desc&sort_field%5B1%5D=ori&sort_order%5B1%5D=asc&sort_field%5B2%5D=ref&sort_order%5B2%5D=asc&accion=Buscar it can be saw it at BOE]). Political parties, especially [https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2019-01-18/convencion-nacional-pp-inauguracion_1768406/ right-wing parties] and also the [http://www.psoe.es/actualidad/noticias-actualidad/abalos-gobierno-nacion-certidumbre-estabilidad/ left-wing PSOE], often use it.{{synthesis inline|date=June 2019}}</ref> or simply the '''Government.'''

The Government consists of the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] and the [[Ministers of Spain|Ministers]]; the prime minister has the overall direction of the Ministers and can appoint or terminate their appointments freely and all of them belong to the supreme decision-making body, known as the [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]]. The Government is responsible before the Parliament ([[Cortes Generales]]), and more precisely before the [[Congress of the Deputies]], a body which elects the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] or dismisses him through a [[motion of censure]]. This is because Spain is a [[parliamentary system]] established by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]].

Its fundamental regulation is placed in Title IV of the Constitution, as well as in Title V of that document, with respect to its relationship with the Cortes Generales, and in Law 50/1997, of 27 November, of the Government. According to Article 97 of the Constitution and Article 1.1 of the Government Act, "''the Government directs domestic and foreign policy, the civil and military administration and the defense of the State. It exercises the executive function and the regulatory regulation according to the Constitution and the laws''".

The current prime minister is [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]], who took office on 2 June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44340879|title=Socialist Sánchez sworn in as Spain's PM|date=2018-06-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> He is the leader of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]], which, at the time of his appointment, was the second biggest party in the [[Cortes Generales]]. Sánchez was appointed to lead the Government through a [[2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy|motion of no confidence]] against former prime minister [[Mariano Rajoy]], who had filled that office since 2011. This was the first election of a prime minister via motion of no confidence in Spanish history.

The Government is occasionally referred to with the [[metonymy]] ''Moncloa'', due to the fact that the residence of the Prime Minister, the [[Palace of Moncloa]], is also the headquarters of the Government.

==Principles==
The Government's performance is governed by the following operating principles:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1997-25336&p=20151002&tn=1#preambulo|title=Government Act of 1997 - Preamble|website=boe.es|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>

* '''Principle of presidential direction''': The [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] directs to the [[Ministers of Spain|Ministers]] and can appoint or dismiss them freely.
* '''Principle of responsibility''': The Prime Minister responds politically to the [[Congress of Deputies]] for the action of the Government. The eventual cessation of the Prime Minister implies the cessation of the Government.
* '''Principle of collegiality''': The Government, understood as [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]], is a collegiate body composed of a plurality of members of the Government.
* '''Principle of solidarity''': The Government responds in solidum for the action of each one of the members of the Government.
* '''Departmental principle''': The members of the Government, as well as members of this collegiate body, are also the heads of a [[Spanish government departments|department]] in charge of a more or less homogeneous area of competence.

The Kingdom of Spain is a [[Constitutional Monarchy|constitutional monarchy]] in which executive decisions are made by the Government. More specifically, the Spanish Constitution describes Spain's form of government as "Monarquía parlamentaria,"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/ConstitucionCASTELLANO.pdf | title=Article 1, Part 3 | work=Constitución Española | year=1978 | publisher=boe.es | language=es | access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> or parliamentary monarchy, in which the monarch acts as a moderator rather than a source of executory authority.  Spain possesses an asymmetric [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament, called the "Cortes Generales," composed of the [[Congress of Deputies]]  and the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]]. While both the Congress and Senate propose legislation, albeit by different procedural mechanisms, the Government has the right to be consulted for such proposals. The Government may also propose law directly. A Government-sponsored bill is known as a  ''proyecto de ley'', contrasting with a ''proposición de ley'' which is offered by a house of parliament.

Neither the prime minister nor the ministers need to be [[Member of parliament|members of parliament]],<ref name=GA11>{{Cite web|url=https://boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1997-25336&p=20151002&tn=1#a11|title=Government Act of 1997 - Article 11|website=boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> but the Government must account to both the Senate and Congress every week in a parliamentary meeting known as a ''sesión de control'' (control session) ([[wikisource:Spanish Constitution of 1978 (unannotated)/Part V|Part V § 108]]). Questioning minor-rank ministers, such as Secretaries of State or Under Secretaries, must be done in [[Parliamentary committees|Parliamentary Committees]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Hist_Normas/Norm/standing_orders_02.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the Congress - Article 189|website=www.boe.es|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1994-10830|title=Standing Orders of the Senate - Article 168|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> While the prime minister is typically elected from the members of Congress, the current prime minister, [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]], was not a member of either chamber for the first year of his premiership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44340879|title=Socialist Sánchez sworn in as Spain's PM|date=2018-06-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Under the parliamentary system, the Government is required to maintain the confidence of the Congress of Deputies. In the absence of such confidence, the Government may fall or prove unable to pass legislation. There are two procedures to ascertain the Congress's confidence in the Government: the [[Motion of no confidence|motion of no-confidence]] ([[wikisource:Spanish Constitution of 1978 (unannotated)/Part V|Part V § 113]]), by which members of parliament can ask the Congress to rescind its confidence in the prime minister and to elect another, and the [[Matter of Confidence|question of confidence]] ([[wikisource:Spanish Constitution of 1978 (unannotated)/Part V|Part V § 112]]), by which the prime minister asks the Congress if it supports the Government's political programs generally or a specific piece of legislation.  A loss by the Government in either case may result in the removal of the prime minister.

The '''[[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]]''', currently [[King Felipe VI]], is the head of state and the [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. As a monarch of a parliamentary monarchy, the executive power does not belong to The Crown and is independent from it. The Constitution gives the monarch a symbolic role, but also a moderating role, being able to intervene if there is a conflict between the country's institutions ([[wikisource:Spanish Constitution of 1978 (unannotated)/Part V|Part II § 56]]).

As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, former [[King Juan Carlos I]] suppressed the [[23-F]] Spanish coup d'état attempt in February 1981, showing that the monarch has more power than the constitution grants him. The [[heir presumptive]] is [[Leonor, Princess of Asturias]].

The Constitution also gives the monarch some powers known as [[Royal prerogative|Royal Prerogatives]]. These prerogatives range from the signing of international treaties, to declaring war and making peace or to dissolving the parliament. However, with the arrival of democracy, these prerogatives have been regulated and most of them must to be [[Countersign (legal)|countersigned]] by an official.

Although the monarch is not part of the executive power, the prime minister has weekly meetings with him to inform him about the Government's activity and the King can express his opinion.<ref>{{Citation|last=La Moncloa|title=El Rey y el presidente mantienen su despacho semanal|date=2018-07-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dgg_rMP3moc|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> In the same sense, the monarch is normally invited to the first [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]] of every new government (and others if the prime ministers wants to) and to the meetings of bodies such as the [[National Security Council (Spain)|National Security Council]] or the National Defence Council.

The Royal prerogatives are:

* The power to assent to and enact laws by giving [[Royal Assent]] to [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] passed by Parliament, which is required in order for a law to make it into a law. This prerogative is exercised by the monarch but needs the countersigned of the prime minister. It is not constitutionally allowed for him to refuse to sign a law passed by Parliament.
* The power to assent to and enact norms with a lower rank than law. This prerogative is exercised by the monarch but needs the countersignature of the prime minister, a minister, the [[President of the Congress of Deputies|president of the Congress]], or the [[President of the Spanish Senate|Senate]] (depending on the kind of norm).
* The power to call for a [[referendum]]. This is exercised with the countersignature of the prime minister after being requested by the Council of Ministers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1980-1564|title=Referendum Act of 1980|website=www.boe.es|language=es|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref>
* The power to command the [[Spanish Armed Forces|Armed Forces of Spain]]. This prerogative is delegated to the prime minister and the [[Ministry of Defence (Spain)|minister of Defence]].
* The power to give [[Royal Pardon|royal pardons]], in Spain known as right of grace (''derecho de gracia''). This is exercised by the monarch but the decision of whom must to pardon is delegated to the [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)|Minister of Justice]] and the Council of Ministers.
* The power to be informed of the affairs of State and chair the sessions of the Council of Ministers. It is exercised after being requested by the prime minister.

* The [[Deputy Prime Minister of Spain|Deputy Prime Minister]] or Deputy Prime Ministers (If there are more than one).
* The [[Ministers of Spain|Ministers]].

==Caretaker government==
The Caretaker Government is regulated in Section 101 of the [[Constitution of Spain|Spanish Constitution]] which says that «the Government shall resign after the holding of general elections, in the event of loss of parliamentary confidence as provided in the Constitution, or on the resignation or death of the President. The outgoing Government shall continue as acting body until the new Government takes office».<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Spanish_Constitution_of_1978_(unannotated)/Part_IV|title=Spanish Constitution - Part IV|last=Spain|first=the Government of}}</ref>

Between the approval of the Constitution in 1978 and the approval of the Government Act of 1997, there were no explicit limitation to the Government powers while acting as acting government except for what the doctrine and parliamentary practice said. With this constitutional precept it was intended that the succession of one Government by another does not affect the fundamental continuity of the governmental action or that paralysis or dysfunctions occur in the system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Outgoing Government in the Supreme Court´s Doctrine|last=Reviriego Picón|first=Fernando|publisher=Revista Española de Derecho Constitucional|year=2017|pages=382|doi = 10.18042/cepc/redc.109.13}}</ref> This need of not leaving a modern state without its central governing body it is very good explained in a [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] sentence saying that «It is easy to understand that Spain can not run out of government even for a few hours».<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.poderjudicial.es/search/doAction?action=contentpdf&databasematch=TS&reference=835289&links=Espa%96a%20no%20puede%20quedarse%20sin%20Gobierno%20ni%20siquiera%20unas%20horas&optimize=20060427&publicinterface=true|title=Supreme Court Sentence 8303 of December 2nd, 2005.|author=Supreme Court|pages=4}}</ref>

In 1997 it was passed the Government Act and the Caretaker Government is regulated in Title 4. In addition to the aforementioned constitutional provisions, Section 21 of the Government Act establish that «the caretaker government shall facilitate the normal development of the process of formation of the new Government and the transfer of powers to it and limit its duties to the ordinary office of public affairs, abstaining from adopting, except in cases of urgency duly accredited or for reasons of general interest whose accreditation expresses justify it, any other measures».<ref name=CTKG>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1997-25336&p=20151002&tn=1#a21|title=1997 Government Act - Section 21|website=www.boe.es|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref>

This article also establishes explicit limitations on the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]], preventing him from «proposing to the King the dissolution of any of the Chambers or the [[Cortes Generales]], raising the question of confidence, or proposing to the King the calling for a consultative referendum» and on the Government prohibiting to it «the approval of the [[State General Budget]] Bill or presenting bills to the Cortes Generales». The government neither may exercise the legislative delegations that the parliament has granted to it while acting as a caretaker government.<ref name=CTKG/>

On the occasion of the 2015-2016 caretaker government of [[Mariano Rajoy]], the Government refused repeatedly to submit to the control of the [[Congress of Deputies]] alleging that there was no trust relationship between both powers for the fact of being an caretaker government and, therefore, there was no control of the legislative power over the executive. Faced with this situation, the Congress denounced the Executive Power before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] for refusing to submit to its control and, on 22 November 2018, the high court ruled that the Government «undermined the constitutional attribution» that the Constitution confers on Congress and that although «control of the Government's action will normally be exercised within the framework of the confidence that must exist between the Government and the Congress of Deputies», this does not mean that «exceptionally, as are the periods in which there is no relationship of trust between Congress and the Government, the aforementioned control function can not be exercised» since «the control function that corresponds to the Cortes Generales is implicit in its representative character and in the form of parliamentary government that establishes the Article 1.3 of the Constitution, not being able to deny the Chambers all exercise of the control function, since this would affect to the balance of powers foreseen in our Constitution».<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20181122/constitucional-avala-parlamento-pueda-controlar-gobierno-funciones/1842140.shtml|title=El Constitucional concluye que el Gobierno en funciones de Rajoy tenía que haberse sometido al control parlamentario|date=2018-11-22|website=RTVE.es|language=es|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-pleno-tc-respalda-gobierno-funciones-pp-podia-ser-controlado-parlamento-20181122143020.html|title=El Pleno del TC respalda que el Gobierno en funciones del PP podía ser controlado por el Parlamento|last=Press|first=Europa|date=2018-11-22|website=www.europapress.es|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref>

The longest caretaker government of the Spanish politics since the restoration of democracy in 1977 has been the 2015-2016 [[Rajoy I Government|Rajoy government]] with a record of 316 days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/politica/2016/10/29/actualidad/1477734852_101043.html|title=Mariano Rajoy, presidente del Gobierno tras 10 meses en funciones|last=País|first=El|date=2016-10-30|work=El País|access-date=2019-01-28|language=es|issn=1134-6582}}</ref>

==Location==
The prime minister office as well as the official headquarters of the Government are located in the [[Palace of Moncloa]], in outside [[Madrid]]. The Council of Ministers meetings also take place here. In this palace is also the office of the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Spain|deputy prime minister]], the headquarters of the [[Ministry of the Presidency (Spain)|Ministry of the Presidency]] and the office of the [[Spokesperson of the Government of Spain|Government's Spokesperson]]. Most of the [[Spanish government departments|government departments]] are located in the center of the city of Madrid, having each of them its own buildings. One of the most famous place where some ministries are located is the gubernatorial complex of [[Nuevos Ministerios|New Ministries]].

==Advisory bodies==
The Spanish Government has two main advisory bodies:

* The [[Spanish Council of State|Council of State]], which advise the Government in legal matters and all the issues that does not correspond to the other advisory body.
* The [[Economic and Social Council (Spain)|Economic and Social Council]], responsible for advising the Government in socioeconomic and labour matters.

==Budget==
{{Main|General State Budget}}
The General State Budget is considered one of the most important legislations that a Government can pass. According to the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution]], the Government is the only body that can make the [[Budget bill]], although is the parliament who must to accept it, reject it or to propose modifications. If the Congress approves a full budget amend, the budget is automatically reject it.

==Devolved Governments==
{{See also|Autonomous communities of Spain|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}
Since the approval of the [[Constitution of Spain|Constitution of 1978]], Spain was established as a [[Decentralization|decentralized]] [[Unitary state|unitary country]] which grants its regions a high degree of autonomy. The first two regions to get their autonomy where the autonomous communities of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Catalonia]] in 1979. In 1981, four further regions achieved their autonomy: [[Andalusia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. A year later, seven more regions were granted autonomy: [[Aragon]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Navarre]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]. The last four regions to get their autonomy were the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Castile and León]], [[Extremadura]] and [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], all of them in 1983.

The Constitution also grants the cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] autonomy, which they got in 1995. The Constitution also gives them the possibility to become fully autonomous communities, but so far these cities have not requested the activation of this clause.
