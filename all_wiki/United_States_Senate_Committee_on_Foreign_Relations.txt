The '''United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations''' is a [[Standing committee (United States Congress)|standing committee]] of the [[United States Senate]]. It is charged with leading [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign-policy legislation]] and debate in the Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee is generally responsible for overseeing (but not administering) and funding [[Aid|foreign aid]] programs as well as funding arms sales and training for national allies. The committee is also responsible for holding [[Congressional hearing#Confirmation hearings|confirmation hearings]] for high-level positions in the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. The committee has considered, debated, and reported important treaties and legislation, ranging from the [[Alaska purchase]] in 1867 to the establishment of the [[United Nations]] in 1945. It also holds jurisdiction over all diplomatic nominations.<ref>[http://foreign.senate.gov/about/history/ History of the Committee]</ref> Along with the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary]] committees, the Foreign Relations Committee is one of the oldest in the Senate, going back to the initial creation of committees in 1816. Its sister committee in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] (renamed from International Relations by the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] in January 2007).

==History==

Between 1887–1907, Alabama Democrat [[John Tyler Morgan]] played a leading role on the committee. Morgan called for a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through Nicaragua, enlarging the merchant marine and the Navy, and acquiring Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Cuba. He expected Latin American and Asian markets would become a new export market for Alabama's cotton, coal, iron, and timber. The canal would make trade with the Pacific much more feasible, and an enlarged military would protect that new trade. By 1905, most of his dreams had become reality, with the canal passing through Panama instead of Nicaragua.<ref>Joseph A. Fry, "John Tyler Morgan's Southern Expansionism," ''Diplomatic History'' (1985) 9#4 pp: 329-346.</ref>

During [[World War II]], the committee took the lead in rejecting traditional isolationism and designing a new internationalist foreign policy based on the assumption that the United Nations would be a much more effective force than the old discredited League of Nations. Of special concern was the insistence that Congress play a central role in postwar foreign policy, as opposed to its ignorance of the main decisions made during the war.<ref>Roland Young, ''Congressional Politics in the Second World War'' (1958), pp 168–96</ref> Republican senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] played the central role. In 1943, a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was made by British scholar [[Isaiah Berlin]] for the [[Foreign Office]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 |author=Hachey, Thomas E. |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973–1974 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=141–153 |jstor=4634869 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref>James A.

In 1966, as tensions over the [[Vietnam War]] escalated, the committee set up hearings on possible relations with Communist China. Witnesses, especially academic specialists on East Asia, suggested to the American public that it was time to adopt a new policy of containment without isolation. The hearings Indicated that American public opinion toward China had moved away from hostility and toward cooperation. The hearings had a long-term impact when Richard Nixon became president, discarded containment, and began a policy of détente with China.<ref>Katherine Klinefelter, "The China Hearings: America's Shifting Paradigm on China," ''Congress & the Presidency'' (2011) 38#1 pp: 60-76.</ref>  The problem remained of how to deal simultaneously with the Chinese government on Taiwan after formal recognition was accorded to the Beijing government. The committee drafted the Taiwan Relations Act (US, 1979) which enabled the United States both to maintain friendly relations with Taiwan and to develop fresh relations with China.<ref>Jacob K. Javits, "Congress And Foreign Relations: The Taiwan Relations Act,"  ''Foreign Affairs'' (1981) 60#1 pp 54-62</ref>

In response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners, [[President Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 nominated [[Ernest W. Lefever]] as [[Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|Assistant Secretary of State]]. Lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations rejected his nomination by vote of 4-13, prompting Lefever to withdraw his name.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert David Johnson|title=Congress and the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYNTXxgcF8C&pg=PA254|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge UO|pages=253–54}}</ref> [[Elliot Abrams]] filled the position.

Republican senator [[Jesse Helms]], a staunch conservative, was committee chairman in the late 1990s. He pushed for reform of the UN by blocking payment of U.S. membership dues.<ref>William A. Link, ''Righteous Warrior: Jesse Helms and the Rise of Modern Conservatism'' (2008)</ref>
