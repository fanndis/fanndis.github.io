'''''Grantland''''' was a sports and pop-culture [[blog]] owned and operated by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Crupi |first=Anthony |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/bill-simmons-banks-grantland-success-sponsorships-132376 |title=Bill Simmons on Launch of Grantland.com and How Sponsors Will Keep the Site Free |publisher=Adweek |date=June 9, 2011 |access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref> The blog was started in 2011 by veteran writer and sports journalist [[Bill Simmons]], who remained as editor-in-chief until May 2015. ''Grantland'' was named after famed early-20th-century sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] (1880–1954).

On October 30, 2015, ESPN announced that it was ending the publication of ''Grantland''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/espn-statement-regarding-grantland/ |title=ESPN Statement Regarding Grantland |publisher=ESPN MediaZone |access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref>

==Editor-in-Chief transition==
In May 2015, ESPN's President [[John Skipper]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that ESPN would not be renewing Simmons' contract, effectively ending Simmons' tenure at ESPN.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guthrie|first1=Marisa|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title=ESPN President John Skipper on Bill Simmons: "It Was Business"|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-president-john-skipper-bill-794981|access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> Later in the month, [[Chris Connelly (journalist)|Chris Connelly]] was announced as interim editor-in-chief.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chase|first1=Chris|title=Bill Simmons will be replaced at Grantland by Chris Connelly|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/bill-simmons-grantland-replacement-chris-connelly|publisher=Ftw.usatoday.com|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref>

== Dr. V controversy ==
An article written by Caleb Hannan and published on the ''Grantland'' website in January 2014 received considerable criticism from the [[transgender]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2014/01/essay_anne_vanderbilt_dr_v_s_magical_putter_grantland_s_expos_of_a_trans.html|title=Digging Too Deep|first=Josh|last=Levin|publisher=Slate.com|date=January 19, 2014|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/lessons-learned-grantlands-tragic-story-dr-v|title=Lessons learned from Grantland's tragic story on Dr. V|first1=Lauren|last1=Klinger|first2=Kelly|last2=McBride|publisher=Poynter.org|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/what-grantland-got-wrong/|title=What Grantland Got Wrong|first=Christina|last=Kahrl|publisher=Grantland.com|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref> Hannan's article was about the Oracle GXI golf putter and its creator, Essay Anne Vanderbilt, referred to as ''Dr. V''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/a-mysterious-physicist-golf-club-dr-v/|title=Dr. V's Magical Putter|first=Caleb|last=Hannan|publisher=Grantland.com|date=January 15, 2014|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref> It treated Vanderbilt's transgender identity in the same manner as a number of scientific qualifications that Vanderbilt had fraudulently claimed to hold, suggesting that Hannan considered Vanderbilt's gender identity to be untruthful as well. Before the article was published, Vanderbilt committed suicide.

After initially dismissing all criticisms and drawing even more fire, ''Grantland''{{'}}s editor-in-chief Bill Simmons published a response to the criticism, acknowledging errors made by ''Grantland'' and Hannan, including Hannan's outing of Vanderbilt to one of her investors and ''Grantland''{{'}}s "collective ignorance about the issues facing the transgender community in general, as well as our biggest mistake: not educating ourselves on that front before seriously considering whether to run the piece".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/the-dr-v-story-a-letter-from-the-editor/|title=The Dr. V Story: A Letter From the Editor|publisher=Grantland.com|first=Bill|last=Simmons|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref> A profile of Simmons in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', published in April 2014, lambasted him at length over the Dr. V matter and incorporated criticism from senior ESPN personnel, but also included Simmons' defenses and disagreements with some of the harsher criticisms of the article.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tannenbaum|first1=Rob|title=Bill Simmons' Big Score|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-simmons-big-score-20140429|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 29, 2014|access-date=October 31, 2015}}</ref>

== ''Grantland'' shut down ==
On October 30, 2015, ESPN officially announced the shut down of ''Grantland'': “After careful consideration, we have decided to direct our time and energy going forward to projects that we believe will have a broader and more significant impact across our enterprise.” <ref name=":0" /> The closing of ''Grantland'' was met with harsh criticism of ESPN, from both former writers of ''Grantland'' and admirers of the site. Former Editor-in-Chief Bill Simmons called the shut down “simply appalling.”<ref>{{cite web|title = ESPN Shutters Grantland, Effective Immediately|url = https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/espn-shutters-grantland-bill-simmons|website = Vanity Fair|access-date = December 1, 2015}}</ref> ESPN president John Skipper said the decision to shut down the site was not a financial matter and instead was done because ESPN did not see the value in spending the time and energy necessary to continue the excellence of ''Grantland''.<ref>{{cite web|title = Vanity Fair|url = https://www.vanityfair.com/error|website = Vanity Fair|access-date = December 1, 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150202065755/http://www.vanityfair.com/error|archive-date = February 2, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

''Grantland''{{'}}s closure was seen by many as another blow against long-form journalism. ''[[HuffPost|Huffington Post]]'' writer Justin Block writes, “In an era ruled by bite-sized content and dumbed-down click-bait journalism, ''Grantland''{{'}}s defining characteristic came at odds with sustainable finances.”<ref>{{cite web|title = ESPN Closing Grantland Is The Dumbest 'Smart' Business Decision|url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/espn-grantland-dumb-business-decision_5633bd2ae4b00aa54a4e1aa0|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = December 1, 2015}}</ref> ''Grantland''{{'}}s articles were often long form and usually not instant but measured reactionary pieces, a trend not common in today's media landscape. ''Grantland'' was considered by some to be the highest-quality work under the umbrella of ESPN and received critical acclaim, but its financial success has been widely debated.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title = The fall of ESPN's Grantland – an enterprisey take|url = http://diginomica.com/2015/11/05/the-fall-of-espns-grantland-an-enterprisey-take/|work=Digimonica|first = Jon|last = Reed|access-date = December 1, 2015}}</ref> ''Grantland'' received 6 million unique visitors in March 2015, a number that some people believed could not support a staff of 50 writers, editors and IT personnel. The shutdown was also coming at a time of relative financial uncertainty for ESPN. In September 2015, ESPN laid off 300 employees or approximately 5% of its workforce.<ref>{{Cite news|title = ESPN layoffs will gut the network's production staff|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/10/22/espn-layoffs-will-gut-the-networks-production-staff/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-10-22|access-date = 2016-02-03|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Matt|last = Bonesteel}}</ref> It has also been widely reported that in 2015 ESPN lost 3.2 million subscribers due to consumers abandoning traditional cable packages.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite web|title = ESPN's Problems Are of Its Own Making -- The Motley Fool|url = http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/14/espns-problems-are-of-its-own-making.aspx|website = The Motley Fool|access-date = December 1, 2015}}</ref>

== Content and legacy ==
''Grantland'' was known for its long-form journalism and award-winning writing.<ref>{{Cite news|title = ESPN shuts down Grantland months after parting ways with Bill Simmons|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/espn-shuts-down-grantland-months-after-parting-ways-with-bill-simmons/2015/10/30/6b026de2-7f45-11e5-afce-2afd1d3eb896_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = October 30, 2015|access-date = December 1, 2015|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Will|last = Hobson|first2 = Matt|last2 = Bonesteel}}</ref> Its sports journalism pieces often had a strong focus on sports analytics and data analysis, referencing and pulling data from sites like Football Outsiders, Baseball Prospectus, Synergy, and ESPN.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title = Oh ESPN, why did you have to kill Grantland?|url = https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-grantland-comment-4acc8d94-8163-11e5-8bd2-680fff868306-20151102-story.html|website = chicagotribune.com|access-date = December 1, 2015}}</ref> ''Grantland'' wove statistics into part of the story and made the analytics understandable to the average sports fan. As Stephen Carter from the ''Chicago Tribune'' put it, "This was sportswriting for grownups."<ref name=":2" /> These pieces would also often include a data visualization representation. Some have concluded that ''Grantland''{{'}}s closure represents a trend in today's media business that unless you are one of the biggest web properties or smallest one-person “micro sites” it's tough to be economically viable.<ref name=":1" />

Simmons started a new media venture in 2016, ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'', which, like ''Grantland'', focuses on sports and pop culture.<ref name="newsweek1">{{cite web|last=Bort |first=Ryan |url=http://www.newsweek.com/bill-simmons-new-website-hbo-ringer-427650 |title=Bill Simmons Announces New Website, The Ringer |website=Newsweek.com |date=2010-04-21 |access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> A number of former ''Grantland'' employees, including Sean Fennessey, Chris Ryan, Mallory Rubin, Juliet Litman, Craig Gaines, Bryan Curtis, Ryan O'Hanlon, Danny Chau, Shea Serrano, Jason Concepcion, Riley McAtee, Joe Fuentes, and Tate Frazier have joined the new venture.<ref>{{cite web|author=Samer Kalaf |url=http://deadspin.com/bill-simmonss-new-site-has-a-name-and-some-new-hires-1759630024 |title=Bill Simmons's New Site Has A Name And Some New Hires |website=Deadspin.com |date=2016-02-17 |access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>

Additionally, Simmons has launched a podcasting network, featuring shows re-purposed from the ''Grantland'' network, including ''The Watch'' with Ryan and television critic [[Andy Greenwald]] and his own podcast ''The Bill Simmons Podcast''.<ref name="newsweek1"/>

Ryan and Greenwald will also host a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' re-cap show on [[HBO]] modeled after their ''Grantland'' podcast "Watch the Thrones" and produced by Simmons.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen |first=Erik |url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/game-of-thrones-aftershow-bill-simmons-hbo-after-the-thrones-1201731633/ |title=Bill Simmons To Produce For 'Game Of Thrones' Aftershow On HBO |website=Deadline.com |date=2016-04-04 |access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>

Simmons debuted a weekly show on HBO, titled ''[[Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons]]'', on June 22, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael O&#039;Connell |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bill-simmons-hbo-show-any-887709 |title=Bill Simmons' HBO Show, 'Any Given Wednesday,' Arrives in June |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2016-04-26 |access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>
