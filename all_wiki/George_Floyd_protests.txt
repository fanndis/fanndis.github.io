In 2015 the [[death of Freddie Gray]] in [[Baltimore]] police custody resulted in riots in the city and nationwide protests as part of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-the-black-lives-matter-movement-changed-america-one-year-later/ |title=Black Lives Matter: How the events in Ferguson sparked a movement in America |first=Shannon |last=Luibrand |date=August 7, 2015 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624181634/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-the-black-lives-matter-movement-changed-america-one-year-later/ |archive-date=June 24, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Several nationally publicized incidents occurred in Minnesota, including the 2015 [[shooting of Jamar Clark]] in [[Minneapolis]]; the 2016 [[shooting of Philando Castile]] in [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota|Falcon Heights]];<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ellis |first1=Ralph |last2=Kirkos |first2=Bill |date=June 16, 2017 |title=Officer who shot Philando Castile found not guilty |website=CNN |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html |accessdate=May 30, 2020}}</ref> and the 2017 [[shooting of Justine Damond]].

MPD Officers Thomas K. Lane and J. Alexander Kueng arrived with their body cameras turned on. A store employee told officers that the man was in a nearby car. Officers approached the car and ordered [[George Floyd]], a 46-year-old African American man, who according to police "appeared to be under the influence", to exit the vehicle, at which point he "physically resisted". According to the MPD, officers "were able to get the suspect into handcuffs, and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance." Once Floyd was handcuffed, he and Officer Lane walked to the sidewalk. Floyd sat on the ground at Officer Lane's direction. In a short conversation, the officer asked Floyd for his name and identification, explaining that he was being arrested for passing counterfeit currency, and asked if he was "on anything".  According to the report officers Kueng and Lane attempted to help Floyd to their squad car, but at 8:14&nbsp;p.m., Floyd stiffened up and fell to the ground. Soon, MPD Officers [[Derek Chauvin]] and [[Killing of George Floyd|Tou Thao]] arrived in a separate squad car.

Many individuals and celebrities used social media to document the protests, spread information, promote donation sites, and post memorials to George Floyd.

Facebook's decision not to remove or label President Trump's tweet of "[[When the looting starts, the shooting starts]]" prompted complaints from Facebook employees that political figures were getting a special exemption from the site's content policies.

===Factors ===
[[File:Civil Unrest 2020 5C2A6287R.jpg|thumb|Masked protesters in [[Philadelphia]] on June 2]]
In June 2020 the CDC released the "Considerations for Events and Gatherings" which assesses large gatherings where it is difficult for people to stay at least six feet apart, and where attendees travel from outside the local area as "highest risk".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goodnough |first1=Abby |title=C.D.C.

==== Masks and distancing ====
<!-- "PPE and distancing" might be more accurate, but it uses an acronym that might not be easily understood by all -->
Speaking about public health implications of demonstrations, Dr. Anthony Fauci said that "[[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic|Masks]] can help, but it's masks plus physical separation".<ref>{{cite news |title=Fauci underscores concerns about protests spreading coronavirus |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/502001-fauci-underscores-concerns-about-protests-spreading-coronavirus |work=The Hill |date=June 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Ashish Jha]], Director of the Global Health Institute at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]], said, "The question is: how do we do protesting safely? I think masks are a critical part of it."<ref name="The Guardian Covid 19" /> Theodore Long, a doctor affiliated with New York's contact tracing strategy, echoed Jha's point, and advocated "proper hand hygiene and to the extent possible, socially distance".<ref name="The Guardian Covid 19" /> Many participants of the protests with potentially unclear current and prior-infection-status – including some police officers – did not wear a face mask at all times,<ref name="bloomberg-toosoon">{{cite news |title=Will the Protests Spread Coronavirus?

==== Overcrowded jails ====
Hundreds of people arrested by police in New York City – including both peaceful demonstrators and persons accused of violence – were detained in overcrowded, sometimes unsanitary [[holding cell]]s, sometimes without [[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic|face masks]], prompting concerns over jail-spread COVID-19 cases.<ref name=Ransom>{{cite newspaper |first=Jan |last=Ransom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/nyregion/nyc-protests-jail.html |title=Despite Virus, Hundreds Arrested in Unrest Are Held in Cramped Jails |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 4, 2020}}</ref> [[The Legal Aid Society]] sued the New York City Police Department, accusing it of detaining people for extended periods (up to three days) in violation of New York state law requiring that arrests receive [[arraignment]]s within 24 hours. The department acknowledged that "it was common for up to two dozen people to be held for hours on buses before being taken to be booked" due to large backlogs and paperwork delays and that [[social distancing]] was impossible within jails, but a [[New York County Supreme Court|state trial court]] denied Legal Aid's request, given the "crisis within a crisis".<ref name=Ransom/>

===Debate over weighing of risks ===
Over 1,200 medical staff signed a letter criticizing what they called "emerging narratives that seemed to malign demonstrations as risky for the public health because of Covid-19".<ref name=Over1000>{{cite news |last1=Simon |first1=Mallory |title=Over 1,000 health professionals sign a letter saying, Don't shut down protests using coronavirus concerns as an excuse |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html |accessdate=June 10, 2020 |work=CNN}}</ref> The letter writers wrote: 
<blockquote>
Staying at home, social distancing, and public masking are effective at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. To the extent possible, we support the application of these public health best practices during demonstrations that call attention to the pervasive lethal force of white supremacy. However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States. We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting practices without detracting from demonstrators' ability to gather and demand change. This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly [[2020 United States anti-lockdown protests|protests against stay-home orders]].<ref name=Over1000/>
</blockquote>

Most protesters in Minneapolis interviewed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine said they "participated with full knowledge of the health risks, and believe police brutality to be an even more urgent existential threat".<ref>{{cite news |title=Covid-19 Cases Were Already Rising Before the George Floyd Protests |url=https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-cases-were-already-rising-before-the-george-floyd-protests/ |accessdate=June 10, 2020 |work=Wired |language=en}}</ref> Dr. [[Tom Frieden]], a former CDC director, said that if trust in government "is undermined by violent policing, or it's undermined by ham-handed public health actions that don't respect communities, that's going to have a negative impact on our ability to fight disease".<ref name="WP-debate">{{cite news |last1=Weiner |first1=Rachel |title=Political and health leaders' embrace of Floyd protests fuels debate over coronavirus restrictions |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/political-and-health-leaders-embrace-of-floyd-protests-fuels-debate-over-coronavirus-restrictions/2020/06/11/9c60bca6-a761-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html |accessdate=June 16, 2020 |work=Washington Post |language=en}}</ref> Frieden has faced considerable backlash for these remarks, most notably from [[Jonah Goldberg]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harmon |first1=Amy |last2=Rojas |first2=Rick |title=A Delicate Balance: Weighing Protest Against the Risks of the Coronavirus |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/Protest-coronavirus-george-floyd.html |accessdate=June 10, 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>

In June, a large number of [[Houston Police Department]] officers tested positive for the virus or were quarantined after being exposed; police chief [[Art Acevedo]] said that none of the officers were seriously ill, and suggested that business reopenings in Texas were more likely the cause of the spread among officers than protest duty, saying "We opened up the state very quickly, especially bars and, you know, I can't control what people do off duty."<ref>{{cite news|title=200 HPD officers under COVID-19 quarantine, chief not among them|url=https://abc13.com/chief-art-acevedo-houston-police-department-coronavirus-covid-19/6286402/|publisher=KTRK|author=Ted Oberg|date=June 30, 2020}}</ref> Members of the D.C.

Many countries, companies, organizations, and celebrities worldwide sent messages of concern about the George Floyd killing and protests. Some television channels blacked out regular programming for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in solidarity with the protests while some celebrities and companies made donations to racial justice organizations. Some politicians also participated in the protests, while others called for protesters to refrain from violence.

U.S. president Donald Trump demanded that state governors "dominate" protesters and, on May 29, tweeted "[[when the looting starts, the shooting starts]]", which Twitter marked as "glorifying violence".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mansell |first1=William |last2=Cathey |first2=Libby |title=Twitter flags Trump, White House for 'glorifying violence' in tweets about George Floyd protests |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/twitter-flags-trump-white-house-glorifying-violence-tweet/story?id=70945228 |accessdate=2020-06-04 |work=[[ABC News]] |date=May 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Purnell|first1=Newley|last2=Restuccia|first2=Andrew|date=May 29, 2020|title=Twitter Flags Trump Tweet About George Floyd Protests for 'Glorifying Violence' |language=en-US|work=wsj.com|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-hides-trump-tweet-for-glorifying-violence-11590743851|access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> Trump later said he was not advocating violence, noting that the tweet could be read as either a threat or a statement of fact and that he intended for it to be read as "a combination of both".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Panetta |first=Grace |title=Trump claims his 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts' remarks weren't a call to violence but instead a 'fact' |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defends-his-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts-tweet-2020-5 |website=Business Insider |access-date=June 17, 2020}}</ref> Trump controversially [[2020 deployment of federal forces in the United States|deployed various federal law enforcement agencies]], the [[District of Columbia National Guard]], and the [[Arlington County Police Department]] to clear [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] and surrounding streets for a [[Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church|photo-op at St. John's Church]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rogers |first1=Katie |title=As Trump Calls Protesters ‘Terrorists,’ Tear Gas Clears a Path for His Walk to a Church |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/politics/trump-governors.html |accessdate=3 November 2020 |work=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |date=2020-06-01}}</ref>
