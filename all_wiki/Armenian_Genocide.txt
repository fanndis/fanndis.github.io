The '''Armenian Genocide'''{{efn|{{lang-hy|Հայոց ցեղասպանություն}} {{lang-hy|script=Latn|label=none|Hayots tseghaspanutyun}}; {{lang-tr|Ermeni Soykırımı/Ermeni Kırımı}}; {{lang-fr|Génocide arménien}}<!--See [[Languages of the Ottoman Empire]] and Johann Strauss's articles about the languages; French was the main language of the educated, among Christians/Jews, and to foreign residents since Tanzimat-->{{cn|date=November 2020}}}} was the systematic mass murder and expulsion of ethnic [[Armenians]] carried out in Turkey and adjoining regions by the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] during [[World War I]]. Although sporadic massacres of Armenians began in mid-1914, the starting date of the genocide is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders]] from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] (now Istanbul), most of whom were eventually murdered. 

The genocide, ordered by the [[Three Pashas]] as part of a process of forced [[Turkification]], was implemented in two phases. First, the able-bodied male population was killed in massacres. Second, according to the [[Tehcir Law]], an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million women, children, elderly, and infirm Armenians were deported on [[death march]]es leading to the [[Syrian Desert]] in 1915 and 1916. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic [[robbery]], [[rape during the Armenian Genocide|rape]],  and [[massacre]]. Only around 200,000 deportees were still alive by the end of 1916. According to some definitions the genocide includes the [[Republic of Turkey]]'s massacres of tens of thousands of Armenian civilians during the 1920 [[Turkish–Armenian War]].

Most estimates of the total [[casualties of the Armenian Genocide|number of Armenians who died]] as a result of Ottoman and Turkish government policies between 1915 and 1923 are in the range of 800,000 to over 1 million. During this time period, other ethnic groups were also targeted for extermination in the [[Assyrian genocide]] and the [[Greek genocide]].

[[Raphael Lemkin]] was inspired by the annihilation of the Armenians to define the crime of systematic extermination of a people, which he called ''[[genocide]]'', in 1943. The Armenian Genocide is the second-most-studied case of genocide after [[the Holocaust]]. In contrast to the vast majority of genocide scholars and historians, Turkey [[Armenian Genocide denial|denies that the word genocide]] is an accurate term for these crimes. {{As of|2019}}, governments and parliaments of 32 countries, including the United States, Russia, and Germany, have recognized the events as a genocide.

{{Main|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian population}}

=== Armenians under Ottoman rule ===
The western portion of historical Armenia, known as [[Western Armenia]], had come under Ottoman jurisdiction by the [[Peace of Amasya]] (1555) and was permanently divided from Eastern Armenia by the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] (1639).<ref>{{cite book| last1=Herzig| first1=Edmund| last2=Kurkchiyan |first2=Marina|title=The Armenians: Past and Present in the Making of National Identity |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-79837-6|page=47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8WRAgAAQBAJ&q=peace+of+amasya+treaty+of+zuhab+armenia+permanently}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Khachaturian|first1=Lisa|title=Cultivating Nationhood in Imperial Russia: The Periodical Press and the Formation of a Modern Armenian Identity|date=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-4128-1372-3 |page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0uY_tuRcx8C&q=western+armenia+treaty+of+zuhab}}</ref> Thereafter, the region was alternatively referred to as "Turkish" or "Ottoman" Armenia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adalian |first1=Rouben Paul| author-link1=Rouben Paul Adalian|title=Historical Dictionary of Armenia|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7450-3 |page=337 |edition= 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QS-vSjHObOYC&q=turkish+armenia+western+armenia}}</ref> The vast majority of Armenians were grouped together into a semi-autonomous community, the Armenian ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]],'' which was led by one of the spiritual heads of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]]. Armenians were mainly concentrated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, although large communities were also found in the western provinces, as well as in the capital, [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].

The Armenian community was made up of three religious denominations: [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]], [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Protestant]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], the Church of the vast majority of Armenians. Under the millet system, the Armenian community was allowed to rule itself under its own system of governance with fairly little interference from the Ottoman government. Most Armenians—approximately 70%—lived in poor and dangerous conditions in the rural countryside, with the exception of the wealthy, Constantinople-based ''Amira'' class, a social elite whose members included the Duzians (Directors of the Imperial Mint), the [[Balyan family|Balyans]] (Chief Imperial Architects) and the [[Dadian family|Dadians]] (Superintendent of the Gunpowder Mills and manager of industrial factories).<ref>{{Citation | author-link = Hagop Barsoumian| last = Barsoumian | first = Hagop | year = 1982 | contribution = The Dual Role of the Armenian Amira Class within the Ottoman Government and the Armenian Millet (1750–1850) | title = Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire: The Functioning of a Plural Society | volume = I | editor1-first = Benjamin | editor1-last = Braude | editor2-first = Bernard | editor2-last = Lewis | place = New York | publisher = Holmes & Meier}}</ref><ref name="Barsoumian">{{Citation | last = Barsoumian | first = Hagop | year = 1997 | contribution = The Eastern Question and the Tanzimat Era | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times | volume = II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century | editor-first = Richard G | editor-last = Hovannisian | editor-link = Richard G.

In the eastern provinces, the Armenians were subject to the whims of their Turkish and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] neighbors, who would regularly overtax them, subject them to [[brigandage]] and kidnapping, force them to convert to Islam, and otherwise exploit them without interference from central or local authorities.<ref name="Barsoumian" /> In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the ''[[dhimmi]]'' system implemented in [[Islam|Muslim]] countries, they, like all other Christians and also Jews, were accorded certain freedoms. The ''dhimmi'' system in the Ottoman Empire was largely based upon the [[Pact of Umar]]. The client status established the rights of the non-Muslims to property, livelihood and freedom of worship, but they were in essence treated as [[second-class citizen]]s in the empire and referred to in Turkish as ''[[Giaour|gavours]]'', a pejorative word meaning "[[infidel]]" or "unbeliever". The clause of the Pact of Umar which prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship was historically imposed on some communities of the Ottoman Empire and ignored in other cases, at the discretion of local authorities. Although there were no laws mandating religious ghettos, this led to non-Muslim communities being clustered around existing houses of worship.<ref name="ÁgostonMasters2010">{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA185|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7| page=185}}</ref><ref name="Balakian">{{Cite book | author-link = Peter Balakian| last = Balakian | first = Peter | title = The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response | place = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-06-019840-0| title-link = The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response }}</ref>

In addition to other legal limitations, Christians were not considered equals to Muslims and several prohibitions were placed on them. Testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law wherein a Muslim could be punished; this meant that their testimony could only be considered in commercial cases. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses and camels. Their houses could not overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely circumscribed, e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden.<ref name="ÁgostonMasters2010" /><ref name="Akçam">{{Cite book | first = Taner | last = Akçam | author-link = Taner Akçam | title = A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility | place = New York | publisher = Metropolitan Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8050-7932-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/shamefulactarmen00ak | url-access = registration | quote = “Right to intervene”. |pages=[https://archive.org/details/shamefulactarmen00ak/page/n34 1]–93}}</ref>

=== Reform, 1840s–1880s ===
{{Main|Armenian Question}}
[[File:Ethnic map of Asia Minor and Caucasus in 1914.jpg|thumb|German ethnographic map of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Caucasus]] in 1914. Armenians are labeled in blue.]]

In the mid-19th century, the three major European powers—the United Kingdom, France and Russia—began to question the Ottoman Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and pressure it to grant equal rights to all its subjects. From 1839 to the declaration of a constitution in 1876, the Ottoman government instituted the [[Tanzimat]], a series of reforms designed to improve the status of minorities. Nevertheless, most of the reforms were never implemented because the empire's Muslim population rejected the principle of equality for Christians. By the late 1870s, the European<!-- There were still Greeks in Anatolia and Cyprus --> [[Kingdom of Greece|Greeks]], along with several other Christian nations in the [[Balkans]], frustrated with their conditions, had, often with the help of the [[Entente powers]], broken free of Ottoman rule.<ref name="Dadrian">{{cite book |author-link=Vahakn Dadrian |last=Dadrian |first=Vahakn N. |title=The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus |place=Oxford |publisher= Berghahn Books |year=1995 | isbn=1-57181-666-6}}</ref>{{rp|192}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Suny| first1=Ronald Grigor|author-link=Ronald Grigor Suny|title=Looking toward Ararat Armenia in modern history| date=1993| publisher=Indiana university press| location=Bloomington |isbn=0253207738| page=[https://archive.org/details/lookingtowardara00rona/page/101 101] |url=https://archive.org/details/lookingtowardara00rona|url-access=registration}}</ref>

The Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, earning them the title of ''millet-i sadika'' or the "loyal millet".<ref>{{cite news| title = What happened to the Armenians (Millet-i Sadıka)?| newspaper = [[Daily Sabah]]| access-date = 3 May 2018| url = https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2014/04/26/what-happened-to-the-armenians-milleti-sadika}}</ref> In the mid-1860s and early 1870s this passivity gave way to new currents of thinking in Armenian society. Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: "the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial". The Ottoman government considered these grievances and promised to punish those responsible, but no meaningful steps to do so were ever taken.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |36}}

Following the violent suppression of Christians during the [[Great Eastern Crisis]], particularly in [[Herzegovina uprising (1875–1877)|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[April Uprising|Bulgaria]] and [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–1878)|Serbia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[France]] invoked the 1856 [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |35ff}} Under growing pressure, the government of [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] declared itself a constitutional monarchy with a parliament (which was almost immediately [[Legislative session#Common procedure|prorogued]]) and entered into negotiations with the powers. At the same time, the Armenian patriarch of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread "forced land seizure&nbsp;... forced conversion of women and children, arson, [[Protection racket|protection extortion]], rape, and murder" to the Powers.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |37}}

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 ended with Russia's decisive victory and its army in occupation of large parts of eastern Turkey, but not before entire Armenian districts had been devastated by massacres carried out with the connivance of Ottoman authorities. In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which was signed on 3 March 1878. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations. In its place, the two sides agreed on a clause making the [[Sublime Porte]]'s implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces a condition of Russia's withdrawal, thus designating Russia the guarantor of the reforms.<ref>{{citation |title=Treaty of San Stefano |quote=As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia&nbsp;... might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and [[Circassians]]. |chapter=Article 16|title-link=Treaty of San Stefano }}</ref> The clause entered the treaty as Article 16 and marked the first appearance of what came to be known in European diplomacy as the ''[[Armenian Question]]''.

Upon receiving a copy of the treaty, Britain promptly objected to it and particularly Article 16, which it saw as ceding too much influence to Russia. It immediately pushed for a congress of the [[great power]]s to be convened to discuss and revise the treaty, leading to the [[Congress of Berlin]] in June–July 1878.{{efn|The great powers at the Congress of Berlin were Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhqpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA12|title=Iran-Turkey Relations, 1979–2011: Conceptualising the Dynamics of Politics, Religion and Security in Middle-Power States|last=Elik| first=Suleyman| date=2013| page=12| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136630880|language=en}}</ref>}} Patriarch Nerses of the Armenian Apostolic Church sent a delegation led by his predecessor, Archbishop [[Khrimian Hayrik]], to speak for the Armenians, but it was not admitted into the sessions on the grounds that it did not represent a country. Confined to the periphery, the delegation did its best to contact the representatives of the powers and argue the case for Armenian administrative autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, but to little effect.

Britain and Russia, having already reached an understanding a month before the congress, entered with the other great powers into the drafting of a final treaty. The old clause was replaced with one in which the Sublime Porte agreed "to carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians", and to "guarantee their security against the Circassians and the Kurds." The Armenians, although perceiving the new clause to be an improvement from the previous one, noted the clear absence of a guarantee of autonomy in addition to the confirmed evacuation of Russian soldiers as a reverse from the San Stefano treaty. <ref name="Akçam" />{{rp|38–39}} The clause was readily adopted as Article 61 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] on the last day of the Congress, 13 July 1878, to the deep disappointment of the Armenian delegation.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp|38–39}}

=== Armenian national liberation movement ===
{{Main|Armenian national liberation movement}}
Prospects for reforms faded rapidly following the signing of the Berlin treaty, as security conditions in the Armenian provinces went from bad to worse and abuses proliferated. Upset with this turn of events, a number of disillusioned Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia decided to form political parties and societies dedicated to the betterment of their compatriots in the Ottoman Empire. In the last quarter of the 19th century, this movement came to be dominated by three parties: the [[Armenakan Party|Armenakan]], whose influence was limited to [[Van, Turkey|Van]]; the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]]; and the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaktsutiun). Ideological differences aside, all the parties had the common goal of achieving better social conditions for the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire through self-defense<ref>{{Citation | last = Nalbandian | first = Louise | title = The Armenian Revolutionary Movement: The Development of Armenian Political Parties through the Nineteenth Century | place = Berkeley | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1963| url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb__dIsS3aidr0C| isbn=0520009142}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Libaridian | first = Gerard | contribution = What was Revolutionary about Armenian Revolutionary Parties in the Ottoman Empire? | title = A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire | editor-link = Ronald Grigor Suny | editor-first = Ronald | editor-last = Suny | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2011 | pages = 82–112|display-editors=etal |isbn=9780195393743| url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780195393743.001.0001/acprof-9780195393743-chapter-5}}</ref> and advocating increased European pressure on the Ottoman government to implement the promised reforms.

Soon after the Treaty of Berlin was signed, Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] (1876–1909) attempted to forestall the implementation of its reform provisions by asserting that Armenians did not make up a majority in the provinces and that their reports of abuses were largely exaggerated or false. In 1890, Abdul Hamid created a paramilitary outfit known as the ''[[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]],'' which was mostly made up of Kurdish irregulars tasked to "deal with the Armenians as they wished".<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |40}} As Ottoman officials intentionally provoked rebellions (often as a result of over-taxation) in Armenian populated towns, such as in [[1894 Sasun rebellion|Sasun]] in 1894 and [[Zeitun rebellion (1895–96)|Zeitun]] in 1895–1896, those regiments were increasingly used to deal with the Armenians by way of oppression and massacre. In some instances, Armenians successfully fought off the regiments and in 1895 brought the excesses to the attention of the Great Powers, who subsequently condemned the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]].<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |40–42}}

In May 1895, the Powers forced Abdul Hamid to sign a new reform package designed to curtail the powers of the Hamidiye, but, like the Berlin Treaty, it was never implemented. On 1 October 1895, 2,000 Armenians assembled in Constantinople to petition for the implementation of the reforms, but Ottoman police units violently broke the rally up.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |57–58}} Soon, massacres of Armenians broke out in Constantinople and then engulfed the rest of the Armenian-populated provinces of [[Bitlis]], [[Diyarbekir]], [[Erzurum]], [[Harput]], [[Sivas]], Trebizond ([[Trabzon]]), and Van. Estimates differ on how many Armenians were killed, but European documentation of the [[pogroms]], which became known as the [[Hamidian massacres]], placed the figures at between 100,000 and 300,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Armenian Genocide| url=http://www.history.com/topics/armenian-genocide|website=history.com|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]}}<br/>The [[German Foreign Ministry]] operative, Ernst Jackh, estimated that 200,000 Armenians were killed and a further 50,000 expelled from the provinces during the Hamidian unrest. French diplomats placed the figures at 250,000 killed. The German pastor [[Johannes Lepsius]] was more meticulous in his calculations, counting the deaths of 88,000&nbsp;Armenians and the destruction of 2,500&nbsp;villages, 645&nbsp;churches and monasteries, and the plundering of hundreds of churches, of which 328 were converted into mosques.</ref>

Although Hamid was never directly implicated, it is believed that the massacres had his tacit approval.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |42}} Frustrated with European indifference to the massacres, a group of members of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] [[1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover|seized]] the European-managed [[Ottoman Bank]] on 26 August 1896.

{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}
[[File:Ottoman Armenians 1908.jpg|thumb|Armenians of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] celebrating the establishment of the [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP]] government]]

On 24 July 1908, Armenians' hopes for equality in the Ottoman Empire brightened when a [[coup d'état]] staged by officers in the Ottoman [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] based in [[Salonika]] removed Abdul Hamid II from power and restored the country to a constitutional monarchy. The officers were part of the [[Young Turks|Young Turk]] movement that wanted to reform administration of the perceived [[Decadence|decadent]] state of the Ottoman Empire and modernize it to European standards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Turk Revolution| url=http://matrix.msu.edu/hst/fisher/HST150/unit6/mod/young_turk_revolution.html|website=matrix.msu.edu| access-date=13 December 2015|url-status=dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111004/http://matrix.msu.edu/hst/fisher/HST150/unit6/mod/young_turk_revolution.html|archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=November 2020}} The movement was an anti-Hamidian coalition made up of two distinct groups, the liberal [[constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] and the nationalists. The former were more democratic and accepting of Armenians, whereas the latter were less tolerant of Armenians and their frequent requests for European assistance.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |140–41}} 

One of the numerous factions within the Young Turk movement was a secret revolutionary organization called the ''[[Committee of Union and Progress]]'' (CUP). It drew its membership from disaffected army officers based in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] and was behind a wave of mutinies against the central government. In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to march on the capital to depose him. Abdulhamid, shaken by the wave of resentment, stepped down from power as [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Arab]]s, [[Bulgarians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] alike rejoiced in his dethronement.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |143–44}}

=== Adana massacre of 1909 ===
{{Main|Adana massacre}}
[[File:AdanaChristianQuarter.jpg|thumb|The Armenian quarter after the massacres in [[Adana]] in 1909]]

Abdulhamid attempted [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|a countercoup]] in early 1909, ultimately resulting in the [[31 March Incident]] on 13 April 1909. Some reactionary Ottoman military elements, joined by [[Islam]]ic [[theological]] students, aimed to return control of the country to the Sultan and the rule of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Riots and fighting broke out between the reactionary forces and CUP forces, until the CUP was able to put down the uprising and [[court-martial]] the opposition leaders.{{cn|date=November 2020}} While the movement initially targeted the Young Turk government, it spilled over into pogroms against Armenians who were perceived as having supported the restoration of the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitution]].<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |68–69}} About 4,000 Turkish civilians and soldiers participated in the rampage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nyti.ms/2BC6Q9c|title=Details of Slaughter Received.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 May 1909|access-date=17 February 2018| language=en}}<br /> Cited in {{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlwEDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 |title=Genocide in the Ottoman Empire: Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks, 1913–1923 |last=Shirinian |first=George N.|date=13 February 2017|publisher=Berghahn Books| isbn=9781785334337 |page=121 |language=en}}</ref>  Estimates of the number of Armenians killed in the course of the [[Adana massacre]] range between 15,000 and 30,000 people.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |69}}<ref>{{cite news |title=30,000 Killed in massacres; Conservative estimate of victims of Turkish fanaticism in Adana Vilayet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1909/04/25/archives/30000-killed-in-massacres-conservative-estimate-of-victims-of.html |date=25 April 1909 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

=== Conflict in the Balkans and Russia ===
{{see also|Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire}}
In 1912, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out and ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire as well as the loss of 85% of its European territory.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |84}} The Turkish nationalist movement in the country gradually came to view [[Anatolia]] as their last refuge.{{cn|date=November 2020}} An important consequence of the [[Balkan Wars]] was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''[[muhacir]]s'') from the Balkans. Beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Chechens]], were forcibly expelled and others voluntarily migrated from the [[Caucasus]] and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish wars]], the [[Russo-Circassian War]] and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: "Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge".<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Akçam]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |86–87}}

== Decision and early actions ==
===Entry into World War I===

On 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

According to [[Gerard Libaridian]], the decision to enter the war and the decision to begin the genocide were part and parcel of the same progress as the war held out the promise of national greatness once the Allies were defeated while the Armenians were seen as an inner enemy holding the Turks back from the national glory that was the dream of the Unionist Central Committee.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|last=Libaridian|first=Gerard J|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yED-aVDCbycC&pg=PA223|title=Genocide and the Modern Age|date=2000|isbn=0-8156-2828-5|editor-last1=Walliman|editor-first1=Isidor|location=Syracuse, New York|page=223|chapter=The Ultimate Repression: The Genocide of the Armenians, 1915-1917|editor-last2=Dobkowski|editor-first2=Michael N}}</ref> Furthermore, the war-time radicalising atmosphere of emergency and national crisis made it possible to pursue policies that would be seen as unacceptable in peace-time.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

{{further|Ottoman labour battalions}}

On 25 February 1915, the Ottoman General Staff released the War Minister Enver Pasha's ''Directive 8682'' on "Increased security and precautions" to all military units calling for the removal of all ethnic Armenians serving in the Ottoman forces from their posts and for their demobilization. They were assigned to the unarmed [[Labour battalion]]s (Turkish: ''amele taburları''). The directive accused the Armenian Patriarchate of releasing State secrets to the Russians. Enver Pasha explained this decision as "out of fear that they would collaborate with the Russians".<ref>{{cite book| last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|title="They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else": A History of the Armenian Genocide|date=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400865581 |page=244 |title-link="They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else": A History of the Armenian Genocide}} – [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zBtBgAAQBAJ Profile at] [[Google Books]]</ref> Traditionally, the Ottoman Army only drafted non-Muslim males between the ages of 20 and 45 into the regular army.

On 19 April 1915, [[Jevdet Bey]] demanded that the [[city of Van]] immediately furnish him 4,000&nbsp;soldiers under the pretext of [[conscription]]. However, it was clear to the Armenian population that his goal was to massacre the able-bodied men of Van so that there would be no defenders.

The next day, 20 April 1915, the siege of Van began when an Armenian woman was harassed, and the two Armenian men who came to her aid were killed by Ottoman soldiers. The Armenian defenders protected the 30,000&nbsp;residents and 15,000&nbsp;refugees living in an area of roughly one square kilometer of the Armenian Quarter and suburb of Aigestan with 1,500&nbsp;ablebodied riflemen who were supplied with 300&nbsp;rifles and 1,000&nbsp;pistols and antique weapons.

''At the fourteenth session of the trial (Saturday, 26 April 1919), a young woman, Manning Yerazian, gave a baffling and portentous testimony. She was left with her sisters in Trebizond and witnessed the poisoning and liquidation through 'disinfection' of the infants.

In the mezzanine of one of the schools, there was a tiled room purporting to be a steam chamber (islim). The Turkish women would escort groups of infants to that room for a steam bath. 'First we didn't realize what was happening. But one day we heard cries that abruptly ceased and were followed by a deathly silence. We then paid closer attention to what was happening.

The premeditated destruction of objects of Armenian cultural, religious, historical and communal heritage was yet another key purpose of both the genocide itself and the post-genocidal campaign of denial.

[[Imperial Germany]] was allied with the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Some German diplomats openly supported the Ottoman policy against the Armenians. As [[Hans Humann]], the German naval attaché in Constantinople said to US Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|Henry Morgenthau]]:

{{quote|I have lived in Turkey the larger part of my life&nbsp;... and I know the Armenians. I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians. I think that they are entirely justified. The weaker nation must succumb.

The Russian Empire's response to the bombardment of its Black Sea naval ports was primarily a land campaign through the Caucasus. Early victories against the Ottoman Empire from the winter of 1914 to the spring of 1915 saw significant gains of territory, including relieving the Armenian bastion resisting in the city of Van in May 1915.

== Studies on the genocide ==

Polish [[jurist]] Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term [[genocide]] in 1943, cited the Turkish extermination of the Armenians and the Nazi extermination of the Jews as defining examples of what he meant by genocide. Outraged that there was no legal framework under which to try the perpetrators of such crimes, Lemkin spearheaded the adoption of the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dirk Moses| first=A.| title=Genocide and Settler Society: Frontier Violence and Stolen Indigenous Children in Australian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zHAGNPTkqIC&pg=PA21| access-date=15 April 2016| year=2004| publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-410-4|page=21|quote=Indignant that the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide had largely escaped prosecution, Lemkin, who was a young state prosecutor in Poland, began lobbying in the early 1930s for international law to criminalize the destruction of such groups.}}</ref><ref>[[Yair Auron]].

A ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article addressed this modern Turkish conception of history thus:

{{quote|Would you admit to the crimes of your grandfathers, if these crimes didn't really happen?" asked ambassador Öymen. But the problem lies precisely in this question, says [[Hrant Dink]], publisher and editor-in-chief of the Istanbul-based Armenian weekly ''[[Agos]]''. Turkey's bureaucratic elite have never really shed themselves of the Ottoman tradition—in the perpetrators, they see their fathers, whose honor they seek to defend. This tradition instills a sense of identity in Turkish nationalists—both from the left and the right, and it is passed on from generation to generation through the school system. This tradition also requires an antipole against which it could define itself. Since the times of the Ottoman Empire, religious minorities have been pushed into this role.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0%2C1518%2C353274%2C00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027160358/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0%2C1518%2C353274%2C00.html|archive-date=27 October 2006|title=Turkey's Memory Lapse: Armenian Genocide Plagues Ankara 90 Years On|work=Spiegel Online}}</ref>}}

As a response to continuing denial by the Turkish state, many activists from [[Armenian Diaspora]] communities have pushed for formal recognition of the Armenian Genocide from various governments around the world. On 4 March 2010, a U.S. congressional panel narrowly voted that the incident was indeed genocide; within minutes the Turkish government issued a statement critical of "this resolution which accuses the Turkish nation of a crime it has not committed".
