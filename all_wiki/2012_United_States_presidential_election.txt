The '''2012 United States presidential election''' was the 57th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and his [[running mate]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], were re-elected to a second term. They defeated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket of businessman and former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Paul Ryan]] of [[Wisconsin]].

As the incumbent [[president (government title)|president]], Obama secured the [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] without serious opposition. The Republicans experienced a [[2012 Republican Party presidential primaries|competitive primary]]. Romney was consistently competitive in the polls and won the support of many party leaders, but he faced challenges from a number of more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] contenders. Romney secured his party's nomination in May, defeating former Senator [[Rick Santorum]], former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]], and Texas congressman [[Ron Paul]], among other candidates.

The campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues, and debate centered largely around sound responses to the [[Great Recession]]. Other issues included long-term [[United States federal budget|federal budget]] issues, the future of [[social insurance|social insurance programs]], and the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]], Obama's marquee legislative program. [[Foreign policy]] was also discussed, including the phase-out of the [[Iraq War]], military spending, the [[Iran]]ian [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]], and appropriate counteractions to [[terrorism]]. The campaign was marked by a sharp rise in fundraising, including from nominally independent [[Super PACs]].

Obama defeated Romney, winning a majority of both the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin#Table of election results|popular vote]]. Obama won 332 electoral votes and 51.1% of the popular vote compared to Romney's 206 electoral votes and 47.2%. Obama was the first incumbent since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] to win reelection with fewer electoral votes and a smaller popular vote margin than had been won in the previous election, and was also the first two-term president since [[Ronald Reagan]] to win both his presidential bids with a majority of the nationwide popular vote (50% or more). This was also the first presidential election since 1944 in which neither candidate had military experience. Obama did not hold onto [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]], [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|North Carolina]], or [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district]], but crucially won all 18 "[[Blue wall (politics)|blue wall]]" states and defeated Romney in other [[swing states]] the Republicans had won in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]], most notably [[2012 United States presidential election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[2012 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida]], [[2012 United States presidential election in Ohio|Ohio]], and [[2012 United States presidential election in Virginia|Virginia]]. Ultimately, of the nine swing states identified by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in the 2012 election, Obama won eight, losing only North Carolina. This is also the most recent presidential election when the Democratic candidate won the states of [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]], along with [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]].

Following his loss Romney quietly retired from politics only to run for retiring senator [[Orrin Hatch]]'s seat in 2018, easily winning it.

==State changes to voter registration and electoral rules==
In 2011, several state legislatures passed new voting laws, especially pertaining to voter identification, with the stated purpose of combating [[voter fraud]]; the laws were attacked, however, by the Democratic Party as attempts to suppress voting among its supporters and to improve the Republican Party's presidential prospects. [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Ohio]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-callahan/ohios-voter-id-law-and-th_b_840399.html |title=David Callahan: Ohio's Voter ID Law and the 2012 Election |work= Huffington Post Politics blog |accessdate=October 20, 2011 |date=March 25, 2011}}</ref> [[Tennessee]], and [[West Virginia]]'s state legislatures approved measures to shorten early voting periods.

==Nominations==
===Democratic Party nomination===
{{Main article|2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}

====Primaries====
With an incumbent president running for re-election against [[Paper candidate|token opposition]], the race for the Democratic nomination was largely uneventful. The nomination process consisted of [[United States presidential primary|primaries and caucuses]], held by the 50 states, as well as [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], and [[Democrats Abroad]]. Additionally, high-ranking party members known as [[superdelegate]]s each received one vote in the convention. A few of the primary challengers surpassed the president's vote total in individual counties in several of the seven contested primaries, though none made a significant impact in the delegate count. Running unopposed everywhere else, Obama cemented his status as the Democratic [[presumptive nominee]] on April 3, 2012, by securing the minimum number of pledged delegates needed to obtain the nomination.<ref>Jackson, David (April 4, 2012)[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/04/this-just-in-obama-clinches-democratic-nomination/1 "It's official: Obama clinches Democratic nomination"], ''[[USA Today]]''.

===Republican Party nomination===
{{Main article|2012 Republican Party presidential primaries}}

====Primaries====
Candidates with considerable name recognition who entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination in the early stages of the primary campaign included [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and former Libertarian nominee [[Ron Paul]], former [[Minnesota]] Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]], who co-chaired [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|John McCain's campaign in 2008]], former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]], the runner-up for the nomination in the 2008 cycle, and former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]].

The first debate took place on May 5, 2011, in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], with businessman [[Herman Cain]], former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], [[Ron Paul]], [[Tim Pawlenty]], and former [[Pennsylvania]] Senator [[Rick Santorum]] participating. Another debate took place a month later, with [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Mitt Romney]], former Utah Governor [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]], and Minnesota Congresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] participating, and Gary Johnson excluded. A total of thirteen debates were held before the Iowa caucuses.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The first major event of the campaign was the [[Ames Straw Poll]], which took place in Iowa on August 13, 2011. Michele Bachmann won the straw poll (this ultimately proved to be the acme of her campaign).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Goldman |first=Russell |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/bachmann-drops-out-of-presidential-race/ |title=Michele Bachmann Drops Out of Presidential Race |publisher=ABC News |date=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Pawlenty withdrew from the race after a poor showing in the straw poll, as did [[Thaddeus McCotter]], the only candidate among those who qualified for the ballot who was refused entrance into the debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61098.html|title=Barred hopefuls make debate plans |last=Summers |first=Juana |date=August 11, 2011 |work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>

It became clear at around this point in the nomination process that while Romney was considered to be the likely nominee by the Republican establishment, a large segment of the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] primary electorate found him to be too [[moderate]] for their political views. As a result, a number of potential "anti-Romney" candidates were put forward,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/01/09/us-campaign-romney-idINDEE80804P20120109|title=Romney's rivals running out of time to stop him|first=Tim|last=Reid|date=January 9, 2012|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Norington|first1=Brad|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/romney-has-money-but-lacks-conviction/story-e6frg6ux-1226285540352|title=Romney has money but lacks conviction|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref> including future President [[Donald Trump]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohn|first1=Alicia M.|url=http://thehill.com/video/campaign/198319-trump-romney-lacks-the-courage-to-participate-in-his-debate|title=Trump says Romney lacks the 'courage' to participate in Newsmax debate|website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref> former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Timothy|date=March 30, 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/opinion/stanley-sarah-palin/|title=If only Sarah Palin had run ...|website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref> New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/30/chris-christie-s-2012-siren-call-why-the-nj-governor-resists-gop-pitch.html|title=Chris Christie's 2012 Tease|first=John|last=Avlon|date=August 31, 2011}}</ref> and Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Tom|last2=Silverleib|first2=Alan|date=September 1, 2011|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-01/politics/republican.nomination_1_romney-and-bachmann-tea-party-sarah-palin?_s=PM:POLITICS|title=Seeking the 'anti-Romney' in the Republican presidential race|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712110209/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-09-01/politics/republican.nomination_1_romney-and-bachmann-tea-party-sarah-palin?_s=PM%3APOLITICS|archive-date=July 12, 2012|website=CNN|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref> the last of whom decided to run in August 2011.

[[File:Romney 2011 Paradise Valley, AZ rally.jpg|thumb|[[Mitt Romney]] on the campaign trail]]

Santorum, who had previously run an essentially one-state campaign in Iowa, was able to organize a national campaign after his surprising victory there. He unexpectedly carried three states in a row on February 7 and overtook Romney in nationwide opinion polls, becoming the only candidate in the race to effectively challenge the notion that Romney was the inevitable nominee.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Madison|first1=Lucy|date=February 8, 2012|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57373308-503544/santorum-hopes-to-build-momentum-from-3-state-sweep/|title=Santorum hopes to build momentum from 3-state sweep|website=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref> However, Romney won all of the other contests between South Carolina and the [[Super Tuesday, 2012|Super Tuesday primaries]], and regained his first-place status in nationwide opinion polls by the end of February.

The [[Super Tuesday, 2012|Super Tuesday primaries]] took place on March 6.

Santorum won Kansas and three Southern primaries, but he was unable to make any substantial gain on Romney, who became a formidable frontrunner after securing more than half of the delegates allocated in March.

On April 10, Santorum suspended his campaign due to a variety of reasons, such as a low delegate count, unfavorable polls in his home state of Pennsylvania, and his daughter's health, leaving Mitt Romney as the undisputed front-runner for the presidential nomination and allowing Gingrich to claim that he was "the last conservative standing" in the campaign for the nomination.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gabriel|first1=Trip|date=April 10, 2012|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/gingrich-says-hes-in-the-race-to-the-end/#|title=Gingrich Says He's in the Race to the End|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> After disappointing results in the April 24 primaries (finishing second in one state, third in three, and fourth in one), Gingrich dropped out on May 2 in a move that was seen as an effective end to the nomination contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/25/overheard-on-cnn-com-what-brought-down-gingrichs-campaign-whats-next/|title=Overheard on CNN.com: What brought down Gingrich's campaign?

On May 29, after winning the Texas primary, Romney had received a sufficient number of delegates to clinch the party's nomination with the inclusion of unpledged delegates. After winning the June 5 primaries in California and several other states, Romney had received more than enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination without counting unpledged delegates, making the June 26 Utah Primary, the last contest of the cycle, purely symbolic. CNN's final delegate estimate, released on July 27, 2012, put Romney at 1,462 pledged delegates and 62 unpledged delegates, for a total estimate of 1,524 delegates. No other candidate had unpledged delegates. The delegate estimates for the other candidates were Santorum at 261 delegates, Paul at 154, Gingrich at 142, Bachmann at 1, Huntsman at 1, and all others at 0.<ref name="romneyclinches">{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Steve|date=May 30, 2012|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/30/us-usa-campaign-romney-idUSBRE84T02720120530|title=Romney clinches Republican 2012 nomination in Texas|website=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref>

===Financing and advertising===
The United States presidential election of 2012 broke new records in financing, fundraising, and [[negative campaigning]]. Through [[grassroots]] campaign contributions, online donations, and [[Super PACs]], Obama and Romney raised a combined total of more than $2 billion.<ref>{{cite news |last=Braun |first=Stephen |title=$2 Billion Price Tag for Presidential Election |url= http://bigstory.ap.org/article/casino-owner-aided-romney-late-10-million-bet|accessdate=December 9, 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 6, 2012}}</ref> Super PACs constituted nearly one-fourth of the total financing, with most coming from pro-Romney PACs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Confessore |first=Nicholas |title=Little to Show for Cash Flood by Big Donors |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/us/politics/little-to-show-for-cash-flood-by-big-donors.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all|accessdate=December 9, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> Obama raised $690 million through online channels, beating his record of $500 million in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Scherer |first=Michael |title=Exclusive: Obama's 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008 |url=http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/15/exclusive-obamas-2012-digital-fundraising-outperformed-2008/ |accessdate=December 9, 2012 |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 27, 2012}}</ref> Most of the advertising in the 2012 presidential campaign was decidedly negative—80% of Obama's ads and 84% of Romney's ads were negative.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunt |first=Albert |title=Barrage of Negative Ads May Haunt President-Elect |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-14/barrage-of-negative-ads-may-haunt-president-elect.html|accessdate=December 9, 2012 |newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=October 14, 2012 |quote=The hundreds of thousands of television commercials broadcast by the presidential candidates are lopsidedly negative; this is the case with 80 percent of those put out by President Barack Obama and 84 percent of those for Mitt Romney.}}</ref> The tax-exempt non-profit [[Americans for Prosperity]], a so-called "outside group", that is, a political advocacy group that is not a [[political action committee]] or super-PAC, ran a television advertising campaign opposing Obama described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as "early and relentless".<ref name=wp20140105>{{cite news |title=The players in the Koch-backed $400 million political donor network |first=Matea |last=Gold |date=January 5, 2014 |accessdate=May 9, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-players-in-the-koch-backed-400-million-political-donor-network/2014/01/05/714451a8-74b5-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html |quote=Americans for Prosperity, the Virginia-based nonprofit that finances grass-roots activities across the country and ran an early and relentless television ad assault against President Obama during the 2012 campaign.}}</ref><ref name=cnbc20111108>{{cite news |title=Record Political Ad Spending Powered by Special Interests |first=Julia |last=Boorstin |date=November 8, 2011 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45212597 |accessdate=April 30, 2015 |publisher=[[CNBC]]}}</ref> Americans for Prosperity spent $8.4 million in [[swing state]]s on television advertisements denouncing the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] loan guarantee to [[Solyndra]], a manufacturer of solar panels that went bankrupt,<ref name=bloomberg1>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-10-17/solyndra-lenders-ahead-of-government-won-t-recover-fully |title=Solyndra Lenders Ahead of Government Won't Recover Fully |first=Michael |last=Bathon |date=October 17, 2012 |work=[[Bloomberg Business]] |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}</ref> an advertising campaign described by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in November 2011 as "perhaps the biggest attack on Mr. Obama so far".<ref name=bloomberg20111128>{{cite news |url=http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/11/28/377053/koch-americans-for-prosperity-solyndra-attack-ad-video/ |title=Koch-Fueled Americans for Prosperity Spends $2.4 Million on Solyndra Attack Ad |first=Stephen |last=Lacey |work=[[ThinkProgress]] |publisher=[[Center for American Progress]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=May 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505235012/http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/11/28/377053/koch-americans-for-prosperity-solyndra-attack-ad-video/ |archive-date=May 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=wsj20120114>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/01/14/americans-for-prosperity-to-air-ads-slamming-obamas-ties-to-solyndra/ |title=Americans for Prosperity to Air Ads Slamming Obama's Ties to Solyndra |first=Brody |last=Mullins |series=Washington Wire blog|date=January 14, 2012 |accessdate=April 19, 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

===Notable expressions, phrases, and statements===
* '''{{visible anchor|Severely conservative}}''' – In a speech he made at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in February 2012, Romney claimed that he had been a "severely conservative Republican governor". Romney's description of his record as "severely conservative" was widely criticized by political commentators as both rhetorically clumsy and factually inaccurate.<ref>{{cite news|author1 = David A. Fahrenthold |title =Mitt Romney reframes himself as a 'severely conservative' governor|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-reframes-himself-as-a-severely-conservative-governor/2012/02/14/gIQAaMiqHR_story.html | work=The Washington Post|date=February 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/mitt-romneys-severe-conservatism_652663.html Mitt Romney's 'Severe Conservatism'].

* '''[[You didn't build that]]''' – A portion of a statement that Obama made in a July 2012 campaign speech in [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]], [[Virginia]]. Obama said that businesses depend on government-provided infrastructure to succeed, but critics of his remarks argued that he was underplaying the work of entrepreneurs and giving the government credit for individuals' success. The Romney campaign immediately jumped on the statement in an effort to drive a wedge between Obama and small business owners/employees. A major theme of the [[2012 Republican National Convention]] was "We Built It".
* '''[[47 percent]]''' – An expression Romney used at a private campaign fundraising event, which was secretly recorded and publicly released. At the private event, Romney said that 47 percent of the people would vote for Barack Obama no matter what Romney said or did because those people "...are dependent upon government... I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." Ironically, Romney received almost exactly 47% of the vote.
* '''[[Binders full of women]]''' – A phrase that Romney used in the [[Second U.S. presidential debate of 2012|second presidential debate]] to refer to the long list of female candidates that he considered when choosing his cabinet members as Governor of Massachusetts.
* '''Horses and bayonets''' – After Romney said in the [[Third U.S. presidential debate of 2012|third presidential debate]] that the U.S. Navy was smaller than at any time since 1917, Obama replied, "We have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Katie|title=Horses and bayonets catch on during final US presidential debate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/23/horses-and-bayonets-presidential-debate|website=The Guardian|date=23 October 2012}}</ref>
* '''[[Shovel-ready]]''' jobs – a phrase used to describe some stimulus projects promoted by the administration. During the debate on September 23, 2011, Gary Johnson quipped, "My next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this president."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2011/09/gary-johnsons-moment-064232#ixzz3xptLeUGs|title=Gary Johnson's moment|website=Politico|last1=Burns|first1=Alexander|date=September 22, 2011}}</ref>
* '''{{visible anchor|Romnesia}}''' – A term coined by a blogger in April 2011 and used by Obama late in the campaign to describe Romney's alleged inability to take responsibility for his past statements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.hcfama.org/2011/04/04/romnesia/ |title=Romnesia |publisher=hcfama.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201074626/http://blog.hcfama.org/2011/04/04/romnesia/ |archive-date=December 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Kantrowitz, Alex |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkantrowitz/2012/10/21/romnesia-a-made-for-social-media-attack-line/ |title=#Romnesia: A Made for Social Media Attack Line |work=Forbes |date=October 21, 2012 |accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref>
* '''[[Public image of Mitt Romney|$10,000 bet]]''' – During a Republican debate, Romney facetiously bet Texas governor [[Rick Perry]] $10,000 that he (Perry) was wrong about Romney's position on the individual mandate under the [[Affordable Healthcare for America Act|Affordable Healthcare Act]]. The statement was vilified by Democrats as exemplary of Romney being out of touch with working-class and middle-class Americans.
* '''Romneyshambles''' – a phrase used by the British press after Romney criticized British preparations for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], which was a play on [[omnishambles]]. The phrase became a popular [[hashtag]] on [[Twitter]] and was later chosen as one of [[Collins English Dictionary]]'s words of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/lauren-collins/romneyshambles-part-ii|title=Romneyshambles, Part II|website=The New Yorker|date=September 18, 2012|last1=Collins|first1=Lauren}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/gangnam-style-romneyshambles-uk-dictionary-words-year-article-1.1224325|title='Gangnam Style,' 'fiscal cliff,' 'Romneyshambles' chosen as Collins Dictionary's words of the year|website=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=December 20, 2012}}</ref>

===Romney's concession===
[[File:Obama takes Romney concession call.jpg|thumb|upright|Obama takes a phone call from Romney conceding the election early Wednesday morning in Chicago.]]

After the networks called Ohio (the state that was arguably the most critical for Romney, as no Republican has ever won the Presidency without carrying it) for Obama at around 11:15 PM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on Election Day, Romney was ready to concede the race, but hesitated when [[Karl Rove]] strenuously objected on Fox News to the network's decision to make that call.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2012/president/2012/12/23/the-story-behind-mitt-romney-loss-the-presidential-campaign-president-obama/2QWkUB9pJgVIi1mAcIhQjL/story-5.html|title = The story behind Mitt Romney's loss in the presidential campaign to President Obama|last = Kranish|first = Michael|date = December 22, 2012|work = Boston Globe|access-date = February 1, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130528013007/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2012/president/2012/12/23/the-story-behind-mitt-romney-loss-the-presidential-campaign-president-obama/2QWkUB9pJgVIi1mAcIhQjL/story-5.html|archive-date = May 28, 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/why-rove-went-denial-election-night-226695|title=The Real Reason for Karl Rove's Election Night Denial|date=January 21, 2014}}</ref> However, after Colorado and Nevada were called for the President (giving Obama enough electoral votes to win even if Ohio were to leave his column), in tandem with Obama's apparent lead in Florida and Virginia (both were eventually called for Obama), Romney acknowledged that he had lost and conceded at around 1:00 AM [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on November 7.

Despite public polling showing Romney behind Obama in the swing states of Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New Hampshire, tied with Obama in Virginia, and just barely ahead of Obama in Florida, the Romney campaign said they were genuinely surprised by the loss, having believed that public polling was oversampling Democrats.<ref name=Adviser:>{{cite news |title=Adviser: Romney "shellshocked" by loss |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57547239/adviser-romney-shellshocked-by-loss/?pageNum=1&tag=page |accessdate=November 10, 2012 |publisher=CBS News |date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> The Romney campaign had already set up a transition website, and had scheduled and purchased a fireworks display to celebrate in case he won the election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Romney's Transition Site |url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/11/07/romneys_transition_site.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108021452/http://politicalwire.com/archives/2012/11/07/romneys_transition_site.html |archive-date=November 8, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |website=Political Wire |date=November 7, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Romney campaign spent $25,000 on fireworks">{{cite news |title=Romney campaign spent $25,000 on fireworks |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/11/09/romney-campaign-spent-fireworks/YrFOs5OEgE98XvjBJ9nItJ/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111171311/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/11/09/romney-campaign-spent-fireworks/YrFOs5OEgE98XvjBJ9nItJ/story.html |archive-date=November 11, 2012 |accessdate=November 11, 2012 |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=November 9, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Reactions===
{{further|International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election}}
Foreign leaders reacted with both positive and mixed messages. Most world leaders congratulated and praised Barack Obama on his re-election victory. However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions. Pakistan commented that Romney's defeat had made [[Pakistan-United States relations]] safer. Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], [[NASDAQ]], and the [[S&P 500]] each declining over two percent the day after the election.<ref name=WSJ-DOW>{{cite news |last=Cheng |first=Jonathan |title=Dow's 300-Point Slide Takes It Back to August Levels |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323894704578104153584769278?mod=wsj_streaming_markets |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

=== Hispanic vote ===
The United States has a population of 50 million [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]], 27 million of whom are citizens eligible to vote (13% of total eligible voters). Traditionally, only half of eligible Hispanic voters vote (around 7% of voters); of them, 71% voted for Barack Obama (increasing his [[percentage]] of the vote by 5%); therefore, the Hispanic vote was an important factor in Obama's re-election, since the vote difference between the two main parties was only 3.9%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/01/19/looking-forward-to-2016-the-changing-latino-electorate/|title=1.

Romney's loss prompted the [[Republican National Committee]] to try to appeal to the American Latino population by concentrating on different approaches to immigration.

However, Obama also became the first president in American history to be reelected to a second term by smaller margins in every way possible: Compared to his victory in 2008, he won fewer states (28 to 26), fewer electoral votes (365 to 332), fewer popular votes (69.5 million to 65.9 million), a smaller percentage of the popular vote (52.9% to 51.1%), and fewer congressional districts (242 to 209).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifenews.com/2012/12/06/numbers-show-obamas-narrow-re-election-was-no-popular-mandate/|title=Numbers Show Obama's Narrow Re-Election Was No Popular Mandate|work=LifeNews.com|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}</ref>

The 2012 election marked the first time since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] in which no state was won by a candidate with a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the state's popular vote. All states were won with over 50% of the vote.

So far, this is the only presidential election in history where both the Republican and Democratic vice presidential candidates are practicing Roman Catholics. It is also the only presidential election where there are no white Protestants on either major party ticket.
