'''The Rolling Stones''' are<!--This article is written in British English. Do not change to is!--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1962. As a diverging act to the popular [[pop rock]] of the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define [[hard rock]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Rolling Stones {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-rolling-stones-mn0000894465/biography|access-date=22 July 2020|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The band's first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano), the last of whom was removed from the official line-up in 1963, but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, the [[Jagger–Richards|partnership of Jagger and Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]], who in turn left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]], who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since Stewart's departure in 1963, but have employed several additional musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965–71), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967–82), [[Billy Preston]] (1971–81), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978–81), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982–present).

Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and established themselves at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964, also being identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. The band found more success with their own material; songs such as "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" and "[[Paint It Black]]" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) – their first entirely original album – has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the Stones returned to their 'bluesy' roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971) and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972). In 1969 they were first introduced on stage as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|'The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World']].

The band continued to release commercially successful albums through the 1970s and early 1980s, including ''[[Some Girls]]'' (1978) and ''[[Tattoo You]]'' (1981), the two best-sellers in their discography. During the 1980s, infighting curtailed their output, and they kept a low profile for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994–95), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997–98), [[Licks Tour]] (2002–03) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005–07).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} In 2012, the band celebrated their 50th anniversary. Their latest album, ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'' (2016), became their [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|twelfth UK number-one album]]. The group continues to sell out venues, with their recent [[No Filter Tour]] running for two years and concluding in August 2019.

The Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 240&nbsp;million makes them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. The band have been awarded three [[Grammy Award]]s and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the Stones were listed 10th on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] All-Time Top Artists chart, and in 2019 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine ranked them second in their list of the "Greatest Artists of All Time" based on US chart success.<ref>{{cite news |title=Beatles, Rolling Stones top Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists list |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6269028/beatles-rolling-stones-top-billboards-greatest-of-all-time-artists-list/ |accessdate=21 June 2020 |agency=Global News}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]] became childhood friends and classmates in 1950 in [[Dartford]], [[Kent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/mick-jagger/|title=Mick Jagger {{!}} The Rolling Stones |website=rollingstones.com|access-date=2 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903121800/http://www.rollingstones.com/artist/mick-jagger/|archive-date=3 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>White, Charles.

A musical partnership began shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Greenfield|1981}} Richards and Taylor often met Jagger at his house. The meetings moved to Taylor's house in late 1961 where Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith joined the trio; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|pp=10–11}}

In March 1962, the Blues Boys read about the [[Ealing Jazz Club]] in ''Jazz News'' newspaper, which mentioned [[Alexis Korner]]'s [[rhythm and blues]] band, [[Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated]]. The group sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was favourably impressed.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}} On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included [[slide guitar]]ist [[Brian Jones]], keyboardist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}} After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}}

Jones, no longer in a band, advertised for bandmates in ''Jazz Weekly'', while Stewart found them a practice space;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-jones-leaves-rolling-stones-19690712|title=Brian Jones Leaves Rolling Stones|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref> together they decided to form a band playing [[Chicago blues]]. Soon after, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart. The first rehearsal included guitarist [[Geoff Bradford (musician)|Geoff Bradford]] and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band. They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=40}} In June 1962 the addition of the drummer [[Tony Chapman]] completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart and Taylor. According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to ''Jazz News''. When asked by a journalist for the band's name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters [[LP record|LP]] lying on the floor; one of the tracks was "[[Rollin' Stone]]".{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=42}}{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=13}}

In May 1963, the Rolling Stones signed [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] as their manager.<ref name=andrew-loog-oldham>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/andrew-loog-oldham |title=Andrew Loog Oldham|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref> His previous clients, [[the Beatles]], directed the former publicist to the band.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=20}}<ref name=":192"/> Because Oldham was only nineteen and had not reached the [[age of majority]]—he was also younger than anyone in the band—he could not obtain an agent's licence or sign any contracts without his mother co-signing.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=20}} By necessity he joined with booking agent [[Eric Easton]]{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=123}} to secure record financing and assistance booking venues.<ref name=andrew-loog-oldham/> Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted.{{sfn|Wyman|1990|pp=135–136}} Initially, Oldham tried applying the strategy used by [[Brian Epstein]], the Beatles' manager, and have the band members wear suits. He later changed his mind and imagined a band which contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance. He wanted to make the Stones "a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables" and to "establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic".{{sfn|Szatmary|2014|p=123}} Stewart left the official line-up, but remained road manager and touring keyboardist. Of Stewart's decision, Oldham later said, "Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for [fans] to remember the faces in the picture."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/keith-richards-the-rolling-stone-interview-19710819|title=Keith Richard: The Rolling Stone Interview|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=14 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418035746/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/keith-richards-the-rolling-stone-interview-19710819|archivedate=18 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Later, Oldham reduced the band members' ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=79}}

[[Decca Records]], which had declined to sign a deal with the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with favourable terms.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=22}} The band got three times a new act's typical royalty rate, full artistic control of recordings and ownership of the [[Audio mastering|recording master tapes]].{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=205, 212}}{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=68}} The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios. Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became their preferred location.{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=209–210, 212}}{{sfn|Coral|Hinckley|Rodman|1995}} Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band's producer, said Regent had a sound that "leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way" creating a "wall of noise" that worked well for the band.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=68}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=252–253}} Because of Regent's low booking rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks common at other studios. All tracks on the first Rolling Stones album, ''The Rolling Stones'', were recorded there.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=26}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=213}}

Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' independence with the Beatles' obligation to record in [[EMI]]'s studios, saying it made them appear as "mere mortals&nbsp;... sweating in the studio for the man".{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=205}} He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoint to the Beatles by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of their first album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as: "Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?"{{sfn|Marshall|2012|p=22}}{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=136}} By contrast, Wyman says, "Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally.&nbsp;... [Oldham] never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively."{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=133}} In a 1972 interview, Wyman stated, "We were the first pop group to break away from the whole [[Cliff Richard]] thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter."<ref>{{cite news|title=Living with Superstardom: The Stones Bill Wyman says 'It Keeps Getting Harder'|date=6 November 1971|newspaper=Billboard |page=29}}</ref>

A cover version of Chuck Berry's "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]" was the Rolling Stones' first [[Single (music)|single]], released on 7 June 1963. The band refused to play it at live gigs,{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=139}} and Decca bought only one ad to promote the record. With Oldham's direction, fan-club members bought copies at record shops polled by the charts,{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=221}} helping "Come On" rise to No.&nbsp;21 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/day-in-music-1025.aspx|title=This Day in Music Spotlight: Rolling Stones Riot on Ed Sullivan|work=gibson.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130131204013/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/day-in-music-1025.aspx|archivedate=31 January 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref> Having a charting single gave the band entree to play outside London, starting with a booking at the Outlook Club in [[Middlesbrough]] on 13 July, sharing the billing with [[the Hollies]].{{sfn|Haslam|2015|p=91}}{{efn|Wyman's book ''Rolling With The Stones'' incorrectly states the band played the Alcove club that night.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=65}}}} Later in 1963 Oldham and Easton arranged the band's first big UK concert tour as a supporting act for American stars including Bo Diddley, [[Little Richard]] and [[the Everly Brothers]].

Oldham saw little future for an act that lost significant songwriting royalties by playing songs of what he described as "middle-aged blacks", limiting the appeal to teenage audiences. Jagger and Richards decided to write songs together. Oldham described the first batch as "soppy and imitative".{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=256–257}} Because the band's songwriting developed slowly, songs on their first album ''[[The Rolling Stones (album)|The Rolling Stones]]'' (1964; issued in the US as ''England's Newest Hit Makers''), were primarily covers, with only one [[Jagger/Richards]] original—"[[Tell Me (You're Coming Back)]]"—and two numbers credited to [[Nanker Phelge]], the pen name used for songs written by the entire group.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=84}} The Rolling Stones' first US tour in June 1964 was "a disaster" according to Wyman.

The Stones followed [[the Famous Flames]], featuring [[James Brown]], in the theatrical release of the 1964 film ''[[T.A.M.I. Show]]'', which showcased American acts with [[British Invasion]] artists.

During [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July 1966]], the Stones' high-energy concerts proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police tasked with controlling the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety "among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people". In an effort to capitalise on this, London released the live album ''[[Got Live If You Want It!

At the end of the decade the band appeared on the [[BBC]]'s review of the sixties music scene ''[[Pop Go the Sixties]]'', performing "Gimme Shelter", which was broadcast live on 31 December 1969. The following year, the band wanted out of contracts with both Klein and Decca, but still owed them a Jagger/Richards credited single. To get back at the label and fulfil their final contractual obligation, the band came up with the track "[[Schoolboy Blues]]"—deliberately making it as crude as they could in hopes of forcing Decca to keep it "in the vaults".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/rolling-stones-sucker-blues/ |title=That Time the Rolling Stones Dared Their Label to Release 'C—sucker Blues'|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=15 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170810031929/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/rolling-stones-sucker-blues/ |archivedate=10 August 2017}}</ref>

Following the release of ''Sticky Fingers'', the Rolling Stones left England after receiving advice from their financial manager [[Prince Rupert Loewenstein]].

Another legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France, interrupted the making of ''Goats Head Soup''. Authorities had issued a warrant for Richards' arrest and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=408}} This, along with Jagger's 1967 and 1970 convictions on drug charges, complicated the band's plans for their [[The Rolling Stones Pacific Tour 1973|Pacific tour]] in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia. A [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1973|European tour]] followed in September and October 1973, which bypassed France, coming after Richards' arrest in England on drug charges.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=361, 412}}

The Stones needed a new guitarist, and the recording sessions for the next album, ''[[Black and Blue]]'' (1976) (No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, No.&nbsp;1 in the US) in Munich provided an opportunity for some guitarists hoping to join the band to work while trying out. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as [[Peter Frampton]] and [[Jeff Beck]] were auditioned as well as [[Robert A. Johnson (musician)|Robert A. Johnson]] and [[Shuggie Otis]]. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]] later claimed they had played without realising they were being auditioned. American session players [[Wayne Perkins]] and [[Harvey Mandel]] also tried out, but Richards and Jagger preferred for the band to remain purely British. When [[Ronnie Wood]] auditioned, everyone agreed he was the right choice.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=174}} He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track "It's Only Rock 'n Roll". He had declined Jagger's earlier offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to [[the Faces]], saying "that's what's really important to me".{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=239}} Faces' lead singer [[Rod Stewart]] went so far as to say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=239}}

Wood officially joined the Rolling Stones in 1975 for their upcoming Tour of the Americas, which was a contributing factor in the disbandment of [[Faces (band)|the Faces]]. Unlike the other band members, however, Wood was a salaried employee, which remained the case until the early 1990s, when he finally joined the Stones' business partnership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/23/ronnie-wood-interview-simon-hattenstone|title=Ronnie Wood: Second Life|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080634/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/23/ronnie-wood-interview-simon-hattenstone|archivedate=29 November 2014|date=22 April 2011|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon}}</ref>

Richards' addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in Toronto; the other members had already arrived. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by [[Canada Customs]] after Richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], armed with an arrest warrant for Anita Pallenberg, discovered {{convert|22|g|oz}} of heroin in Richards' room.{{sfn|Greenspan|1980|p=518}} He was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|p=225}}

The Crown prosecutor later conceded that Richards had procured the drugs after his arrival.{{sfn|Greenspan|1980|pp=517–527}} Despite the incident, the band played two shows in Toronto, only to cause more controversy when [[Margaret Trudeau]], then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], was seen partying with the band after one show. The band's shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the [[El Mocambo]] had been booked for the entire week by [[April Wine]] for a recording session. [[CHUM (AM)|1050 CHUM]], a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|p=227}}

On 4 March, Richards' partner [[Anita Pallenberg]] pleaded guilty to drug possession and incurred a fine in connection with the original airport incident.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|p=227}} The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, he received a [[suspended sentence]] and was ordered to play two free concerts for the [[CNIB]] in [[Oshawa]];{{sfn|Greenspan|1980|pp=517–527}} both shows featured the Rolling Stones and [[The New Barbarians (band)|the New Barbarians]], a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin.<ref name=stonemag /> It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction as Richards struggled to get clean.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|pp=232–233; 248–250}} While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was a regular at New York's [[Studio 54]] disco club, often in the company of model [[Jerry Hall]]. His marriage to [[Bianca Jagger]] ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400291/Seventies-and-Eighties.html |title=Seventies and Eighties |newspaper=The Telegraph |location= London |date=1 August 2003 |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016071230/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400291/Seventies-and-Eighties.html |archivedate=16 October 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The band were joined by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]], who continues to perform and record with them.<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web|publisher=Music Legends|url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-leavell-interview-rolling-stones/|title=Chuck Leavell Interview|accessdate=6 May 2013|date=8 April 2010|last=Saulnier|first=Jason|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216075205/http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-leavell-interview-rolling-stones/|archivedate=16 December 2013}}</ref> By the end of the year, the Stones signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], for a reported $50&nbsp;million, then the biggest record deal in history.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=96}}

=== 1983–1988: Band turmoil and solo projects ===
Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released ''[[Undercover (The Rolling Stones album)|Undercover]]'' in late 1983. It reached No.&nbsp;3 in the UK and No.&nbsp;4 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/undercover/ |title=Undercover |website=rollingstones.com |access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref> Despite good reviews and the Top Ten peak position of the title track, the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] took over distributing their Atlantic catalogue.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=96}}

[[File:Richards, Wood onstage in Turin, 1982.jpg|thumb|left|Richards and Wood during a Stones concert in [[Turin]], Italy in 1982]]
By this time, the Jagger/Richards rift had grown significantly. To Richards' annoyance, Jagger signed a solo deal with CBS Records and spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first album. He also declared his growing lack of interest in the Rolling Stones.{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|pp=470–472}} By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings. Much of the material on 1986's ''[[Dirty Work (The Rolling Stones album)|Dirty Work]]''  was generated by Richards, with more contributions from Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. It was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward.{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|p=461}}

In June 1985, Jagger teamed up with [[David Bowie]] for "[[Dancing in the Street#Bowie/Jagger version|Dancing in the Street]]", which was recorded for the [[Live Aid]] charity movement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iQEAAAAMBAJ&q=dancing+in+the+street+-+JAGGER+BOWIE+live+aid&pg=PA1|title=Bowie/Jagger Vidclip Heads for Movie Screens|newspaper=Billboard|page=1|date=24 August 1985|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818104921/https://books.google.com/books?id=2iQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=dancing%20in%20the%20street%20-%20JAGGER%20BOWIE%20live%20aid&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vnNdT8mwCIPZ8AOu6dmEDw&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=dancing%20in%20the%20street%20-%20JAGGER%20BOWIE%20live%20aid&f=false|archivedate=18 August 2017}}</ref> This was one of Jagger's first solo performances, and the song reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK, and No.&nbsp;7 in the US.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17011078|title=Sir Mick Jagger returns to UK singles chart|work=BBC |accessdate=12 March 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223104718/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17011078|archivedate=23 February 2012|date=13 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7881063/the-rolling-stones-mick-jagger-biggest-billboard-hot-100-hits|title=Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones' Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits|work=Billboard|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610124107/http://www.rollingstones.com/book/|archivedate=10 June 2017}}</ref> In December 1985, Stewart died of a heart attack.

===1989–1999: Comeback and record-breaking tours===
In early 1989, the Stones, including Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood as well as Brian Jones and Ian Stewart (posthumously), were inducted into the American [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="rockhall3"/> Jagger and Richards set aside their animosity and went to work on a new Rolling Stones album, ''[[Steel Wheels]]''. Heralded as a return to form, it included the singles "[[Mixed Emotions (The Rolling Stones song)|Mixed Emotions]]" (US No.&nbsp;5), "[[Rock and a Hard Place (song)|Rock and a Hard Place]]" (US No.&nbsp;23) and "[[Almost Hear You Sigh]]". The album also included "Continental Drift", which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco in 1989 with [[the Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]], coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting. [[Nigel Finch]] produced a BBC documentary film ''The Rolling Stones in Morocco''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00jsgbs|title=The Rolling Stones- Continental Drift|work=BBC Four|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024728/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00jsgbs|archivedate=4 September 2015}}</ref> The album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK and No.&nbsp;3 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/steel-wheels/ |title=Steel Wheels |website=rollingstones.com |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref>

The [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]] was the band's first world tour in seven years and their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included [[Living Colour]] and [[Guns N' Roses]]. Recordings from the tour include the 1991 concert album ''[[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]]'', which reached No.&nbsp;6 in the UK and No.&nbsp;16 in the US,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/flashpoint/ |title=Flashpoint |website=rollingstones.com |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> and the concert film ''[[Stones at the Max|Live at the Max]]'' released in 1991.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-1991-concert-film-live-at-the-max-headed-to-dvd-20091109#ixzz3JlfeBGPi|title=Rolling Stones' 1991 Concert Film "Live at the Max" Headed to DVD|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224234348/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-1991-concert-film-live-at-the-max-headed-to-dvd-20091109#ixzz3JlfeBGPi|archivedate=24 December 2014|date=9 November 2009}}</ref> The tour was Bill Wyman's last.

After the successes of the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, the band took a break. Watts released two jazz albums; Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called ''[[Slide On This]]''; Wyman released his fourth solo album; Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, ''[[Main Offender]]'' and did a small tour including big concerts in Spain and Argentina.{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=394}}{{sfn|Neill|2015|p=137}} Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'' which reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14177/mick-jagger/ |title=Mick Jagger |website=officialcharts.com |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> and No.&nbsp;11 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/mick-jagger/chart-history/top-album-sales/song/177750 |title=Wandering Spirit |website=billboard.com |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> The album sold more than two million copies worldwide, being certified Gold in the US.<ref name="RIAA"/>

After Wyman's departure, the Rolling Stones' new distributor/record label, [[Virgin Records]], remastered and repackaged the band's back catalogue from ''Sticky Fingers'' to ''Steel Wheels'', except for the three live albums. They issued another hits compilation in 1993 entitled ''[[Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones|Jump Back]]'', which reached No.&nbsp;16 in the UK and No.&nbsp;30 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/jump-back-the-best-of-71-93/ |title=Jump Back |website=rollingstones.com |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> By 1993, the Stones were ready to start recording another studio album. Charlie Watts recruited bassist [[Darryl Jones]], a former [[sideman]] of [[Miles Davis]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], as Wyman's replacement for 1994's ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]''. Jones continues to perform with the band as their touring and session bassist. The album met with strong reviews and sales, going double platinum in the US.

The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and [[world music]], exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]], as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments like harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the [[sitar]] and [[slide guitar]] in their early days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725181034/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Multi-Instrumentalist Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710161316/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|archivedate=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gn24CgAAQBAJ&q=Brian+Jones+non-traditional+instruments+such+as+the+sitar+and+slide+guitar+in+their+early+days&pg=PA23|title=Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001–2014|last=Hell|first=Richard|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=9781619026742|pages=23}}</ref> The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording [[cover song]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|title=Time Is on My Side – The Rolling Stones : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024728/http://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|archivedate=4 September 2015}}</ref>

Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic [[Richie Unterberger]] described the first Jagger/Richards single, "[[Tell Me (You're Coming Back)]]", as a "[[pop rock]] ballad&nbsp;... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, [[Beat music|Mersey]]-type pop numbers".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/tell-me-mt0011910726 |title=Tell Me – song review |last=Unterberger |first=Richie|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|work=AllMusic|accessdate=14 July 2013|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130722004917/http://www.allmusic.com/song/tell-me-mt0011910726 |archivedate=22 July 2013}}</ref> "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists.

Of their early writing experience, Richards said,

<blockquote>The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try&nbsp;...'{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=85}}</blockquote>

Jagger said,

<blockquote>We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order&nbsp; ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=85}}</blockquote>

The writing of "[[The Last Time (The Rolling Stones song)|The Last Time]]", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it "a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it."{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=95}} The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by [[the Staple Singers]], but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones.<ref name=":02">{{cite book|last=van der Luft|first=Eric|year=2009|title=Die at the Right Time!: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties|page=102}}</ref> Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym [[Nanker Phelge]]. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.{{sfn|Nathan|Lindsay|2001|p=217}}

Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the "ancient art of weaving" responsible for part of their sound – the interplay between two guitarists on stage.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|pp=[https://archive.org/details/accordingtorolli00jagg/page/160 160–161]}} Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's (Watts).{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|p=241}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/11/taylor-swift-the-new-mick-jagger|title=Taylor Swift is Officially the New Mick Jagger (and Here's Why)|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=6 November 2019}}</ref>  Likewise, Watts is primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1"/> The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rolling Stones: Sociological Perspectives |last=Staubmann |first=Helmut|page=35|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-739-17672-6}}</ref> In the studio, the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on ''Beggars Banquet'' are driven by [[Nicky Hopkins]]' piano playing. On ''Exile on Main St.'', Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=159,185}}

Richards started using [[open tuning]]s for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a [[capo]]), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", "[[Brown Sugar (The Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]" (''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', 1971), "[[Tumbling Dice]]" (capo IV), "[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]" (capo IV) (''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', 1972), and "[[Start Me Up]]" (''[[Tattoo You]]'', 1981).<ref>{{cite book|last=Chris|first=Gill|year=1995|title=Guitar legends: the definitive guide to the world's greatest guitar players|page=108|publisher=HarperPerennial}}</ref>

The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict,{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|p=236}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/13/rolling-stones-some-girls-interview |title=The Rolling Stones: that 50-year itch…|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|date=12 November 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=17 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170817122425/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/13/rolling-stones-some-girls-interview|archivedate=17 August 2017}}</ref> resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years.<ref name="Jagger Remembers"/> When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like his authority diminished.

On Jagger's 75th birthday, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band. Two species, ''Petroperla mickjaggeri'' and ''Lapisperla keithrichardsi'', were placed within a new family Petroperlidae. The new family was named in honour of the Rolling Stones, derived from the Greek "petra" that stands for "stone". The scientists referred to the fossils as "Rolling Stoneflies".<ref>{{cite journal|title='Rolling' stoneflies (Insecta: Plecoptera) from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber|first1=Pavel|last1=Sroka|first2=Arnold H.|last2=Staniczek|first3=Boris C.|last3=Kondratieff|date=26 July 2018|journal=PeerJ|volume=6|pages=e5354|doi=10.7717/peerj.5354|pmid = 30065894|pmc = 6064637}}</ref> This theme was continued when [[NASA]] named a rock disturbed by the thrusters of the Mars InSight Lander "Rolling Stones Rock", as announced by [[Robert Downey Jr.]] during the band's 22 August 2019 performance in [[Pasadena, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/nasa-rolling-stones-mars-rock-875612/|title=NASA Names Rolling Stone on Mars After Rolling Stones|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=23 August 2019|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref>

The Stones' early setups were simple compared to what they became later in the band's career when elaborate stage designs, pyrotechnics and giant screens were used.

During the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows became an industry for the band, and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher.{{sfn|Davis|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5-Nx8AUNAHIC&pg=PT379]}} The props the band used on stage increased in both size and sophistication, similar to those on Broadway.<ref name=":14" /> They started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show. On this tour they had two versions of what Jagger referred to as the "lotus stage". One version had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain, and the other had leaves that began in a folded up position and opened during the beginning of the concert.<ref name=":14" /> This period also included a variety of props, including inflatable penises and other gimmicks,<ref name=":14" /> and incorporated a number of circus tricks.<ref name=":14" />

During the 1981–1982 American tour, the Stones worked with Japanese designer Kazuhide Yamazari in constructing their stages for stadium-sized locations and audiences.<ref name="sloppy_start">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-stones-sloppy-start-19811112|title=The Stones' Sloppy Start|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=1 June 2018}}</ref> During this period, stages increased in size to include runways and movable sections of the stage going out into the audience.<ref name=":15" /><ref name="sloppy_start" /> This tour used coloured panels and was one of the last Stones tours to do so before switching to devices such as video screens.<ref name=":15" /> Stadium shows provided a new challenge for the band. The venues were large enough in size that the band became "like ants" to audience members.<ref name=":15" /> This resulted in Jagger having to project himself "over the footlights" and the band needing to use more gimmicks, such as pyrotechnics, lights and video screens.<ref name=":15" />

{{quote|text=When you're out there in this vast stadium, you have to physically tiny up on stage, so that's why on the 1981-2 tour we had those coloured panels and later we started using devices like video screens.

And when the show gets that big, you need a little extra help, you need a couple of gimmicks, as we call it, in the show. You need fireworks, you need lights, you need a bit of theatre.|source=Charlie Watts, ''According to the Rolling Stones''<ref name=":15" />}}

As time went on, their props and stage equipment became increasingly sophisticated. When the Stones began to fill stadium-sized venues, or larger, they ran into the problem of the audience no longer being able to see them.
