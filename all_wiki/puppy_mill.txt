[[File:Puppy mill02.jpg|thumb|right|373x373px|A puppy mill in the rural [[United States]]]]A '''puppy mill''', also known as a '''puppy farm''', is a commercial [[dog breeding]] facility characterized by quick breeding and poor conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/puppy+mill|title=Definition of PUPPY MILL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> Although no standardized legal definition for "puppy mill" exists, a definition was established in ''Avenson v.

There are an estimated 10,000 licensed and unlicensed puppy mills in the United States, in total selling more than 2,000,000 puppies annually.<ref name="hsus_pm_faq">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/pets/puppy_mills/puppy_mills_facts_figures_2012.pdf |title=FAQs |author=Humane Society of the United States |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309004955/http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/pets/puppy_mills/puppy_mills_facts_figures_2012.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Australia, around 450,000 puppies are sold each year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/puppy-factory-problem.php|title=How big is the puppy factory problem?|website=www.animalsaustralia.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> and in United Kingdom up to 400,000 are sold each year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://naturewatch.org/campaign/puppy-farming-in-the-uk|title=Puppy Farming in the UK - Naturewatch|website=naturewatch.org|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>

The term "mill" is also applied to operations involving other animals commercially bred for profit, including cats.<ref name="aspca_glossary">{{cite web |url = https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills|title = ASPCA: Fight Animal Cruelty: Puppy Mills|author = ASPCA|year = 2007|accessdate = 2016-02-18}}</ref> For-profit breeding on a smaller scale may be referred to as [[backyard breeding]], although this term has negative connotations and may also refer to unplanned or non-commercial breeding.

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] oversees regulations pertaining to the commercial dog industry. The regulations are similar to those in the livestock industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aspca.org/news/usda-enforcement-animal-welfare-act-hits-new-low|title=USDA Enforcement of Animal Welfare Act Hits a New Low|website=ASPCA|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>

== Differences in breeding conditions ==

[[The Kennel Club]] and the [[American Kennel Club]] both state that responsible breeders should raise their animals with the intent to produce healthy dogs and to ensure that all animals are provided responsible homes and [[socialization]]. However, there is no way to enforce these wishes or records being kept to prove this is the case.<ref name="akc_breed_to_improve">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeders/resources/guide_to_breeding_your_dog/step_2.cfm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-13 |title=Step Two - Breed to Improve |author=American Kennel Club}}</ref><ref name="wkc">{{cite web |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/2008/show/news/breeders.html |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-13 |title=Buy Dogs from a Breeder |author=Westminster Kennel Club |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122023455/http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/2008/show/news/breeders.html |archive-date=2008-01-22 }}</ref> The socialization period in a puppy occurs between the ages of 4 weeks and up to 14 weeks of age.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Draper|first1=Donald|title=Improper Puppy Socialization and Subsequent Behavior|journal=Iowa State University Veterinarian|date=1976|volume=38|issue=2|pages=Article 1}}</ref> This period is crucial for adult development as almost all adult abilities are learned during this stage. With puppy mills essentially skipping the process of socialization, the result is often social problems when the puppy matures to adulthood.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Females in puppy mills are sometimes bred every time they are [[estrous cycle|in heat]], regardless of whether they have physically recovered from the last litter. Once a breeding female can no longer be bred, whether from pure exhaustion or from age, the female is usually killed.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills-old|title=Puppy Mills|work=ASPCA|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}</ref> Puppies are also often [[weaning|wean]]ed from their mothers well before the recommended 8–⁠10 weeks of age.<ref name="aspca_responsible_breeding">{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cruelty_puppymills_statement |title=Puppy Mills: Responsible Breeding |author=ASPCA |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref>

== Common problems ==

The ASPCA states that some puppy mills can have up to 1,000 dogs under one roof. Because of the high volume of animals, the mill runner will often resort to housing them in wire cages. This results in the animals having poor locomotion.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal|date=2010|title=United States: A dog's life; "Puppy mills"|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17468228|journal=The Economist|volume=397|issue=8708|pages=36–39|last1=Anonymous|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}</ref>
Keeping dogs in wire kennels can lead to injury and damage to the dogs' paws and legs. It's also fairly common for these kennels to be stacked on top of each other in columns.<ref name=":0" /> The conditions in these mills are so unsanitary that the animals are often coated in their own urine and feces, causing mats in their fur.  Due to unsanitary conditions, puppies from mills will often have internal parasites, affecting their health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gadahi|first=J.A.|year=2008|title=Prevalence of Blood parasites in stray and pet Dogs in Hyderabad Area : Comparative sensitivity of different Diagnostic techniques for the detection of microfilaria|url=http://veterinaryworld.org/2008/August/Prevalence%20of%20Blood%20parasites%20in%20stray%20and%20pet%20Dogs%20in%20Hyder.pdf|journal=Veterinary World|volume=8|pages=229–232}}</ref> Puppy mills are often unheated and this increases the number of deaths due to cold among the dogs used for breeding.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Conversely, the mills can also be too hot in warmer weather leading to [[hyperthermia]].<ref name="Merck 207–232">{{Cite book|title=Veterinary Forensics: Animal Cruelty Investigations|last=Merck|first=Melinda D.|last2=Miller|first2=Doris M.|last3=Reisman|first3=Robert W.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118704738|editor-last=DVM|editor-first=Melinda D.

Other common conditions in mills include malnutrition and untreated injuries.<ref name="Merck 207–232"/>

Due to the frequently poor breeding conditions in puppy mills,<ref name="charitypaws">{{cite web |url=https://charitypaws.com/puppy-mills/ |title=The Real Cost of Buying a Puppy |author=CharityPaws |accessdate=2017-10-13|date=2017-10-03 }}</ref> puppies bred there often suffer from health and/or social problems. Puppies raised in a cramped environment shared by many other dogs become poorly socialized to other dogs and to humans. Dogs are then transported over long distances in poor conditions, sometimes resulting in animal stress and death. As the surviving mill dogs grow older, they are more prone to developing respiratory ailments and [[pneumonia]], as well as hereditary defects such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].<ref name="aspca_puppy_mills">{{cite web|author=Swartz, Tracy|date=2007-11-19|title=Buy or adopt?

Puppies from mills are usually sold as purebred dogs in an attempt to attract the higher prices associated with purebreds. However, due to the indiscriminate breeding practices of puppy mills, the dog may not actually be a purebred puppy.<ref name="kennel_club_uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/208 |title=Where NOT to buy a puppy or a dog |author=The Kennel Club (UK) |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref> A high population of puppies from mills are inbred due to uncontrolled breeding.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mixon|first1=Craig|title=Puppy Mills|url=http://newanimalcontrol.org/pupmill.shtml|website=New Animal Control|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}</ref> The vast majority of puppy mill animals are sold to pet stores by "dealers" or "brokers". Some puppies are sold by dealers masquerading as authentic breeders.

Puppy mills in the US often start with hundreds of female dogs which serve their entire lives in the establishment. The females are bred until they can no longer conceive puppies, and are often euthanized after that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/fight-cruelty/puppy-mills/puppy-mill-faq|title=A Closer Look at Puppy Mills|work=ASPCA|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref> The estimated number of puppies per breeding female per year is 9.4.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Media|first=Sentient|date=2018-11-23|title=Puppy Mills: Millions of Dogs Suffer Needlessly to Create Pets|url=https://sentientmedia.org/puppy-mills/|access-date=2020-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In most puppy mills, the dogs live in cages that are only {{convert|6|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=off}} larger than the dog on all sides, which is the minimum legal size allowed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Is a Puppy Mill?|url=https://resources.bestfriends.org/article/what-puppy-mill|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Best Friends Animal Society|language=en}}</ref> Two millions puppies are bred each year in the mills and almost 1.2 million dogs are euthanized in shelters every year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepuppymillproject.org/about-puppy-mills/|title=The Puppy Mill Project – About Puppy Mills|website=www.thepuppymillproject.org|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> The conditions in puppy mills are considered inhumane because all of the dogs are in a small, dirty area which is confined with disease and bacteria. Because of the poor living conditions, dogs are often sick and malnourished. Food is often found crawling with bugs and feces is almost everywhere. Health issues that are prevalent in puppy mills consist of giardia, mange, heartworm, respiratory infections, and much more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animal-issues/pet-trade/puppy-mills/|title=Puppy Mills|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
According to Chanis Major V. publications, puppy mills originated in the post-[[World War II]] era. Midwestern farmers looking for an alternative crop reacted to a growing demand for puppies, resulting in the development of the first commercial puppy business. As the industry grew, both small and large retail outlets began to sell puppies through pet departments. At around the same time, the first pet store chains were born.<ref name="canis_major_dilemma" />

Puppy mill dogs are usually housed in a small, wire cages similar to rabbit hutches and chicken coops.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills-old | title =A Closer Look at Puppy Mills | publisher = [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]}}</ref> In addition, veterinary care for these puppies was often overlooked because of an inability to pay. As a result, organizations such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]] began to investigate breeding kennels, leading to the passage of the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] of August 24, 1966.<ref name="canis_major_dilemma" /><ref name="usda">{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |title=Animal Welfare Act |author=United States Department of Agriculture |date=2003-08-21 |accessdate=2007-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416104435/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |archive-date=2009-04-16 }}</ref>

== Prevalence in the United States==

According to the Humane Society of the United States, out of around 10,000 puppy mills in the United States, only about 3,000 of them are closely monitored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This means that not every puppy mill owner is following the law. Also, puppy mills do not only affect the dogs that live and come from them. They also affect dogs living in shelters. Because so many people are buying animals from pet stores and breeders, three to four million dogs are euthanized in shelters every year.

A high concentration of both puppy mills and breeders has been reported in the states of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Arkansas]], [[Kansas]], and [[Missouri]].<ref name="time">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137662,00.html |title=Curbing the Puppy Trade: Dog lovers are divided over new efforts to ensure that all breeders treat their pooches humanely |accessdate=2012-10-07 |date=2005-12-04 |author=Hamilton, Anita |publisher=Time}}</ref>

The term "puppy mill" has been widely used by [[list of animal rights groups|animal rights group]]s in protests against breeders who have substandard breeding conditions. Critics in the breeder community claim that emotional rhetoric, sensationalism and pictures of dirty kennels are used to justify additional legislation or additional restrictive licensing that travels well beyond the initial goal of removing dogs from truly deplorable conditions,<ref name="canis_major_dilemma">{{cite web |url=http://www.canismajor.com/dog/puppymil.html |title=Just what is a puppy mill? |accessdate=2007-12-14 |year=2007 |author=Canis Major Publications}}</ref> or that attempts to legislate puppy mills would put them out of business. They argue the laws requiring additional costs in updating and maintaining their facility and licensing would be detrimental to the dogs in their care. They cite existing [[lemon law]]s for puppies as sufficient protection for both dogs and prospective buyers.<ref name="time" />

== Media coverage ==

On May 1, 2008, [[MSNBC]] aired a report about puppy mills, in which talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]] revealed an industry fraught with problems and apparent cruelty. The broadcast showed puppy mills with small cages, with [[chicken wire]] floors, stacked in rows from floor to ceiling, and stated that many dogs spend their entire lives within these tiny cages. Many of these dogs are sold on the [[internet]] or by [[pet store|pet retailers]] to buyers who are unaware of the dogs' background. The report claimed that customers who object to this treatment of puppies are more likely to try to "save" the puppies by purchasing them directly from the puppy mill, unknowingly allow the industry to thrive. It also pointed out that many of the puppy mill bred dogs suffer long-term health problems.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/investigating-puppy-mills/all|title=Investigating Puppy Mills|work=Oprah.com|access-date=2019-05-08|language=en-us}}</ref>

== Legislative response ==

=== United States ===
{{over-coverage|section|region=the state of Missouri|date=January 2014}}
In the [[United States]], some elements of the dog breeding industry are regulated by the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] of August 24,&nbsp;1966.<ref name="awa">{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |date=2003-08-21 |accessdate=2008-01-03 |title=Animal Welfare Act and Regulations |author=Animal Welfare Information Center - United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service - National Agricultural Library |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416104435/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/legislat/usdaleg1.htm |archive-date=2009-04-16 }}</ref>

In recent years, state legislatures have passed new laws aimed at eliminating the worst abuses at puppy mills. New laws include limits on the number of breeding females, requirements that facilities be licensed and inspected, and requirements that dogs be given proper veterinary care. Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Virginia passed puppy mill laws in 2008, and 10 states passed laws in 2009 to crack down on abusive puppy mills.

In 2010, Missouri voters passed Proposition B, the "Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act", which establishes minimum standards of humane care and limits breeders to 50 intact dogs.<ref name="new laws">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2010/03/iowa_puppy_mill_bill_signed_030910.html |date=2010-03-09 | accessdate=2009-03-18 |title=Iowa Gov.

A compromise, dubbed the ''Missouri Solution'', was signed by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon.<ref name="missouri solution">{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_6e5b5f7e-96ad-11e0-982f-0019bb30f31a.html|date=2011-06-14 | title=State Officials Outline New Dog Breeding Law | author=Joel Currier St. Louis Post Dispatch}}</ref>

Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, Missouri Director of Agriculture Jon Hagler and Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch state that "key provisions of a compromise dog breeding law passed in April will protect animals without putting dog breeders out of business."<ref name="missouri solution" />

It retained some of the provisions of Proposition B, and made available some state funding for inspections. Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick reacted favorably, seeing a step in the right direction for animal welfare.<ref name="missouri solution"/>

The Missouri Senate has a current bill SB 161 that "modifies provisions relating to agriculture." Section 273.327, under the Animal Care Facilities Act states how there will be fees for dog facilities every year. On the same bill section 273.347, it states that breeders can receive penalties for animal care violations up to $1,000 and receive a class C misdemeanor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=4091895|title=SB161 - Modifies provisions relating to agriculture|website=www.senate.mo.gov|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>

=== Australia ===

Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has responded to the problem of puppy mills in [[Australia]] by proposing the Animals Regulation of Sale Bill. It would ban the sale of dogs through pet shops, the internet or newspapers. The aim is to crack down on [[impulse purchase]]s and shut down unregistered backyard breeders. These breeders should no longer easily profit from the sale of the dogs and the number of unwanted and abandoned animals could drop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greenerideal.com/news/environment/1001-puppy-farm-shut-down-australia/|title=One Small Step for Dog’s Rights as Puppy Farm Shut Down in Australia {{!}} Greener Ideal|last=Burke|first=Sarah|website=greenerideal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>

Also recently there were a few bold initiatives to fight against puppy mills. Namely RSPCA ([[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]) strategy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/history-rspca|title=The History of the RSPCA {{!}} Animal Legal & Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> Oscar's law (The organization's name originates from the story of a dog called Oscar, who was rescued from a puppy factory in central Victoria).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscarslaw.org/who-is-oscar.htm|title=Who Is Oscar? - the problem with puppies for sale online, avoiding puppy mills|website=Oscar's Law|language=en|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref> and Victorian Labor Party Efforts that restrict the number of dogs per breeding facility and require that pet shop owners to keep records of every dog sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/victorias-puppy-farms-and-pet-shop-laws-a-world-first-but-questions-about-ethical-breeding-remain-98947|title=Victoria's puppy farms and pet shop laws a world first - but questions about 'ethical' breeding remain|last=Brealey|first=Clare|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===

In 1996, Britain passed [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1980–1999|the Breeding and Sale of Dogs Act]] which requires annual veterinary inspections for anyone breeding five or more litters in one year. Breeding females are restricted to one litter per year and four per lifetime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.northampton.gov.uk/info/200274/licensing-and-business-regulation/19/licensing-of-dog-breeding-establishments|title=Licensing of dog breeding establishments|last=Council|first=Northampton Borough|website=www.northampton.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>

Breeders who choose to be members of the UK [[Kennel club|Kennel Club]] are required to register purebred puppies for sale with that organization and must certify the conditions under which the puppies were raised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/375/form1.pdf|title=Litter registration form|accessdate=14 May 2017}}</ref> Breeders who sell puppies by misrepresenting these standards may be liable to prosecution under the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]].

Members of the UK public frequently buy puppies and kittens without knowing the conditions under which the animals were reared, the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]] estimates from 40,000 to 80,000 puppies are sold that way per year.  To prevent this a new law is planned banning the sale of puppies and kittens below the age of 6 months in England except by licensed breeders and rehoming centres. Paula Boyden, of the [[Dogs Trust]], approves of the ban but advised, "potential loopholes" needed to be addressed. She maintains rehoming organisations need regulation.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45266357 Puppy and kitten sales at pet shops set to be banned] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

[[Lucy's Law]], which came into effect in April 2020, is intended to prevent puppy (and kitten) farming by banning third-party sales such as in pet shops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gove-delivers-lucys-law-to-protect-puppies-and-kittens|title=Gove delivers ‘Lucy’s Law’ to protect puppies and kittens|website=GOV.UK}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/lucys-law-puppy-farm-ban-set-to-be-confirmed-11718827|title='Lucy's Law' puppy farm ban set to be confirmed|website=Sky News}}</ref>

== Legal cases ==
Chelsea Vancleve v. Chien Et Chat, Inc. stated, "In 2014, the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against Barkworks, a Southern California pet store chain with six locations." Barkworks tricked many puppy buyers into purchasing sick puppies. They were also making illegal breeder licenses, "fabricating breeding certificates and lying about providing veterinary care" The Animal Defense Fund made a complaint in 2015 that could have turned into a class action. The court prevented the case from going any further as a class action but in 2018, the parties agreed on a settlement. "Barkworks had taken down the misleading in-store signs and closed four of its six retail stores, and the California legislature had passed a law banning the sale of dogs from commercial breeders."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aldf.org/case/challenging-the-sale-of-puppy-mill-dogs-barkworks-class-action/|title=Challenging the Sale of Puppy Mill Dogs - Barkworks Class Action|website=Animal Legal Defense Fund|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-07}}</ref>

=== Clewiston, Florida === 
According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals ([[ASPCA]]), on November 17, 2015 over 100 dogs were rescued from a puppy mill raid in [[Clewiston, Florida]].  Found in overcrowded and untidy pens with limited access to food or water, 116 dogs, including Huskies, Chihuahuas, and Poodles, were found having several ailments and untreated medical conditions that called for immediate veterinary care.  According to Tim Rickey, the Vice President of ASPCA's Field Investigations and Response team, "[ASPCA's] goal is to remove these dogs from a life of neglect, help them become healthy and eventually find them safe and loving homes."  Reports state that the two puppy mill owners, Beatriz Perez, 46, and Alexei Fernandez, 47, have been arrested on charges of animal cruelty while the [[ASPCA]] transported the 116 dogs to a safe and secure location.  The [[ASPCA]] is currently asking for donations to fund the medical treatments that many of the dogs need as well as to help these dogs find a forever home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aspca.org/secure/201511ea2-nd-ms-p1?ms=em_ea2_nd-c-p1-20151117&initialms=em_ea2_nd-c-p1-20151117&pcode=AFBNDWEB2P1|title=Donate to the ASPCA and Help Animals|work=ASPCA|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2572642/clewiston-puppy-mill-bad-breeders-busted-over-100-dogs-seized-from-facility/|title=Clewiston Puppy Mill: Bad Breeders Busted, Over 100 Dogs Seized From Facility|work=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>

=== Gibson County, Tennessee ===
On November 5, 2014, the Animal Rescue Corps rescued about 100 dogs from what was said to be severely neglectful conditions in [[Gibson County, Tennessee]].  Both adult and newborn dogs were found in extremely crowded cages exposed to ammonia with limited access to any water or food. According to the Animal Rescue Corps's spokesman, Michael Cunningham, "the dogs were suffering from untreated, painful eye infections, respiratory conditions, dental issues, severe matting that limited their mobility and vision, and urine-soaked, feces-caked fur."  Since the owners could not be reached, no criminal charges have been filed. However, the dogs were taken for thorough veterinary screenings and care followed by their transportation to in-state and out-of-state dog adoption centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/news/local/2014/11/05/alleged-puppy-mill-raided-in-gibson-county/18537295/|title=UPDATED: Alleged puppy mill raided in Gibson County|date=5 November 2014|work=The Jackson Sun|accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>
