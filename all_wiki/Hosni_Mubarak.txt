Mubarak served as an [[Egyptian Air Force]] officer in various formations and units; he spent two years in a [[Spitfire]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron.<ref name="EAF" /> Some time in the 1950s, he returned to the Air Force Academy as an instructor, remaining there until early 1959.<ref name="EAF" /> From February 1959 to June 1961, Mubarak undertook further training in the [[Soviet Union]], attending a Soviet pilot training school in Moscow and another at [[Kant Air Base]] near [[Bishkek]] in the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]].<ref name="PBS1">{{cite news |last1=Epatko |first1=Larisa |title=Timeline: Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's President for Three Decades, Resigns |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/egypts-president-resigns |accessdate=26 February 2020 |date=11 February 2011}}</ref>

Mubarak undertook training on the [[Ilyushin Il-28]] and [[Tupolev Tu-16]] jet bombers. In 1964 he gained a place at the [[Frunze Military Academy]] in Moscow. On his return to Egypt, he served as a wing commander, then as a base commander; he commanded the Cairo West Air Base in October 1966 then briefly commanded the [[Beni Suef]] Air Base.<ref name="EAF" /> In November 1967, Mubarak became the Air Force Academy's commander when he was credited with doubling the number of Air Force pilots and navigators during the pre-[[Yom Kippur War|October War]] years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mmc.gov.eg/Academies/AFA/Aa10.htm |title=Staff Group Captain Mohammed Hosni Mubarak |website=Egyptian Armed Forces Web Site |publisher=Egyptian Armed Forces |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094717/http://www.mmc.gov.eg/Academies/AFA/Aa10.htm |archive-date=29 April 2011 }}</ref> Two years later, he became Chief of Staff for the Egyptian Air Force.<ref name="madamasr"/>

In 1972, Mubarak became Commander of the Air Force and Egyptian Deputy Minister of Defense.

She said Mubarak exaggerated his role in the 1973 war. In an interview with the Egyptian independent newspaper Almasry Alyoum (26 February 2011), El-Shazli said Mubarak altered documents to take credit from her father for the initial success of the Egyptian forces in 1973. She also said photographs pertaining to the discussions in the military command room were altered and Saad El-Shazli was erased and replaced with Mubarak. She stated she intended to take legal action.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=288933&IssueID=2058 |last=Khalid |first=Osama |date=26 February 2011 |website=Almasry Alyoum |language=Arabic |script-title=ar:ابنة الفريق سعدالدين الشاذلى لـ"المصري اليوم": "مبارك" زوّر التاريخ ووضع صورته مكان والدى فى "غرفة عمليات أكتوبر" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425231850/http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=288933&IssueID=2058 |archive-date=25 April 2011 }}</ref>

===Egypt's return to the Arab League===

The Islamic Republic of Iran had, from 1979 onward, been making the claim to be the leader of the Islamic world, and in particular [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] had called for the overthrow of the governments of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab states along the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, calling these states illegitimate.<ref name="Islamic Imperialism 2006, p. 174">{{Cite book |last=Karsh |first=Efraim |title=Islamic Imperialism: A History |date=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10603-3 |location=New Haven |page=174 |oclc=62408708}}</ref> The claim of the Ayatollah Khomeini to be the rightful leader of the Islamic world and his attempts to export the Iranian revolution by working to overthrow governments that Khomeini deemed un-Islamic caused profound alarm and fear in the governments that were targeted like Iraq and Saudi Arabia.<ref name="Islamic Imperialism 2006, p. 174" /> In the face of the Iranian challenge, the other Arab states looked towards Egypt as an ally.<ref name="Islamic Imperialism 2006, p. 174" /> For King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the other leaders of the Arab Gulf states, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict faded into the background and the main concern was resisting Iranian pretensions to be the leader of the Islamic world, meaning that Egypt could not be ignored.<ref name="Islamic Imperialism 2006, p. 174" />

=== Governing style ===
Throughout the 1980s, Mubarak increased the production of affordable housing, clothing, furniture, and medicine. By the time he became President, Mubarak was one of a few Egyptian officials who refused to visit Israel and vowed to take a less enthusiastic approach to normalizing [[Egypt–Israel relations|relations with the Israeli government]].<ref name=sadhos2 /> Under Mubarak, Israeli journalists often wrote about the "cold peace" with Egypt, observing Israeli–Egyptian relations were frosty at best.<ref name="Islamic Imperialism 2006, p. 183">{{Cite book |last=Karsh |first=Efraim |title=Islamic Imperialism: A History |date=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10603-3 |location=New Haven |page=183 |oclc=62408708}}</ref> Mubarak was quick to deny that his policies would result in difficulties for Egyptian–Israeli dealings in the future.<ref name=sadhos2 />

President Mubarak was re-elected by majority votes in a referendum for successive terms on four occasions in 1987, 1993, and 1999. Each time, Mubarak secured his position by having himself nominated by Parliament then confirmed without opposition in a referendum.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bradley|first=John R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1zgCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA162|title=Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution|date=18 August 2009|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-61437-6|pages=162|language=en}}</ref>

The September 2005 ballot was a multiple-candidate election rather than a referendum, but the electoral institutions and security apparatus remain under the control of the President.

In 2005 [[Freedom House]], a non-governmental organization that conducts research into democracy, reported that the Egyptian government under Mubarak expanded bureaucratic regulations, registration requirements, and other controls that often feed corruption.

===Post-resignation===
Mubarak made no media appearances after his resignation. Except for his family and a close circle of aides, he reportedly refused to talk to anyone{{mdash}}even his supporters. His health was speculated to be rapidly deteriorating; some reports said he was in a coma. Most sources said he was no longer interested in performing any duties and wanted to "die in Sharm El-Sheikh".<ref>[http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/15/137787.html "Workers at Mubarak's palace plan 'Friday of Apology' Mubarak given up, wants to die in Sharm"] 15 February 2011, Al Arabiya News</ref><ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/02/15/2011-02-15_exegyptian_president_hosni_mubarak_in_a_coma_reports_protests_flare_up_in_bahrai.html "Ex-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak near death"] 15 February 2011, ''Daily News'' (New York)</ref>

[[File:Mubark behind the bars.JPG|thumb|Mubarak appearing in a [[Cairo]] court]]
On 24 May 2011, Mubarak was ordered to stand trial on charges of premeditated murder of peaceful protesters during the revolution and, if convicted, could face the death penalty. The decision to try Mubarak was made days before a scheduled protest in Tahrir Square. The full list of charges released by the public prosecutor was "intentional murder, attempted killing of some demonstrators&nbsp;...&nbsp;misuse of influence, deliberately wasting public funds and unlawfully making private financial gains and profits".<ref name="reutersmurdercharges" />

On 28 May, a Cairo administrative court found Mubarak guilty of damaging the national economy during the protests by shutting down the Internet and telephone services. He was fined LE200&nbsp;million{{mdash}}about {{USD|33.6 million}}{{mdash}}which the court ordered he must pay from his personal assets.

The trial of Hosni Mubarak, his sons Ala'a and Gamal, former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]] and six former top police officials began on 3 August 2011 at a temporary criminal court at the Police Academy in north Cairo. They were charged with corruption and the premeditated killing of peaceful protesters during the mass movement to oust the Mubarak government, the latter of which carries the death penalty.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/201161131532286483.html Mubarak and sons to stand trial in August] Al Jazeera.
