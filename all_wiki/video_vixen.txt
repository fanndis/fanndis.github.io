==Social aspect==

The work of video vixens and their portrayal in music videos have drawn criticism.

In 2005, former hip hop music-video model [[Karrine Steffans]] authored the book ''[[Confessions of a Video Vixen]]'', in which she depicts the degradation of women in the world of hip hop. The book's publisher describes it as "part tell-all, part cautionary tale".<ref name="VVbook">[http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060842423 "''Confessions of a Video Vixen'' by Karrine Steffans"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212141513/http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060842423 |date=December 12, 2005 }}.

==Female rappers as video vixens==
Female rappers have most substantially felt this pressure, where sex appeal is now the currency by which women in the music business are both valued and devalued.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} In particular, female rappers such as [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Trina]] occupy what [[Tracy Denean Sharpley-Whiting|T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting]] calls a "peculiar place of cultural antipathy", often accused of selling out and blamed for participating in the [[Exploitation of women in mass media|exploitation of women]].<ref name="genius.it"/> Similarly, [[Nicki Minaj]] is arguably{{By whom|date=July 2019}} a 'video vixen' who is the 'object, subject, and author' of sexually explicit music videos.<ref name="genius.it"/>

Female rappers who have shown themselves off as "video vixens" include Nicki Minaj, [[Trina (rapper)|Trina]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Rasheeda]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Remy Ma]], [[Da Brat]], [[Jacki-O]], [[Shawnna]], [[Gangsta Boo]], [[LoLa Monroe]], [[Diamond (rapper)|Diamond]] [[Princess (rapper)|Princess]], [[Cardi B]] and many others. The role of women has evolved over time in the hip-hop world. Two artists in the early era of hip-hop, rapper [[Roxanne Shante]] and rap group [[Salt-N-Pepa]], were well-known for rapping about defending the image of women.<ref name=":0" /> They were responding to male hip-hop artists who habitually degrade women.<ref name=":0" /> Rappers Lil' Kim, [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], Trina, Nicki Minaj, and many others are all opposite and seem to accept this hyper-sexuality.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Women, Pop Music, and Pornography|last = Levande|first = Meredith|date = 2008|journal = Meridians|volume = 8|pages = 293–321|doi = 10.2979/MER.2008.8.1.293|pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>

== Black women in hip hop ==
[[Audre Lorde]], who spoke out for black girls who are considered video vixens, said: "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive."<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Vixen Resistin': Redefining Black Womanhood in Hip Hop Music Videos|last = Balaji|first = Murali|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Black Studies|doi = 10.1177/0021934708325377|pmid = 21117275|volume = 41|issue = 1|pages = 5–20 |s2cid = 26320847}}</ref> The images presented in mass media, specifically in music videos, portray hyper-sensual images of the female sex. These images created within the world of hip hop reinforce the negative stereotypes associated with women, especially with black women.

It is pressuring for women musicians to conform to the porn standards because if not they will have to compete with the women who do.<ref name=":2" />

People realize that images of women is what rap music videos sell whether the women in the videos are playing the part of cheerleaders or die-hard groupies.  Women in the videos are what gets the attention of men and guarantees a male audience.<ref name=":2" /> The images are still shots of women taken from videos displaying their appearance. Women are tended to dress half naked and moving their body in sexual ways.<ref name=":2" /> The media paint the picture that African American women are only seen as sexual figures in the society. Once these images are put out there these women are not the owner of their representation anymore.<ref name=":1" />

== Expressing femininity in hip hop ==
[[Gender performance|Gender Performance]] is an evolving category where hip hop artists express femininity in non-conventional ways that break the stereotype of the passive, hyper-sexualized female body as an object to be consumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Imani Kai|date=April 12, 2014|title=From blues women to b-girls: performing badass femininity|url=https://bbnewpaltz.sln.suny.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-1861563-dt-content-rid-2699459_2/courses/spring16_WOM393_02/Johnson_Badass%20Femininity.pdf|journal=Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|volume=24|pages=15–28|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2014.902649|pmid=|s2cid=37603740|access-date=March 6, 2016}}</ref> Throughout the genre in [[graffiti]], [[breakdancing]], and [[rapping]], women are addressing the issues associated with the passive stereotype of female representation in hip hop. [[Feminist activism in hip hop]] re-examines the relationship women have to the hip hop culture, and how women choose to assert their sexuality.

A form of femininity in hip hop is through asserting sexuality and using it as a dominant source of power, creating the notion of being liberated and a subject as opposed to an object.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology|last=Pough|first=Gwendolyn D.|publisher=Parker Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-60043-010-7|location=Mira Loma, California|pages=[https://archive.org/details/homegirlsmakesom0000unse/page/116 116–127]|url=https://archive.org/details/homegirlsmakesom0000unse/page/116}}</ref> Artists within this category use blatant sexuality to their advantage as a part of their marketing and work. Due to the commodification of hip hop and stereotyping, the "sex sells" concept became prominent within mainstream hip hop culture.

==Successful career paths==
