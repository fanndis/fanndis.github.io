'''''Harper's Bazaar''''' is an American monthly women's [[fashion magazine]], first published based in [[New York City]] on November 2, 1867, as the weekly '''''Harper's Bazar'''''.<ref name=bazar/> ''Harper's Bazaar'' is published by New York City-based [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] and considers itself to be the style resource for "women who are the first to buy the best, from casual to couture".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hearst.com/magazines/harpers-bazaar|title=Harper's BAZAAR {{!}} Hearst|website=www.hearst.com|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> Aimed at what it calls "discerning ladies", ''Bazaar'' is published monthly with the slogan, motto, theme and tagline its "World and American's No. 1 Fashion Magazine."

Since its debut in New York City on November 2, 1867, as [[United States|America]]'s first [[fashion magazine]], its pages have been home to talent such as the founding editor, author and translator [[Mary Louise Booth]], as well as numerous [[fashion|fashion editors]], photographers, illustrators and writers. Samira Nasr is the editor-in-chief of U.S. edition of ''Harper's Bazaar''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/business/media/harpers-bazaar-editor-samira-nasr.html|title=Harper’s Bazaar Appoints First Woman of Color as Top Editor|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>

== History ==

[[Harper & Brothers]] founded the magazine based in New York City on November 2, 1867.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harper-brothers|title=Harper Brothers {{!}} American publishers|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=September 7, 2017|language=en}}</ref> This company also gave birth to ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishing]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}[[File:Harpersbazar.jpg|thumb|Front cover illustrating hairstyles, Vol. I, No. 49 (October 3, 1868) – as ''Harper's Bazar: A Repository of Fashion, Pleasure, and Instruction'']]

''Harper's Bazar'' began publication as a tabloid-size weekly newspaper catering to women in the middle and upper classes. It showcased fashion from Germany and Paris in a newspaper-design format. It was not until 1901 ''Harper's'' moved to a monthly issued magazine which it maintains today. Now ''Harper's Bazaar'' is owned and operated by the [[Hearst Corporation]] in the U.S. and The National Magazine Company in the U.K. Hearst purchased the magazine in 1913.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The name change to ''Harper's Bazaar'' was filed on December 30, 1930.<ref name=bazar>"Corporate Changes". ''The New York Times''. December 31, 1930. Page 36. <br>"Albany, Dec. 30.—These corporate changes were filed today: ... [under heading 'Name Changes'] Harper's Bazar, Manhattan, to Harper's Bazaar. ..."</ref>

===Victorian elegance (1898–1912)===
As the turn-of-the-century began in America, ''Harper's Bazaar'' began featuring both illustrations and photographs for its covers and inside features of high society and increasingly of fashion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

During the late Victorian period, as the women's suffrage movement was gaining momentum (American women did not all win the right to vote until 1920 with the passing of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]]), the introduction of more tailored dresses and jackets coincided with women's new sense of feminism. ''Bazaar'' also began profiling prominent socialites, such as the [[Astor family|Astors]] and the Griscoms.

===The Carmel Snow years (1933–1957)===
In 1933, editor-in-chief [[Carmel Snow]] (a former editor at ''Vogue'') brought photojournalist [[Martin Munkacsi]] to a windswept beach to shoot a swimwear spread. As the model ran toward the camera, Munkacsi took the picture that made fashion-magazine history. Until that moment, nearly all fashion was carefully staged on mannequin-like models in a studio. Snow's buoyant spirit (she rarely slept or ate, although she had a lifelong love affair with the three-martini lunch) and wicked sense of adventure brought life to the pages of ''Bazaar''. Snow's genius came from cultivating the "best" people. Her first big find was art director Alexey Brodovitch, who innovated ''Bazaar''{{'}}s iconic Didot logo. Brodovitch is perhaps best known for his work with Richard Avedon, who, as a young photographer, was so determined to work at ''Bazaar'' that he endured the humiliation of 14 canceled interviews before finally being hired. Snow also unleashed the force of nature known as [[Diana Vreeland]], whom she brought on as fashion editor in 1936. The collaboration of these four visionaries resulted in some of the germane fashion shoots of the 20th century and ended only with Snow's retirement, at the age of 70, in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a92/bazaar-140-0507/|title=The Carmel Snow Years: 1933–57|date=May 1, 2007}}</ref>

===Alexey Brodovitch (1934–1958)===
In 1934, newly installed ''Bazaar'' editor Carmel Snow attended an Art Directors Club of New York exhibition curated by 36-year-old graphic designer [[Alexey Brodovitch]] and immediately offered Brodovitch a job as ''Bazaar'' 's art director. Throughout his career at the magazine, Brodovitch, a Russian émigré (by way of Paris), revolutionized magazine design. With his directive "Astonish me", he inspired some of the greatest visual artists of the 20th century (including protégés [[Irving Penn]], [[Hiro (photographer)|Hiro]], [[Gleb Derujinsky]], and, of course, [[Richard Avedon]]). One of his assistants was future [[Rolling Stone]] art director [[Tony Lane]]. Brodovitch's signature use of white space, his innovation of ''Bazaar'' 's iconic Didot logo, and the cinematic quality that his obsessive cropping brought to layouts (not even the work of [[Man Ray]] and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] was safe from his busy scissors) compelled [[Truman Capote]] to write, "What [[Dom Pérignon (person)|Dom Pérignon]] was to champagne ... so [Brodovitch] has been to ... photographic design and editorial layout." Brodovitch's personal life was less triumphant. Plagued by alcoholism, he left ''Bazaar'' in 1958 and eventually moved to the south of France, where he died in 1971.

===The Vreeland years (1936–1962)===
[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Toni Frissell, Woman in tennis outfit, 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Toni Frissell]], Woman in tennis outfit, published in Harper's Bazaar, February 1947]]
When Carmel Snow saw [[Diana Vreeland|Mrs. T. Reed Vreeland]] dancing on the roof of New York's St. Regis Hotel in a white lace [[Chanel]] dress and a bolero with roses in her hair one evening in 1936, she knew she'd found ''Bazaar''{{'}}s newest staffer. Diana, who is said to have invented the word "pizzazz", first came to the attention of readers with her "Why Don't You ... ?" column. (A typical suggestion: "Why don't you ... wear, like the [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], three enormous diamond stars arranged in your hair in front?") Before long, she became fashion editor, collaborating with photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Richard Avedon and, later, art director Henry Wolf. Her eccentricity, perception and wit, as well as her sharp wit and sweeping pronouncements ("I adore that pink! It's the navy blue of India," "Elegance is refusal!"), were memorialized in the movie ''Funny Face'', making her, for many, the prototypical fashion-magazine editor.

===The Avedon years (1945–1965)===
[[Richard Avedon]] began creating fashion portfolios for ''Harper's Bazaar'' at the age of 22. His distinctive photographs showed both chic insouciance and boundless vitality. Avedon's women leapt off curbs, roller-skated on the [[Place de la Concorde]], and were seen in nightclubs, enjoying the freedom and fashions of the postwar era.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

He was immortalized in the film ''[[Funny Face]]'' by the character Dick Avery (played by [[Fred Astaire]]), who asked, "What's wrong with bringing out a girl who has character, spirit, and intelligence?"

=== The Derujinsky years (1950–1968) ===
[[Gleb Derujinsky]]'s 18-year career at Harper's bazaar spanned from 1950 to 1968 and during that time produced some of the classic images of the era.
Scouted by editor-in-chief [[Carmel Snow]] and art director [[Alexey Brodovitch]], Derujinsky joined the elite group of photographers, including [[Richard Avedon]], who shot for the magazine. Working closely with the then fashion editor [[Diana Vreeland]], Derujinsky proved a pioneer in his field, creating stunning juxtapositions between European Haute Couture dresses and landscapes ranging from desert sands to car junkyards, fairgrounds and airports, all this at a time when air travel was yet to become as common as it is now. "Avedon shot dresses and clothes, Gleb shot women living in them".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capturing Fashion: Derujinsky|publisher=Flammarion|year=2016|page=45}}</ref>

To mark the inauguration of Pan Am's [[Boeing 707]] in 1957, Derujinsky travelled across the world with [[Nena von Schlebrügge]], and Ruth Neumann, whom he would later marry.  The latter would be his muse from the seaside harbors of China, to the Nara Deer Park in Japan, and throughout Thailand, Spain and Greece.
The 1957 Paris Collections were the basis for a 25-page spread in ''Harper's Bazaar'' featuring his photographs. "Gleb Derujinsky's photographs evoke the best of ''Harper's Bazaar'': exquisitely beautiful, original, and instantly iconic images of a very fashionable life".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Capturing Fashion: Gleb Derujinsky|publisher=Flammarion|year=2016|page=107}}</ref>

===Nonnie Moore (1980–1984)===
[[Nonnie Moore]] was hired as fashion editor in 1980, having served in the same post at ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]].''<ref>{{cite news|title=Nonnie Moore, Fashion Editor at Magazines, Dies at 87|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|date=February 24, 2009|accessdate=February 26, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/business/media/25moore.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' noticed the changes she made at ''Harper's Bazaar'', highlighting how the magazine had been "looking a little dowdy", but that Moore had "noticeably sharpened the magazine's fashion point of view" by showing "brighter, younger and more stylish", complimenting her use of "young and exciting fashion photographers", such as [[Oliviero Toscani]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Duka |first=John |url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60F16FC3C5F0C758CDDA80894D9484D81 |title=Notes on Fashion |publisher=The New York Times |date= January 6, 1981|accessdate= February 25, 2009}}</ref>
