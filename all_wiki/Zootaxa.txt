It is published by [[Magnolia Press]] (Auckland, New Zealand).

==Temporary suspension from JCR==
The journal exhibited high levels of [[self-citation]] and its [[journal impact factor]] of 2019 was suspended from ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'' in 2020, a sanction which hit 34 journals in total.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Author Ivan|last1=Oransky|accessdate=2020-07-01|title=Major indexing service sounds alarm on self-citations by nearly 50 journals|url=https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/29/major-indexing-service-sounds-alarm-on-self-citations-by-nearly-50-journals/|date=2020-06-29}}</ref>
Biologist [[Ross Mounce]] noted that high levels of self-citation may be inevitable for a journal which publishes a large share of new species classification.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mounce|first1=Ross|date=2020-07-03|title=Suppression as a form of liberation?|url=http://rossmounce.co.uk/2020/07/03/suppression-as-a-form-of-liberation/}}</ref> Later that year this decision was reversed and it was admitted that levels of self-citation are appropriate considering the large proportion of papers from its field published by Zootaxa.<ref>[https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/28/major-indexing-service-reverses-decision-to-suppress-two-journals-from-closely-followed-metric/?fbclid=IwAR0XjnQUV5EM9bYZP-ABLLuM346rs1d_EYUENsDqcRBa_MiH4pgDyG4SW4k Major indexing service reverses decision to suppress two journals from closely followed metric]</ref>
