==History==
{{update|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Compton-1914.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street of Compton, 1914]]

The [[Spanish Empire]] had expanded into this area when the Viceroy of [[New Spain]] commissioned [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] to explore the Pacific Ocean in 1542–1543. In 1767, the area became part of the [[The Californias|Province of the Californias]] ({{lang-es|Provincia de las Californias}}), and the area was explored by the [[Portolá expedition]] in 1769–1770. In 1784, the [[Charles III of Spain|Spanish Crown]] deeded [[Rancho San Pedro]], a tract of over {{convert|75,000|acre|km2}}, to soldier Juan José Domínguez. The rancho changed in size over the years, as Domínguez's descendants partitioned the land amongst family members, sold parcels to newly arriving settlers, or relinquished some when validating their legal claim with the [[Mexico|Mexican]] government at {{convert|48000|acre|km2|}} in 1828, and with the United States government through a patent validating {{convert|43119|acre|km2|}} in 1858. The Domínguez family name is still applied throughout the area, including the [[Dominguez Rancho Adobe]] historical landmark, in the [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] of [[Rancho Dominguez, California|Rancho Dominguez]], located between the cities of Compton, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Carson, California|Carson]]. The tree that marked the original northern boundary of the rancho still stands at the corner of Poppy and Short streets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eagle Tree|url=http://www.comptoncity.org/visitors/eagletree.asp|website=www.comptoncity.org|publisher=City of Compton|accessdate=22 July 2017|language=en}}</ref> {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In 1867, Griffith Dickenson Compton led a group of 30 pioneers to the area. These families had traveled by wagon train south from [[Stockton, California]], in search of ways to earn a living other than the rapid exhaustion of gold fields. Originally named Gibsonville, after one of the tract owners, it was later called Comptonville. However, to avoid confusion with the [[Camptonville, California|Comptonville]] located in [[Yuba County]], the name was shortened to Compton.<ref name="city"/> Compton's earliest settlers were faced with terrible hardships as they farmed the land in bleak weather to get by with just the barest subsistence. The weather continued to be harsh, rainy and cold, and fuel was difficult to find. To gather firewood it was necessary to travel to mountains close to [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. The round trip took almost a week. Many in the Compton party wanted to relocate to a friendlier climate and settle down, but as there were two general stores within traveling distance—one in the pueblo of [[Los Angeles]], the other in [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]]—they eventually decided to stay put.<ref name="city"/>

By 1887, the settlers realized it was time to make improvements to the local government. A series of town meetings were held to discuss incorporation of their little town. Griffith D. Compton donated his land to incorporate and create the city of Compton in 1889, but he did stipulate that a certain acreage be zoned solely for agriculture and named Richland Farms.<ref name="Comp">{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/richland-farms/the-past/|title=1 The Past &#124; Departures|publisher=KCET|date=July 23, 2010|accessdate=August 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915160002/http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/richland-farms/the-past/|archivedate=September 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In January 1888, a petition supporting the incorporation of Compton was forwarded to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who in turn forwarded the petition to the State Legislature. On May 11, 1888 the city of Compton was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] with a population of 500 people. The first City Council meeting was held on May 14, 1888.<ref name="city"/>

The ample residential lots of Richland Farms gave residents enough space to raise a family, and food to feed them, along with building a barn, and caring for livestock. The farms attracted the black families who had begun migrating from the rural South in the 1950s, and there they found their 'home away from home'. Compton could not support large-scale agricultural business, but it did give the residents the opportunity to work the land for their families.<ref name="Comp"/>

The 1920s saw the opening of the Compton Airport. Compton Junior College was founded and city officials moved to a new City Hall on Alameda Street.<ref name="city"/> On March 10, 1933, a destructive earthquake caused many casualties: schools were destroyed and there was major damage to the central business district.<ref name="city"/> While it would eventually be home to a large black population, in 1930 there was only one black resident.<ref>{{cite book|last=Horne|first=Gerald|title=Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1997|location=New York, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/firethistimewatt00horn/page/27 27]|isbn=978-0-306-80792-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/firethistimewatt00horn/page/27}}</ref>

From the 1920s through the early 1940s, the Compton area was home to a sizable Japanese American population, a large proportion of whom were farmers. Shortly after President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 9066]] in February 1942, Compton residents of Japanese descent were forcibly removed from their homes and interned for the duration of World War II. Most were initially detained at the Santa Anita Assembly Center; they were later transferred to and incarcerated at Manzanar and other internment centres, called "Relocation Centers."<ref>{{cite book|last=Seigel|first=Shizue|title=In Good Conscience: Supporting Japanese Americans During the Internment|url=https://archive.org/details/ingoodconscience00seig|url-access=registration|publisher=AACP, Inc.|year=2006|location=San Mateo, California|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ingoodconscience00seig/page/93 93–99]|isbn=978-0-934609-18-0}}</ref>

In the 1950s, middle-class black people began moving into the area, mostly on the west side. Compton grew quickly throughout the decade. One reason for this was Compton was close to [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]], where there was an established black population. The eastern side of the city was predominately white until the 1970s. Despite being located in the middle of a major metropolitan area, thanks to the legacy of Griffith D. Compton, there still remains one small pocket of agriculture from its earliest years.<ref name="Comp"/>

During the 1950s and 1960s, after the Supreme Court declared all racially exclusive housing covenants (title deeds) unconstitutional in the case ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the first black families moved to the area.<ref name="black">{{cite web|url=http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/history-of-the-city.htm|title=History of the City &#124; About Compton|publisher=Comptoncity.org|date=March 10, 1933|accessdate=August 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710154944/http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/history-of-the-city.htm|archivedate=July 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Compton's growing black population was still largely ignored and neglected by the city's elected officials. [[Centennial High School (Compton, California)|Centennial High School]] was finally built to accommodate a burgeoning student population.<ref name="black"/> At one time, the City Council even discussed dismantling the [[Compton Police Department]] in favor of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] in an attempt to exclude blacks from law enforcement jobs.  A black man first ran for City Council in 1958, and the first black councilman was elected in 1961.<ref name="black"/>
[[File:Compton-1920.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Compton, 1920]]

In 1969, [[Douglas Dollarhide]] became the mayor, the first black man elected mayor of any metropolitan city in California.<ref name="black"/> Two blacks and one Mexican-American were also elected to the local school board.<ref name="black"/> Four years later, in 1973, [[Doris A. Davis]] defeated Dollarhide's bid for re-election to become the first female black mayor of a metropolitan American city. By the early 1970s, the city had one of the largest concentrations of blacks in the country with over ninety percent.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 2013, [[Aja Brown]], age 31, became the city's youngest mayor to date.

For many years, Compton was a much sought-after suburb for the black middle class of Los Angeles. This past affluence is reflected in the area's appearance—Compton's streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family houses. However, several factors have contributed to Compton's gradual decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base, something that was already sparse due to limited commercial properties. In later years, there were middle-class [[white flight|whites who fled]] to the newly incorporated cities of [[Artesia, California|Artesia]], [[Bellflower, California|Bellflower]], [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]], [[Paramount, California|Paramount]] and [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] in the late 1950s. These nearby cities remained largely white early on despite [[Racial integration|integration]].<ref>Scott, Allen John and Edward Soja (1996). ''The City: Los Angeles and Urban Theory at the End of the Twentieth Century'' Berkeley: University of California Press. 10.</ref> This white middle class flight accelerated following the [[Watts Riots|1965 Watts Riots]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=McWhorter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/08/12/DI2005081201348.html |title=Outlook: The Negative Impact of the Watts Riots |work=The Washington Post |date=August 15, 2005|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

By the late 1960s, middle-class and upper-middle-class blacks found other areas to be more attractive to them. Some were unincorporated areas of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] such as [[Ladera Heights, California|Ladera Heights]], [[View Park-Windsor Hills, California|View Park]] and [[View Park-Windsor Hills, California|Windsor Hills]], and others were cities such as [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[Carson, California|Carson]]. Carson was particularly significant because it had successfully thwarted attempts at [[annexation]] by neighboring Compton. The city opted instead for incorporation in 1968, which is notable because its black population was actually more affluent than its white population. As a newer city, it also offered more favorable tax rates and lower crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ci.carson.ca.us/content/department/about_carson/growing_pains.asp|title=Growing Pains of a Young City – City of Carson, CA|publisher=City of Carson|accessdate=August 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716131444/http://ci.carson.ca.us/content/department/about_carson/growing_pains.asp|archivedate=July 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Crime===
Following the [[Watts riots]] in 1965, crime in Compton rose sharply as more middle-class residents fled. By 1970, it had the highest crime rate in the state of California. Compton's violent reputation reached the national spotlight in the late 1980s with the prominent rise of local [[gangsta rap]] groups [[Compton's Most Wanted]] and [[N.W.A]], the latter of whom released the album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' in 1988. The city became notorious for [[gang violence]], primarily caused by the [[Bloods]] and [[Crips]].<ref name=Straight>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0815-compton-image-20150815-story.html|title='Straight Outta' a different Compton: City says much has changed in 25 years|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 14, 2015|first1=Angel|last1=Jennings|last2=Esquivel|first2=Paloma}}</ref> After years of decline in crime, Compton's murder rate skyrocketed in 2004 with racial conflicts between blacks and Latinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4804296|title=A Deadly Year for the City of Compton|last=del Barco|first=Mandalit|date=August 17, 2005|website=NPR News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> 2005 was the city's deadliest year on record when the city murder rate reached 72 killings

Compton is 10.12 square miles and is fondly known as the “Hub City” because of its unique geographical proximity being in the center of the Los Angeles County boundaries.  As the ‘Hub City’ it makes Compton strategically located along the [[Alameda Corridor]], a rail passageway of 25% of all U.S. waterborne international trade, in addition to being a large industrial center for transit and distribution, business services, high technology, home and lifestyle products, metals, financial services, and textile manufacturing.
The Hub City is part of the Gateway region and has a 77-acre Compton / Woodley Airport that is home to 275 based aircraft and experiences over 66,000 flight operations each year.  This air transportation asset is complemented by the Hub City's four major freeways adjacent to the City's boundaries.  Interstate 710 runs from the seaports through the eastern boundary; the State Route 91 freeway extends through the southern boundary; Interstate 105 runs slightly along the north of the City; and Interstate 110 along to the west.  Additionally, the Interstates 405 and 605 freeways are within two miles of Compton's southern and eastern edges, respectively.

Compton is surrounded by multiple freeways which provide access to destinations throughout the region.<ref name=LAMag/> The [[Port of Long Beach|Long Beach]] and [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] Ports are less than 20 minutes from downtown Compton, providing access to international destinations for customers and suppliers.

Until recently, Compton's population was dominated by a black demographic, but [[Latinos]] now represent the largest ethnic group in the city. Despite the shift in population, many black professional athletes and entertainers are originally from Compton.  Black people continue to dominate local politics, holding most elected positions in the city. Although an [[Inner suburbs|inner suburb]] of Los Angeles, Compton has seen an increase of middle-class residents in the last few years, due to its affordable housing. With the influx of immigrants and the demographic shift in ethnic population, it was after the [[2000 U.S. Census]] that Latinos were recognized as the majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/history-of-the-city.htm|title=History of the City &#124; About Compton|publisher=Comptoncity.org|date=March 10, 1933|accessdate=August 30, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710154944/http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/history-of-the-city.htm|archivedate=July 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Compton has been referred to on numerous occasions in [[gang]] affiliation, [[gangsta rap]] and [[g-funk]] songs, especially in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, and so has attained an association not only with gang violence and crime, but with [[hip hop music]] as well. The city is known as the home of many famous rappers (see [[List of people from Compton, California#Arts and entertainment|list]]).

==Government==

===Municipal government===
After [[Lionel Cade]], an accountant, assumed the mayor's office in 1977, one of the first orders of business was to conduct an audit of the city's finances. It was discovered that the city was $2 million in debt. The administration was able to eliminate the huge deficit in one year by making cuts in every department. It also aggressively sought federal funding to help pay for essential services, which was at least partially effective. However, with the passage of the property tax cutting initiative [[Proposition 13]] by California voters, Compton was one of the cities hardest hit, since it had already eliminated most of the excess from its budget.<ref>William A. Fischel [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~wfischel/Papers/Martin%20comment%20feb09.pdf Serrano and Proposition 13: Comment on Isaac Martin, "Does School Finance Litigation Cause Taxpayer Revolt"], Dartmouth College, 2009</ref>

In 2000, the [[Compton Police Department]] was disbanded amidst controversy and charges of corruption. The police department claims it was disbanded after investigations of gang activity led to then-Compton Mayor [[Omar Bradley (California politician)|Omar Bradley]]. Once this became public, the mayor charged it was the police who were themselves corrupt, and he disbanded the police department. Omar Bradley has since faced serious corruption charges.<ref>[http://www.blackpressusa.com/news/Article.asp?SID=3&Title=National+News&NewsID=2776 Former Compton Mayor among Five Officials Arrested after Probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206051559/http://www.blackpressusa.com/news/Article.asp?SID=3&Title=National+News&NewsID=2776 |date=December 6, 2008 }}.

Current recall efforts are a direct response from residents of the accusations of corruption of the city's mayor and council. Some of the accusations involve the issuing of city contracts to personal donors and friends. One particular accusation involved the trash and recycling contract of the city to [[Pacific Coast Waste and Recycling]] LLC in 2007,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200113082845/http://www.thecomptonbulletin.com/series1/index.html] </ref> whose leadership donated large amounts of money to Perrodin's political coffers.

Notices of intent to circulate recall petitions against four Compton city officials are expected to be filed in August 2010, by a group of citizens who claim corruption in Compton is being ignored by the same authorities who were shocked by the recent salary controversy in the city of [[Bell, California|Bell]].<ref>{{cite web|author=BETTY PLEASANT, Contributing Editor|url=http://www.wavenewspapers.com/opinion/Bottom-Line-In-Compton-recall-paperwork-soon-to-land-on-the-desks-of-top-city-officials-101040384.html|title=Bottom Line: In Compton, recall paperwork soon to land on the desks of top city officials|publisher=Wavenewspapers.com|date=August 18, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823002147/http://www.wavenewspapers.com/opinion/Bottom-Line-In-Compton-recall-paperwork-soon-to-land-on-the-desks-of-top-city-officials-101040384.html|archivedate=August 23, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Compton has discharged its city manager for the second time in three years. ''The Los Angeles Times'' says the City Council voted in a closed meeting, September 9, 2010, to fire Charles Evans. ''The Times'' says council members refused to discuss the reasons for their decision. Evans took office in 2007, after the dismissal of previous City Manager Barbara Kilroy. City Controller Willie Norfleet will take over until a permanent manager can be named.<ref name=AP/>
