In 2012, [[Halifax Media Group]] acquired the ''Tuscaloosa News''. Prior to that, the paper's owner was [[The New York Times Company]].<ref>[http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/items/2012/01/06/halifax-media-purchases-16-newspapers.html Halifax Media purchases 16 newspapers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109211739/http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/items/2012/01/06/halifax-media-purchases-16-newspapers.html |date=January 9, 2012 }}</ref> The New York Times Company acquired the ''News'' in 1985 from the Public Welfare Foundation, a charitable entity.<ref>"Times Co. In Pact for 3 Dailies," ''The New York Times'', January 15, 1985, p. D21</ref>  The ''News'' had been donated to that foundation by its owner Edward Marsh, along with other newspapers he owned, before his death in 1964.<ref>PR Newswire, January 14, 1985</ref>

In 2015, Halifax was acquired by [[GateHouse Media]] (legally known as New Media Inverstment Group).<ref>[http://ir.newmediainv.com/Cache/1001192429.PDF?Y=&O=PDF&D=&FID=1001192429&T=&IID=4426551 New Media Announces Agreement to Acquire Halifax Media Group for $280.0 Million] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307125519/http://ir.newmediainv.com/cache/1001192429.pdf?d=&fid=1001192429&iid=4426551&o=pdf&t=&y= |date=2016-03-07 }}</ref>

The ''News'' has a 12-month average circulation of 32,700 daily and 34,600 Sunday.<ref>[http://www.nytco.com/company/business_units/regional_media_group.html New York Times Company Business Units] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324051819/http://www.nytco.com/company/business_units/regional_media_group.html |date=March 24, 2008 }}</ref>  Of the 25 daily newspapers published in Alabama, the ''News'' has the fifth-highest daily circulation.<ref>[http://www.alabamapress.org/uploads/ratesheet08.pdf Alabama Press Association: 2008 Ratesheet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625002318/http://www.alabamapress.org/uploads/ratesheet08.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }}</ref>  Beginning in 2001, the ''News'' constructed and occupied a new {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility overlooking the [[Black Warrior River]].<ref>"Warehouse Sites Allow 'Bama Dailies to Build in Downtown Areas," ''Editor and Publisher Magazine'', November 5, 2001, p. 22</ref>

The'' Tuscaloosa News'' has received two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s. The first was in 1957, when the paper won the prize for editorial writing, for Buford Boone's editorials on the issue of segregation at the [[University of Alabama]], as exemplified by "[[s:What A Price For Peace|What A Price For Peace]]".<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/cgi-bin/year.pl?892,23 Pulitzer Prizes: 1957]</ref> The second Pulitzer Prize was awarded for the paper's outstanding reporting on the tornado outbreaks of [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 25 to 28, 2011]].<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2012-Breaking-News-Reporting Pulitzer Prizes: 2012]</ref>

Because Tuscaloosa is home to the University of Alabama, the ''News'' places particular emphasis on coverage of its sports programs, and maintains a separate website for that coverage.

Since late 2012, the ''Tuscaloosa News'' has become available in the [[Birmingham, Alabama]], area.  The reason for its expansion into Birmingham is to fill a perceived void in the market when the ''[[Birmingham News]]'' cut back publication into three days a week earlier in the year.
