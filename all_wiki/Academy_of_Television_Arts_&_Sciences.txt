The '''Academy of Television Arts & Sciences''' ('''ATAS'''), also colloquially known as the '''Television Academy''', is a professional honorary organization dedicated to the advancement of the [[Television in the United States|television industry in the United States]].

Founded in 1946, the organization presents the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, an annual ceremony honoring achievement in U.S. [[prime time|primetime]] television.

==History==
[[Syd Cassyd]] considered television a tool for education and envisioned an organization that would put outside the "flash and glamor" of the industry and become an outlet for "serious discussion" and award the industries "finest achievements".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/academy/about/history|title=History|newspaper=Television Academy|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref> In 2016, producer Hayma Washington was elected chairman and CEO of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, becoming the first African-American to hold the position.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-statement-election-hayma-washington-television-academy/|title=NAACP {{!}} NAACP Statement on Election of Hayma Washington to Television Academy|date=November 21, 2016 |newspaper=NAACP|language=en-US|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref>

In 2014, alongside its Hall of Fame induction ceremony and announced plans to expand its headquarters, the organization announced that it had changed its public brand to the Television Academy, with a new logo designed by [[Siegel + Gale]]. The new branding was intended to downplay the organization's antiquated formal name in favor of a more straightforward identity, and features a separating line (typically used to separate the organization's [[wordmark]] from a simplified image of the Emmy Award statuette) used to symbolize a screen, and also portrayed as a "portal".<ref name=fastco-tvacademy>{{cite web |title= How the Television Academy got its brand mojo back |url= http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027971/how-the-television-academy-got-its-brand-mojo-back |website= Fast Co Design |access-date= July 10, 2014}}</ref><ref name=deadline-rebrand>{{cite web |title= Television Academy getting $40&nbsp;million makeover |url= http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/television-academy-getting-40-million-makeover/ |website= Deadline.com |access-date= July 10, 2014}}</ref>

==Emmy Award==
[[File:The courtyard -- Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.png|thumb|250 px|The courtyard and Emmy Award statue at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences facility on Lankershim]]

In 1949, the Television Academy held the first [[Emmy Award]]s ceremony, an annual event created to recognize excellence in U.S. television programming, although the initial event was restricted to programming from the [[Los Angeles]] area. The name "Emmy" was derived from "Immy," a nickname for the [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|image orthicon]] camera tube, which aided the progress of modern television. The word was feminized as "Emmy" to match the statuette, which depicted a winged woman holding an atom.

The Emmy Awards are administered by three sister organizations who focus on various sectors of television programming: the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (primetime), the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (daytime, sports, news and documentary), and the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (international).

==Publications and programs==
In addition to recognizing outstanding programming through its Primetime Emmy Awards, the Television Academy publishes the award-winning ''emmy'' magazine and through the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]], is responsible for the [[Archive of American Television]], annual College Television Awards, Fred Rogers Memorial Scholarship, acclaimed student internships and other educational outreach programs.
