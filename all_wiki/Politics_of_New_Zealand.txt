{{Politics of New Zealand}}

The '''politics of New Zealand''' function within a framework of a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]]. The structure of government is based on the [[Westminster system]], and the legal system is modelled on the [[English law|common law of England]]. New Zealand is a [[constitutional monarchy]], in which [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[sovereign]] and [[head of state]].

The [[New Zealand Parliament]] holds [[legislative power]] and consists of the Queen and the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Queen is represented by the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] when not present in the country herself. Members of Parliament (MPs) are [[Elections in New Zealand|elected]] to the House of Representatives usually every three years. The country has a [[multi-party system]], though the dominant [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties in New Zealand]] have historically been the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] and the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] (or its predecessors). [[Minority government]]s are common and typically dependent on [[confidence-and-supply]] agreements with other parties.

[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] in New Zealand is based on the principle that "The Queen reigns, but the government rules".<ref name="constitution">{{cite web|title=On the Constitution of New Zealand|url= https://gg.govt.nz/role/constofnz/intro|publisher=The Governor-General of New Zealand Te Kawana Tianara o Aotearoa|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref> Although an integral part of the process of government, the Queen and her governor-general remain politically neutral and are not involved in the everyday aspects of governing. [[Ministers in the New Zealand Government|Ministers]] are selected from among the democratically elected members of the House of Representatives. Most ministers are members of the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], which is the main decision-making body of the [[New Zealand Government]]. The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] is the most senior minister, chair of the Cabinet, and thus [[head of government]]. Other ministers are appointed by the governor-general upon the advice of the prime minister, and are all accountable to Parliament.

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] rated New Zealand as a "[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|full democracy]]" in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016 |title = Democracy Index 2016 – The Economist Intelligence Unit |last=solutions |first=EIU digital |website=www.eiu.com |language=en |access-date=29 November 2017 }}</ref> The country ranks highly for [[government transparency]], and has the lowest [[Corruption Perceptions Index|perceived level of corruption]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016#table |title = 2016 official table |date=25 January 2017 |access-date = 15 December 2018 }}</ref>

Constitutional rights are protected under common law and are strengthened by the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act 1990]] and [[New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993|Human Rights Act 1993]], although these are not [[Entrenchment clause|entrenched]] and can be overturned by Parliament with a simple majority.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=John |last=Wilson |title = Government and nation – The constitution |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=March 2009 |url = http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/government-and-nation/ |access-date=28 February 2011 }}</ref> The Constitution Act 1986 describes the three [[branches of government]] in New Zealand: the executive (the Sovereign and the Executive Council), the legislature (Parliament) and the judiciary (Courts).<ref name=EIIR2.1/>

=== Elections and party politics ===
[[File:Nzelection2011 ballot4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ballot]] showing parties, [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]]]]

The first [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political party in New Zealand]] was founded in 1891, and its main rival was founded in 1909—New Zealand had a ''de facto'' [[two-party system]] from that point until the adoption of MMP in 1996. Since then New Zealand has been a multi-party system, with at least five parties elected in every election since. No party has been able to govern without support from other groups since 1996, making [[coalition government]] standard.<ref>{{cite web |title = Coalition and minority governments |url = https://www.parliament.nz/resource/mi-nz/00PLLawRP99071/52e3e8f5c5960d88fc9bfa046bb1d6408e17b345 |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date=8 September 2017 |date=23 November 1999 }}</ref>

Historically the two largest, and oldest, parties are the New Zealand Labour Party ([[centre-left]], formed in 1916) and the New Zealand National Party ([[centre-right]], formed in 1936).<ref>{{cite book |last1= Papillon |first1= Martin |last2= Turgeon |first2= Luc |last3= Wallner |first3= Jennifer |last4= White |first4= Stephen |title= Comparing Canada: Methods and Perspectives on Canadian Politics |year = 2014 |publisher=UBC Press |isbn= 9780774827867 |page = 126 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WpU8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126 |access-date= 30 August 2016 |quote= ...in New Zealand politics, by the centre-left Labour Party and the centre-right National Party }}</ref> Other parties to be represented in Parliament, based on provisional results from the {{as of|2020|lc=on|alt=October 2020 general election}}, are [[ACT New Zealand]] (right-wing, [[free-market]]), the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] (left-wing, [[environmentalist]]), and the [[Māori Party]] ([[indigenous rights]]-based).<ref>{{cite web |title = Parliamentary parties |url = https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/political-parties/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |access-date=31 October 2020 |language=en-NZ }}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of voting in New Zealand}}

Prior to New Zealand becoming a British colony in 1840, politics in New Zealand was dominated by Māori chiefs as leaders of ''[[hapu]]'' and ''[[iwi]]'', utilising [[tikanga|Māori customs]] as a political system.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ballara|first=Angela|title=Iwi: The Dynamics of Māori Tribal Organisation from C.1769 to C.1945 |year=1998|publisher=Victoria University Press|location=Wellington|isbn=9780864733283|edition=1st}}</ref>

===Colonial politics===
[[File:The Treaty of Waitangi (in Maori).jpeg|thumb|Manuscript copy of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] (in [[Māori language|Māori]])]]

After the 1840 [[Treaty of Waitangi]], a colonial Governor and his small staff acted on behalf of the British government based on the British political system.<ref name="Timeline" /> Whereas Māori systems had dominated prior to 1840 governors attempting to introduce British systems met with mixed success in Māori communities. More isolated Māori were little influenced by the Government. Most influences were felt in and around [[Russell, New Zealand|Russell]], the [[Capital of New Zealand|first capital]], and [[Auckland]], the second capital.

The first [[voting rights]] in New Zealand were legislated in 1852 as the New Zealand Constitution Act for the 1853 elections and reflected British practice.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web |title = Political and constitutional timeline |url= https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/milestones |publisher=New Zealand History Online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|access-date=1 May 2017|date=4 November 2016}}</ref> Initially only [[property owner]]s could vote, but by the late 1850s 75% of British males over 21 were eligible to vote compared to 20% in England and 12% in Scotland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Around 100 Māori chiefs voted in the 1853 election.<ref>{{cite web |title = Setting up the Māori seats |url = https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/setting-up-seats |publisher=New Zealand History Online |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |access-date=1 May 2017|date=28 November 2016}}</ref>

During the 1850s [[Provinces of New Zealand|provincial]]-based government was the norm. It was abolished in 1876.<ref name="Timeline" /> Politics was initially dominated by [[Historic conservatism in New Zealand|conservative]] and wealthy "wool lords" who owned multiple sheep farms, mainly in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]. During the gold rush era starting 1858 suffrage was extended to all British gold miners who owned a 1-pound mining license. The conservatives had been influenced by the militant action of gold miners in [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]] at Eureka. Many gold miners had moved to the New Zealand fields bringing their radical ideas. The extended franchise was modelled on the Victorian system. In 1863 the mining franchise was extended to goldfield business owners. By 1873 of the 41,500 registered voters 47% were gold field miners or owners.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

After the brief Land War period ending in 1864, Parliament moved to extend the [[right to vote|franchise]] to more Māori. [[Donald McLean (New Zealand politician)|Donald McLean]] introduced a bill for four temporary [[Māori electorates]] and extended the franchise to all Māori men over 21 in 1867. As such, Māori were universally franchised 12 years prior to European men.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Atkinson|first=Neill|title=Voting rights |url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/voting-rights |encyclopedia = Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=1 May 2017 |date=17 February 2015 }}</ref>

In 1879 an [[economic depression]] hit, resulting in poverty and many people, especially miners, returning to Australia. Between 1879 and 1881 Government was concerned at the activities of Māori activists based on confiscated land at [[Parihaka]]. Activists destroyed settlers' farm fences and ploughed up roads and land<ref>Cowan J.NZ Wars.Vol 2. p 478.</ref> which incensed local farmers. Arrests followed but the activities persisted. Fears grew among settlers that the resistance campaign was a prelude to armed conflict.<ref>King, Michael (2003). ''The Penguin History of New Zealand''. Chapter 15.</ref> The government itself was puzzled as to why the land had been confiscated and offered a huge 25,000-acre reserve to the activists, provided they stopped the destruction.{{sfn|Riseborough|2002|pp=95,98,111}} Commissioners set up to investigate the issue said that the activities "could fairly be called hostile".{{sfn|Riseborough|2002|pp=95,98,111}} A power struggle ensued resulting in the arrest of all the prominent leaders by a large government force in 1881. Historian Hazel Riseborough describes the event as a conflict over who had authority or [[mana]]—the Government or the Parihaka protestors.{{sfn|Riseborough|2002|p=212}}

In 1882 the export of meat in the first refrigerated ship started a period of sustained economic export-led growth. This period is notable for the influence of new social ideas and movements such as the [[Fabians]] and the creation in 1890 of the first political party, the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberals]]. Their leader, former gold miner [[Richard Seddon]] from Lancashire, was Premier from 1893 to 1906. The Liberals introduced new taxes to break the influence of the wealthy conservative sheep farm owners. They also purchased more land from Māori.<ref>{{DNZB|last=Hamer |first=David |id=2s11 |title= Seddon, Richard John |accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> (By 1910, Māori in parts of the North Island retained very little land, and the amount of Māori land would decrease precipitously as a result of government purchases.<ref>{{cite web |title = Maori land loss, 1860-2000 |url = https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/interactive/maori-land-1860-2000 |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher = New Zealand History Online |access-date=17 July 2020}} Map adapted from Appendix four of [[Claudia Orange]] (2004), ''Illustrated History of the Treaty of Waitangi''.</ref>)

The early 20th century saw the rise of the [[trade union movement]] and labour parties {{Crossreference|(see {{section link|Socialism in New Zealand|Unions and workers' parties}})}}, which represented organised workers. The [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] town of [[Blackball, New Zealand|Blackball]] is often regarded as the birthplace of the labour movement in New Zealand,<ref>{{cite web|title=Returning to Labour's Roots|url=http://www.labour.org.nz/returning_to_labours_roots|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|access-date=19 June 2017|language=en|date=18 April 2016|archive-url=http://www.labour.org.nz/returning_to_labours_roots|archive-date=17 June 2016}}</ref>  as it was the location of the founding of one of the main political organisations which became part of the New Zealand Labour Party.

=== Māori politics and legislation ===
{{Main|Māori politics}}

Māori political affairs have been developing through legislation<ref name="Taonga">{{cite encyclopedia |url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/te-ture-maori-and-legislation/page-5 |title = Te ture – Māori and legislation |language = en-NZ |access-date = 2018-05-28 |encyclopedia = Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand }}</ref> such as the [[Resource Management Act 1991]] and the [[Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993]] and many more.<ref name="Taonga" /> Since colonisation in the 1800s, Māori have had their customary laws oppressed, with the imposition of a Westminster democracy and political style. As reparations from the colonial war and general discrepancies during colonisation, the New Zealand Government has formally apologised to those ''[[iwi]]'' affected, through settlements and legislation. In the 1960s Māori Politics Relations began to exhibit more positivity. The legislature enacted a law to help Māori retrieve back their land, not hinder them, through the Māori Affairs Amendment Act 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-HilMaor-t1-body-d7-d4.html |title = The Maori Affairs Amendment Act {{!}} NZETC |website = nzetc.victoria.ac.nz |access-date = 2018-05-28 }}</ref> Since then, this progressive change in attitude has materialised as legislation to protect the natural environment or Taonga, and the courts by establishing treaty principles that always have to be considered when deciding laws in the courts.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/treaty-timeline/treaty-events-1950 |title = Treaty events since 1950 – Treaty timeline |website = New Zealand History Online |language = en-NZ |access-date = 2018-05-28 }}</ref> Moreover, the Māori Lands Act 2016 was printed both in [[te reo Māori]] and English—the act itself affirms the equal legal status of te reo Māori.

{{New Zealand postwar governments timeline}}
The right-leaning [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] and the left-leaning [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] have dominated New Zealand political life since a Labour government came to power in 1935. During fourteen years in office (1935–1949), the Labour Party implemented a broad array of social and economic legislation, including comprehensive [[social security]], a large scale [[public works]] programme, a forty-hour working week, and compulsory [[Trade union|union]]ism.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McLintock |first1=A.

Except for two brief periods of Labour governments in 1957–1960 and 1972–1975, National held power until 1984.<ref name="Aimer2"/>

The greatest challenge to the first and later Labour governments' policies on the welfare state and a regulated economy that combined state and private enterprise came from the Labour Party itself. After regaining control in 1984, the fourth Labour government instituted a series of radical [[free market|market]]-oriented reforms. It privatised state assets and reduced the role of the state in the economy.<ref name=Aimer4>{{cite web |last=Aimer |first=Peter |title=Labour Party - Fourth, fifth and sixth Labour governments |url = https://teara.govt.nz/en/labour-party/page-4 |access-date=18 August 2019 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> It also instituted a number of other more left-wing reforms, such as allowing the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] to hear claims of breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi to be made back to 1840.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Derby |first1=Mark |title=Waitangi Tribunal – Te Rōpū Whakamana - Developing the tribunal, 1980s |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/waitangi-tribunal-te-ropu-whakamana/page-2 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=18 August 2019 |language=en |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> In 1987, the government introduced the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act]], banning visits by nuclear powered ships; the implementation of a [[New Zealand nuclear-free zone|nuclear-free zone]] brought about New Zealand's suspension from the [[ANZUS]] [[Military alliance|security alliance]] with the [[United States]] and [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Ayson |first1=Robert |last2=Phillips |first2=Jock |title=United States and New Zealand - Nuclear-free 1980s |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/united-states-and-new-zealand/page-3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=17 August 2019 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

In October 1990, the National Party again formed a government, for the first of three three-year terms. The new National government largely advanced the free-market reforms of the preceding government. In 1996, New Zealand inaugurated the [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|new electoral system]] (MMP) to [[Electoral system of New Zealand|elect its Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand's Change to MMP |url=http://aceproject.org/main/english/ei/eiy_nz01.htm |website=aceproject.org |publisher=ACE Electoral Knowledge Network |access-date=24 June 2017 |language=en}}</ref> The system was expected (among numerous other goals) to increase representation of smaller parties in Parliament and appears to have done so in the MMP elections to date. Between 1996 and 2020, neither National nor Labour had an absolute majority in Parliament, and for all but two of those years a minority government ruled (however, every government has been led by one or other of the two main parties).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Roberts |first1=Nigel S. |title=Electoral systems - MMP in practice |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/electoral-systems/page-6 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=18 August 2019 |date=17 February 2015}}</ref>

MMP parliaments have been markedly more diverse, with greater representation of women, [[ethnic minorities]] and other minority groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barker |first1=Fiona |last2=Coffé |first2=Hilde |title=Representing Diversity in Mixed Electoral Systems: The Case of New Zealand |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |date=1 July 2018 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=603–632 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsx073 |url=https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/3/603/4781509 |access-date=8 May 2020 |language=en |issn=0031-2290}}</ref> In 1996, [[Tim Barnett (politician)|Tim Barnett]] was the first of several New Zealand MPs to be elected as an openly gay person.<ref>{{cite web |title=I used to be the only gay in the House - Barnett |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/645363/I-used-to-be-the-only-gay-in-the-House-Barnett |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=8 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In 1999, [[Georgina Beyer]] became the world's first openly transgender MP.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Mitchell |first1=Mark |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |title=Carmen and Georgina Beyer |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28886/carmen-and-georgina-beyer |language=en}}</ref>

After nine years in office, the National Party lost the [[1999 New Zealand general election|November 1999 election]]. Labour under [[Helen Clark]] out-polled National, and formed a coalition government with the left-wing [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]]. The coalition partners pioneered "agree to disagree" procedures to manage policy differences.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Palmer |first1=Matthew |title=Constitution - Constitutional change |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/35909/helen-clark-and-jim-anderton-with-their-coalition-agreement-1999 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=18 August 2019 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The minority government often relied on support from the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] to pass legislation. Labour retained power in the 27 July 2002 [[2002 New Zealand general election|election]], forming a coalition with [[Jim Anderton]]'s new party, the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Party]], and reaching an agreement for support with the [[United Future]] party. Helen Clark remained Prime Minister. In early 2004, Labour came under attack for its policies on the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|ownership of the foreshore and seabed]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Barker|first1=Fiona|title=Debate about the foreshore and seabed|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/video/34605/debate-about-the-foreshore-and-seabed|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=22 November 2019|date=June 2012}}</ref> eventually culminating in the establishment of a new break-away party, the [[Māori Party]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dunne|first1=Peter|title=What to do about that foreshore and seabed?|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/3236512/What-to-do-about-that-foreshore-and-seabed|accessdate=22 November 2019|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|date=18 January 2010|language=en}}</ref> Following the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]] on 17 September 2005, negotiations between parties culminated in Helen Clark announcing a third consecutive term of Labour-led government. The Labour Party again formed a coalition with Jim Anderton's [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Party]], with confidence and supply from [[Winston Peters]]' [[New Zealand First]] and [[Peter Dunne]]'s United Future.<ref>{{cite work |last = Hicks |first = Bruce M. |title = New Zealand: Learning How to Govern in Coalition or Minority |url = http://revparl.ca/36/4/36n4e_13_Hicks.pdf |work=[[Canadian Parliamentary Review]] |page = 35 |year=2013 }}</ref>

After the [[2008 New Zealand general election|general election in November 2008]], the National Party moved quickly to form a minority government with [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], the Māori Party and United Future. This arrangement allowed National to decrease its reliance on the right-leaning ACT party, whose policies are sometimes controversial with the greater New Zealand public. In 2008, [[John Key]] became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], with [[Bill English]] his deputy. This arrangement conformed to a tradition of having a north-south split in the major parties' leadership, as Key's residence is in Auckland and English's electorate is in the South Island. On 12 December 2016, English [[2016 New Zealand National Party leadership election|was elected]] as leader, and thus Prime Minister, by the National Party caucus after Key's unexpected resignation a week earlier. [[Paula Bennett]] (member for [[Upper Harbour (New Zealand electorate)|Upper Harbour]]) was elected [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], thus continuing the tradition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/world/bill-english-is-nzs-new-prime-minister-paula-bennett-new-deputy-20161211-gt8wmf.html|title=Bill English is NZ's new Prime Minister, Paula Bennett new Deputy|date=12 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref> However this north–south arrangement ceased with the next government.

Following the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]] National retained its [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] in the House of Representatives, while Labour greatly increased its proportion of the vote and number of seats. In a first under the MMP system, Labour formed a minority government after securing a coalition arrangement with New Zealand First. [[Jacinda Ardern]], Labour leader, became Prime Minister, with Winston Peters becoming Deputy Prime Minister. The Labour government also agreed a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Green Party.<ref name="Phipps" />

In the [[2020 New Zealand general election]] Labour gained an absolute majority of seats in Parliament, sufficient to govern alone – a first under the MMP system.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Zealand election: Jacinda Ardern's Labour Party scores landslide win |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54519628 |access-date=19 October 2020 |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2020}}</ref> Labour's coalition partner New Zealand First lost its representation in Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=David |last2=Jones |first2=Nicholas |title=Election results 2020: Winston Peters concedes defeat - 'wait and see' for his next move |url = https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/election-results-2020-winston-peters-concedes-defeat-wait-and-see-for-his-next-move/VYWEU62LJV3TKUEFHKER5GMEME/#:~:text=New%20Zealand%20First%20is%20out%20of%20Parliament%20-,volunteers%20and%20NZ%20First%20staff%20around%20New%20Zealand. |access-date=1 November 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=17 October 2020 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>
