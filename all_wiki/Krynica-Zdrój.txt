==History and economy==
Krynica was first recorded in official documents in 1547 and became a town in 1889. Due to its convenient location, infrastructure and rail connections with major cities in Europe, Krynica-Zdrój (Zdrój means mineral spring in Polish) was the location of winter sports tournaments during the [[Polish Second Republic|interwar period]], including the [[1931 World Ice Hockey Championships]], the 1958 and 1962 [[FIL World Luge Championships]], the 1935 [[FIL European Luge Championships]] and the 2004 [[Euro Ice Hockey Challenge]] played in the town.

A [[gondola lift]] built in 1997 on the [[Jaworzyna Krynicka]] mountain overlooking Krynica, and subsequent investment in modern skiing facilities (apart from the [[List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks|former track of bobsleigh]]) made Krynica one of the most important ski resorts in Poland. Nearby [[Beskids|Beskid Sądecki]] mountains are also a perfect setting for recreational cross-country skiing in winter and mountain-biking in summer.

The winter sport of [[bandy]] returned to Poland ine the [[2010s]], after many decades. When the country made their first international appearance in 2006 at the World Championships for boys U15 in [[Edsbyn]], Krynica-Zdrój contributed with most players.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171229112257/http://www.bandyvm.se/eng2/read.asp?NewsID=69 Bandy World Championships 2006: Poland roster.] Homepage.</ref>

Krynica was home to [[Nikifor]] (birth name Epifaniusz Drowniak), a famous [[Naïve art|naïve]] painter in [[People's Republic of Poland|communist Poland]].
