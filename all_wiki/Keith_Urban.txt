'''Keith Lionel Urban''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 26 October 1967)<ref>https://polishgreatness.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-polish-diaspora-part-3-famous.html</ref> is an Australian singer, songwriter and record producer. In 1991, he released a [[Keith Urban (1991 album)|self-titled debut album]], charting four singles in Australia before moving to the United States the following year. He found work as a [[Session musician|session guitarist]] before starting a band known as [[The Ranch (band)|The Ranch]], which recorded [[The Ranch (album)|one studio album]] on [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]] and charted two singles on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart.

Still signed to Capitol, Urban made his solo American debut in 1999 with a [[Keith Urban (1999 album)|second eponymous album]]. Certified platinum in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], it produced his first number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart with "[[But for the Grace of God (song)|But for the Grace of God]]". "[[Somebody Like You]]", the first single from his second Capitol album ''[[Golden Road (album)|Golden Road]]'' (2002), was named by ''Billboard'' as the biggest country hit of the 2000s decade. The album's fourth single, "[[You'll Think of Me]]", featuring his nephew and Australian country artist Rory Gilliatte, earned him his first Grammy Award. 2004's ''[[Be Here]]'', his third American album, produced three more number-one singles in "[[Days Go By (Keith Urban song)|Days Go By]]", "[[Making Memories of Us]]" and "[[Better Life]]", and became his highest-selling album, being certified 4× Platinum. ''[[Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing]]'' was released in 2006, containing "[[Once in a Lifetime (Keith Urban song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" as well as his second Grammy Award-winning song, "[[Stupid Boy]]". A greatest hits package titled ''[[Greatest Hits: 18 Kids]]'' followed in late 2007. ''[[Defying Gravity (Keith Urban album)|Defying Gravity]]'' and ''[[Get Closer (Keith Urban album)|Get Closer]]'' were released on 31 March 2009 and 16 November 2010, respectively. In September 2013, he released the album ''[[Fuse (Keith Urban album)|Fuse]]'', which produced four more number ones on the [[Country Airplay]] chart, two of which are duets—one with [[Miranda Lambert]] and the other with [[Eric Church]]. "[[John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16]]" was released in June 2015<ref name="Release date">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2015/06/keith-urban-to-debut-single-from-next-album/|title=Keith Urban To Debut Single From Next Album|last=Hollabaugh|first=Lorie|date=8 June 2015|work=[[MusicRow]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref> as the lead single of his eighth American studio album, ''[[Ripcord (album)|Ripcord]]''. The album later produced the Country Airplay chart number-one hits "[[Break on Me]]", "[[Wasted Time (Keith Urban song)|Wasted Time]]", and "[[Blue Ain't Your Color]]", with the latter also becoming Urban's longest reigning number one on the Hot Country Songs chart, spending 12 weeks atop the chart. His tenth album, ''[[Graffiti U]]'', was released in 2018 and includes the Top 10 hit "[[Coming Home (Keith Urban song)|Coming Home]]". His eleventh album ''[[The Speed of Now Part 1]]'' was released in 2020 and includes the global hit "[[One Too Many (song)|One Too Many]]" with [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], in addition to Country Airplay top ten hits "[[We Were]]" and "[[God Whispered Your Name]]".

Urban has released a total of eleven studio albums (one of which was released only in Australia), as well as one album with The Ranch. He has charted 37 singles on the US [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, 18 of which went to number one, counting a duet with [[Brad Paisley]] ("[[Start a Band]]") and the 2008 single "[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]", which he previously recorded on ''Golden Road''. Those also include his third Grammy Award-winning single "[[Sweet Thing (Keith Urban song)|Sweet Thing]]" from his album ''Defying Gravity''.

Urban is also known for his roles as a coach on the Australian version of the singing competition ''[[The Voice (Australia)|The Voice]]'' and as a judge on ''[[American Idol]]''. In October 2013, Urban introduced his own signature line of guitars and accessories.

In May 2020, Keith Urban hosted a drive-in concert for medical workers. His latest gig was mostly just him and two other musicians playing on a flatbed truck in front of about 125 cars. Urban played at the Stardust Drive-In movie theatre, about 60&nbsp;km east of Nashville, Tennessee, for a crowd of more than 200 medical workers from Vanderbilt Health.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|website=NZherald.co.uk|title=Entertainment, Covid 19 coronavirus|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12332363|access-date=}}</ref>

===1999–2001: ''Keith Urban''===
Urban released his [[Keith Urban (1999 album)|self-titled American debut album]] in 1999 under the production of session pianist [[Matt Rollings]]. It was led by the number 18 single "[[It's a Love Thing]]", followed by the number four single "[[Your Everything]]", which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10 on the US country charts.<ref>Mark Price, "Carolina Country Music," ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'', 13 August 2000.</ref> Its follow-up, "[[But for the Grace of God (song)|But for the Grace of God]]", written by [[Charlotte Caffey]] and [[Jane Wiedlin]] of [[The Go-Gos]], became his first number 1 hit on the charts.

He won the Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards and the 2001 [[Country Music Association]]'s Horizon Award. [[Allmusic]]'s Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track "Rollercoaster", saying that Urban was "flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with." He thought that those songs "balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/keith-urban-mw0000252646|title=''Keith Urban'' review| last=Jurek| first=Thom| work=Allmusic| accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

"[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]" was originally intended to be the fifth single from this album.<ref name="shirt">{{cite web| url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1598587/keith-urban-and-songwriters-celebrate-their-latest-no-1-single.jhtml| title=Keith Urban and Songwriters Celebrate Their Latest No. 1 Single| last=Seif| first=Whitney| date=4 November 2008| work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]| accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> Instead, Capitol chose to release "[[Days Go By (Keith Urban song)|Days Go By]]", the lead-off to his third American album ''[[Be Here]]''. By late 2004, this song became Urban's fifth number one hit on the country chart. Although it was not officially released, "You Look Good in My Shirt" spent one week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004<ref name="Whitburn urban">Whitburn, p. 437</ref> and remained a fan favourite.<ref name="shirt"/> The next single from this album was the #2 "[[You're My Better Half]]", followed by the five-week number 1 "[[Making Memories of Us]]", which was written by [[Rodney Crowell]] and previously recorded by both [[Tracy Byrd]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-truth-about-men-mw0000446749| title=''The Truth About Men'' review| last=Erlewine| first=Stephen Thomas| work=Allmusic| accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> and Crowell's side project [[The Notorious Cherry Bombs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-notorious-cherry-bombs-mw0000208622|title=''The Notorious Cherry Bombs'' review| last=Jurek| first=Thom| work=Allmusic| accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> The next singles from this album were "[[Better Life]]" and "[[Tonight I Wanna Cry]]".

After this song, "Live to Love Another Day" spent 14 weeks on the country chart, reaching a peak of number 48, although it was never officially released as a single.<ref name="Whitburn urban"/>

===2006–2008: ''Love, Pain, & The Whole Crazy Thing'' and ''Greatest Hits: 18 Kids''===
[[File:Keith Urban in PoAH.JPG|alt=|thumb|Urban performs in 2007]]
On 21 August 2006, Urban's "[[Once in a Lifetime (Keith Urban song)|Once in a Lifetime]]" debuted at No.&nbsp;17, setting what was then a new record for the highest-debuting country single in the 62-year history of the Hot Country Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=198| title=Keith Urban makes history| date=21 August 2006| work=[[Country Standard Time]]| accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> Despite the high debut, the song peaked at number 6.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> Following it was "[[Stupid Boy]]", which was co-written by [[Sarah Buxton]], went to number 3, and won him his second Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2007.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> The album's next two singles, "[[I Told You So (Keith Urban song)|I Told You So]]" and "[[Everybody (Keith Urban song)|Everybody]]", respectively peaked at numbers two and five.<ref name="allmusic charts"/> Urban released his first greatest hits collection ''[[Greatest Hits: 18 Kids]]'' on 20 November 2007. This compilation contains all of his Top 10 hits, along with two new songs, "Got It Right This Time (The Celebration) and a cover of [[Steve Forbert]]'s "Romeo's Tune"."

In January 2008, Urban embarked on the "Love, Pain and the Whole Crazy Carnival Ride World Tour" with fellow country singer [[Carrie Underwood]]. In early May 2008, Urban debuted a new song at the Grand Ole Opry titled "A New Sunshine". That same month, Urban recorded a new version of "[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]" and released it as a single in June of that year. "Over the years it ("You Look Good In My Shirt") has always played like a hit song," Urban said. "That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song." The single was a precursor to the "Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour" concert DVD release in the fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for [[Brad Paisley]]'s single "[[Start a Band]]," on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar. This song was included on Paisley's album ''[[Play (Brad Paisley album)|Play]]'' and it went to No. 1 in January 2009.

===2008–2010: ''Defying Gravity''===
Urban announced that the lead single for his fifth studio album would be titled "[[Sweet Thing (Keith Urban song)|Sweet Thing]]". This song became his 10th number one hit. Capitol Records released the album, ''[[Defying Gravity (Keith Urban album)|Defying Gravity]]'', on 31 March 2009. The second single, "[[Kiss a Girl]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sessions.aol.ca/video/kiss-a-girl/keith-urban/696/ |title=Keith Urban AOL Sessions Performance |publisher=Sessions.aol.ca |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> was released in March 2009. Urban performed this song on [[American Idol]], during the [[American Idol (season 8)|season 8]] finale, as a duet with eventual winner [[Kris Allen]]. "[[Only You Can Love Me This Way]]", the third single, went to number one. The fourth single, "[['Til Summer Comes Around]]", went to number three. The fifth and final single "[[I'm In]]" is a cover of a song by Radney Foster, taken from the same album as "Raining on Sunday" was. This song was also recorded by [[The Kinleys]],<ref name="scoop"/> whose version had been a Top 40 single in 2000. Urban's rendition went to number two. Between the two, Urban also made a guest appearance on then-labelmate [[Emily West]]'s single "Blue Sky," which charted at number 38.

Urban's 2009 Escape Together tour, supporting the ''Defying Gravity'' album, featured many big-name opening acts, such as [[Taylor Swift]], [[Sugarland]], and [[Jason Aldean]]. On 27 June 2009, Urban filmed a video for the song, "Only You Can Love Me This Way", at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa.

In 2009, Urban was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.

Preston Brust and Chris Lucas, who constitute the [[LoCash Cowboys]], co-wrote "You Gonna Fly" with [[Jaren Johnston]], then-member of the group [[American Bang]]. After "You Gonna Fly" fell from the charts, Urban released "[[For You (Keith Urban song)|For You]]", which was featured as the theme song of the 2012 action film ''[[Act of Valor]]'' and appeared on the film's [[Act of Valor: The Album|soundtrack]]. The song peaked at number six on the country charts.

On 10 April 2012, Urban was invited to be a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] by [[Vince Gill]] at the third annual [[We're All for the Hall]] benefit concert which Urban organized. He was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on 21 April 2012.<ref>{{cite web| last=Wyland |first=Sarah|title=Keith Urban Inducted Into the Grand Ole Opry|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2012/04/21/keith-urban-inducted-into-the-grand-ole-opry/|publisher=GACTV.com|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>

Urban plays guitar on [[Tim McGraw]]'s early-2013 single "[[Highway Don't Care]]", which also features a guest vocal from [[Taylor Swift]]. This song is the third single from McGraw's album ''[[Two Lanes of Freedom]]''.

[[File:2013 Golden Globe Awards (8378775681).jpg|thumb|left|Urban with his wife [[Nicole Kidman]] at the [[2013 Golden Globes|70th Golden Globe Awards]] in 2013]]

While living in Nashville, Urban frequently used [[cocaine]].<ref>[http://www.usaweekend.com/01_issues/011104/011104urban.html "Up from Down Under"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Stephanie Mansfield, ''[[USA Weekend]]'', 8 November 2001</ref> After reaching a personal low point in 1998, he became determined to stop using the drug and checked into Cumberland Heights, a treatment centre in Nashville.

Urban met Australian actress [[Nicole Kidman]] at ''[[G'Day LA]]'', a Hollywood event promoting Australia, in January 2005, and they began dating six months later. They married on 25 June 2006 at the Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel in the grounds of [[St Patrick's Seminary|St Patrick's Estate]], [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], in Sydney.

On 19 October 2006, Urban checked into the [[Betty Ford Center]] in California. On 20 October, he issued a statement saying: "I deeply regret the hurt this has caused Nicole and the ones who love and support me. One can never let one's guard down on recovery, and I'm afraid that I have." On 18 January 2007, Urban announced his completion of rehab and his plans to go on tour to promote his album, ''[[Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6270247.stm |work=BBC News |title=Singer Urban ends rehab treatment | date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>

On 2 February 2007, Urban filed a lawsuit against a New Jersey painter by the same name, who has a website called KeithUrban.com. The singer wanted to acquire the rights to the URL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3if477e99d5c9afc6cb34884b6b1867e96 |title=Keith Urban sues Keith Urban over web site |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> The painter counter-sued.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070405/ENTERTAINMENT06/70405027|title=Keel, Beverly, "Keith Urban countersues Keith Urban"|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|accessdate=19 September 2020}}</ref> The lawsuit was settled in the painter's favour.

On 1 October 2007, Urban skidded off his motorbike when a [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]] followed him near his home in Sydney. He was not hurt. In a statement released by his publicists, Urban said that the incident was "the result of one person's desire to do his job and my desire to maintain my privacy". Urban said that he tried to avoid an oncoming car and dropped his bike. He said the photographer came to his assistance without taking photos.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

On 7 January 2008, Kidman said she and Urban were expecting their first child together. Kidman's publicist said, "the couple are thrilled and cannot wait". Kidman gave birth to a daughter in 2008 in Nashville, Tennessee. On his website, Urban said:

<blockquote>
"Earlier this morning Nic gave birth to our beautiful baby girl, Sunday Rose Kidman Urban. We want to thank everybody that has kept us in their thoughts and prayers. We feel very, very blessed and grateful that we can share this joy with all of my loving fans today."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.keithurban.net/content/news_article.php?em1934=191697_-1__0_~0_-1_7_2008_0_0&content=news&em1975=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310163722/http://www.keithurban.net/content/news_article.php?em1934=191697_-1__0_~0_-1_7_2008_0_0&content=news&em1975=|url-status=dead|title=Keith Urban.net &#124; Keith Welcomes Sunday Rose Kidman Urban!|archivedate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7497137.stm |work=BBC News |title=Kidman's baby name mystery solved |date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>
