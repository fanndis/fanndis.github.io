'''BBC Studios''' is a British television and radio production and distribution company. It is a commercial arm of the [[BBC]], bringing together the majority of [[BBC Television]]'s former in-house production departments; Comedy, Drama (both combined as Scripted in the new division), Entertainment, Music & Events, and Factual.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/bbc-studios-takes-shape/5098564.article|title=BBC Studios takes shape|work=[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]|first=Hannah|last=Gannagé-Stewart|date=7 January 2016}}</ref> 

[[BBC News]] and [[BBC Radio]] remain separate internal production divisions in the BBC (although BBC Radio Comedy is part of BBC Studios), and the rest of the former BBC Television division (channels and genre commissioning, as well as [[BBC Sport]], [[CBBC]], [[CBeebies]], [[BBC Three (online)|BBC Three]] and [[BBC iPlayer]]) now form the BBC Content division.

The division was formed in 2016 with an intent to make it a for-profit entity in the future, which would allow it to produce programming for other broadcasters to supplement the income received through the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|licence fee]]. In exchange, the BBC agreed to place production of much of its non-news programmes [[Request for tender|to tender]], allowing third-party independents to compete with BBC Studios on bids to produce them.

The formal establishment of BBC Studios as a commercial entity occurred in April 2017. In April 2018, BBC Studios subsumed the BBC's existing international distribution arm [[BBC Worldwide]], to make it both a distributor and producer of programmes in line with other major multinational studio conglomerates.

==History==
BBC Studios Ltd. as a production company was first registered on 27 February 2015.<ref name="BBCStudiosProdsLtd" /> In September 2015, the BBC's general director [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Tony Hall]] announced a proposal to split the BBC's in-house production units for non-news television programming into a separate BBC Studios division, which would eventually, with [[BBC Trust]] approval as part of the next revision to the BBC's charter, be spun-out as a for-profit subsidiary of the BBC. This proposal would allow the BBC's units to produce programmes for other broadcasters and digital outlets (which could be done in conjunction with its international distribution arm [[BBC Worldwide]]) in addition to the BBC's publicly funded properties. As a for-profit company, BBC Studios would be allowed to pay higher wages to its executives and talent, and no longer face scrutiny over them as it did as a public entity.<ref name="guardian-forprofitproposal">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/16/biggest-shakeup-to-bbc-consultation-hit-shows-moved-to-private-sector|title=Biggest shakeup ever to BBC could see hit shows moved to private sector|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date=16 September 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 November 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The proposal was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as being "one of the biggest changes to the BBC in its 93-year history".<ref name="Conlan">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/13/bbc-studios-cut-staff-songs-of-praise-holby|title=BBC Studios to cut 300 staff as hit shows move to private sector|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date=13 October 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=30 November 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The proposal attracted criticism from independent studios, who felt that it would result in the formation of a "super-indie" that would unduly benefit from "guaranteed" programme commissions from the BBC. As part of the split, the BBC planned to [[Request for tender|tender]] its programmes, so that independent producers and BBC Studios could bid for the rights to produce its non-news programming, outside of top shows assigned to BBC Studios.<ref name="guardian-forprofitproposal"/> The re-organisation and formation of BBC Studios as a division of the BBC was completed in April 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/01/bbc-studios-talent-tony-hall-departures|title=BBC Studios: a win for talent or an own goal?|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Tara|last=Conlan|date=2 May 2016}}</ref> In September 2016, the BBC announced that it would tender its non-news programmes over the next 11 years, beginning with programmes such as ''[[A Question of Sport]]'', ''[[Holby City]]'' and ''[[Songs of Praise]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/17/bbc-independent-producers-great-british-bake-off|title=BBC woos independent producers after loss of Great British Bake Off|last=Conlan|first=Tara|date=17 September 2016|work=The Observer|access-date=29 November 2017|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37419090|title=Holby City among BBC shows out to tender|date=20 September 2016|work=BBC News|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="rt-bbcstudios"/>

In October 2016, the BBC announced that it planned to lay off 300 employees from the division seen as redundant.<ref name="Conlan"/> In December 2016, BBC Studios announced that it had reached an agreement with [[Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television]] (PACT) in regards to the tendering plan, stating that it would tender at least 40% of the "in-house guarantee" within two years of approval of the transition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://realscreen.com/2015/12/21/bbc-pact-outline-policy-framework-for-bbc-studios/|title=BBC, Pact outline policy framework for Studios proposal|work=Realscreen|access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref> The [[BBC Trust]] subsequently approved the creation of BBC Studios as a commercial subsidiary, with the process expected to be completed in April 2017.<ref name="rt-bbcstudios">{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-21/bbc-to-begin-making-programmes-for-other-broadcasters/|title=BBC to begin making programmes for other broadcasters|work=Radio Times|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/12/20/bbc-studios-wins-go-ahead-commercial-production-push/|title=BBC Studios wins go-ahead for commercial production push|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Christopher|last=Williams|date=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://realscreen.com/2016/12/20/bbc-studios-approved-to-launch-comercially/|title=BBC Studios approved to launch commercially|work=Realscreen|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>

On 29 November 2017, the BBC announced that BBC Worldwide would be merged into BBC Studios effective 1 April 2018. The BBC stated that by handling both the production and sales of its programming within one unit, it would improve efficiency and be in line with the "global norms" of other major international media companies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/global/bbc-worldwide-bbc-studios-merge-single-operation-1202625590/|title=BBC Worldwide, BBC Studios to Merge into Single Operation|last=Chu|first=Henry|date=29 November 2017|work=Variety|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/bbc-merge-bbc-worldwide-bbc-studios-into-1-9bn-company-1202216337/|title=BBC To Merge BBC Worldwide & BBC Studios Into $1.9B Company|last=White|first=Peter|date=29 November 2017|work=Deadline|access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref> Technically, BBC Ventures Group Ltd.{{NoteTag|Originally registered as FFW 1987 Ltd. on 18 June 2002, renamed as BBC Ventures Group Ltd. on 15 August 2002.<ref name="BBCStudiosLtdHldg" />}} was renamed BBC Studios Group Ltd. on 3 April 2018, and then BBC Studios Ltd. 1 October 2018;<ref name="BBCStudiosLtdHldg" /> also in October, the production company established in 2015 was renamed BBC Studios Productions Ltd.,<ref name="BBCStudiosProdsLtd" /> and so did [[BBC Worldwide|BBC Worldwide Ltd.]], which was renamed BBC Studios Distribution Ltd.<ref>https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/01420028</ref>
