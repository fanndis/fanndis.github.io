'''Bernard <!--Please see: [[WP:QUOTENAME]] before placing "Bernie" here--> Sanders''' (born September{{nbsp}}8, 1941) is an American politician who has served as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States senator]]<!--lower case per MOS:JOBTITLE--> from [[Vermont]] since 2007 and as [[U.S. Representative]] for the state's [[Vermont's at-large congressional district|at-large congressional district]] from 1991 to 2007. He is the longest-serving [[independent politician|independent]] in U.S. congressional history, although he has a close relationship with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], having [[Congressional caucus|caucused]] with [[House Democratic Caucus|House]] and [[Senate Democratic Caucus|Senate Democrats]] for most of his congressional career.<ref name="wapo"/> Sanders unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for [[president of the United States]] in [[Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign|2016]] and [[Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign|2020]], finishing in second place in both campaigns.

An advocate of [[Social democracy|social democratic]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] policies, Sanders is known for his opposition to [[economic inequality]] and [[neoliberalism]]. On domestic policy, he supports [[Labour movement|labor rights]], [[Universal healthcare|universal]] and [[single-payer healthcare]], paid [[parental leave]], tuition-free [[tertiary education]], and an ambitious [[Green New Deal]] to create jobs addressing [[climate change]]. On foreign policy, he supports reducing [[United States military spending|military spending]], pursuing more [[diplomacy]] and [[international cooperation]], and putting greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements. Sanders describes himself as a [[democratic socialist]], supports [[workplace democracy]], and has praised elements of the [[Nordic model]]. Some commentators have described his politics as aligned with the [[New Deal]] policies of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[left-wing populism]]. Sanders has been credited with influencing a leftward shift in the Democratic Party since his 2016 presidential campaign.

Sanders was born into a working-class [[Jewish]] family and raised in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]]. He attended [[Brooklyn College]] before graduating from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1964. While a student, he was an active protest organizer for the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] as well as for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] during the [[civil rights movement]]. After settling in [[Vermont]] in 1968, he ran unsuccessful [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He became [[1981 Burlington mayoral election|elected]] [[List of mayors of Burlington, Vermont|mayor of Burlington]] in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in [[1990 United States House of Representatives election in Vermont|1990]], representing Vermont's at-large congressional district, later co-founding the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]]. He served as a U.S. Representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in [[2006 United States Senate election in Vermont|2006]]. Sanders was reelected to the Senate in [[2012 United States Senate election in Vermont|2012]] and [[2018 United States Senate election in Vermont|2018]].

Sanders was a major candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. Despite initially low expectations, his 2016 campaign generated significant grassroots enthusiasm and funding from small-dollar donors, carrying Sanders to victory against eventual nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] in 23 [[Democratic Party 2016 presidential primaries|primaries and caucuses]] before he conceded in July.<ref name="auto4">{{cite news|last=Gambino|first=Lauren|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/democrats-small-dollar-donors-essential-bernie-sanders|title='Not the billionaires': why small-dollar donors are Democrats' new powerhouse |date=March 10, 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=February 25, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 2020, Sanders's strong showing in early [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|primaries and caucuses]] briefly made him the [[front-runner]] in a historically large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]]. In April 2020, he conceded the nomination to [[Joe Biden]], who had won a series of decisive victories as the field narrowed. Sanders endorsed Clinton and Biden in their general election campaigns against [[Donald Trump]], while continuing his efforts to move the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction.<ref name=Ember-200408>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html|title=Bernie Sanders Is Dropping Out of 2020 Democratic Race for President|work=The New York Times|date=April 8, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|first=Sydney|last=Ember}}</ref><ref name=BizInsider2020-04-10/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1165631|title=Sanders' campaign raises over $2 million for coronavirus charities|last=Grumbach|first=Gary|agency=NBC News|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-endorsement.html|title=Bernie Sanders Endorses Joe Biden for President|last1=Ember|first1=Sydney|last2=Glueck|first2=Katie|date=April 13, 2020|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>

===Liberty Union campaigns===
Sanders began his electoral political career in 1971 as a member of the [[Liberty Union Party]], which originated in the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] movement and the [[People's Party (United States, 1971)|People's Party]].

The 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,317 votes for governor and the party.

==Mayor of Burlington, Vermont (1981–1989)==

===Campaigns===
Urged by his close friend and political confidant [[Richard Sugarman]], Sanders ran for mayor of [[Burlington, Vermont]], in 1980, at age 39.<ref name=":BeganRevolution">{{cite news|url=https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/26/sanders-begin-political-revolution/27991467/|title=Sanders: 'We begin a political revolution'|last1=Burbank|first1=April|last2=Donoghue|first2=Mike|date=May 26, 2015|newspaper=[[Burlington Free Press]]|language=en|access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref> He ran against incumbent Democratic mayor [[Gordon Paquette|Gordon "Gordie" Paquette]], a five-term mayor who had served as a member of the Burlington City Council for 13 years before that, building extensive community ties and a willingness to cooperate with Republican leaders in controlling appointments to various commissions. Republicans had found Paquette so unobjectionable that they failed to field a candidate in the March 1981 race against him, leaving Sanders as his principal opponent. Sanders's effort was further aided by [[Citizens Party (United States)|Citizens Party]] candidate Greg Guma's decision to exit the race so as not to split the progressive vote. Two other candidates in the race, independents Richard Bove and Joe McGrath, were non-factors in the campaign, with the battle coming down to Paquette and Sanders.<ref name="Guma">{{cite book|last = Guma|first = Greg|title = The People's Republic: Vermont and the Sanders Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttETPQAACAAJ |publisher = New England Press|date = 1989|location = South Burlington, Vermont|pages = 19–42|isbn = 9780933050785}}</ref>

Sanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders were elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as by a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The final result came as a shock to the local political establishment when Sanders won by just ten votes.<ref name = Guma/>

During his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as [[Corporatocracy|working primarily on behalf of the wealthy]]. In 1991, he co-founded the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], a group of mostly liberal Democrats that he chaired for its first eight years,<ref name="Shoah"/> while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.<ref name=":17">{{cite news|title=Is Bernie Sanders a Democrat?|url=https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/23/bernie-sanders-democrat/|accessdate=October 17, 2016|work= [[PolitiFact]] |first=Linda |last=Qiu |date=February 23, 2016 }}</ref>

In 2005, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Sanders the "amendment king" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control.

====Health care====
[[File:Don't Take Our Health Care Rally (35501942056).jpg|thumb|Don't Take Our Health Care rally in [[Columbus, Ohio]], June 2017]]
In mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the [[Affordable Care Act]] to fund $11 billion to [[community health centers]], especially those in [[Medical deserts in the United States|rural areas]].

In September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a [[single-payer healthcare]] plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill "Berniecare" and "the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes." He responded that the Republican Party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32 million Americans under the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kurtzleben|first1=Danielle|title=Here's What's In Bernie Sanders' 'Medicare For All' Bill |date=September 14, 2017 |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/09/14/550768280/heres-whats-in-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-bill |work=NPR |accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref>

====Income and wealth distribution====
[[File:Sanders Introduces $15 Minimum Wage.jpg|thumb|Sanders introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, April 2017]]

Sanders opposed the [[2018 United States federal budget]] proposed by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]], calling it "a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country… nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%."<ref>{{cite news |date=May 24, 2017 |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/24/opinions/trump-budget-is-immoral-sanders-opinion/ |title=Bernie Sanders: Trump's budget is immoral|last1=Sanders|first1=Bernie|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}</ref>

On September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with [[Ro Khanna]] to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop [[Jeff Bezos|BEZOS]]) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, relieving the burden on taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/5/17822810/bernie-sanders-bill-bezos-amazon-ro-khanna|title=Bernie Sanders's BEZOS bill takes aim at how Amazon pays workers|first=Emily|last=Stewart|publisher=Vox|date=September 5, 2018|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Santus |first=Rex |date=October 2, 2018 |title=Jeff Bezos just caved to activists and Bernie Sanders and raised Amazon's minimum wage to $15|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/yw4n7j/jeff-bezos-just-caved-to-activists-and-bernie-sanders-and-raised-amazons-minimum-wage-to-dollar15|work=Vice |location= |access-date=October 4, 2018|quote=What Mr. Bezos today has done is not only enormously important for Amazon's hundreds of thousands of employees.

===Committee assignments===
As an independent, Sanders worked out a deal with the Senate Democratic leadership in which he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic [[Assistant Majority Leader|whip]], [[Dick Durbin]], agreed that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013–14 he was chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs]] (during the [[Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014|Veterans Health Administration scandal]]).<ref name=vet>{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/15/bernie-sanders-veterans-affairs-griffin-dnt-ac.cnn |title=Bernie Sanders criticized for leadership in VA committee |work=[[Anderson Cooper 360°]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |first=Anderson |last=Cooper |date=October 15, 2015 |accessdate=December 18, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=hillcommittee>{{cite web |last=Needham |first=Vicki |date=December 12, 2014 |title=Senate Democrats lock in key committee memberships |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |url=https://thehill.com/policy/finance/227000-senate-democrats-set-key-committee-memberships |accessdate=July 19, 2015}}</ref>

Sanders became the [[Ranking member|ranking minority member]] on the [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Senate Budget Committee]] in January 2015; he had previously chaired the [[Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee]] for two years.

===Caucus memberships===
Sanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51–49 majority in the Senate during the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] in 2007–08. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] would likely have broken any [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|tie]] in favor of the Republicans.<ref name="Jones">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781568587141 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781568587141/page/27 27] |publisher=Nation Books |title=Rebuild the Dream |isbn=9781568587158 |date=April 3, 2012 }}</ref> He is a member of the following caucuses:

During the [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012 Democratic presidential primaries]], Sanders—dissatisfied with President Obama's "attempts to trade [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] cuts for tax hikes"—reportedly considered running against him in the primaries. Sanders had previously suggested in 2011 that it was "a good idea" for someone to challenge Obama, and "got so close to running a primary challenge… that Senator [[Harry Reid]] had to intervene to stop him."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Levitz |first1=Eric |title=Sanders Considered Primarying Obama in 2012: Report |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/bernie-sanders-primary-obama-2012-social-security.html |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> In November 2013, Sanders suggested that Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran.

Initially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|primaries and caucuses]] and around 46% of pledged delegates to [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for rejecting large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated [[Super PAC]].

The [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates.

===Polls and news coverage===
{{see also|Media coverage of Bernie Sanders}}

Some supporters raised concerns that publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The ''Times''s [[ombudsman]] reviewed her paper's coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that {{as of|2015|September|lc=y}} the ''Times'' "hasn't always taken it very seriously.

Given the high national profile that Sanders has maintained since his 2016 campaign, [[NPR]] described him as "no longer an underdog" when he announced his 2020 campaign.<ref>{{cite news |date=February 19, 2019 |first1=Scott |last1=Detrow |first2=Jessica |last2=Taylor |title=Bernie Sanders Enters 2020 Presidential Campaign, No Longer An Underdog |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/676923000/bernie-sanders-enters-2020-presidential-campaign-no-longer-an-underdog |website=NPR |accessdate=February 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220002744/https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/676923000/bernie-sanders-enters-2020-presidential-campaign-no-longer-an-underdog?t=1550576496363 |archive-date=February 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch.

===Fundraising===

Sanders's campaign has employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a [[Super PAC]] and relying predominantly on small-dollar contributions. According to [[Federal Election Commission]] filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money in the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races.<ref>{{cite web |title=2020 Presidential Race |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race |website=Open Secrets |accessdate=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Summary data for Bernie Sanders |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate?id=N00000528 |website=Open Secrets |accessdate=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Money |first1=Beatrice |last1=Jin |first2=Maggie |last2=Severns |date=October 15, 2019 |url=https://www.politico.com/2020-election/president/democratic-primary/candidates/fundraising-and-campaign-finance-tracker/ |website=Politico |accessdate=December 18, 2019 }}</ref> In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million donors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bernie Sanders has 1 million donors |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-has-one-million-donors/ |first=Cara |last=Korte |date=September 19, 2019 |website=CBS News |accessdate=September 21, 2019}}</ref> On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3 million in the year's third quarter, with an average donation of $18.

Online mentions "reflect a slightly more balanced picture," with both Sanders and [[Elizabeth Warren]] running "neck-and-neck" with Biden.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/08/22/ranking_the_2020_democratic_candidates_by_media_coverage.html |first=Kalev |last=Leetaru |title=Ranking the 2020 Democratic Candidates by Media Coverage|date=August 22, 2019|publisher=RealClearPolitics|access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref>

In December 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official DNC-sanctioned debates, set to begin in June 2019, with six in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020. During the July and September debates, commentators described Sanders and [[Elizabeth Warren]] as having a "non-aggression pact," staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more centrist candidates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49675275|title=Democratic debate: The winners and losers|date=September 13, 2019|publisher=BBC News|access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/heres-how-each-candidate-stood-out-during-the-debate|title=Here's How Each Candidate Stood Out During The Debate|date=September 12, 2019 |first1=John |last1=Light |first2=David |last2=Taintor|work=[[Talking Points Memo]] |access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref> In the October 15 debate, his first appearance since his heart attack, debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders's performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Todd |title=Debate coach: A star emerged from the Democratic debate |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/opinions/debate-coach-graham-democratic-debate/index.html |date=October 16, 2019 |website=CNN |accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>

[[CNN]] hosted the first 2020 debate in January with six candidates remaining. Co-moderator [[Abby Phillip]] questioned Sanders and Warren about an allegation Warren had made that he had privately told her that a woman could not defeat Donald Trump. Phillip asked Sanders, "Senator Sanders, CNN reported yesterday, and Senator Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?" Ignoring Sanders's strong denial, Phillip asked Warren, "What did you think when Bernie Sanders told you that a woman couldn't become president?" In an interview after the debate, Sanders called it ludicrous to believe that he would doubt a woman's ability to win the presidency and noted that a woman already ''had'' won, saying, "After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Derysh |first1=Igor |title=Elizabeth Warren: Bernie Sanders "disagreed" with me that a "woman could win" the presidency |url=https://www.salon.com/2020/01/14/warren-says-sanders-disagreed-that-a-woman-could-win-in-2020-bernie-denies-it/ |website=Salon |accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref>
