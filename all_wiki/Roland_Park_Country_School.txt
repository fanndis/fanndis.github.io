==History==
The neighborhood of Roland Park in Baltimore, MD, was established in 1891 by the Roland Park Company. A school was soon needed.<ref name="Eden Unger Bowditch 2001">Eden Unger Bowditch, ''Growing Up in Baltimore: A Photographic History'' (Arcadia Publishing, 2001), 56.</ref> Therefore, in 1894, the company established the Roland Park School and installed teachers Adelaide and Katherine Howard at 410 Notre Dame Avenue (now 4810 Keswick Road). The school opened there on September 25, 1894.<ref name="bcps-tan" /> The company hired “a high-quality staff” and turned the school into a “first-rate college preparatory institution.”<ref name="Eden Unger Bowditch 2001"/> It became the “first fully accredited independent school for girls in Baltimore.”<ref name="Judy Colbert 2010">Judy Colbert, ''Insiders’ Guide to Baltimore'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2010), 165.</ref>

*1905: the school was moved to its second location, 210 Roland Avenue (later renumbered 4608). It remained there until 1916.<ref name="bcps-tan" /> It was a girls’ school, but it admitted boys up to the fourth grade.<ref>Marsha Wight Wise, ''Baltimore Neighborhoods, Volume 4'' (Arcadia Publishing, 2009), 31.</ref> The principal, Bertha Chapman, instituted a college preparatory curriculum. The first graduating class was in 1907, a class of one.<ref name="rpcs-timeline" />
