==Sunday edition==
For many years, the Sunday Reading Eagle featured a banner on its [[Sunday comics]] section saying "Biggest Comics Section in the Land",<ref name="comic1">{{cite news | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LWMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MqIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1799,4125770 | title= Comics section | newspaper=Reading Eagle | date= July 9, 2006 | accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref> running over 50 features until the late 1980s, and occupying two sections until 1995. It carried [[half page (comic strip)|half pages]] of ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', ''[[HÃ¤gar the Horrible]]'', and ''[[Tarzan]]'', as well as smaller versions of ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[The Phantom]]'', and many popular humor strips. On July 8, 2018, however, if followed the path of most dwindling American newspapers, and reduced the size of its comics section and of the strips it carries.
