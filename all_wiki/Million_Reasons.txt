"'''Million Reasons'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] for her fifth studio album, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016). Initially released as a [[Promotional recording|promotional single]], it was released to radio stations on November 8, 2016, as the album's second single. The track was written by Gaga, [[Hillary Lindsey]] and [[Mark Ronson]], and produced by Ronson, Gaga and [[BloodPop]]. It grew organically from the conversations that Lindsey and Gaga were having one day, with the title phrase lifted from the singer's musings about the men in her life.

The track is a [[pop music|pop]] song with [[country music|country]] influences. It lyrically delves on "heartbreak and hope" during a relationship, as well as Gaga's religious faith during the chorus, ultimately making it a song with a positive message. Critics appreciated the track's simple production and lyrics. Commercially, "Million Reasons" reached the top 10 of the charts in Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland, the United States, and Venezuela as well as the top 20 in Canada, Italy, and Scotland. The track received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]] at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]].

An accompanying [[music video]] was directed by Ruth Hogben and Andrea Gelardin, and continues the story established in the video for her previous single, "[[Perfect Illusion]]". It shows Gaga singing in a white studio, and also her in a desert, breaking down before being rescued by her friends. In order to promote "Million Reasons", the singer performed it on her [[Dive Bar Tour (Lady Gaga)|Dive Bar Tour]] (2016), multiple television appearances, the [[Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016]], the [[Super Bowl LI halftime show]], the 2017 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], and the 60th Grammy Awards. It also served as the encore for the [[Joanne World Tour]] (2017–2018). Cover versions of the song were recorded by singer [[Kelsea Ballerini]], rock band [[Grateful Dead]]'s [[Bob Weir]] and [[Phish]]'s [[Trey Anastasio]].

It was released on December 14, 2016 on [[MTV]] followed by a worldwide release to [[Vevo]]. The video begins with the singer laying across the desert floor from the ending of "Perfect Illusion" during sunset, as black SUVs approach her from afar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/12/13/lady-gaga-teases-million-reasons-music-video|title=Lady Gaga teases 'Million Reasons' music video|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Nolfi|first=Joey|date=December 13, 2016|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214055022/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/12/13/lady-gaga-teases-million-reasons-music-video|archive-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Gaga's crew comes out of the SUVs and takes her to a video shoot where she prepares to sing "Million Reasons". As she starts getting ready, the singer notices a small box with a bow atop it on her desk. The video then intercuts to a number of flashbacks—Gaga singing in a white studio while playing the guitar, getting rescued by her friends from the desert and breaking down in tears. Finally Gaga opens the box which reveals the content to be a [[rosary]] with a note saying "Love you, sis".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7624561/lady-gaga-million-reasons-video|title=Lady Gaga Releases Emotional 'Million Reasons' Video: Watch|work=Billboard|last=Blake|first=Liza|date=December 13, 2016|accessdate=December 13, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215115250/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7624561/lady-gaga-million-reasons-video|archive-date=December 15, 2016}}</ref>

=== Reception and analysis ===
Ian David Monroe from ''[[V (American magazine)|V]]'' found the video to "stark contrast" with the one for "Perfect Illusion". He noticed that it did not portray a "traditional love narrative", rather focused on Gaga's own team. Monroe theorized that with the recent reveal by Gaga that she suffered from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) in an open letter, the continued theme between the videos made sense. Along with the essay, the videos portrayed Gaga being handled roughly in her early career, forced to tour through her hip pain (described by the dancing in "Perfect Illusion"), and finally in the "Million Reasons" clip, her team helps her in healing and crafting ''Joanne''.<ref name="vmag"/> Brian Joseph from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' found the video's portrayal of Gaga as "emotionally transparent" and added that the video was in line with the "emotionally vulnerable themes running throughout [''Joanne'']".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/12/lady-gaga-million-reasons-video/|title=Video: Lady Gaga&nbsp;– 'Million Reasons'|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|last=Joseph|first=Brian|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220145537/http://www.spin.com/2016/12/lady-gaga-million-reasons-video/|archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Julianne Shepherd from ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' compared Gaga's looks in the video to that of singer [[Stevie Nicks]], "with a filmic play on the rock-and-roll mythos, attaching imagery of everyday backstage tour preparation to a song of loneliness and isolation, life on the road forever breaking its practitioners."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themuse.jezebel.com/lady-gaga-is-back-and-sad-in-the-million-reasons-video-1790116892|title=Lady Gaga Is Back and Sad In the 'Million Reasons' Video|work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|last=Shepherd|first=Julianne|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216231932/http://themuse.jezebel.com/lady-gaga-is-back-and-sad-in-the-million-reasons-video-1790116892|archive-date=December 16, 2016}}</ref>
