A '''minister''' is a [[politician]] who heads a [[ministry (government department)|ministry]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/minister|title=Minister|work=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=17 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/es/diccionario/ingles/minister|title=Minister|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=17 June 2018}}</ref> making and implementing decisions on policies in conjunction with the other ministers. In some jurisdictions the [[head of government]] is also a minister and is designated the ’[[prime minister]]’, ‘premier’, ’chief minister’, ’chancellor’ or other title. 

In [[Commonwealth realm]] jurisdictions which use the [[Westminster system]] of government, ministers are usually required to be members of one of the houses of [[Parliament]] or [[legislature]], and are usually from the political party that controls a majority in the lower house of the legislature. In other jurisdictions — such as [[Belgium]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Philippines]], [[Slovenia]], [[Nigeria]] — the holder of a cabinet-level post or other government official is not permitted to be a member of the legislature. Depending on the administrative arrangements in each jurisdiction, ministers are usually heads of a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] and members of the government's ministry, [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and perhaps of a committee of cabinet. Some ministers may be more senior than others, and some may hold the title ’assistant minister’ or ‘deputy minister’. Some jurisdictions, with a large number of ministers, may designate ministers to be either in the inner or outer ministry or cabinet.

In some jurisdictions — such as [[Hong Kong]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] — holders of an equivalent cabinet-level post are called [[Secretary (title)|secretaries]] (e.g., the [[Home Secretary]] in the United Kingdom, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the United States). Some holders of a cabinet-level post may have another title, such as ’[[Attorney-General]]’ or ’[[Postmaster-General]]’.

The term ’minister’ also is used in diplomacy, for a diplomat of the [[Diplomatic rank|second class]], such as in the title [[Minister Plenipotentiary]], ranking between an [[Ambassador]] and a [[Minister Resident]].

The term minister comes from [[Middle English]], deriving from the [[Old French]] word ''ministre'', originally ''minister'' in [[Latin]], meaning "servant, attendant", which itself was derived from the word 'minus' meaning "less".<ref>The word [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/minister Minister] Definition, dictionary.com dictionaries</ref>{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
In jurisdictions that use the [[Westminster system]] of government — such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] — ministers or their equivalents are selected from the legislature, and usually from the political party that controls a majority in the lower house of the legislature. In jurisdictions with strict [[separation of powers]], ministers cannot be members of the legislature — such as [[Belgium]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Philippines]], [[United States]] — and a legislator chosen to become a minister must resign from the legislature. 

Normally the leader of the [[majority party]] becomes the [[prime minister]], or an office of equivalent function, and selects the other ministers. In the Westminster system, these ministers continue to represent their [[constituency]] in parliament while being part of the government. Often, a person from the outside may be appointed minister, usually in order to bring special skills to the government. Such a person would not have to be part of the parliament while serving as minister, nor would he/she necessarily be a member of the party/parties in government.

In the United Kingdom, a government minister does not have to be a member of either House of Parliament. In practice, however, convention is that ministers must be members of either the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or [[House of Lords]] in order to be accountable to Parliament. From time to time, Prime Ministers appoint non-parliamentarians as ministers. In recent years such ministers have been appointed to the House of Lords.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maer|first=Lucinda|date=2017-09-04|title=Ministers in the House of Lords|url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05226}}</ref>

Some ministers may hold multiple portfolios and lead several ministries simultaneously, while multiple ministers with separate portfolios may oversee a single ministry, or may also share both ministerial and deputy-ministerial portfolios in different ministries. A cabinet minister may not be in charge of any ministry, and is then known as a "[[minister without portfolio]]".
