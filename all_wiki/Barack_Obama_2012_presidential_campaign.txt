== Getting out the vote ==
[[File:20121106 Barack Obama making phone calls.jpg|thumb|right|Obama participating in a phone bank [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]]]

The Obama campaign was highly effective in getting out the vote, in using technology to identify voters, and in capitalizing on growing segments of the voting population.

"President Obama won reelection, not by going after independent voters, but by going after emerging groups in the U.S. population. By race, age and gender, voters made clear that America is made up of many parts, and the Obama team captured more of them, and delivered more of them to the polls."<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama Capitalizes On Emerging Voter Groups|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/11/07/164582496/obama-capitalizes-on-emerging-voter-groups|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=November 18, 2012 |author=Renee Montqgne|author2=Cokie Roberts|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref>
