'''Bridgeton''' ({{lang-sco|Brigtoun}}, {{lang-gd|Baile na Drochaid}}) is a district to the east of [[Glasgow]] city centre. [[Shires of Scotland|Historically]] part of [[Lanarkshire]], it is bounded by [[Glasgow Green]] to the west, [[Dalmarnock]] to the east and south, [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] to the north-west at Abercromby Street/London Road and [[Gallowgate, Glasgow|Gallowgate]] to the north-east.

==History==
[[File:Bridgeton Cross, at London Road and Dalmarnock Road; Station entrance to left - geograph.org.uk - 1900209.jpg|thumb|left|1974 image of Bridgeton Cross]]
It started as a small weaving village in 1705, when the third John Walkinshaw marked out a portion of his Goosefauld estate for rent.<ref>[https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA01013&t=2 Barrowfield House (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, 1844)], The Glasgow Story</ref> However, not much interest was shown until 1775 when [[Rutherglen Bridge]] was built over the [[River Clyde]] and the area became known as ''Bridge Town'' (or ''Brig Toun'' in Scots).<ref name=bbc>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/bridgeton/|title=Scotland's Landscape: Bridgeton|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref> A major employer was carpet manufacturer [[James Templeton & Co]]. Bridgeton used to be bounded by a village named Mile-End to the north, however this district seems to have vanished over the years, resulting in Bridgeton's boundary moving north to Crownpoint Road.

==Bridgeton Cross==
[[File:Bridgeton Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1079913.jpg|thumb|left|Bridgeton Cross with the Umbrella, former station building (background) and Olympia theatre (right) prior to renovation work.]]
Bridgeton Cross, also known as 'The Toll' is a major junction, the meeting point of London Road ([[A74 road|A74]] towards [[Celtic Park]]), Dalmarnock Road ([[A749 road|A749]]), Main Street, James Street (leading to Glasgow Green), Olympia Street and Orr Street. 

The intersection is notable for the "Brigton Umbrella", a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] (1875) cast iron [[bandstand]] covering the centre of the Cross.<ref name=bbc/><ref>[https://www.glasgowhistory.com/glasgows-crosses.html Glasgow’s Crosses], Glasgow History, 28 May 2016</ref> The landmark structure and surrounds was renovated in the early 21st century, resulting in improved public realm areas and the complete refurbishment of the Umbrella.

Bridgeton Cross is the location for [[Bridgeton railway station]] (opened in 1895, closed in 1964, reopened in 1979) which is on the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the area to central Glasgow. The [[listed building#Scotland|category B listed building]]<ref>{{Historic Environment Scotland|num=LB33853|desc=577-621 (odd nos) London Road, 2-4 (even nos) Kerr Street and 3-5 (odd nos) Orr Street, former Bridgeton Cross Station and Tenements|cat=B|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> which previously housed [[Bridgeton Central railway station]] (1892-1979) is a short distance away. A number of local buses also pass along London Road and Dalmarnock Road.

The Cross is also the location for the ''Olympia Theatre'' (built 1911), which after lying abandoned for many years has undergone rebuilding and reopened in 2012 as a library and community facility for the people of Bridgeton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympiaglasgow.org/history.html|title=The history of the Olympia|publisher=Olympia Glasgow|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308123926/http://olympiaglasgow.org/history.html#|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are several public houses in the vicinity, with most themed around [[Rangers F.C.]]

In 1893 William Millard started ''Millers Linoleum Stores'', renting sheds in Charles Street (now Olympia Street) from the [[North British Railway Company]]. On 26 June 1913 planning permission was granted to build a two-storey warehouse on this land, which had now been purchased by Millard. Under the directorship of William's great-grandson David Millard, the building was sympathetically renovated in 2013. Believed to be the only surviving family business from the 1800s in the area, ''Millers 1893'' continues to operate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowheritage.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bridgeton-exhibition-pdf.pdf|title=Learn from the past: Bridgeton Exhibition |publisher= Glasgow City Heritage Trust|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://millers1893.co.uk|title=Home page |publisher=Millers 1893|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

==Points of interest==
Bridgeton has one of Glasgow's original [[Carnegie library|Carnegie libraries]], deftly designed by the Invernessian architect, [[James Robert Rhind]]. Since 2014, the library has been in use by the Glasgow Women's Library, holding a lending library, archive and museum collection,  who have made significant renovations both inside and out. 

After the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] was held in Glasgow, Bridgeton now has international-class sporting facilities within walking distance: the [[Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome]] are located in nearby Dalmarnock, with the ''Crownpoint Sports Complex'', a modern outdoor athletics track, also located in the area adjacent to [[St Mungo's Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/sport/glasgow-club/crownpoint/pages/default.aspx|title=Glasgow Club Crownpoint Sports Complex|publisher=Glasgow Life|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

Bridgeton has been the centre of the [[Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland|Orange Order in Scotland]]. Their marches are a fairly common sight in Glasgow during the summer months but reach a peak around [[the Twelfth]] of July when the parades commemorating the [[Battle of the Boyne]] are in full flow.  In 2019, the ''Sunday Times'' reported that concerns over an incident during the 2018 Apprentice Boys of Derry (Bridgeton) march had led to suggestions that Glasgow council reroute the march to avoid passing near two Catholic churches.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2019-04-13/scotland/orange-easter-march-faces-glasgow-route-change-over-sectarian-fears-0zhzns59h|title=Orange Easter march faces Glasgow route change over sectarian fears|work=Times newspapers|author=Marc Horne|date=13 April 2019|access-date=14 April 2019|url-access=limited}}</ref>

The Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust, one of the largest voluntary commercial and passenger vehicle preservation groups in Scotland are based at Bridgeton Bus Garage which opened on 5 June 1965<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fiztpayne|first1=E.R.L.|title=Annual Report of Glasgow Corporation Transport 1965|date=1965|publisher=Glasgow Corporation Transport|location=Bath St Glasgow|page=12}}</ref> on a site bordered by London Road to the south, Fordneuk Street to the West, Broad Street to the north and Rimsdale Street to the east. It replaced the former tram depot at Dalmarnock which had suffered fire damage.

Bridgeton's use as a Glasgow Bus Garage was brief, the tendency was to use a smaller fleet of larger buses and that led to the garage being closed in 1976, however it was then taken on by [[Strathclyde Regional Council]] for its Internal Transport fleet, servicing everything from light vans to Gritting Lorries. In this capacity it later passed to [[Glasgow City Council]] who when they ceased using it for that purpose were prevailed upon to rent it out for vehicle preservation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust|title=Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust|url=http://www.gvvt.org}}</ref>

==Football==
For four decades in the mid-20th century, Bridgeton was represented in the [[Scottish Junior Football Association]] by [[Bridgeton Waverley F.C.]] Initially a local Juvenile team, upon joining the Junior setup they played at [[Shawfield Stadium]] (home of [[Clyde F.C.]]), then moved to ''Barrowfield Park''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britainfromabove.org.uk/en/image/SPW053585|title=General view of Bridgeton, Glasgow, facing south-west, 1937 (ground is in bottom centre)|publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|RCAHMS]] - Britain from Above|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://britainfromabove.org.uk/en/image/SPW042529|title=General view of Bridgeton, Glasgow, facing north-east, 1933 (ground is in upper right)|publisher=RCAHMS - Britain from Above|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> which was bought and demolished by [[Glasgow Corporation]] for the construction of the [[Barrowfield|housing scheme of the same name]] in the 1930s. Waverley then moved to ''New Barrowfield'' on the edge of the [[Parkhead]] district. After they folded in the 1960s, that site became the training ground of [[Celtic F.C.]]<ref name=parkhead>{{cite web |url=http://parkheadhistory.com/sport/junior-football/ |title=Junior Football|work=Parkhead History|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>

Another Junior club which became defunct around the same time, [[Strathclyde F.C.]], was also based in the area.<ref name=venues>{{cite web|url=http://parkheadhistory.com/sport/sporting-venues/ |title=Sporting Venues Around Parkhead|work=Parkhead History|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=view1>{{cite web|url=https://britainfromabove.org.uk/en/image/SAW045962|title=View around Belvidere Hospital, Glasgow, facing south-east, 1952 (showing three grounds: Parkhead left centre, Waverley mid centre, Strathclyde bottom centre)|publisher=[[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|RCAHMS]] - Britain from Above|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=view2>{{cite web|url=https://britainfromabove.org.uk/en/image/SAW045959|title=View around Belvidere Hospital, Glasgow, facing east, 1952 (showing three grounds: Parkhead upper centre, Waverley mid right, Strathclyde bottom left)|publisher=RCAHMS - Britain from Above|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref> Strathclyde's predecessor senior league club [[Thistle F.C.]] had their roots in Bridgeton/[[Dalmarnock]], as did the aforementioned Clyde and the 19th century side [[Eastern F.C.]] who both once played at another [[Barrowfield Park]].

Although Celtic's stadium is nearby and their origins also stem from the Bridgeton area, the district is known for a large and passionate Rangers following.<ref name="don">{{cite book|last=[[Willie Miller|Miller]]|first=Willie|title=Willie Miller – The Don|year=2013|publisher=[[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]]|isbn=9780857905505}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/petrol-bomb-pensioner-shows-old-gang-hatreds-die-hard-1-1072606|title=Petrol bomb pensioner shows old gang hatreds die hard|publisher=The Scotsman|date=6 January 2008|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>
