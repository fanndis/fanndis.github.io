==History==
{{Main|Germanic peoples|History of Norway|History of Scandinavia}}
Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European speaking]] [[Battle-Axe culture|Battle-Axe peoples]] migrated to Norway bringing [[Horse|domesticated horses]], [[agriculture]], [[cattle]] and [[wheel|wheel technology]] to the region.

During the [[Viking Age]], [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]] [[Unification of Norway|unified]] the [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[petty kingdom]]s after being victorious at the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]] in the 880s. Two centuries of [[Viking expansion]] tapered off following the decline of [[Norse paganism]] with [[Christianization of Scandinavia|the adoption of Christianity]] in the 11th century. During [[Black Death|The Black Death]], approximately 60% of the population died and in 1397 Norway entered a [[Denmark–Norway|union]] with [[Denmark]].

In 1814, following Denmark-Norway's defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway entered a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union]] with [[Sweden]] and adopted a [[Constitution of Norway|new constitution]]. [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|Rising nationalism]] throughout the 19th century led to a [[1905 Norwegian union dissolution referendum|1905 referendum]] granting [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|Norway independence]]. Although [[History of Norway#Norway in World War I|Norway remained officially neutral]] in [[World War I]], the country was [[The Neutral Ally|unofficially allied]] with the [[Entente powers]]. In [[World War II]] Norway proclaimed its neutrality, but was nonetheless [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied for five years]] by [[Nazi Germany]] (1940–45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of [[NATO]]. [[Energy in Norway|Discovery of oil and gas]] in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted [[Economy of Norway|Norway's economic fortunes]] but in referendums held in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]], Norway rejected joining the [[European Union|EU]]. Key domestic issues include [[Immigration to Norway|integration of a fast growing immigrant population]], maintaining the country's generous [[social safety net]] with an [[Ageing of Europe|aging population]], and preserving economic competitiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>

==Geographic distribution==
{{Main|Norwegian diaspora}}
As with many of the people from European countries, Norwegians are spread throughout the world. There are more than 100,000 Norwegian citizens living abroad permanently, mostly in the U.S. and other [[Scandinavian countries]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In the 8th century and onwards, Norwegian and Danish Vikings also settled in [[Normandy]], most famously those led by [[Rollo]], and thus began the tradition of the [[Normans]] (also meaning 'men from the north'), who expanded to [[England]], [[Sicily]], and other [[Mediterranean]] islands.

Apart from Britain and Ireland, Norwegian Vikings established settlements in largely uninhabited regions.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The first known permanent Norwegian settler in Iceland was [[Ingólfur Arnarson]]. In the year 874 he settled in [[Reykjavík]].

After his expulsion from Iceland [[Erik the Red]] discovered Greenland, a name he chose in hope of attracting Icelandic settlers.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Viking settlements were established in the sheltered fjords of the southern and western coast.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Erik's relative [[Leif Eriksson]] later discovered North America.

=== Netherlands ===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, many Norwegians emigrated to the Netherlands, particularly Amsterdam.<ref>Van Lottum, Jelle. Across the North Sea: The Impact of the Dutch Republic on International Labour Migration, c. 1550–1850. Vol. 1. Amsterdam University Press, 2007, pp. 73–77</ref> The Netherlands was the second most popular destination for Norwegian emigrants after Denmark.<ref>de Bles, Harry, and Erlend des Bouvrie. Dutch Light in the" Norwegian Night": Maritime Relations and Migration Across the North Sea in Early Modern Times. Uitgeverij Verloren, 2004, p. 8</ref>

Loosely estimated, some 10% of the population may have emigrated, in a period when the entire Norwegian population consisted of some 800,000 people.

The Norwegians left with the Dutch trade ships that when in Norway traded for timber, hides, herring and [[stockfish]] (dried codfish). Young women took employment as maids in Amsterdam. Young men took employment as sailors. Large parts of the Dutch merchant fleet and navy came to consist of Norwegians and Danes. They took Dutch names, so no trace of Norwegian names can be found in the Dutch population of today. One well-known illustration is that of Admiral Kruys. He was hired in Amsterdam by Peter I to develop the Russian navy, but was originally from [[Stavanger]], Norway (Kruys means "cross", and the Russian maritime flag is today also a blue cross on white background).

The emigration to the Netherlands was so devastating to the homelands that the Danish-Norwegian king issued penalties of death for emigration, but repeatedly had to issue amnesties for those willing to return, announced by posters in the streets of Amsterdam. Increasingly, Dutchmen who search their genealogical roots turn to Norway. Many Norwegians who emigrated to the Netherlands, and often were employed in the Dutch merchant fleet, emigrated further to the many Dutch colonies such as New Amsterdam (New York).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==== United States ====
{{Main|Norwegian American}}
Many Norwegians emigrated to the U.S. between the 1850s and the 1920s. Today, the descendants of these people are known as Norwegian Americans. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, three million Americans consider Norwegian to be their sole or primary ancestry. It is estimated that as many as a further 1.5 million more are of partial Norwegian ancestry.
Travelling to and through Canada and Canadian ports were of choice for Norwegian settlers immigrating to the United States. In 1850, the year after Great Britain repealed its restrictive Navigation Acts in Canada, more and more emigrating Norwegians sailed the shorter route to the Ville de Québec (Quebec City) in Canada, to make their way to US cities like Chicago, Milwaukee, and Green Bay by steamer. For example, in the 1850s, 28,640 arrived at Quebec, Canada, en route to the US, and 8,351 at New York directly.

Norwegian Americans represent 2–3% of the non-Hispanic [[European American|Euro-American]] population in the U.S. They mostly live in both the [[Upper Midwest]] and [[Pacific Northwest]].

====Canada====
{{Main|Norwegian Canadian}}
[[File:Christian-krohg-leiv-eriksson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leif Ericson]] discovers Canada and North America.]]
As early as 1814, a party of Norwegians was brought to [[Canada]] to build a winter road from York Factory on Hudson Bay to the infant [[Red River Colony|Red River settlement]] at the site of present-day [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada. Norway House is one of the oldest trading posts and Native-Canadian missions in the Canadian West. Willard Ferdinand Wentzel served the North West Company of Canada in the Athabasca and Mackenzie regions and accompanied Sir John Franklin on his overland expedition in 1819–20 to the Canadian Arctic.

Norwegians immigrated to Canada in search of the Canadian Dream. This immigration lasted from the mid-1880s until 1930, although Norwegians were already working in Canada as early as 1814. It can be divided into three periods of roughly fifteen years each. In the first, to about 1900, thousands of Norwegians homesteaded on the Canadian prairies. In the second, from 1900 to 1914, there was a further heavy influx of Norwegians immigrating to Canada from the United States because of poor economic conditions in the US, and 18,790 from Norway. In the third, from 1919 to 1930, 21,874 people came directly from Norway, with the peak year in 1927, when 5,103 Norwegians arrived, spurred by severe depression at home. They came with limited means, many leaving dole queues.
[[File:Saskatoon.jpg|thumb|right|7% of the population in [[Saskatoon]] in [[Canada]] is of Norwegian ancestry.]]
From 1825 to 1900 some 500,000 Norwegians landed at Ville du Quebec in Canada (and other Canadian ports) for travelling through Canada was the shortest corridor to the United States' central states. In spite of efforts by the Government of Canada to retain these immigrants for Canada, very few remained because of Canada's somewhat restrictive land policies at that time and negative stories being told about Canada from U.S. land agents deterring Norwegians from going to Canada. Not until the 1880s did Norwegians accept Canada as a land of opportunity. This was also true of the many Americans of Norwegian heritage who immigrated to Canada from the US with "Canada Fever" seeking homesteads and new economic opportunities. By 1921 one-third of all Norwegians in Canada had been born in the US.

These new Canadians became British subjects in Canada, and part of the British Empire. Canadian citizenship, as a status distinct from that of a British subject, was created on 1 January 1947, with Canada being the first Commonwealth country to create their own citizenship. Prior to that date, Canadians were British subjects and Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. On 1 January 1947, Canadian citizenship was conferred on most British subjects connected with Canada. Unlike the US, Canada was part of the British Empire and most Norwegians would have become Canadians and British subjects at the same time.

According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]], 452,705 Canadians reported Norwegian ancestry (Norwegian-Canadians).<ref name="Norwegian Canadians">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=1118296&GK=0&GRP=0&PID=105396&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=95&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0 |author=Statistics Canada |title=2011 National Household Survey: Data tables |accessdate=11 February 2014|author-link=Statistics Canada |date=2013-05-08 }}</ref> Norwegians make up 2% of the White Canadian population. However, the actual figure may be higher. It is important to note that because so many Norwegian women married men of other nationalities, and thus by census rules are not counted as having children of this ethnic origin, this tends to reduce the number in the statistics.

===Australia===
{{Main|Norwegian Australian}}
As of 2011, there were 3,710 Norwegian-born Australians, and 23,037 Norwegians of Australian descent.

===Russia===
{{Further|Kola Norwegians}}
In the 19th century a community known as the [[Kola Norwegians]] settled in the environs of the Russian city of [[Murmansk]]. They have suffered persecution under [[Joseph Stalin]] and after 1992 were offered a chance to get back to Norway. There are very few of them left there today.

==Genetics==
According to recent genetic analysis, both mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and Y chromosome [[Chromosomal polymorphism|polymorphisms]] showed a noticeable genetic affinity between the Norwegian population and other ethnic groups in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Central Europe]], particularly with the Germans. This is due to a history of at least a thousand years of large-scale migration both in and out of Norway.<ref name="hpgl.stanford.edu">{{cite web |url=http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/EJHG_2002_v10_521-529.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060758/http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/EJHG_2002_v10_521-529.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>

The Norwegian population is typical of the Northern European population with [[Haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup I1]] being most common. Norwegians also show the characteristic [[R1a]] genes of the paternal ancestorship at 17.9%<ref name="ajhg.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(07)63256-X |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414055310/http://www.ajhg.org/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297(07)63256-X |archivedate=2012-04-14 }} Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic Ancestry in the Male Settlers of Iceland – Agnar Helgason et al., 2000, Am.

Norwegian genetic ancestry also exists in many locations where Norwegians immigrated. In particular, several northern states in the United States ([[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Montana]]) show Scandinavian (which includes Norwegian) ancestry proportions among European descent (white) persons of 10 to 20%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bryc|first1=Katarzyna|last2=Durand|first2=Eric&nbsp;Y.|last3=Macpherson|first3=J.

== Language ==
{{Main|Norwegian language|North Germanic languages}}
[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is a [[North Germanic language]] with approximately 5 million speakers, of whom most are located in [[Norway]]. There are also some speakers of Norwegian in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]], where the largest community of speakers exists, with 55,311 speakers as of 2000; approximately half of the speakers live in [[Minnesota]] (8,060), [[California]] (5,865), [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (5,460), [[New York (state)|New York]] (4,200), and [[Wisconsin]] (3,520).<ref>[http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&mode=lang_tops&SRVY_YEAR=2000&lang_id=616 U.S Census 2000]</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Norway}}
'''Norwegian culture''' is closely linked to the country's [[History of Norway|history]] and [[Geography of Norway|geography]]. The unique [[Norwegian farm culture]], sustained to this day, has resulted not only from scarce resources and a harsh climate but also from [[Ancient Norwegian property laws|ancient property laws]]. In the 18th century, it brought about a strong [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|romantic nationalistic]] movement, which is still visible in the [[Norwegian language]] and [[:Category:Mass media in Norway|media]]. In the 19th century, Norwegian culture blossomed as efforts continued to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of Norway}}
[[File:Får i kål.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Fårikål]] is the traditional and national cuisine that covers all of Norway.]]
Norway's culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions with [[salmon]] (fresh and cured), [[herring]] (pickled or marinated), [[trout]], [[cod]]fish and other seafood balanced by cheeses, dairy products and excellent breads (predominantly dark/darker). [[Lefse]] is a common Norwegian potato flatbread, common around Christmas. For renowned Norwegian dishes, see [[lutefisk]], [[smalahove]], [[pinnekjøtt]], [[Krotekake]] and [[fårikål]].<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Norway.html Culture of Norway.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Norway}}
Along with the classical [[Norwegian music|music]] of [[romanticism|romantic]] [[composer]] [[Edvard Grieg]] and the modern music of [[Arne Nordheim]], [[Norwegian black metal]] has become something of an export article in recent years.

Norway's classical performers include [[Leif Ove Andsnes]], one of the world's more famous pianists, and [[Truls Mørk]], an outstanding cellist.

The jazz scene in Norway is also thriving. [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Mari Boine]], [[Arild Andersen]], and [[Bugge Wesseltoft]] are internationally recognised while [[Paal Nilssen-Love]], [[Supersilent]], [[Jaga Jazzist]] and [[Wibutee]] are becoming world-class artists of the younger generation.<ref>[http://www.studyinnorway.no/sn/Living-in-Norway/Culture Culture from Study in Norway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219033541/http://www.studyinnorway.no/sn/Living-in-Norway/Culture |date=2012-02-19 }}.

=== Celebrations ===
[[File:Oslo 17 mai 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Norwegian Constitution Day, May 17.]]
Norwegians celebrate their national day on May 17, dedicated to the [[Constitution of Norway]]. Many people wear ''[[bunad]]'' (traditional costumes) and most participate in or watch the [[Norwegian Constitution Day]]
parade that day, consisting mostly of children, through the cities and towns. The [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|national romanticist]] author [[Henrik Wergeland]] was the founder of the 17 May parade.
Common [[Christianity|Christian]] holidays are also celebrated, the most important being [[Christmas]] (called ''[[Yule|Jul]]'' in Norway after the pagan and early [[Viking]] winter solstice) and [[Easter]] (Påske). In Norway, the [[Santa]] (called [[Tomte|Nissen]]) comes at [[Christmas Eve]], the 24 December, with the presents, not the morning after as in many English speaking countries. He usually comes late in the evening, after the Christmas dinner many children consider long, boring and unnecessary.

''[[Jonsok]]'' ([[John the Baptist|St. John]]'s Passing), or ''[[St. Hans]]'' ([[John the Baptist|St. John]]'s Day), i.e. 24 June, is also a commonly revered holiday. It marks [[midsummer]] and the beginning of summer vacation, and is often celebrated by lighting [[bonfire]]s the evening before. In Northern areas of Norway, this day has 24 hours of light, while southern areas have only 17.5 hours.

===Religion===
{{See also|Religion in Norway|Norwegian American#The Norwegian Lutheran Church in the United States}}
[[File:Stavechurch-heddal.jpg|thumb|[[Heddal Stave Church]] is the largest stave church and one of the oldest preserved churches in Norway.]]
The conversion of Norway to [[Christianity]] from [[Norse paganism]] began in 1000. By the middle of the 11th century, Christianity had become well-established in Norway and had become dominant by the middle of the 12th century. The Norwegians were [[Catholics]] until the [[Denmark|Danish]] king [[Christian III of Denmark]] forced them to convert to [[Lutheranism]] and established a state-governed church. The [[church (building)|church]] undertook a program to convert the [[Sámi people|Sámi]] in the 16th and 17th century, with the program being largely successful.

In the 19th century, emigration from Norway for political and religious motives began and Lutheranism spread to the United States. As a result of this,{{citation needed|reason=Most Nordic people are religiously moderate – I have heard of no oppression of Christians here.|date=March 2011}} many of the Norwegians remaining in Norway were religiously moderate; subsequently, [[church attendance]] declined throughout the 20th century, as reflected by 78% of the population stating that religion is unimportant in a Gallup poll<ref>[https://worldview.gallup.com/default.aspx GALLUP WorldView]</ref> and low weekly church attendance, at 2%,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/livssyn/1086156/2_prosent_gaar_i_kirken_paa_en_vanlig_soendag.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721001720/http://www.aftenbladet.no/livssyn/1086156/2_prosent_gaar_i_kirken_paa_en_vanlig_soendag.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=2 prosent går i kirken på en vanlig søndag |work=Aftenbladet.no |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> particularly when compared to that of [[North Dakota]], the state in which Norwegians constitute approximately 30.4% of the population.

==Other terms used==
The Norwegians are and have been referred to by other terms as well.

Some of them include:
* '''''Nordmenn''''': A term used by Scandinavians to denote Norwegians. It translates as "Northmen". (Singular: '''Nordmann''')
* ''[[Norsemen|Northmen]]'': Old term used by other European peoples to denote the peoples originating in the northern regions of Europe.
* ''[[Norsemen]]'' or Norse: [[Viking Age]] peoples of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] origin.
* ''[[Vikings]]'': Used in the Nordic countries to denote people who went raiding, pillaging or ''slave catching'' during the Viking Age. Used in a similar way by other peoples but can also mean [[Scandinavia]]ns in general.
* ''[[Minnewegian]]'': [[Colloquial]] term for a [[Norwegian Minnesotan]].
* ''Norski'': Common name for Northern American Norwegians.
* ''Norrbagge'': A Swedish (derogatory) term for Norwegians (first attested use in 1257) of uncertain meaning. Some claim that it is based on the root ''bagge'' meaning sheep's testicles in some Swedish dialects. Another explanation is that "bagge" refers to Bagaholm where [[Bohus Fortress]] lies, at an ancient border between Norway and Sweden. Nordbagge then means people who lives on the north (Swedish:norr) side of Bagaholm.<ref>[[Per Egil Hegge]]: [http://tux.aftenposten.no/spraak/spraak?action=question&id=4121 Norrbagge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207040024/http://tux.aftenposten.no/spraak/spraak%3Faction%3Dquestion%26id%3D4121 |date=2019-12-07 }} Aftenposten, 8 December 2010 {{in lang|no}}</ref>
