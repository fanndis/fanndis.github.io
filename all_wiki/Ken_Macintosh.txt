Between 1987 and 1999, Macintosh was employed as a television producer for the [[BBC]], working on its news broadcasts and election coverage. He was first elected in the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election]] as a [[Scottish Labour Party|Scottish Labour]] [[Labour and Co-operative|Co-operative Party]] candidate, and retained his seat of [[Eastwood (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Eastwood]] in the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]], [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]] and the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 elections]], but lost it in the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 election]].

Macintosh was re-elected as MSP for Eastwood at the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]] with a narrow majority of 913, where he fought off a strong challenge from the Conservative Party's [[Jackson Carlaw]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6624781.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turner out as Labour wins seats | date=4 May 2007}}</ref> After the election, Macintosh was appointed Shadow [[Minister for Schools and Skills]].

=== 2011 and 2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership elections ===
Macintosh announced his candidacy in [[2011 Scottish Labour leadership election]]. During a September 2011 [[BBC Scotland]] TV interview, Labour leader [[Ed Miliband]] was unable to recall Macintosh's name.<ref>{{cite news|date=29 September 2011|title=Ed Miliband unable to name all Scots leader candidates|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15104173}}</ref> After the interview, Miliband telephoned to apologise for his mistake and Macintosh tried to downplay the incident saying "I don't think anyone should read anything into it – half the time I can't even remember the names of my own kids."<ref>{{cite news|last=MacDonell|first=Hamish|date=30 September 2011|title=Ed Miliband forgets Scottish candidate's name|work=The Independent|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/miliband-forgets-scottish-candidates-name-2363319.html}}</ref> Macintosh officially launched his campaign at [[Cumbernauld College]] on 28 October. He described the 2011 election result as a "disaster" and said the party had been too negative: "We need to unite as a party and to start talking positively about our values, what Labour stands for and not just what we are against."<ref>{{cite news|date=31 October 2011|title=Scottish Labour leader contenders put their cases|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15520440}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=28 October 2011|title=Ken Macintosh launches Scottish Labour leadership bid|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15496676}}</ref> He later also said he was a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolutionist]], not a [[Unionism in Scotland|unionist]].<ref>{{cite news|date=25 September 2011|title=Labour leadership contender rejects unionist label|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-15055010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Archived copy|url=http://www.labourhame.com/archives/2082|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509080949/http://www.labourhame.com/archives/2082|archive-date=9 May 2012|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> Despite lacking ministerial experience, he was widely seen as a frontrunner.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Tim|date=27 September 2011|title=BBC News – Senior Labour figure makes Scots candidates warning|newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-15080475}}</ref> Colleagues who endorsed his bid included his campaign manager [[Michael McMahon (Scottish politician)|Michael McMahon]], [[Claire Baker]], [[Mary Fee]], [[Neil Bibby]], [[Mark Griffin (politician)|Mark Griffin]], [[Kezia Dugdale]], [[Jenny Marra]] and East Renfrewshire MP [[Jim Murphy]], with whom Macintosh shared his constituency office in [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=12 September 2011|title='It's time to change' – Macintosh sets out stall for Labour Leadership|work=The Scotsman}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MSPs : Scottish Parliament|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msp/memberspages/ken_macintosh/contact.htm|date=2014-11-19|publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk|accessdate=2016-05-28}}</ref> In the ensuing leadership election, Macintosh came second to MSP [[Johann Lamont]].<ref name="BBC-2011-12-17">{{cite news|date=17 December 2011|title=Johann Lamont named new Scottish Labour leader|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16217972|url-status=live|accessdate=17 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217013556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16217972|archive-date=17 December 2011}}</ref>

Following Scottish Labour's near wipeout at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], Macintosh decided to [[2015 Scottish Labour leadership election|stand again for the Scottish Labour leadership]], triggered by the resignation of [[Jim Murphy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Andrew|date=18 May 2015|title=Ken Macintosh enters Scottish Labour leader race|work=The Scotsman|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/ken-macintosh-enters-scottish-labour-leader-race-1-3776105}}</ref> Macintosh faced a straight two-way contest with previous deputy leader [[Kezia Dugdale]],<ref>{{cite news|date=15 June 2015|title=Five candidates put forward names for Scottish Labour leader posts|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-33133054}}</ref> who won the leadership.<ref>{{Cite news|date=15 August 2015|title=Kezia Dugdale elected Scottish Labour leader|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-33942238}}</ref>

=== Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament ===
[[File:KenMacintoshMSP.jpg|thumb|Official parliamentary portrait, 2016]]At the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], Macintosh lost the Eastwood constituency, being pushed into third place behind the Conservatives' Jackson Carlaw and the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[Stewart Maxwell]]. However, Macintosh was returned as an additional member on Scottish Labour's West Scotland regional list.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36219110 |title=Holyrood 2016: Former Scottish leader candidate Ken Macintosh loses seat |work=BBC News |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>

On 12 May 2016, Macintosh was elected as [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament]] with 71 votes on the third round of voting by MSPs. He defeated [[Murdo Fraser]], Johann Lamont, [[John Scott (Scottish politician)|John Scott]] and [[Elaine Smith (Scottish politician)|Elaine Smith]]. He suspended his Scottish Labour Co-operative membership upon taking office, per the tradition of the presiding officer being strictly nonpartisan.

In early November 2018, Macintosh created controversy when an MSP was sent out of the Holyrood chamber for wearing a rainbow tie in support of LGBTI rights and liberation. [[Alex Cole-Hamilton]], [[Scottish Liberal Democrat]] MSP for [[Edinburgh Western (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Western]], was told to change the garment by Macintosh during a debate on LGBTI-inclusive education in schools. Macintosh said it flouted rules against "ostentatious campaign material" in the chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McPherson|first=Gareth|title=MSP ordered out of Holyrood chamber for wearing rainbow tie in support of LGBTI campaign|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/761637/msp-ordered-out-of-holyrood-chamber-for-wearing-rainbow-tie-in-support-of-lgbti-campaign/|access-date=2020-10-23|website=The Courier|language=en-GB}}</ref>
