Global warming will likely rise to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052 if warming continues to increase at the current rate.<ref name="SR15_Headlines">{{harvnb|SR15 Headline statements}}</ref>{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=A.1}}
SR15 provides a summary of, on one hand, existing research on the impact that a warming of 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C (equivalent to 2.7{{nnbsp}}°F) would have on the planet, and on the other hand, the necessary steps to limit global warming.<ref name=insideclimatenews_SR15>{{cite web |url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07102018/ipcc-global-warming-science-report-short-lived-climate-pollutants-methane-hfcs-carbon |title=Not Just CO2: These Climate Pollutants Also Must Be Cut to Keep Global Warming to 1.5 Degrees |quote="A landmark report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns policymakers of the risks ahead and the changes needed to stop global warming." |first=Phil |last=McKenna |date=7 October 2018 |access-date=10 October 2018 |publisher=[[InsideClimate News]]}}</ref>

Even assuming full implementation of conditional and unconditional [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|Nationally Determined Contributions]] submitted by nations
in the [[Paris Agreement]], net emissions would increase compared to 2010, leading to a warming of about 3{{nnbsp}}°C by 2100, and more afterwards.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=D.1}}{{sfn|SR15 Report|loc=ch. 4, Cross-Chapter Box 11, section 3}}
In contrast, limiting warming below or close to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C would require to decrease net emissions by around 45% by 2030 and reach ''net zero'' by 2050 (i.e. keeping total cumulative emissions within a carbon budget).
Even just for limiting global warming to below 2{{nnbsp}}°C, CO2 emissions should decline by 25% by 2030 and by 100% by 2075.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1}}

Pathways (i.e. scenarios and portfolios of mitigation options) that would allow such reduction by 2050{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.2.2}} describe a rapid transition towards producing electricity through lower-emission methods, and increasing use of electricity instead of other fuels in sectors such as transportation. On average, the pathways describing the proportion of primary energy produced by renewables as increasing to 60%, while the proportion produced by coal drops to 5% and oil to 13%.{{sfn|SR15|loc=C.2.4.2.1}} Most pathways describe a larger role for nuclear energy and [[carbon capture and storage]], and less usage of natural gas.{{sfn|SR15|loc=C.2.4.2.1}}  They also assume that other measures are simultaneously undertaken: e.g. non-CO2 emissions (such as methane, black carbon, nitrous oxide) are to be similarly reduced,{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1.2}} energy demand is unchanged, reduced by even 30% or offsetted by an unprecedented scale of [[carbon dioxide removal]] methods yet to be developed, while new policies and research allows to improve efficiency in agriculture and industry.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|p=15}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://youngfarmers.simplecast.com/episodes/farming-in-a-new-climate-reality-with-948a6e3d|title=Farming in a New Climate Reality with Mark Howden of the IPCC|date=December 6, 2018|website=Young Farmers Podcast, National Young Farmers Coalition|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref>

=== Impact of 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C or 2{{nnbsp}}°C  warming ===
{{main|Effects of global warming}}
According to the report, with global warming of 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C there would be increased risks to "health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth."<ref name="SR15_Headlines"/>
Impact vectors include reduction in crop yields and nutritional quality.
Livestock are also affected with rising temperatures through "changes in feed quality, spread of diseases, and water resource availability."
"Risks from some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are projected to increase."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.5.2, B.5.3}}

"Limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.5.1}} 
Climate-related risks associated with increasing global warming depend on geographic location, "levels of development and vulnerability", and the speed and reach of [[climate mitigation]] and [[climate adaptation]] practices.<ref name="SR15_Headlines"/>
For example, "[[urban heat islands]] amplify the impacts of heatwaves in cities."
In general, "countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.5.2, B.5.5}}

==== Weather, sea level and ice ====
Many regions and seasons experience warming greater than the global annual average, e.g. "2–3 times higher in the Arctic. Warming is generally higher over
land than over the ocean,"{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=A.1.2}} and it correlates with temperature extremes (which are projected to warm up to twice more on land than the global [[mean surface temperature]]) as well as precipitation extremes (both heavy rain and droughts).{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=p. 6–9}}
The assessed levels of risk generally increased compared to the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|previous IPCC report]].{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.5.7}}

The "[[global mean sea level]] is projected rise (relative to 1986-2005) by 0.26 to 0.77{{nnbsp}}m by 2100 for 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C global warming" and about 0.1{{nnbsp}}m more for 2{{nnbsp}}°C. A difference of 0.1{{nnbsp}}m may correspond to 10 million more or fewer people exposed to related risks.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.2.1}}
"Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C.
Around 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C to 2{{nnbsp}}°C of global warming," irreversible instabilities could be triggered in [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctica]] and "[[Greenland ice sheet]], resulting in multi-metre rise in sea level."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.2.2}}
"An ice-free Arctic summer is projected once per century" (per decade) for 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C (respectively 2{{nnbsp}}°C).{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.4.1}}
"Limiting global warming to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C rather than 2{{nnbsp}}°C is projected to prevent the thawing over centuries of a permafrost area in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 million km<sup>2</sup>."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.3.3}}

==== Ecosystems ====
"A decrease in global annual catch for marine fisheries of about 1.5 or 3 million tonnes for 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C or 2{{nnbsp}}°C of global warming" is projected by one global fishery model cited in the report.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.4.4}}
Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C, and even more than 99% at 2{{nnbsp}}°C.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.4.2}}
"Of 105,000 species studied, 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates fare projected to lose over half of their climatically determined geographic range for global warming of 2{{nnbsp}}°C."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.3.1}}

Approximately "4% or 13% of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation of ecosystems from one type to another" at 1{{nnbsp}}°C or 2{{nnbsp}}°C, respectively. "High-latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of climate change-induced
degradation and loss, with woody shrubs already encroaching into the tundra and
will proceed with further warming."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=B.3.2, B.3.3}}

=== Limiting the temperature increase ===
Human activities ([[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions]]) have already contributed {{convert|0.8-1.2|C-change}} of warming.<ref name="SR15_Headlines"/> Nevertheless, the gases which have been emitted so far are unlikely to cause global temperature to rise to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C alone, meaning a global temperature rise to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels is avoidable, assuming net zero emissions are reached soon.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=A.2.1}}{{sfn|SR15 Report|loc=ch. 1, p. 4}}

==== Carbon budget ====
{{main|Emissions budget}}
Limiting global warming to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C requires staying within a total carbon budget, i.e. limiting total cumulative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1.3}}
In other words, if net anthropogenic CO2 emissions are kept above zero, a global warming of 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C and more will eventually be reached.

The value of the ''total'' net anthropogenic CO2 budget since the pre-industrial era is not assessed in the report.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=p. 14, footnote 13}} Estimates of 400–800 GtCO<sub>2</sub> (gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>) for the ''remaining'' budget are given (580 GtCO2 and 420 GtCO2 for a 50% and 66% probability of limiting warming to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C, using global mean surface air temperature (GSAT);
or 770 and 570 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, for 50% and 66% probabilities, using global mean surface temperature (GMST)).
This is about 300 GtCO<sub>2</sub> more compared to [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|a previous IPCC report]], due to updated understanding and further advances in methods.

Emissions around the time of the report were depleting this budget at 42±3 GtCO<sub>2</sub> per year.
Anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the end of 2017 are estimated to have reduced the budget for 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C by approximately 2200±320 GtCO<sub>2</sub>.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1.3}}

The estimates for the budget come with significant uncertainties, associated with: climate response to CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (these contribute about ±400 GtCO<sub>2</sub> in uncertainty),
the level of historic warming (±250 GtCO<sub>2</sub>), potential additional carbon release from future permafrost thawing and methane release from wetlands (reducing the budget by up to 100 GtCO<sub>2</sub> over the century), and the level of future non-CO2 mitigation (±400 GtCO<sub>2</sub>).{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1.3}}

==== Necessary emission reductions ====
Current nationally stated mitigation ambitions, as submitted under the [[Paris Agreement]], would lead to global greenhouse gas
emissions of 52–58 Gt[[Carbon dioxide equivalent|CO<sub>2</sub>eq]] per year, by 2030. 
"Pathways reflecting these ambitions would not limit global warming to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C, even if supplemented by very challenging
increases in the scale and ambition of emissions reductions after 2030."{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=D.1}}
Instead, they are "broadly consistent" with a warming of about 3{{nnbsp}}°C by 2100, and more afterwards.

Limit global warming to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C with no or limited overshoot would require reducing emissions to below 35 GtCO<sub>2</sub>eq per year in 2030, regardless of the modelling pathway chosen. Most fall within 25–30 GtCO<sub>2</sub>eq per year, a 40–50% reduction from 2010 levels.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=D.1.1}}

The report says that for limiting warming to below 1.5{{nnbsp}}C "global net human-caused emissions of CO2 would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ''net zero'' around 2050." Even just for limiting global warming to below 2{{nnbsp}}°C, CO2 emissions should decline by 25% by 2030 and by 100% by 2070.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1}}

Non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should decline in more or less similar ways.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|p=15}}
This involves deep reductions in emissions of methane and black carbon: at least 35% of both by 2050, relative to 2010, to limit warming near 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C.
Such measures could be undertaken in the energy sector and by reducing nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture, methane from the waste sector, and some other sources of black carbon and hydrofluorocarbons.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1.2}}

On timescales longer than tens of years, it may still be necessary to sustain net negative CO2 emissions and/or further reduce ''non-CO2 radiative forcing'' (*), in order to
prevent further warming (due to Earth system feedbacks), reverse ocean acidification, and minimise sea level rise.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=A.2.2}}

(*) ''Non-CO2 emissions included in this Report are all anthropogenic emissions other than CO2 that result in radiative forcing. These include short-lived climate forcers, such as methane, some fluorinated gases, ozone precursors, aerosols or aerosol precursors, such as black carbon and sulphur dioxide, respectively, as well as long-lived greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide or some fluorinated gases. The radiative forcing associated with non-CO2 emissions and changes in surface albedo is referred to as'' non-CO2 radiative forcing''.''

==== Pathways to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C ====
{{See also|Sustainable energy#Proposed pathways to sustainable energy}}
Various ''pathways'' are considered, describing scenarios for mitigation of global warming, including portfolios for energy supply and [[negative emission technologies]] (like [[afforestation]] or [[carbon dioxide removal]]).

Examples of actions consistent with the 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C pathway include "shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing '[[green infrastructure]]', such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the layout of many cities."{{sfn|SR15 FAQ}}
As another example, an increase of [[forests|forestation]] by {{convert|10000000|km2|mi2}} by 2050 relative to 2010 would be required.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.2.5}}

The pathways also assume an increase in annual investments in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency by roughly a factor of four to ten by 2050 compared to 2015.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.2.6}}

==== Negative emission technologies and geoengineering ====
The emission pathways that reach 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C contained in the report assume the use of [[Negative emission technologies|negative emission technology]] to offset for remaining
emissions.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.3}} Pathways that overshoot the goal rely on them to exceed remaining emissions in order to return to 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.3.3}}
However, understanding is still limited about the effectiveness of net negative emissions to reduce temperatures after an overshoot. 
Reversing an overshoot of 0.2&nbsp;°C might not be achievable given considerable implementation challenges.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=D.1.2}}

There are two main groups of geoengineering types in the report, [[carbon dioxide removal]] (CDR) and [[solar radiation management]] (SRM). 
For CDR the report highlights [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|bioenergy with carbon capture and storage]] (BECCS). The report notes that apart from [[afforestation]]/reforestation and ecosystem restoration, "the feasibility of massive-scale deployment of many CDR technologies remains an open question", with areas of uncertainty regarding technology upscaling, governance, ethical issues, policy and carbon cycle.{{sfn|SR15 Report|loc=ch. 1}}{{sfn|SR15 Report|loc=ch. 4}}
The report notes that CDR technology is in its infancy and the feasibility is an open question. 
Estimates from recent literature are cited, giving a potential of up to 5 GtCO2 per year for BECCS and up to 3.6 GtCO2 per year for afforestation.{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.3.2}}
An analysis of the geoengineering proposals published in [[Nature Communications|Nature Communication]] confirmed findings of the SR15, stating that "all are in early stages of development, involve substantial uncertainties and risks, and raise ethical and governance dilemmas. Based on present knowledge, climate geoengineering techniques cannot be relied on to significantly contribute to meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goals".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Mark G.|last2=Schäfer|first2=Stefan|last3=Muri|first3=Helene|last4=Scott|first4=Vivian|last5=Oschlies|first5=Andreas|last6=Vaughan|first6=Naomi E.|last7=Boucher|first7=Olivier|last8=Schmidt|first8=Hauke|last9=Haywood|first9=Jim|date=2018-09-13|title=Evaluating climate geoengineering proposals in the context of the Paris Agreement temperature goals|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=9|issue=1|pages=3734|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-05938-3|issn=2041-1723|pmc=6137062|pmid=30213930|bibcode=2018NatCo...9.3734L}}</ref>

As for SRM, the report focuses on [[stratospheric aerosol injection]], as it has the most available literature; however it is still an experimental technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/geoengineering-global-warming-ipcc|title=Geoengineering may be used to combat global warming, experts say|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2018-10-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref> SRMs also "face large uncertainties and knowledge gaps as well as substantial risks, [...] and constraints";{{sfn|SR15 Summary for policymakers|loc=C.1.4}} "the impacts of SRM (both biophysical and societal), costs, technical feasibility, governance and ethical issues associated need to be carefully considered."{{sfn|SR15 Report|loc=ch. 4}}

In a CBC interview, [[Paul Romer]] was asked if the Nobel Prize in economic sciences that he and [[William Nordhaus]] received shortly before the SR15 was released, was timed as a message. Romer said that he was optimistic that measures will be taken in time to avert climate catastrophe. Romer compared the angst and lack of political will in imposing a carbon tax to the initial angst surrounding the [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) ban and the positive impact it had on restoring the [[ozone depletion|depleted]] [[ozone]] layer.{{notetag|The 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]]  banned [[Chlorofluorocarbon]]  (CFO) and the [[ozone layer]] recovered by 2000.}}<ref name="CBC_Romer_2018">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.4843029/nobel-prize-winning-economist-says-carbon-taxes-are-the-solution-to-climate-change-1.4854639 |title=Nobel Prize-winning economist says carbon taxes are the solution to climate change |publisher=CBC News |date=8 October 2018 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> In giving the Nobel to Nordhaus and Romer, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] cited Nordhaus as saying "the most efficient remedy for problems caused by greenhouse gases is a global scheme of universally imposed carbon taxes".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Latest: Nordhaus predicts US will accept climate science |date=8 October 2018 |access-date=10 October 2018|url=https://www.apnews.com/87598b3d269f4891984c0d7304ab2c1e |agency=Associated Press }}</ref>

Howard J. Herzog, a senior research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that carbon capture and storage technologies, except [[reforestation]], are problematic because of their impact on the environment, health and high cost.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Herzog |first1=Howard J. |title=Why We Can't Reverse Climate Change With 'Negative Emissions' Technologies |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/negative-emissions-technologies-climate-change-2611111962.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |agency=Ecowatch |date=9 October 2018}}</ref> In the article there is a link to another article that refers to a study published in the scientific journal "Nature Energy".

Low-emissions and climate resilient growth is possible: The EU is continuing successfully to decouple economic growth from emissions. Between 1990 and 2016, the EU's GDP grew by 53% while total emissions fell by 22.4%. The EU's share of global greenhouse gas emissions fell from an estimated 17.3% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2012.}}

====India====
The [[Centre for Science and Environment]] said the repercussions for developing countries such as India, would be "catastrophic" at 2{{nbsp}}°C warming and that the impact even at 1.5{{nbsp}}°C described in SR15 is much greater than anticipated. Crop yields would decline and poverty would increase.<ref name="economictimes">{{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/ipcc-report-india-to-be-highly-impacted-says-cse/articleshow/66120491.cms |work=[[The Economic Times]] |title=IPCC report: India to be highly impacted says Centre for Science and Environment |date=8 October 2018 |access-date=10 October 2018 }}</ref>

====New Zealand====
The Minister for Climate Change [[James Shaw (New Zealand politician)|James Shaw]] said that the Report "has laid out a strong case for countries to make every effort to limit temperature rise to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ... The good news is that the IPCC's report is broadly in line with this Government's direction on climate change and it's highly relevant to the work we are doing with the Zero Carbon Bill."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/international-global-warming-report-lays-out-critical-challenge|title=International global warming report lays out the critical challenge|last=Shaw|first=James|date=8 October 2018|publisher=The official website of the New Zealand Government|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref>

The "Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C" (SR15) is cited by [[Greta Thunberg]] in her speeches "Wherever I Go I Seem to Be Surrounded by Fairy Tales" ([[United States Congress]], Washington DC, 18 September 2019) and "We Are the Change and Change Is Coming" (Week For Future, Climate Strike, [[Montreal]], 27 September 2019), both published in the second edition of ''[[No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference]]''.

At the 2019 [[World Economic Forum]], the head of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Kristalina Georgieva]], said that: "The big eye opener [into climate change and its effects] was when last year I read [the SR15] IPCC report. I tell you, I could not sleep that night. [...] What have we done?".<ref>{{Cite news |author=Oscar Williams-Grut |title=IMF chief 'couldn't sleep' after reading climate report: 'What have we done?' |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/davos-2020-imf0-kristalina-georgieva-larry-fink-climate-115530685.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=fb |work=[[Yahoo!
