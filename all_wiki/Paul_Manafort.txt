On June 9, 2016, Manafort, [[Donald Trump Jr.]], and [[Jared Kushner]] were participants in [[Trump campaign–Russian meeting|a meeting]] with Russian attorney [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]] and several others at [[Trump Tower]].

In August 2016, Manafort's connections to former [[Ukrainian President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and his pro-Russian [[Party of Regions]] drew national attention in the US, where it was reported that Manafort may have received $12.7 million in off-the-books funds from the Party of Regions.<ref name="ukraine">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html|title=Secret Ledger in Ukraine Lists Cash for Donald Trump's Campaign Chief|last1=Kramer|first1=Andrew E.|date=August 14, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 15, 2016|last2=McIntire|first2=Mike|last3=Meier|first3=Barry}}</ref>

In January 2019, Manafort's lawyers submitted a filing to the court in response to the allegation that Manafort had lied to investigators. Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while he was campaign chairman, Manafort met with [[Konstantin Kilimnik]], who is believed to be linked to Russian intelligence. The filing says Manafort gave him polling data related to the 2016 campaign and discussed a Ukrainian peace plan with him. Most of the polling data was reportedly public, although some was private Trump campaign polling data. Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the data to Ukrainians [[Serhiy Lyovochkin]] and [[Rinat Akhmetov]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/08/politics/manafort-russia-court-deadline/index.html|title=Mueller believes Manafort fed information to Russian with intel ties|last=Polantz|first=Katelyn|date=January 8, 2019|work=CNN|accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/manafort-trump-campaign-data-kilimnik.html|title=Manafort Accused of Sharing Trump Polling Data With Russian Associate|first1=Sharon|last1=LaFraniere|first2=Kenneth P.|last2=Vogel|first3=Maggie|last3=Haberman|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 9, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

===Lobbying career===
In 1980, Manafort was a founding partner of Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm [[Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly|Black, Manafort & Stone]], along with principals [[Charles R.

In 1985, Manafort's firm, BMSK, signed a $600,000 contract with [[Jonas Savimbi]], the leader of the Angolan rebel group [[UNITA]], to refurbish Savimbi's image in Washington and secure financial support on the basis of his anti-communism stance. BMSK arranged for Savimbi to attend events at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (where [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] gave him a laudatory introduction), [[The Heritage Foundation]], and [[Freedom House]]; in the wake of the campaign, Congress approved hundreds of millions of dollars in covert American aid to Savimbi's group.<ref name="Foer">{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/paul_manafort_isn_t_a_gop_retread_he_s_made_a_career_of_reinventing_tyrants.html|title = The Quiet American|last = Foer|first = Franklin|newspaper = Slate|date=April 28, 2016|access-date = August 1, 2016}}</ref> Allegedly, Manafort's continuing lobbying efforts helped preserve the flow of money to Savimbi several years after the Soviet Union ceased its involvement in the Angolan conflict, forestalling peace talks.<ref name="Foer"/>

Between June 1984 and June 1986, Manafort was a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|FARA]]-registered lobbyist for [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Reagan Administration refused to grant Manafort a waiver from federal statutes prohibiting public officials from acting as foreign agents; Manafort resigned his directorship at OPIC in May 1986. An investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] found 18 lobbying-related activities that were not reported in FARA filings, including lobbying on behalf of [[The Bahamas]] and [[Saint Lucia]].<ref name="bb">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/2018/07/11/mueller-wants-manafort-jury-to-hear-of-saudi-lobbying-in-1984 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=July 12, 2018 |title=Mueller Wants Manafort Jury to Hear of Lobbying Decades Ago |first=David |last=Voreacos}}</ref>

====Association with Pakistani Inter-Service Intelligence Agency====
Manafort received $700,000 from the [[Kashmir]]i American Council between 1990 and 1994, supposedly to promote the plight of the Kashmiri people.

====Transition to Ukraine====
Manafort's involvement in Ukraine can be traced to 2003, when [[Russian oligarch]] [[Oleg Deripaska]] hired [[Bob Dole]], Manafort's prior campaign candidate, to lobby the State Department for a waiver of his visa ban, primarily so that he could solicit otherwise unavailable institutional purchasers for shares in his company, RusAL.<ref name="DMP">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/mccains-kremlin-ties/|title=McCain's Kremlin Ties|last=Ames|first=Mark|date=October 1, 2008|website=[[The Nation]]|access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref><ref name="GSimpson">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117674837248471543|title=How Lobbyists Help Ex-Soviets Woo Washington|last=Simpson|first=Glenn|date=April 17, 2007|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920212025/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117674837248471543|archive-date=September 20, 2015|url-status=dead|access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref> Then in early 2004, Deripaska met with Manafort's partner, [[Rick Davis]], also a prior campaign adviser to [[Bob Dole]], to discuss hiring Manafort and Davis to return the former Georgian Minister of State Security, [[Igor Giorgadze]], to prominence in Georgian politics.<ref name="OVD">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-manaforts-overseas-political-work-had-a-notable-patron-a-russian-oligarch-1504131910|title=Paul Manafort's Overseas Political Work Had a Notable Patron: A Russian Oligarch|last=Forrest|first=Brett|date=August 30, 2017|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830222840/https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-manaforts-overseas-political-work-had-a-notable-patron-a-russian-oligarch-1504131910|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref>

By December 2004, however, Deripaska shelved his plans in Georgia and dispatched Manafort to meet with [[Rinat Akhmetov]] in Ukraine to help Akhmetov and his holding firm, System Capital Management, weather the political crisis brought by the [[Orange Revolution]].<ref name="OVD" /> Akhmetov would eventually flee to [[Monaco]] after being accused of murder, but during the crisis Manafort shepherded Akhemtov around Washington, meeting with U.S. officials like [[Dick Cheney]].<ref name="DMP" /><ref name="GSimpson" /><ref name="OVD" /> Meanwhile, the Orange Revolution would push Deripaska to also hire Davis—Manafort, this time to work for [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the [[Party of Regions]].<ref name="pmsuOB" />

In a February 7, 2019, hearing before [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] Judge [[Amy Berman Jackson]], prosecutors speculated that Manafort had concealed facts about his activities to enhance the possibility of his receiving a pardon. They said that Manafort's work with Ukraine had continued after he had made his plea deal and that during the Trump campaign, he met with his campaign deputy Rick Gates, who also had pleaded guilty in the case, and with alleged Russian Federation intelligence agent, [[Konstantin Kilimnik]], in an exclusive New York cigar bar. Gates said the three left the premises separately, each using different exits.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/prosecutors-manafort-continued-ukraine-work-in-2018-and-key-russian-aide-came-to-trump-inauguration/2019/02/07/a0210b96-2a50-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html Manafort continued Ukraine work in 2018, prosecutors say], ''[[Washington Post]]'', Spencer S.
