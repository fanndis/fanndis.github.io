'''Portland''' is the [[List of cities in Maine|most populous city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] and the [[County seat|seat]] of [[Cumberland County, Maine|Cumberland County]]. Portland's population was 66,215 as of 2019.<ref name="USCensusEst2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2019.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 21, 2020}}</ref> The [[Portland metropolitan area, Maine|Greater Portland]] metropolitan area is home to over half a million people, the 105th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Portland's economy relies mostly on the service sector and tourism. The [[Old Port]] district is known for its 19th-century architecture and nightlife. Marine industry still plays an important role in the city's economy, with an active waterfront that supports fishing and commercial shipping. The [[Port of Portland (Maine)|Port of Portland]] is the largest tonnage seaport in [[New England]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.portlandmaine.com/explore-downtown/|title=Explore Downtown |website=Portland Downtown |language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref>

[[Christopher Levett]], an English naval captain granted {{convert|6000|acre|ha}} in 1623 to found a settlement in [[Casco Bay]]. A member of the [[Plymouth Council for New England|Council for New England]] and agent for [[Ferdinando Gorges]], Levett built a stone house where he left a company of ten men, then returned to England to write a book about his voyage to bolster support for the settlement.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/christopherleve00levegoog|quote=christopher levett.|title=Christopher Levett, of York: The Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay|first=James Phinney|last=Baxter|date=September 10, 1893|publisher=Gorges Society|accessdate=September 10, 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Ultimately, the settlement was a failure and the fate of Levett's colonists is unknown. The explorer sailed from England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] to meet [[John Winthrop]] in 1630, but never returned to Maine. [[Fort Levett]] in the harbor is named for him.

The [[List of peninsulas|peninsula]] was settled in 1632 as a fishing and trading village named '''Casco'''.<ref name=maineguide /> When the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] took over Casco Bay in 1658, the town's name changed again to '''Falmouth'''. In 1676, the village was destroyed by the [[Abenaki]] during [[King Philip's War]]. It was rebuilt. During [[King William's War]], a raiding party of French and their native allies attacked and largely destroyed it again in the [[Battle of Fort Loyal]] (1690).

On October 18, 1775, [[Burning of Falmouth|Falmouth was burned]] in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]] by the [[Royal Navy]] under command of Captain [[Henry Mowat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainememory.net/bin/Detail?ln=7479|title=Jedediah Preble letter on Mowat kidnapping, 1775|accessdate=April 1, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033714/http://www.mainememory.net/bin/Detail?ln=7479|archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the war, a section of Falmouth called The Neck developed as a commercial port and began to grow rapidly as a shipping center. In 1786, the citizens of Falmouth formed a separate town in Falmouth Neck and named it '''Portland''', after the [[Isle of Portland|isle]] off the coast of [[Dorset]], England.<ref name="Coolidge, A.J 1859. p. 301"/> Portland's economy was greatly stressed by the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] (prohibition of trade with the British), which ended in 1809, and the [[War of 1812]], which ended in 1815.

In 1820, Maine was established as a state with Portland as its capital. In 1832, the capital was moved north and East to [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]]. In 1851, Maine led the nation by passing the first state law prohibiting the sale of alcohol except for "medicinal, mechanical or manufacturing purposes." The law subsequently became known as the [[Maine law]], as 18 states quickly followed. On June 2, 1855, the [[Portland Rum Riot]] occurred.

In 1853, upon completion of the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] to [[Montreal]], Portland became the primary ice-free winter seaport for Canadian exports. The [[Portland Company]], located on Fore Street, manufactured more than 600 19th-century steam [[locomotive]]s, as well as engines for trains and boats, fire engines and other railroad transportation equipment. The [[Portland Company]] was, for a time, the city's largest employer and many of its employees were immigrants from Canada, Ireland and Italy. Portland became a 20th-century [[junction (rail)|rail hub]] as five additional rail lines merged into [[Portland Terminal Company]] in 1911. Following nationalization of the Grand Trunk system in 1923, Canadian export traffic was diverted from Portland to [[Halifax Harbour|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], resulting in marked local economic decline. In the 20th century, [[icebreaker]]s later enabled ships to reach Montreal in winter, drastically reducing Portland's role as a winter port for Canada.

On June 26, 1863, a Confederate raiding party led by Captain Charles Read entered the harbor at Portland leading to the [[Battle of Portland Harbor]], one of the northernmost battles of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The [[1866 Great Fire of Portland, Maine]], on July 4, 1866, ignited during the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration, destroyed most of the commercial buildings in the city, half the churches and hundreds of homes. More than 10,000 people were left homeless.

By act of the Maine Legislature in 1899, Portland annexed the city of [[Deering, Maine|Deering]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maine Secretary of State|title=Private and Special Laws of the State of Maine|date=1899|publisher=Kennebec Journal Print|pages=9–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3xKAAAAYAAJ&q=portland+deering+annex&pg=RA1-PA9|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref> despite a vote by Deering residents rejecting the annexation, thereby greatly increasing the size of the city and opening areas for development beyond the peninsula.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Conforti|first1=Joseph|title=Creating Portland|date=2007|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-449-0|page=xvii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WjGkuhZyaoC&q=portland+deering+expansion&pg=PR17|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>

The construction of [[The Maine Mall]], an indoor shopping center established in the suburb of [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], during the 1970s, economically depressed downtown Portland. The trend reversed when tourists and new businesses started revitalizing the old seaport, a part of which is known locally as the Old Port. Since the 1990s, the historically industrial Bayside neighborhood has seen rapid development, including attracting a Whole Foods and Trader Joes supermarkets, as well as [[Baxter Academy for Technology and Science]], an increasingly popular charter school. Other rapidly developing neighborhoods include the India Street neighborhood near the Ocean Gateway and [[Munjoy Hill]], where many modern condos have been built.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bayside is a journey of many 'next steps' |url=http://business.mainetoday.com/news/061016bayside.html |publisher=Portland Press Herald (Blethen Maine Newspapers, Inc.) |date=October 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022053706/http://business.mainetoday.com/news/061016bayside.html |archivedate=October 22, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Kelley |last=Bouchard |title=Riverwalk: Parking garage due to rise; luxury condos to follow |url=http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/news/local/061006riverwalk.html |publisher=Portland Press Herald (Blethen Maine Newspapers, Inc.) |date=October 6, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Tux |last=Turkel |title=An urban vision rises in Bayside |url=http://business.mainetoday.com/news/070206bayside.html |publisher=Portland Press Herald (Blethen Maine Newspapers, Inc.) |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226015400/http://business.mainetoday.com/news/070206bayside.html |archivedate=December 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[Maine College of Art]] has been a revitalizing force downtown, attracting students from around the country.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|69.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|21.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|48.13|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> Portland is situated on a peninsula in Casco Bay on the [[Gulf of Maine]] and the Atlantic Ocean.

Portland borders [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], [[Westbrook, Maine|Westbrook]] and [[Falmouth, Maine|Falmouth]]. The city is located at 43.66713 N, 70.20717 W.

=== Climate ===
Portland has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dfb''), with cold, snowy, and often prolonged winters, and warm, relatively short summers. The monthly average high temperature ranges from roughly {{convert|30|°F|0}} in January to around {{convert|80|°F|0}} in July. Daily high temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on only 4 days per year on average, while cold-season lows of {{convert|0|°F|0}} or below are reached on 10 nights per year on average.<ref name="Portland weatherbox NOAA"/> The area can be affected by severe [[nor'easter]]s during winter, with high winds and snowfall totals often measuring over a foot. Annual liquid precipitation (rain) averages {{convert|47.2|in|sigfig=3}} and is plentiful year-round, but with a slightly drier summer. Annual frozen precipitation (snow) averages {{convert|62|in|cm|0}} in the city. However, neighborhoods away from the immediate coast average slightly more, as the warmer ocean waters and onshore flow can cause snow to transition to sleet or rain along the coast. In Southern Maine, winter-season snowstorms can be intense from November through early April, while warm-season thunderstorms are somewhat less frequent than in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern U.S. Direct strikes by hurricanes or tropical storms are rare, partially due to the normally cooler Atlantic waters off the Maine coast (which usually weaken tropical systems), but primarily because most tropical systems approaching or reaching 40 degrees North latitude recurve (due to the Coriolis force) and track east out to sea well south of the Portland area. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|−39|°F|0}} on February 16, 1943, to {{convert|103|°F|0}} on July 4, 1911, and August 2, 1975.<ref name="Portland weatherbox NOAA"/><!-- defined by template: Portland, Maine weatherbox -->

{{main|Neighborhoods in Portland, Maine}}

Portland is organized into neighborhoods generally recognized by residents,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.creativeportland.com/resources/neighborhoods|title=Neighborhoods|work=Portland, Maine|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201192919/http://www.creativeportland.com/resources/neighborhoods|archive-date=February 1, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> but they have no legal or political authority. In many cases, city signs identify neighborhoods or intersections (which are often called corners). Most city neighborhoods have a local association<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginportland.org/|title=Neighborhoods Associations - Portland, ME|website=www.livinginportland.org|accessdate=September 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105032934/http://www.livinginportland.org/|archive-date=January 5, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> which usually maintains ongoing relations of varying degrees with the city government on issues affecting the neighborhood.

On March 8, 1899, Portland annexed the neighboring city of Deering.<ref>{{cite news |title= Shall We Tax the Hunters? |work=Lewiston Evening Journal |date= February 2, 1899 |page=2 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZMIgAAAAIBAJ&pg=926,2137056&dq=portland+deering&hl=en }}</ref> Deering neighborhoods now comprise the northern and eastern sections of the city before the merger.

==Economy==

Portland has become Maine's economic capital because the city has Maine's largest port, largest population, and is close to Boston (105 miles to the south). Over the years, the local economy has shifted from fishing, [[manufacturing]], and agriculture towards a more [[service economy|service-based economy]]. Most national [[financial services]] organizations such as [[Bank of America]] and [[KeyBank|Key Bank]] base their Maine operations in Portland. [[Unum]], [[TruChoice Federal Credit Union]], [[People's United Bank]], [[ImmuCell Corp]], and [[Pioneer Telephone]] have headquarters here, and Portland's neighboring cities of [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]], [[Westbrook, Maine|Westbrook]] and [[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]], provide homes for other corporations including [[Idexx Laboratories|IDEXX]] and [[WEX Inc.|WEX Inc]]. Since 1867, Burnham & Morrill Co., maker of B&M Baked Beans, has had its main plant in Portland and is considered a landmark.

The city's port is also undergoing a revival and the first-ever container train departed from the new International Marine Terminal with 15 containers of locally produced bottled water in early 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/06/poland-spring-to-ship-water-by-train-to-massachusetts-distributors/|title=Poland Spring to ship water by train to Massachusetts distributors|date=2016-04-06|work=Press Herald|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Americold]], a US-based international provider of temperature-controlled storage and distribution, won a bid to develop a state-of-the-art temperature-controlled storage facility adjacent to the port.  The facility will support perishable produce, meats, and seafood imports with direct exports but construction has not yet begun.

Portland has a low unemployment rate (3% in June 2017) when compared to national and state averages.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/web/metro/laummtrk.htm] Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2017</ref> The city and its adjacent communities also have higher median incomes than most of the state.

In January 2020 Portland was announced to be the location of a new research institute that will focus on the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. [[Northeastern University]] was selected by technology entrepreneur David Roux to lead the institute that will include programs that will allow graduate student research.<ref>https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/01/28/northeastern-university-launches-100-million-research-center-maine</ref>

Portland also has a large subsidized housing industry with more than five large real estate companies entirely in the business.

The spire of the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Portland, Maine)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] has been a notable feature of the Portland skyline since its completion in 1854. In 1859, [[Ammi B. Young]] designed the Marine Hospital, the first of three local works by [[Office of the Supervising Architect|Supervising Architects of the U.S. Treasury Department]]. Although the city lost to redevelopment its 1867 [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] post office, which was designed by [[Alfred B.

==== Food history ====
Portland is where national [[Prohibition]] started. Portland mayor and temperance leader [[Neal Dow]] led Maine to ban alcohol sales in 1851.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/maine-first-state-try-prohibition-180963503/|title=Why Was Maine the First State to Try Prohibition?|last=Eschner|first=Kat|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The law led to the [[Portland Rum Riot]] in 1855. Canned corn was developed in Portland by the N. Winslow company. By 1852 the Winslow's Patent Hermetically Sealed Green Corn was a commercial success and the company became a world leader in the canning industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainememory.net/bin/Features?fn=53&fmt=list&n=1&supst=Exhibits&mr=all|title=Maine Memory Network Exhibit - Canning: A Maine Industry|website=www.mainememory.net|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainelegacy.com/14.html|title=Civil War Canning Pioneer Winslow's Cannery / Union Army Contractors|website=www.mainelegacy.com|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> The city's [[Amato's]] Italian delicatessen claims to be the birthplace of the [[Italian sandwich]], called "an Italian" by locals, which Amato's first served in 1903.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatscookingamerica.net/History/HoagieSubmarinePoBoy.htm|title=History Hoagie Sandwich, History Submarine Sandwich, History Po' Boys Sandwich, Poor Boy Sandwich, History Dagwood Sandwich, History Italian Sandwich|date=|publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref> An historic B&M Baked Beans plant built in 1913 remains in operation on the waterfront.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2017/05/14/for-150-years-this-company-knows-beans/|title=Take a look inside the 150-year-old B&M Beans factory in Portland|last=McCanna|first=Ben|date=2017-05-14|website=Press Herald|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

The city has adopted a [[council-manager government|council-manager style government]] that is detailed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080228100402/http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter000.pdf city charter]. The citizens of Portland are represented by a nine-member [[Portland, Maine City Council|city council]] which makes policy, passes ordinances, approves appropriations, appoints the city manager and oversees the municipal government. The city council of nine members is elected by the citizens of Portland. The city has five voting districts, with each district electing a city [[councillor|councilor]] to represent their neighborhood interests for a three-year term. There are also four members of the city council who are elected [[at-large]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter000.pdf|title= City of Portland Code of Ordinances, Charter Rev. 7-01-09  |accessdate=September 10, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191418/http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter000.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

From 1923 until 2011, city councilors chose one of themselves each year to serve as [[Mayor of Portland, Maine|Mayor of Portland]], a primarily ceremonial position. On November 2, 2010, Portland voters narrowly approved a measure that allowed them to elect the mayor. On November 8, 2011, former State Senator and candidate for U.S. Congress [[Michael F. Brennan]] was elected as mayor. On December 5, 2011, he was sworn in as the first citizen-elected mayor in 88 years (see [[Portland, Maine mayoral election, 2011]]). The office of mayor is a four-year position that earns a salary of 150% of the city's median income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxmaine.com/news/politics/Portland-Elected-Mayor-Measure-Passes-106603518.html|title=Portland Elected Mayor Measure Passes|publisher=|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The current mayor is [[Kate Snyder]], who defeated incumbent mayor [[Ethan Strimling]] in the [[2019 Portland, Maine mayoral election]].

A [[city manager]] is appointed by the city council. The city manager oversees the daily operations of the city government, appoints the heads of city departments, and prepares annual budgets. The city manager directs all city agencies and departments, and is responsible for the executing laws and policies passed by the city council.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The current city manager is [[Jon Jennings]].

Aside from the main city council, there is also an elected school board for the [[Portland Public Schools (Maine)|Portland Public School system]]. The school board is made up in the same manner of the city council, with five district members, four at-large members and one chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter002.pdf|title=Copyrighted<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=September 10, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527204438/http://www.portlandmaine.gov/Chapter002.pdf|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> There are also three students from the local high schools elected to serve on the board. There are many other boards and committees such as the Planning Committee, Board of Appeals, and Harbor Commission, etc. These committees and boards have limited power in their respective areas of expertise. Members of boards and committees are appointed by city council members.

On November 5, 2013, Portland voters overwhelmingly approved an ordinance to legalize the possession and private use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for adults, making the city the first municipality in the Eastern United States to do so.<ref name="Koenig">{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/11/06/politics/portland-police-chief-pot-legalization-doesnt-change-anything-about-enforcement-state-law-prevails/?ref=search|title=Portland police chief, Maine attorney general say Portland pot legalization vote won't change enforcement strategies|last=Koenig|first=Seth|date=November 6, 2013|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>

Nova Star officials pledged a smooth transition to the new operator.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fischell |first=Darren |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/10/29/news/state/nova-scotia-to-ditch-maine-based-ferry-operator-after-second-season/ |title=Province prefers past Cat ferry operator over Nova Star for 2016|publisher=Bangordailynews.com |date=October 29, 2015 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref>  The Nova Star was later ordered seized by federal marshals for nonpayment of bills.<ref>{{cite web|last=Betts |first=Stephen |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2015/10/31/news/portland/court-orders-seizure-of-nova-star-ferry/ |title=Court orders seizure of Nova Star ferry|publisher=Bangordailynews.com |date=October 31, 2015 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref>

They stated that the boat would be renamed ''The Cat''<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy |first=Edward |url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/24/nova-scotia-confirms-high-speed-ferry-for-service-to-portland/ |title=New ferry expected to make Portland-Yarmouth trip in 5{{frac|1|2}} hours|newspaper=[[Portland Press Herald]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2016}}</ref> and that service would begin around June 15, after refitting in South Carolina.
