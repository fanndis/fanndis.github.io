His first singing engagements were in nightclubs at age 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà,<ref name=italianalmanac/> a plumber from [[Preganziol]], [[Province of Treviso|Treviso]],<ref name=Florentine/> who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson.<ref name=youngswinger/> Bublé's grandfather paid for his singing lessons.

Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather's collection of [[jazz]] records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. "My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock and roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the [[Mills Brothers]], something magical happened.

At age 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won, but was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich for being underage. Delich entered him in the Canadian Youth Talent Search. After Bublé won that contest, he asked Delich to be his manager. Delich represented him for the next seven years, during which Bublé worked diligently at any job that came along: clubs, conventions, cruise ships, hotel lounges, shopping malls, and talent shows.<ref name=takeovertheworld /><ref name="EWSixThings"/>

In 1996, Bublé appeared in TV's ''Death Game'' (aka ''Mortal Challenge'') as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of ''[[The X-Files]]'' as a member of a submarine crew. His first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning [[Bravo!]] documentary titled ''Big Band Boom!'', directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on [[Vicki Gabereau]]'s national talk show on the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based programme aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with [[Jann Arden]] and [[Elvis Costello]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/B/Buble.html|title=Bublé, Michael |work=The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia|publisher=Canoe/Sun Media|accessdate=April 11, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150412033624/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/B/Buble.html|archivedate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>

==Music career==

===2000–2002: Musical beginnings===
Michael McSweeney, an aide to former [[Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]], saw Bublé's performance at a business party<ref name=takeovertheworld/> and received a copy of Bublé's self-financed independent album. McSweeney showed the album to Mulroney and his wife. Bublé subsequently was invited to sing at the wedding of Mulroney's daughter, Caroline, where he sang [[Kurt Weill]]'s "[[Mack the Knife]]".<ref name=takeovertheworld/> At the wedding Bublé was introduced to [[David Foster]], a multi-[[Grammy Award]]-winning producer and record executive who previously had worked with artists such as [[Madonna]], [[Brandy Norwood]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Céline Dion]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Kenny G]], [[Cher]], [[Josh Groban]], and [[Andrea Bocelli]].<ref name=takeovertheworld/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/david-foster-emc|title=David Foster|work=[[Encyclopedia of Music in Canada]]|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|date=March 21, 2019|accessdate=August 17, 2019}}</ref>

[[David Foster]] was reluctant to sign Bublé to his [[143 Records]] label<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|title=Michael Buble: I was told my music wouldn't sell|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37797675|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}</ref> because he "didn't know how to market this kind of music." Bublé moved to Los Angeles with his agent for a brief period to convince Foster to sign him. Eventually, Foster agreed to produce an album for him if he raised $500,000 to cover the costs of the production (which Bublé did). Foster ended up covering the costs of production under his label, with no assurances of support from [[Warner Brothers]]. After Bublé received the personal stamp of approval and support of Foster's friend, musician and songwriter [[Paul Anka]].
