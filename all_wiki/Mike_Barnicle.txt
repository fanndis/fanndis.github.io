==Early career==
Barnicle was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], grew up in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Boston University]] in 1965. Barnicle worked as a volunteer for the [[Robert F. Kennedy presidential campaign, 1968|Robert F. Kennedy]] 1968 presidential campaign in various states. After Kennedy's assassination, Barnicle attended the [[Requiem Mass]] for Kennedy at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick’s Cathedral]] and later rode on the 21 car funeral train to [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnicle |first=Mike |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-i-saw-on-rfks-funeral-train-50-years-ago-today |title=What I Saw on RFK's Funeral Train 50 Years Ago Today |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=2018-06-05 |accessdate=2018-07-24 }}</ref> He worked as a speechwriter on the U.S. Senate campaign of [[John V. Tunney]] and for Sen. [[Ed Muskie]], when Muskie announced his intention to run in the Democratic Party presidential primaries. Barnicle appeared in a small part in the [[Robert Redford]] film ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]''. While visiting Redford's "Sundance" home in Utah, Barnicle was asked to write a column in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', and his column ran for 24 years between 1973 and 1998.<ref name=sun />

The paper and its columnist won praise with their coverage of the political and social upheaval that roiled Boston after the city instituted a mandatory, court-ordered school desegregation plan in the mid 1970s. In his Pulitzer Prize–winning book ''[[Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families]]'' (1986), [[J. Anthony Lukas]] wrote that Barnicle gave voice to the Boston residents who had been angered by the policy. Lukas singled out Barnicle's column ("Busing Puts Burden on Working Class, Black and White" published in ''The Boston Globe'', October 15, 1974) and interview with Harvard psychiatrist and author Robert Coles as one of the defining moments in the coverage that helped earn the paper the 1975 [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]].<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1975/ Pulitzer Prize Website]</ref>

Over the next three decades, Barnicle became a prominent voice in New England. His columns mixed pointed criticism of government and bureaucratic failure with personal stories that exemplified people's everyday struggles to make a living and raise a family. Tapping into a rich knowledge of local and national politics, Barnicle had unique takes on the ups and downs of luminaries such as Sen. [[Ted Kennedy]], Sen. [[John Kerry]], and longtime Congressional Speaker of the House Thomas [[Tip O'Neill]], as well as Boston mayors [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]], [[Ray Flynn]], and [[Tom Menino]]. In subsequent years, Barnicle's coverage expanded as he reported from [[Northern Ireland]] on the conflict and resolution there to the beaches of [[Normandy]], from where he wrote about the commemorations of [[World War II]] veterans.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130512014815/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8282630.html Amid the graves, gratitude lives on, ''The Boston Globe'', June 7, 1994]</ref>

Barnicle has won local and national awards for both his print and broadcast work over the last three decades, including from the [[Associated Press]], [[United Press International]], National Headliners, and duPont-Columbia University. He holds honorary degrees from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and [[Colby College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/umassmag/archives/1997/summer_97/sum97_barnicle.html|title=Around the Pond Summer 1997|website=www.umass.edu|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/news_events/commencement/history/speakers.cfm|title=Colby College, 1987 Commencement|accessdate=16 January 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004215901/http://www.colby.edu/news_events/commencement/history/speakers.cfm|archivedate=4 October 2012}}</ref>

==''Boston Globe'' controversy==
In 1998, Barnicle resigned from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' due to controversy over two columns, written three years apart. The first column of more than 80 lines of humorous observations had "a series of one-liners that had been lifted from... [[George Carlin]]'s best-selling 1997 book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]''."<ref name="wapo">{{cite news

The paper's editor, Matthew Storin, asked Barnicle to resign "after learning that Barnicle, who claimed never to have read Carlin's book, had held it in his hand and recommended it on Boston's WCVB-TV in June." <ref name ="wapo" /> Barnicle initially refused to resign over Storin's insistence, finally caving in on August 20.<ref name = "latimes"/>

In 1999, Carlin commented to the National Press Club:

{{quote|...someone changed each of the jokes just enough, they thought, to disguise them – that part didn't work – and what they did was make them all worse. ... As an example, one of them was just an observation where I said: "someday I'd like to see the Pope come out on that balcony and give the football scores." And they changed it to baseball! Which is not as funny! For whatever reason, ..."football" is funnier than "baseball" in that sentence.|<ref>{{cite AV media

In a subsequent ''Globe'' review of all of Barnicle's many years of work, a second column was called into question. The October 8, 1995, column recounted the story of two sets of parents with cancer-stricken children. When one of the children died, the parents of the other child, who had begun to recover, sent the dead child's parents a check for $10,000. When the ''Globe'' could not locate the people who had not been publicly identified because they had died as well, Barnicle insisted nonetheless that the story was true. He said he did not obtain the story from the parents but from a nurse, whom he declined to identify. Mrs. Patricia Shairs later contacted the ''Globe'' to indicate that the story Barnicle wrote was about her family, although she said some of the facts were incorrect. The article states that "[...]there are more differences between the column and Shairs's story than similarities".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130512211115/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8500797.html Column had similarities to couple's story, ''The Boston Globe'', August 26, 1998]</ref>

==1998–present==
Six months after his resignation from the ''Globe'', the New York ''Daily News'' recruited Barnicle to write for them, and later the ''Boston Herald''.<ref name="BarnicleHerald">[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/03/08/barnicle_signs_on_as_herald_columnist/ "Barnicle signs on as Herald columnist"].
