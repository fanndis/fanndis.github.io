The '''''Chicago Tribune''''' is a daily newspaper based in [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States, owned by [[Tribune Publishing]]. Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the "World's Greatest Newspaper" (a slogan for which WGN [[WGN (AM)|radio]] and [[WGN-TV|television]] are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and the [[Great Lakes region]]. It had the 6th highest circulation for American newspapers in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 10 Most Popular Daily Newspapers In The United States|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-popular-daily-newspapers-in-the-united-states.html|access-date=October 24, 2017}}</ref>

In the 1850s, under [[Joseph Medill]], the ''Chicago Tribune'' became closely associated with Illinois' favorite son, [[Abraham Lincoln]], and with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s progressive wing. In the 20th century under Medill's grandson, [[Robert R. McCormick]], it achieved a reputation as a crusading paper with a decidedly more American-conservative anti-[[New Deal]] outlook, and its writing reached other markets through family and corporate relationships at the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]].'' The 1960s saw its corporate parent owner, [[Tribune Company]], reach into new markets.  In 2008, for the first time in its over century-and-a-half history, its editorial page endorsed a Democrat, Illinoisan [[Barack Obama]], for U.S. president.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-10-19-chi-tribune-2008-presidential-endorsement-story.html |title=Tribune 2008 presidential endorsement |last=Editorial |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2019-05-22 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Originally published solely as a [[broadsheet]], on January 13, 2009, the ''Tribune'' announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-bn-xpm-2009-01-13-28521446-story.html|title=Tribune to launch tabloid for newsstands|publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=January 13, 2009 |access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref> This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the ''Tribune'' discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its established broadsheet format through all distribution channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2011-08-31-chi-chicago-tribune-broadsheet-edition-to-replace-tabloid-version-on-newsstands-20110831-story.html |title=Chicago Tribune drops tabloid edition of paper|publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=August 31, 2011 |access-date=April 7, 2015}}</ref> In December 2019, [[Alden Global Capital]], a [[New York City]]-based [[hedge fund]], acquired a 32% stake in shares of Tribune Publishing Company.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=David |last2=Marx |first2=Gary |title=Opinion: Will The Chicago Tribune Be the Next Newspaper Picked to the Bone? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/opinion/chicago-tribune-alden-capital.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=19 June 2020 |date=19 January 2020}}</ref>

The ''Tribune''{{'}}s [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]]  displays the [[American flag]], in reference to the paper's former motto, "An American Paper for Americans". The motto is no longer displayed on the [[masthead (American publishing)|masthead]], where it was placed below the flag.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The ''Tribune'' was founded by [[James Kelly (journalist)|James Kelly]], John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the ''Tribune'' was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] or [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] parties against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in elections.<ref>{{Harv|Wendt|1979|pp=23, 27–28}}</ref> By late 1853, it was frequently running [[xenophobic]] editorials that criticized foreigners and [[Roman Catholics]].<ref>{{Harv|Cole|1948|p=14}}</ref> About this time it also became a strong proponent of [[The Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]].<ref>{{Harv|Keefe|1971|p=131}}</ref> However [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855, that the ''Tribune'' formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or [[Know-Nothing movement|Know Nothing]] party, whose candidate [[Levi Boone]] was elected [[Mayor of Chicago]] the following month.<ref>{{Harv|Keefe|1975|pp=233–4}}</ref>

===Medill editorship===

[[File:Cheer up.jpg|thumb|The lead editorial in the first issue the ''Chicago Tribune'' published after the [[Great Chicago Fire]]]]

By about 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General Webster and chief of staff at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], and Dr. Charles H. Ray of [[Galena, Illinois]], through [[Horace Greeley]], convinced [[Joseph Medill]] of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]'s ''[[The Plain Dealer|Leader]]'' to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, Medill became the managing editor, and [[Alfred Cowles, Sr.]], brother of [[Edwin Cowles]], initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the ''Tribune''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rushton, Wyatt|title=Joseph Medill and the Chicago Tribune (thesis)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcc7AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7-IA2|year=1916|access-date=October 24, 2007}} and {{cite book|author=White, James Terry|title=The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Being the History of the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalcyclopa01whitgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/nationalcyclopa01whitgoog/page/n255 224]|publisher=James T.

The ''Tribune'' absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: the ''[[Free West]]'' in 1855, the ''[[Democratic Press]]'' of [[William Bross]] in 1858, and the ''[[Chicago Democrat]]'' in 1861, whose editor, [[John Wentworth (mayor)|John Wentworth]], left his position when elected as [[Mayor of Chicago]]. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as the ''[[Chicago Press & Tribune]]''. On October 25, 1860, it became the ''Chicago Daily Tribune''.<ref>[http://www.archives.chicagotribune.com/1860/10/25 ''Chicago Daily Tribune'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, October 25, 1860.</ref> Before and during the [[American Civil War]], the new editors strongly supported [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom Medill helped secure the presidency in 1860, and pushed an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] agenda. The paper remained a force in Republican politics for years afterwards.

In 1861, the ''Tribune'' published new lyrics by [[William Weston Patton|William W. Patton]] for the song "[[John Brown's Body]]". These rivaled [[The Battle Hymn of the Republic|the lyrics]] published two months later by [[Julia Ward Howe]]. Medill served as mayor of Chicago for one term after the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.

===Years of McCormick===
Under the 20th-century editorship of Colonel [[Robert R. McCormick]], who took control in the 1920s, the paper was strongly [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]] and aligned with the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] in its coverage of political news and social trends. It used the motto "The American Paper for Americans". From the 1930s to the 1950s, it excoriated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and the [[New Deal]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was resolutely disdainful of the British and French, and greatly enthusiastic for [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and Sen. [[Joseph McCarthy]].

When McCormick assumed the position of co-editor (with his cousin [[Joseph Medill Patterson]]) in 1910, the ''Tribune'' was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000.<ref name="current">"Robert R. McCormick," ''Current Biography 1941'', pp. 545–547.</ref> The young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' and ''[[Moon Mullins]]''. They promoted political "crusades", with their first success coming with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, Sen. [[William Lorimer (politician)|William Lorimer]].<ref name="current" /> At the same time, the ''Tribune'' competed with the Hearst paper, the ''[[Chicago American|Chicago Examiner]]'', in a circulation war. By 1914, the cousins succeeded in forcing out Managing Editor William Keeley. By 1918, the ''Examiner'' was forced to merge with the ''[[Chicago Record-Herald|Chicago Herald]]''.

[[File:Chicago Tribune, September 4, 1919.gif|thumb|upright|''Tribune'' in 1919]]

In 1919, Patterson left the ''Tribune'' and moved to New York to launch his own newspaper, the New York ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]''.<ref name="current"/> In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's ''Herald-Examiner'', McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The ''Tribune'' won the battle, adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. Also in 1922, the ''Chicago Tribune'' hosted an international [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] for its new headquarters, the [[Tribune Tower]]. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a [[neo-Gothic]] design by New York architects [[John Mead Howells]] and [[Raymond Hood]].

The newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted round-trip to Europe across [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] in a [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] amphibious aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/tribune/trib06301929/trib06301929003.pdf|title= Great Circle Route|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 30, 1929|access-date=April 7, 2015}}</ref> But, the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, near [[Ungava Bay]] at the tip of [[Labrador]], Canada. The crew were rescued by the Canadian science ship [[CSS Acadia|CSS ''Acadia'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/photo/chi-aviation_01620081001145015,0,4192965.photo |title=Bowler over Evanston |work=Chicago Tribune |date=July 3, 1929 |access-date=April 7, 2015}}</ref>

The ''Tribune''{{'}}s reputation for innovation extended to radio—it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it [[WGN (AM)]], the station [[call letters]] standing for the paper's self-description as the "World's Greatest Newspaper." [[WGN-TV|WGN Television]] was launched April 5, 1948. These broadcast stations remained ''Tribune'' properties for nine decades and were among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. (The ''Tribune''{{'}}s East Coast sibling, the New York ''Daily News'', later established [[WPIX]] television and radio.)

The ''Tribune''{{'}}s legendary sports editor [[Arch Ward]] created the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] in 1933 as part of the city's [[Century of Progress]] exposition.

From 1940 to 1943, the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with ''The Chicago Tribune Comic Book'', responding to the new success of [[comic book]]s. At the same time, it launched the more successful and longer lasting ''[[Spirit (comics)|The Spirit Section]]'', which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/search/label/Chicago%20Tribune%20Comic%20Book |title=Stripper's Guide |publisher=Strippersguide.blogspot.com |access-date=April 7, 2015}}</ref>

Under McCormick's stewardship, the ''Tribune'' was a champion of [[English-language spelling reform|modified spelling]] for simplicity (such as spelling "although" as "altho").<ref>{{cite journal |first=Burke |last=Shipley |title=Spelling the Chicago Tribune Way, 1934–1975, Part I |url=http://spellingsociety.org/uploaded_journals/j24-journal-1420110509.pdf |journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society |publisher=[[English Spelling Society]] |number=24 |date=1998 |access-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=John B. |last=Shipley |title=Spelling the Chicago Tribune Way, 1934–1975, Part II |url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/uploaded_journals/j25-journal-1420110618.pdf |journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society |publisher=[[English Spelling Society]] |number=25 |date=1999 |access-date=January 2, 2016}}</ref> McCormick, a vigorous campaigner for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic boss [[Richard J. Daley]] was elected mayor for the first time.

One of the great scoops in ''Tribune'' history came when it obtained the text of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States war plans on the eve of the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. The ''Tribune''{{'}}s June 7, 1942, front page announcement that the United States had broken Japan's naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret.<ref>{{cite news |title=Navy had Word of Jap Plan to Strike at Sea; Knew Dutch Harbor was a Feint |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1942/06/07/page/1/article/navy-had-word-of-jap-plan-to-strike-at-sea |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=June 7, 1942 |access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors, and had U.S. President [[Franklin D.

===1948 U.S. presidential election===
[[File:Deweytruman12.jpg|thumb|alt=Man in gray suit and wire glasses holding newspaper that says "[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]"|[[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] was widely expected to lose the 1948 election, and the ''Chicago Tribune'' ran the incorrect headline, "[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]".]]

The paper is well known for a mistake it made during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]]. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike. The early returns led editors to believe (along with many in the country) that the Republican candidate [[Thomas Dewey]] would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried the headline "[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]", turning the paper into a collector's item. Democrat [[Harry S. Truman]] won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at [[St. Louis Union Station]].  Beneath the headline was a [[Dewey defeats Truman|false article]], written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to describe West Coast results although written before East Coast election returns were available.

===Pulitzer Prizes===
Colonel McCormick prevented the ''Tribune'' for years from participating in the [[Pulitzer Prize]] competition. But it has won 25 of the awards over the years, including many for [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing|editorial writing]].<ref name="chicagotribune.com">{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/about/custom/company/chi-companypulitzerprizes-htmlstory,0,3933976.htmlstory |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |title=Chicago Tribune Pulitzer Prizes}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Pulitzer Award-winning Journalism |url=http://www.tribpub.com/about/pulitzer-prizes/#tab-1398195802-2-95 |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |access-date=January 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119143648/http://www.tribpub.com/about/pulitzer-prizes/#tab-1398195802-2-95 |archive-date=January 19, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Parade Of Pulitzers |date=June 8, 1997 |first=Patrick T. |last=Reardon |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=June 19, 2020 |url= https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-06-08-9706300098-story.html}}</ref> The ''Tribune'' won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when [[Carey Orr]] won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter [[George William Bliss|George Bliss]] won a Pulitzer the following year for reporting, and reporter [[Bill Jones (journalist)|Bill Jones]] another in 1971 for reporting.<ref name="chicagotribune.com"/> A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by reporter [[William Mullen (journalist)|William Mullen]] and photographer [[Ovie Carter]], who won a Pulitzer for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award in 1976, and architecture critic [[Paul Gapp]] won a Pulitzer in 1979.<ref name="chicagotribune.com"/>

===The Watergate years===
In 1969, under the leadership of publisher [[Harold Grumhaus]] and editor [[Clayton Kirkpatrick]] (1915–2004), the ''Tribune'' began reporting from a wider viewpoint. The paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective in its editorials, but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years.

On May 1, 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the ''Tribune'' published the complete 246,000-word text of the [[Watergate tapes]], in a 44-page supplement that hit the streets 24&nbsp;hours after the transcripts' release by the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] [[White House]]. Not only was the ''Tribune'' the first newspaper to publish the transcripts, but it beat the U.S. [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]'s  published version, and made headlines doing so.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

A week later, after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that "the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to expect from a President is missing from the transcript record." The ''Tribune''{{'}}s editors concluded that "nobody of sound mind can read <nowiki>[the transcripts]</nowiki> and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the Presidency," and called for Nixon's resignation. The ''Tribune'' call for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms of Nixon's hopes for survival in office. [[The White House]] reportedly perceived the ''Tribune''{{'}}s editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal.

On December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that [[Rick Soll]], a "young and talented columnist" for the paper, whose work had "won a following among many ''Tribune'' readers over the last two years", had resigned from the paper. He had acknowledged that a November 23, 1975 column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, were from a notebook where Soll regularly entered words, phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember. The paper initially suspended Soll for a month without pay. Kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of Soll's columns contained information which he knew was false. At that point, ''Tribune'' editors decided to accept the resignation offered by Soll when the internal investigation began.<ref>{{cite news|first=Clayton|last=Kirkpatrick|title=Reporting the news|work=Chicago Tribune|page=4|date=December 7, 1975}}</ref>

After leaving, Soll married [[Pam Zekman]], a Chicago newspaper (and future TV) reporter. He worked for the short-lived ''Chicago Times'' magazine in the late 1980s.

In January 1977, ''Tribune'' columnist Will Leonard died at age 64.<ref>{{cite news|title=Will Leonard, our man 'On Town,' dies|work=Chicago Tribune|page=B7|date=January 7, 1977}}</ref>

In March 1978, the ''Tribune'' announced that it hired columnist [[Bob Greene]] from the ''Chicago Sun-Times''.<ref name=CM/>

===1980s and 1990s===
Kirkpatrick stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Maxwell McCrohon]] (1928–2004), who served as editor until 1981. He was transitioned to a corporate position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left to become editor-in-chief of the [[United Press International]]. [[James Squires (editor)|James Squires]] served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989.

[[Jack Fuller]] served as the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the president and chief executive officer of the ''Chicago Tribune''. [[Howard Tyner]] served as the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing.

The ''Tribune'' won 11 Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name="chicagotribune.com"/> Editorial cartoonist [[Dick Locher]] won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist [[Jeff MacNelly]] won one in 1985. Then, future editor [[Jack Fuller (author)|Jack Fuller]] won a Pulitzer for editorial writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, [[Dean Baquet]], William Gaines and [[Ann Marie Lipinski]] won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, [[Lois Wille]] won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and [[Clarence Page]] snagged the award for commentary. In 1994, [[Ron Kotulak]] won a Pulitzer for explanatory journalism, while [[R. Bruce Dold]] won it for editorial writing. In 1998, reporter [[Paul Salopek]] won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, architecture critic [[Blair Kamin]] won it for criticism.<ref name="chicagotribune.com"/>

In September 1981, baseball writer [[Jerome Holtzman]] was hired by the ''Tribune'' after a 38-year career at the [[Chicago Sun-Times|''Sun-Times'']].

In November 1982, ''Tribune'' managing editor William H.

The ''Tribune'' scored a coup in 1984 when it hired popular columnist [[Mike Royko]] away from the rival ''[[Chicago Sun-Times|Sun-Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jerry|last=Crimmins|author2=[[Rick Kogan]] |title=Mike Royko 1932-1997 - Newspaper legend Mike Royko dies - Pulitzer prize-winning columnist was the voice of Chicago for more than 30 years|work=Chicago Tribune|page=1|date=April 30, 1997}}</ref>

In 1986, the ''Tribune'' announced that film critic [[Gene Siskel]], the ''Tribune''{{'}}s best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague [[Roger Ebert]] decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as ''[[At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]]'' and later known as ''[[Siskel & Ebert & The Movies]]''—from [[Tribune Entertainment]] to [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Disney–ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] unit. "He has done a great job for us," editor James Squires said at the time. "It's a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that." Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's ''Tribune'' bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&dat=19860422&id=AmIPAAAAIBAJ&pg=5742,2075741 |title=Film critic comes to defense of rival Siskel |publisher=The Bulletin |date=April 22, 1986 |access-date=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Siskel remained in that freelance position until he died in 1999.

In December 1995, the alternative newsweekly ''[[Newcity]]'' published a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned in the play ''[[The Front Page]]'') but quickly identified by ''Tribune'' reporters as that of former ''Tribune'' reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to the ''Chicago Reader'' that she had written the diatribe originally for the Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for ''Newcity''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Miner|url=https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=1996/960105/HOTTYPE&search=%22one-year%20residency%22|title=Reader Archive-Extract: 1996/960105/HOTTYPE|publisher=Securesite.chireader.com|date=January 5, 1996|access-date=September 26, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1997, the ''Tribune'' celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime reporter [[Stevenson Swanson]] to edit the book ''Chicago Days: 150 Defining Moments in the Life of a Great City''.

On April 29, 1997, popular columnist [[Mike Royko]] died of a [[brain aneurysm]]. On September 2, 1997, the ''Tribune'' promoted longtime City Hall reporter [[John Kass]] to take Royko's place as the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.<ref>{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Tyner|title=Introducing a new column by John Kass|work=Chicago Tribune|page=1|date=September 2, 1997}}</ref>

On June 1, 1997, the ''Tribune'' published what ended up becoming a very popular column by [[Mary Schmich]] called "Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young," otherwise known as "[[Wear Sunscreen]]" or the "Sunscreen Speech." The most popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single released in 1999, accredited to [[Baz Luhrmann]].

In 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas was fired by the ''Tribune'' after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] for ''[[Emerge (magazine)|Emerge]]'' magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover article on King for the ''Chicago Tribune'' Sunday magazine. The paper decided to fire Thomas—and suspend his photographer on the ''Emerge'' story, Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Tribune'' photographer [[Ovie Carter]] for a month—because Thomas did not tell the ''Tribune'' about his outside work and also because the ''Emerge'' story wound up appearing in print first.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Miner|url=https://securesite.chireader.com/cgi-bin/Archive/abridged2.bat?path=1998/980703/HOTTYPE&search=Ovie|title=Reader Archive-Extract: 1998/980703/HOTTYPE|publisher=Securesite.chireader.com|access-date=September 26, 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The ''Tribune'' has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of [[AOL|America Online]] in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com (1995), [[Metromix]].com (1996), '''ChicagoSports.com''' (1999), '''ChicagoBreakingNews.com''' (2008), and '''[[ChicagoNow]]''' (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as ''[[RedEye]]''.

The conduct later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the age of consent in Illinois.

In May 2004, the ''Tribune'' revealed that freelance reporter [[Mark Falanga]] was unable to verify some facts that he inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant—namely, that the restaurant charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree.

Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press about their issues. "We'll let the e-mail speak for itself," reporter John Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued the effort, which he described as "a brief market research project."<ref name="sdut30apr2009">{{cite news | url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/apr/30/us-tribune-reader-survey-043009/ | title=Reader survey of stories roils tribune newsroom | work=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=April 30, 2009 | agency=Associated Press | access-date=November 25, 2015 | first=Herbert G. | last=McCann}}</ref>

The ''Tribune'' broke the story on May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations by the school's Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of the [[Rod Blagojevich]] administration. Initially denying the existence of a so-called "Category I" admissions program, university President B. Joseph "Joe" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was short and their role was minor, the ''Tribune'', in particular, revealed emails through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative of convicted fundraiser [[Tony Rezko]] to be admitted. The Tribune also later posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/06/09/pols_press_for_hearings_in_uis_cloutgate_scandal |title=Pols press for hearings in UI's 'Cloutgate' scandal |newspaper=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]] |date=June 9, 2009 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |location=[[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area|Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]] |first=Julie |last=Wurth}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=June 7, 2009 |url=http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/06/university-of-illinois-boland-white.html |title=U. of I. leaders urged to resign |publisher=Chicago Breaking News |access-date=September 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622190437/http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/06/university-of-illinois-boland-white.html |archive-date=June 22, 2009 }}</ref> The ''Tribune'' has since filed suit against the university administration under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] to acquire the names of students benefited by administrative clout and impropriety.

In a 2007 statement of principles published in the ''Tribune''{{'}}s print and online editions, the paper's editorial board described the newspaper's philosophy, from which is excerpted the following:
<blockquote>The ''Chicago Tribune'' believes in the traditional principles of limited government; maximum individual responsibility; minimum restriction of personal liberty, opportunity and enterprise. It believes in free markets, free will and freedom of expression. These principles, while traditionally conservative, are guidelines and not reflexive dogmas.

The ''Tribune'' brings a Midwestern sensibility to public debate. It is suspicious of untested ideas.

The ''Tribune'' places great emphasis on the integrity of government and the private institutions that play a significant role in society. The newspaper does this in the belief that the people cannot consent to be governed unless they have knowledge of, and faith in, the leaders and operations of government. The ''Tribune'' embraces the diversity of people and perspectives in its community. It is dedicated to the future of the Chicago region.</blockquote>

The ''Tribune'' has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical of increasing the minimum wage and [[entitlement]] spending. Although the ''Tribune'' criticized the Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] and [[Cook County Board President]] [[Todd Stroger]], to task and calling for their removal from office.

In 2004, the ''Tribune'' endorsed President [[George W. Bush]] for re-election, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois junior U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]]—the first time that it had ever endorsed a Democrat for president.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tribune Endorsement: Barack Obama for president|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 17, 2008|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-10-19-chi-tribune-2008-presidential-endorsement-story.html|access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref> The ''Tribune'' endorsed Obama once again for reelection in 2012,<ref>{{cite news|title= Tribune endorses Obama: Our children's America|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 26, 2012|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2012-10-26-chi-obama-endorsement-chicago-tribune-20121026-story.html|access-date=June 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027072338/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-obama-endorsement-chicago-tribune-20121026,0,5462618.story|archive-date=October 27, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in 2020 would endorse another Democrat, [[Joe Biden]], who had served as vice president under Obama.<ref>[https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html "Editorial: Our Case for Joe Biden over Donald Trump,"] from ''Chicago Tribune'', 9/25/2020</ref>

The ''Tribune'' has occasionally backed independent candidates for president. In 1872, it supported [[Horace Greeley]], a former Republican Party newspaper editor,<ref>{{cite news|title=To-morrow|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|page=4|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=November 4, 1872}}</ref> and in 1912 the paper endorsed [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who ran on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] slate against Republican President [[William Howard Taft]]. In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate, former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], for president, over Republican [[Donald Trump]] and Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-gary-johnson-president-endorsement-edit-1002-20160930-story.html|title=A principled option for U.S. president: Endorsing Gary Johnson, Libertarian|website=Chicagotribune.com|access-date=October 15, 2017}}</ref>

Over the years, the ''Tribune'' has endorsed some Democrats for lesser offices, including recent endorsements of [[Bill Foster (Illinois politician)|Bill Foster]], Barack Obama for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and Democrat [[Melissa Bean]], who defeated [[Philip Crane]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]' longest-serving Republican. Although the ''Tribune'' endorsed [[George Ryan]] in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of the scandal.

==Tribune Company==
{{main|Tribune Media}}
The ''Chicago Tribune'' is the founding business unit of [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]] (since renamed ''Tribune Media''), which included many newspapers and television stations around the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owns the [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] radio station (720&nbsp;AM) and [[WGN-TV]] (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''—which displaced the Tribune as the company's largest property—and the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[baseball]] team. The Cubs were sold in 2009; the newspapers spun off in 2014 as Tribune Publishing and, later, Tronc.

Tribune Company owned the New York ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' from its 1919 founding until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate [[Robert Maxwell]]. The founder of the ''News'', Capt. [[Joseph Medill Patterson]], was a grandson of Joseph Medill and a cousin of ''Tribune'' editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick were enthusiasts of [[spelling|simplified spelling]], another hallmark of their papers for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper ''[[Newsday]]''—founded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter (and Medill's great-granddaughter), [[Alicia Patterson]]—to Long Island cable TV company [[Cablevision]].

From 1925 to 2018, the Chicago Tribune was housed in the [[Tribune Tower]] on North [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] on the [[Magnificent Mile]]. The building is [[Gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] in style, and the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune moved in June 2018 to the Prudential Plaza office complex overlooking Millennium Park after Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower to developers.

The September 2008 redesign (discussed here<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-tribune-redesign-htmlpage,0,7090729.htmlpage|title=It's a whole new day: Your guide to the new Chicago Tribune|publisher=chicagotribune.com|access-date=September 26, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201051645/http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-tribune-redesign-htmlpage,0,7090729.htmlpage|archive-date=February 1, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> on the ''Tribune''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s web site) was controversial and is largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=30261&seenIt=1|title=Trib buries news in redesign test &#124; Crain's Chicago Business|publisher=Chicagobusiness.com|date=July 21, 2008|access-date=September 26, 2009}}</ref> Since then the newspaper has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the old style and a new modern style.

==Zell ownership and bankruptcy==
In December 2007, the Tribune Company was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate [[Sam Zell]] in an $8.2&nbsp;billion deal. Zell was the company's new chairman.<ref name="APBuyoutCloses20071221">{{cite news | url=http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071221/BUSINESS/712210329/1003/NLETTER01 | title=Tribune buyout, at $8.2 billion, closes in Chicago | work=The News Journal | date=December 21, 2007 | agency=Associated Press | access-date=August 6, 2014 | last=Carpenter | first=Dave | location=Wilmington, Delaware | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223090732/http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071221%2FBUSINESS%2F712210329%2F1003%2FNLETTER01 | archive-date=December 23, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> A year after going private, following a $124&nbsp;million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, citing a debt of $13&nbsp;billion and assets of $7.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/12/08/daily16.html|title=Tribune Co. files for bankruptcy protection - Business Courier of Cincinnati|publisher=Bizjournals.com|date=December 9, 2008|access-date=September 26, 2009}}</ref>

Sam Zell originally planned to turn the company into a private company through the creation of an [[Employee stock ownership plan|ESOP]] (employee stock ownership plan) within the company, but due to poor management that existed prior to his ownership, this did not work out as well as he intended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2007/04/employee-ownership-through-esopsa-bad-bargain-becker.html|title=Employee Ownership Through ESOPS:A Bad Bargain-BECKER|access-date=November 15, 2018}}</ref>

As part of its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]]. Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=6426449&page=1|title=Paper Cuts: Did Chicago Tribune Owner Cut Deal to Fire His Editor? - ABC News|publisher=Abcnews.go.com|access-date=September 26, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212084321/http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=6426449&page=1|archive-date=December 12, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary Tribune shareholders participated in a "fraudulent transfer" of wealth.<ref name=wsj>{{cite web|title=Lyondell Suit a Potential Threat for Private Equity|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2011/05/03/lyondell-suit-a-potential-threat-for-private-equity/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 3, 2011|access-date=May 6, 2013|quote=The Lyondell suit alleges that the shareholders participated in a "fraudulent transfer" of wealth from the company and its creditors by knowingly burdening it with debt it couldn't handle, pushing it into bankruptcy less than a year after the close of the buyout... Unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co., the media conglomerate still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, are making essentially the same claim in their high-profile case.}}</ref>

The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 stockholders who bought Tribune stock.<ref name="haunt">{{cite web | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2011-11-27-ct-biz-1127-tribune-stockholders-this-one-20111127-story.html | title=Tribune Co. bankruptcy case haunting former shareholders | work=Chicago Tribune | date=November 27, 2011 | access-date=June 19, 2020| last1=Oneal | first1=Michael | last2=Sachdev | first2=Ameet}}</ref> Prolonged due to these claims against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the Chicago Tribune Company,<ref name=haunt /><ref name=ch11>{{cite web|title=Chicago Tribune Bankruptcy Update|url=http://www.bankruptcylawreview.com/blog/chicago-tribune-bankruptcy-update|work=Bankruptcy Law Review|access-date=May 6, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611114019/http://www.bankruptcylawreview.com/blog/chicago-tribune-bankruptcy-update|archive-date=June 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal and professional fees of $500&nbsp;million were more than twice the usual amount for that size of company.<ref name="Trib20121231">{{cite news|last1=Channick|first1=Robert|title=Tribune Co. emerges from bankruptcy|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-xpm-2012-12-31-chi-a-new-era-dawning-for-tribune-co-20121230-story.html|access-date=June 19, 2020|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=December 31, 2012}}</ref>

The Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy in January 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated on its distressed debt. The reorganized company's plan included selling off many of its assets.<ref name="Trib20121231"/>

==Tribune Publishing divestment==
[[tronc|Tribune Publishing]], owning the ''Chicago Tribune'', ''Los Angeles Times'', and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate publicly traded company in August 2014. The parent Tribune Company was renamed [[Tribune Media]].<ref name="Trib20140805"/> Tribune Publishing started life with a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.<ref name="Trib20140805">{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-tribune-spinoff-complete-0805-biz-20140805-story.html | title=Spun-off Tribune Publishing faces future on its own | work=Chicago Tribune | date=August 5, 2014 | access-date=August 5, 2014 | last=Channick | first=Robert | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805094602/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-tribune-spinoff-complete-0805-biz-20140805-story.html | archive-date=August 5, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Trib20140612">{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-tribune-publishing-finances-20140612-story.html | title=Tribune Publishing to carry $350 million in debt in spinoff | work=Chicago Tribune | date=June 12, 2014 | access-date=August 5, 2014 | last=Channick | first=Robert}}</ref>

Spinning off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%.<ref name="Trib20140612"/> Tribune Media, retaining the non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.<ref name="Trib20140805"/>
