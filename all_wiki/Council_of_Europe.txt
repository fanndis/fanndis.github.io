The '''Council of Europe''' ('''CoE''') ({{lang-fr|Conseil de l'Europe}}, CdE) is an [[international organization|international organisation]] founded in the wake of [[World War II]] to uphold [[European Convention on Human Rights|human rights]], [[democracy]] and the [[Law in Europe|rule of law]] in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/4816408.stm|title=BBC News - Profile: The Council of Europe|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Founded in 1949, it has 47 member states, with a population of approximately 820 million, and operates with an annual budget of approximately 500 million [[euro]]s.<ref>Council of Europe, [http://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/budget Budget], Retrieved: 21 April 2016</ref>

The organisation is distinct from the 27-nation [[European Union]] (EU), although it is sometimes confused with it, partly because the EU has adopted the original [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] which was created by the Council of Europe in 1955,<ref>Council of Europe.

The Council of Europe cannot make binding laws, but it does have the power to enforce select international agreements reached by European states on various topics. The best known body of the Council of Europe is the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which enforces the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

The Council's two statutory bodies are the [[Committee of Ministers]], comprising the foreign ministers of each member state, and the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]], composed of members of the national parliaments of each member state. The [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] is an independent institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness of and respect for human rights in the member states. The [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe|Secretary General]] heads the secretariat of the organisation. Other major CoE bodies include the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]].

The headquarters of the Council of Europe are in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]]. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are its two [[official language]]s. The Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly, and the [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] also use [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] for some of their work.

=== Founding ===

In a speech in 1929, French Foreign Minister [[Aristide Briand]] floated the idea of an organisation which would gather European nations together in a "federal union" to resolve common problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fresques.ina.fr/jalons/fiche-media/InaEdu02042/discours-d-aristide-briand-devant-la-sdn-du-7-septembre-1929-audio.html |title=Lumni &#124; Enseignement - Discours d'Aristide Briand devant la SDN du 7 septembre 1929 |publisher=Fresques.ina.fr |date= |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> But it was Britain's wartime leader Sir [[Winston Churchill]] who first publicly suggested the creation of a “Council of Europe” in a BBC radio broadcast on 21 March 1943,<ref>https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1941-1945-war-leader/national-address/</ref> while the Second World War was still raging. In his own words,<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1943/1943-03-21a.html</ref> he tried to "peer through the mists of the future to the end of the war”, and think about how to re-build and maintain peace on a shattered continent. Given that Europe had been at the origin of two world wars, the creation of such a body would be, he suggested, "a stupendous business". He returned to the idea during a well-known speech at the [[University of Zurich]] on 19 September 1946,<ref name="COE_Churchill">{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Archives/Selection/Churchill/Default_en.asp |title=Winston Churchill and the Council of Europe |work=Council of Europe: Archiving and Documentary Resources |publisher=Council of Europe |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}, including audio extracts</ref><ref name="ENA_Churchill">{{cite web|title=European Navigator (ENA)|url=http://www.ena.lu/the_zurich_speech-020100043.html|accessdate=4 April 2011}} Including full transcript</ref> throwing the full weight of his considerable post-war prestige behind it. But there were many other statesmen and politicians across the continent, many of them members of the [[European Movement International|European Movement]], who were quietly working towards the creation of the Council. Some regarded it as a guarantee that the horrors of war could never again be visited on the continent, others came to see it as a "club of democracies", built around a set of common values that could stand as a bulwark against totalitarian states belonging to the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Others again saw it as a nascent "United States of Europe", the resonant phrase that Churchill had reached for at Zurich in 1946.

[[Willy Brandt]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|German Minister for Foreign Affairs]], is speaking.]]

The future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at the [[Congress of Europe]] which brought together several hundred leading politicians, government representatives and members of civil society in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], in 1948. There were two competing schools of thought: some favoured a classical international organisation with representatives of governments, while others preferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were finally combined through the creation of a Committee of Ministers (in which governments were represented) and a Consultative Assembly (in which parliaments were represented), the two main bodies mentioned in the Statute of the Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary structure was later copied for the [[European Communities]], [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].

The Council of Europe was signed into existence on 5 May 1949 by the [[Treaty of London (1949)|Treaty of London]], the organisation's founding Statute which set out the three basic values that should guide its work: democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It was signed in London on that day by ten states: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]], though Turkey and Greece joined three months later. On 10 August 1949, 100 members of the Council's Consultative Assembly, parliamentarians drawn from the twelve member nations, met in Strasbourg for its first plenary session, held over 18 sittings and lasting nearly a month. They debated how to reconcile and reconstruct a continent still reeling from war, yet already facing a new East&ndash;West divide, launched the concept of a trans-national court to protect the basic human rights of every citizen, and took the first steps in a process that would eventually lead to the creation of the [[European Union]].

In August 1949, [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] resigned as Belgium’s Foreign Minister in order to be elected as the first President of the Assembly. Behind the scenes, he too had been quietly working towards the creation of the Council, and played a key role in steering its early work. However, in December 1951, after nearly three years in the role, Spaak resigned in disappointment after the Assembly rejected proposals for a “European political authority”.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spaak |url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-XML2HTML-EN.asp?SpeechID=271 |title=Speeches made to the Parliamentary Assembly (1949-2018) |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date=1951-12-11 |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> Convinced that the Council of Europe was never going to be in a position to achieve his long-term goal of a unified Europe,<ref>Sandro Guerrieri, "From the Hague Congress to the Council of Europe: hopes, achievements and disappointments in the parliamentary way to European integration (1948–51)."

=== Early years ===
There was huge enthusiasm for the Council of Europe in its early years, as its pioneers set about drafting what was to become the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], a charter of individual rights which - it was hoped - no member government could ever again violate. They drew, in part, on the tenets of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], signed only a few months earlier in Paris. But crucially, where the Universal Declaration was essentially aspirational, the European Convention from the beginning featured an enforcement mechanism - an international Court - which was to adjudicate on alleged violations of its articles and hold governments to account, a dramatic leap forward for international justice. Today, this is the [[European Court of Human Rights]], whose rulings are binding on 47 European nations, the most far-reaching system of international justice anywhere in the world. 

One of the Council's first acts was to welcome [[Germany]] into its fold on 2 May 1951,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/accession_of_germany_to_the_council_of_europe_strasbourg_2_may_1951-en-24be5b53-aefd-4ac1-a21c-c8e514bd1a9f.html |title=Accession of Germany to the Council of Europe (Strasbourg, 2 May 1951) - CVCE Website |publisher=Cvce.eu |date=1951-05-02 |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> setting a pattern of post-war reconciliation that was to become a hallmark of the Council, and beginning a long process of "enlargement" which was to see the organisation grow from its original ten founding member states to the 47 nations that make up the Council of Europe today.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Council of Europe in brief |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/our-member-states |title=Our member States |publisher=Coe.int |date=1949-05-05 |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> Iceland had already joined in 1950, followed in 1956 by Austria, Cyprus in 1961, Switzerland in 1963 and Malta in 1965.

=== Historic speeches at the Council of Europe ===
[[File:Churchill Tha Hague 1948.jpg|thumb|[[Winston Churchill]]'s inaugurational speech of the Council of Europe in The Hague]]
In 2018 an archive of all speeches made to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] by heads of state or government since the Council of Europe's creation in 1949 appeared online, the fruit of a two-year project entitled "Voices of Europe".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-EN.asp |title=Speeches made to the Parliamentary Assembly (by Country) |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> At the time of its launch,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-en.asp?newsid=7112&lang=2 |title=All speeches by heads of state and government to PACE since 1949 online |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> the archive comprised 263 speeches delivered over a 70-year period by some 216 Presidents, Prime Ministers, monarchs and religious leaders from 45 countries - though it continues to expand, as new speeches are added every few months.

Some very early speeches by individuals considered to be "founding figures" of the European institutions, even if they were not heads of state or government at the time, are also included (such as Sir [[Winston Churchill]] or [[Robert Schuman]]). Addresses by eight monarchs appear in the list (such as King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], King [[Albert II of Belgium]] and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri of Luxembourg]]) as well as the speeches given by religious figures (such as [[Pope John Paul II]], and [[Pope Francis]]) and several leaders from countries in the Middle East and North Africa (such as [[Shimon Peres]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Hosni Mubarak]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] or King [[Hussein of Jordan]]).

The full text of the speeches is given in both English and French, regardless of the original language used. The archive is searchable by country, by name, and chronologically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/Speeches/Speech-By-Country-FR.asp |title=Discours prononcés devant l'Assemblée parlementaire (1949-2018) - par pays |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref>

== Aims and achievements ==
Article 1(a) of the Statute states that "The aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic and social progress."<ref>{{cite web|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/001.htm|website=conventions.coe.int|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> Membership is open to all European states who seek harmony, cooperation, good governance and human rights, accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to guarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.

Whereas the member states of the European Union transfer part of their national legislative and executive powers to the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]], Council of Europe member states maintain their sovereignty but commit themselves through conventions/treaties ([[international law]]) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political decisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states working together at the Council of Europe. Both organisations function as concentric circles around the common foundations for European co-operation and harmony, with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The European Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of integration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level. "The Council of Europe and the European Union: different roles, shared values."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/european-union|title=The Council of Europe and the European Union|website=www.coe.int}}</ref> Council of Europe conventions/treaties are also open for signature to non-member states, thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside Europe.

The Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and followed on from the United Nations '[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]' (UDHR).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org}}</ref> The Convention created the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this court that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has violated their fundamental rights and freedoms.

The various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found in detail on its official website. The Council of Europe works in the following areas:

* Protection of the [[rule of law]] and fostering legal co-operation through some 200 conventions and other treaties,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}</ref> including such leading instruments as the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism|Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism]], Conventions against Corruption and Organised Crime,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/173|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/198|title=Details of Treaty No.198: Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism|website=Treaty Office|publisher = Council of Europe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/search-on-treaties/-/conventions/treaty/174|title=Details of Treaty No.174: Civil Law Convention on Corruption|website=Treaty Office|publisher = Council of Europe}}</ref> the [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]], and the [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine|Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=164&CM=8&DF=9/4/2007&CL=ENG|title=Council of Europe Convention for the protection of Human Rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine}}</ref>

The national parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e. comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP [[Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe]] was rapporteur for the drafting of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Dick Marty]]'s reports on secret [[CIA]] detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2006 and 2007. Other Assembly reports were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in Europe, highlighting the political and human rights situation in [[Chechnya]], identifying who was responsible for disappeared persons in [[Belarus]], chronicling threats to freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.
* The [[Congress of the Council of Europe]] (Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe), which was created in 1994 and comprises political representatives from local and regional authorities in all member states. The most influential instruments of the Council of Europe in this field are the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]] of 1985 and the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities of 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/congress/overview|title=In brief|website=Congress<br />of Local and Regional Authorities|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/congress/origins-and-history|title=History|website=Congress<br />of Local and Regional Authorities|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref>

[[File:Council of Europe Agora building in Strasbourg.JPG|thumb|Council of Europe's Agora building]]
The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]], France. First meetings were held in Strasbourg's [[University of Strasbourg|University]] Palace in 1949, but the Council of Europe soon moved into its own buildings. The Council of Europe's eight main buildings are situated in the ''Quartier européen'', an area in the northeast of Strasbourg spread over the three districts of Le Wacken, La Robertsau and Quartier de l'Orangerie, where are also located the four buildings of the [[seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg]], the [[Arte]] headquarters and the seat of the [[International Institute of Human Rights]].

Building in the area started in 1949 with the predecessor of the Palais de l'Europe, the House of Europe (demolished in 1977), and came to a provisional end in 2007 with the opening of the New General Office Building, later named "Agora", in 2008.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.coe.int/t/DC/Press/Source/PressFile_%20AGORA_fr.pdf |date=30 January 2008 |language=French |title=Inauguration of the Agora Building |publisher=Council of Europe |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528112354/http://www.coe.int/t/DC/Press/Source/PressFile_%20AGORA_fr.pdf |archivedate=28 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Palais de l'Europe ([[Palace of Europe]]) and the [[Art Nouveau]] Villa Schutzenberger (seat of the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]]) are in the Orangerie district, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] and the Agora Building are in the Robertsau district.

The Council of Europe was founded on 5 May 1949 by [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Statute of the Council of Europe is signed in London |url=https://70.coe.int/-/1949-statute-of-the-council-of-europe-is-signed-in-london |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019 |quote=On 5 May 1949, at St James’s Palace, London, the Foreign Ministers of Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty establishing the Council of Europe.}}</ref> [[Greece]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Greece joins |url=https://70.coe.int/-/1949-greece-joins |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Greece - Member state |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/greece |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019 |quote=Greece became the 11th member State of the Council of Europe on 9 August 1949.}}</ref> joined three months later, and [[Iceland]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Iceland joins |url=https://70.coe.int/-/1950-iceland-joins |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Iceland - Member state |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/iceland |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019 |quote=Iceland became the 12th member State of the Council of Europe on 7 March 1950.}}</ref> [[Turkey]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey joins |url=https://70.coe.int/-/1950-turkey-joins |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Turkey - Member state |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/turkey |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019 |quote=Turkey became the 13th member State of the Council of Europe on 13 April 1950.}}</ref> and [[West Germany]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Federal Republic of Germany joins the Council of Europe |url=https://70.coe.int/-/1950-federal-republic-of-germany-joins-the-council-of-europe |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Germany - Member state |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/germany |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019 |quote=Germany became the 14th member State of the Council of Europe on 13 July 1950.}}</ref> the next year. It now has 47 member states, with [[Montenegro]] being the latest to join.

Article 4 of the [[Statute of the Council of Europe|Council of Europe Statute]] specifies that membership is open to any "European" State.<ref>{{cite web |title=Full list |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680935bd0 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref> This has been interpreted liberally from the beginning, when Turkey was admitted, to include [[Geography of Europe#Countries bordering or spanning another continent|transcontinental states]] (such as Georgia and Azerbaijan) and states that are geographically Asian but socio-politically European (such as Armenia and Cyprus).

Nearly all [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European states]] have acceded to the Council of Europe, with the exceptions of [[Belarus]] ([[Human rights in Belarus|human rights concerns]] including [[capital punishment in Belarus|active use of the death penalty]]), [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Human rights in Kazakhstan|human rights concerns]]), and the [[Vatican City]] (a [[theocracy]]), as well as some of the territories [[List of states with limited recognition|with limited recognition]].

Besides the status as a full member, the Council of Europe has established [[Member states of the Council of Europe#Observers|other instruments for cooperation and participation]] of non-member states: observer, applicant, special guest, and partner for democracy.

== Co-operation ==

=== Non-member states ===
The Council of Europe works mainly through conventions. By drafting conventions or international treaties, common legal standards are set for its member states. However, several conventions have also been opened for signature to non-member states. Important examples are the [[Convention on Cybercrime]] (signed for example, by Canada, Japan, South Africa and the United States), the [[Lisbon Recognition Convention]] on the recognition of study periods and degrees (signed for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada, the [[Holy See]], Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand and the United States), the Anti-[[Doping (sport)|doping]] Convention (signed, for example, by Australia, Belarus, Canada and Tunisia) and the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] (signed for example, by Burkina Faso, Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal as well as the [[European Community]]). Non-member states also participate in several partial agreements, such as the [[Venice Commission]], the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (GRECO), the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] Commission and the [[North-South Centre]].

Invitations to sign and ratify relevant conventions of the Council of Europe on a case-by-case basis are sent to three groups of non-member entities:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheNonMembres.asp?CM=14&CL=ENG |title=CoE Conventions |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date=31 December 1998 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}</ref>
* Non-European states: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, South Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mauritius, Morocco, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa, Syria, Tajikistan, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Uruguay, Venezuela and the observers Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, United States.
* European states: Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Belarus and the observer Vatican City.
* the European Community and later the [[European Union]] after its [[legal personality]] was established by the ratification of the EU's [[Lisbon Treaty]].

=== European Union ===
{{main|Council of Europe–European Union relations}}
{{Supranational European Bodies|size=400px|align=right}}
The Council of Europe is not to be confused with the [[Council of the European Union]] (the "Council of Ministers") or the [[European Council]]. These belong to the [[European Union]], which is separate from the Council of Europe, although they have shared the same European flag and anthem since the 1980s since they both work for [[European integration]]. Nor is the Council of Europe to be confused with the European Union itself.

The Council of Europe is an entirely separate body<ref name="COE_not_EU">{{cite web| url = http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu/index_en.htm| title = Council of the European Union| publisher =[[European Union]]| accessdate = 2012-05-19}}</ref> from the European Union. It is not controlled by it.

Cooperation between the [[European Union]] and the Council of Europe has recently been reinforced, notably on culture and education as well as on the international enforcement of justice and Human Rights.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=23 May 2007|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}</ref>

The European Union is expected to accede to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (the Convention). There are also concerns about consistency in case law – the [[European Court of Justice]] (the EU's court in [[Luxembourg]]) is treating the Convention as part of the legal system of all [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]] in order to prevent conflict between its judgements and those of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (the court in [[Strasbourg]] interpreting the Convention). Protocol No. 14 of the Convention is designed to allow the EU to accede to it and the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]] contains a protocol binding the EU to join. The EU would thus be subject to its human rights law and external monitoring as its member states currently are.<ref name="Juncker Council">{{cite web|last=Juncker|first=Jean-Claude|authorlink=Jean-Claude Juncker|title =Council of Europe – European Union: "A sole ambition for the European continent"|year=2006|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Sessions/2006/speeches/20060411_report_JCJuncker_EN.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 5 August 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Reform Draft">{{cite web|title=Draft treaty modifying the treaty on the European Union and the treaty establishing the European community|date=24 July 2007|publisher=[[Open Europe]]|url=http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=5 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808073053/http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/translation.pdf|archivedate=8 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Schools of Political Studies===
The Council of Europe Schools of political studies were established to train future generations of political, economic, social and cultural leaders in countries in transition. With the participation of national and international experts, they run annual series of seminars and conferences on topics such as European integration, democracy, human rights, the rule of law and globalisation.  The first School of Political Studies was created in Moscow in 1992. Since then, 20 other schools have been set up along the same lines and now form an Association;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsofpoliticalstudies.eu/index.php/en/ |title=Home |publisher=Schoolsofpoliticalstudies.eu |date= |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> a genuine network now covering the whole of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, as well as some countries in the Southern Mediterranean region.  The Council of Europe Schools of political studies is part of the Education Department which is part of the Directorate of Democratic Participation within the Directorate General of Democracy (“DGII”) of the Council of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/schools-political-studies |title=Schools of Political Studies |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> 

=== United Nations ===
The beginning of co-operation between the CoE and the UN started with the agreement signed by the Secretariats of these institutions on 15 December 1951. On 17 October 1989, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] approved a resolution on granting observer status to the Council of Europe which was proposed by several member states of the CoE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/der/united-nations|title=The Council of Europe's Relations with the United Nations|website=www.coe.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> Currently, the Council of Europe holds [[United Nations General Assembly observers|observer status]] with the [[United Nations]] and is regularly represented in the [[UN General Assembly]]. It has organised the regional UN conferences against racism and on women and co-operates with the United Nations at many levels, in particular in the areas of human rights, minorities, migration and counter-terrorism. In November 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus Resolution (A/Res/71/17) on Cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe whereby it acknowledged the contribution of Council of Europe to the protection and strengthening of human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, welcomed the ongoing co-operation in a variety of fields.

=== Non-governmental organisations ===
Non-governmental organisations ([[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) can participate in the [[INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe]] and become observers to inter-governmental committees of experts. The Council of Europe drafted the [[European Convention on the Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations]] in 1986, which sets the legal basis for the existence and work of NGOs in Europe. Article 11 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right to freedom of association, which is also a fundamental norm for NGOs. The rules for [[Consultative Status]] for INGOs appended to the resolution (93)38 "On relation between the Council of Europe and [[international nongovernmental organizations|non-governmental organisations]]", adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 18 October 1993 at the 500th meeting of the Ministers' Deputies.
On 19 November 2003, the Committee of Ministers changed the consultative status into a participatory status, "considering that it is indispensable that the rules governing the relations between the Council of Europe and NGOs evolve to reflect the active participation of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in the Organisation's policy and work programme".<ref>https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=Res%282003%298&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&Site=CM&BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&BackColorIntranet=EDB021&BackColorLogged=F5D383</ref>

=== Others ===
On 30 May 2018, the Council of Europe signed a [[Memorandum of understanding]] with the European [[Association football|football]] confederation [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UEFA and the Council of Europe sign Memorandum of Understanding |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/newsid=2561781.html |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>

The Council of Europe also signed an agreement with FIFA in which the two agreed to strengthen future cooperation in areas of common interests. The deal which included cooperation between member states in the sport of football and safety and security at football matches was finalized in October 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tass.com/sport/1024752|title=Council of Europe and FIFA ink landmark deal on cooperation in shared areas|work=TASS|access-date=2018-12-03|language=ru}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
=== Privileges and immunities ===
The General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe grants the organisation certain privileges and immunities.<ref name="priv-immu-EC">[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/002.htm General Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe], Council of Europe</ref>

=== Symbol and anthem ===
{{Main|Symbols of Europe|Flag of Europe}}

The Council of Europe created, and has since 1955 used as its official symbol, the [[Flag of Europe|European Flag]] with 12 golden stars arranged in a circle on a blue background.

Its musical anthem since 1972, the "[[European Anthem]]", is based on the "[[Ode to Joy]]" theme from [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|ninth symphony]].

On 5 May 1964, the 15th anniversary of its founding, the Council of Europe established 5 May as [[Europe Day]].<ref name="symbols">{{cite web|title=Flag, anthem and logo: the Council of Europe's symbols |publisher=Council of Europe |url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp |accessdate=5 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731041722/http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/emblems/emblemes.asp |archivedate=31 July 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

The wide private and public use of the European Flag is encouraged to symbolise a European dimension. To avoid confusion with the [[European Union]] which subsequently adopted the same flag in the 1980s, as well as other European institutions, the Council of Europe often uses a modified version with a lower-case "e" surrounding the stars which are referred to as the "Council of Europe Logo".<ref name="symbols"/><ref>{{cite web| title =Logo of the Council of Europe| publisher=Council of Europe| url=http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg| accessdate = 5 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024938/http://www.coe.int/02/Logo/Pictures/LogoCoE/LogoCoe.jpg| archivedate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

Issues have been raised regarding [[Azerbaijan]]'s relationship to the Council of Europe, including allegations that Azerbaijan has, over a sustained period, provided bribes to Council members to vote down criticism of the authoritarian rule of the [[Ilham Aliyev|Aliyev]] regime and support motions advantageous to Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan joined the Council of Europe in 2001. Since September 2014 [[Human Rights Watch]] said that Azerbaijan's <blockquote>"systematic crackdown on human rights defenders and other perceived government critics shows sheer contempt for its commitments to the Council of Europe".<ref name="HRW_Criticism">{{cite news|last1=Human Rights Watch|title=Azerbaijan: Government Repression Tarnishes Chairmanship Council of Europe’s Leadership Should Take Action|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/09/29/azerbaijan-government-repression-tarnishes-chairmanship|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=29 September 2014}}</ref> </blockquote>In 2017 Council member and Italian politician Luca Volontè was accused by Italian prosecutors of receiving over 2.3 million euros in bribes in exchange for working for Azerbaijan in the parliamentary assembly, and that in 2013 he played a key role in orchestrating the defeat of a highly critical report on the abuse of political prisoners in Azerbaijan.<ref>Jennifer Rankin, ''Council of Europe urged to investigate Azerbaijan bribery allegations'', The Guardian, 1 February 2017 [https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/01/council-of-europe-urged-investigate-azerbaijan-bribery-allegations].</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Valencia |url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/heaping-on-the-caviar-diplomacy |title=Heaping on the Caviar Diplomacy |publisher=1843magazine.com |date=2020-06-19 |accessdate=2020-09-24}}</ref> The money was paid to Volontè in monthly instalments of 100,000 euros, starting in 2013, via four anonymous offshore companies.
