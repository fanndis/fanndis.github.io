==Premiership and aftermath==
In January 2005, Hsieh was appointed premier, forcing him to leave his post as mayor of [[Kaohsiung]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Silitonga|first1=Siska|title=Taiwan President Picks New Cabinet Leader|url=http://m.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-01-25-voa15/305196.html|accessdate=10 June 2016|agency=Voice of America|date=25 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Chen names Frank Hsieh as new premier|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/detail.asp?id=57447|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=China Post|date=26 January 2005}}</ref> [[Chen Chi-mai]] succeeded him as acting mayor.

Regarding [[Ma Ying-jeou]]'s idea of a "cross-strait common market," Hsieh states that if Taiwan only focuses on the economy, it will end up like [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], whose only goal in life is to make money. Hsieh believes that improving the economy is as important as preserving national dignity, and that the goal of economic development is more than just making money, but it is also improving the happiness of people.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ko|first1=Shu-ling|title=Hsieh clarifies stance on investment from China|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/10/19/2003383788|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=19 October 2007}}</ref>

Following the DPP's poor performance in the [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|2008 legislative election]], Hsieh replaced Chen Shui-bian as party chairman.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ko|first1=Shu-ling|last2=Shih|first2=Hsiu-chuan|title=DPP to elect new chairman on May 25|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/03/26/2003407115|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=26 March 2008}}</ref>

In January 2008, Hsieh accused candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] of having a United States [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. Subsequent investigations revealed that one of Ma's sisters and one of his two daughters are [[US citizen]]s. Hsieh stated that if Ma made public documented proof that he had renounced the green card, Hsieh would withdraw from the election.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shan|first1=Shelley|title=6 days to go: Chen vows to quit if Ma proves he has no green card|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/03/16/2003405765|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=16 March 2008}}</ref>

The election was devastating to Hsieh and the DPP because he lost by a wider-than-expected margin of 17%. Hsieh had stated that if he lost this election, he would not run for office again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/03/23/2003406736|title=Presidential election 2008: Losing Ticket: Hsieh congratulates the victor|date=2008-03-23|accessdate=2013-10-10|first=Shu-ling|last=Ko|publisher=Taipei Times}}</ref> He resigned from the DPP chairmanship to take responsibility for the defeat.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ko|first1=Shu-ling|title=Hsieh resigns as chairman of the DPP|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/03/27/2003407236|accessdate=11 June 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=27 March 2008}}</ref> [[Tsai Ing-wen]] was elected as the new chairperson of the DPP.

==Cross-strait relations==

===2012 mainland visit===

On October 2012, Hsieh went to [[mainland China]] for five days as the highest-ranking DPP official ever to visit. However, the trip was made in no political capacity, but rather as a private citizen. He visited [[Xiamen]] and the [[Dongshan County|Dongshan Islands]] in [[Fujian]] as well as [[Beijing]] on 4–8 October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/10/02/2003544157 |title=Frank Hsieh confirms visit to China |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>

He met with [[Dai Bingguo]], a [[State Councilor]], [[Chen Yunlin]], the President of [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] and [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]], Director of the [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the People's Republic of China.

Although both sides agreed on the [[One-China policy]], which governs [[Cross-Strait relations]], Hsieh prefers to have a new consensus he called {{ill|Two Sides, Two Constitutions|zh|憲法各表}} instead of the [[1992 consensus]].

Hsieh reiterated his "Two Sides, Two Constitutions" initiative while on an April 2013 visit to the United States, and urged [[Government of China|Beijing]] to accept difference across the [[Taiwan Strait]] for both sides being able to facilitate dialogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/04/12/2003559436 |title=Hsieh defends cross-strait initiative |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>

===Hong Kong cross-strait forum===

In late June 2013, Hsieh attended a two-day forum on [[cross-strait relations]] entitled "Development and Innovation of Cross-Strait Relations" in [[Hong Kong]]. The forum was co-organized by Taiwan-based [[Taiwan Reform Foundation]] and Beijing-based [[Taiwan Research Institute]]. Before the forum, Hsieh attended a dinner hosted by [[Tung Chee Hwa]], former [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] on Friday evening.<ref>{{cite web |author=(GMT+8) |url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130629000084&cid=1101 |title=Frank Hsieh calls for tolerance in cross-strait relations｜Politics｜News｜WantChinaTimes.com |publisher=Wantchinatimes.com |date=2013-06-29 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130701061125/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130629000084&cid=1101 |archivedate=July 1, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Hsieh said that mutual trust between DPP and [[Government of China|Beijing]] was important and that all of the bilateral exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should benefit the public and address their needs. He also added that rebalancing cross-strait interactions is important as well. He once again reiterated his '[[constitutions with different interpretations]]' view that Taipei and Beijing can coexist if both sides respect each other's constitutional legitimacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2013/07/01/2003566053 |title=Hsieh wraps up cross-strait forum in HK |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref>
