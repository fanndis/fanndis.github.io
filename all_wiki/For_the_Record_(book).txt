'''''For the Record''''' is a [[memoir]] by the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[David Cameron]], published by William Collins, an imprint of [[HarperCollins UK]], on 19 September 2019. It gives an insight into his life at [[10 Downing Street]] as well as inside explanations of the decisions taken by his government. 

== History ==
Cameron signed an £800,000 contract with HarperCollins UK in 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/25/david-cameron-signs-deal-autobiography-eu-referendum|title=David Cameron signs deal to write tell-all autobiography|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=2016-10-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-05-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> selling it the rights to the publication of a 'frank' account of his time in [[Downing Street]]. The autobiography was initially planned to be released in 2018, but was delayed so that Cameron would not be seen as a "backseat driver" in [[Theresa May]]’s handling of [[Brexit]]. In April 2017, it was highly documented that Cameron had purchased a £25,000 [[Shed|garden shed]] to write in, in a style similar to past writers [[Roald Dahl]] and [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39761410|title=David Cameron buys £25,000 shed|date=2017-04-30|access-date=2019-05-17|language=en-GB}}</ref> The title and publication date of the book were released in May 2019, as ''For the Record'', to be published on 19 September, just ten days before the [[Conservative Party Conference (UK)|Conservative Party Conference]] and a little over a month before the UK's EU exit date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/16/david-cameron-book-for-the-record-to-be-published-in-september|title=David Cameron's book to be published in September|last=Perraudin|first=Frances|date=2019-05-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-05-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Cameron said: "It was an immense privilege to lead the Conservative Party for more than a decade and the country for over six years as Prime Minister. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to explain the decisions I took and why I took them. I will be frank about what worked and what didn’t." He noted that two working titles for the book were ''Decisions'' and ''Right at the Centre''.

== Synopsis ==
Cameron said that his aim in writing the book was to "correct the record" where he thought it was wrong.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-25/david-cameron-for-the-record-book-review-legacy-beyond-brexit|title=David Cameron For the Record Book Review: Legacy Beyond Brexit|last=Ross|first=Tim|date=2019-09-25|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> It covers his decision to call the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]] on the UK's [[European Union]] membership and its outcome, which led him to quit as Prime Minister and as MP for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] two months later. It also describes the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]] and his reforms to economy, welfare and education. His controversial foreign policy is mentioned, as is the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|2013 legalisation]] of same-sex marriage under his government.

The book addresses the effects of the severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy suffered by Cameron's son Ivan who died at the age of 6. ''For the Record'' is dedicated to Cameron's wife [[Samantha Cameron|Samantha]].

William Collins' overview said that Cameron gives "for the first time, his perspective on the EU referendum and his views on the future of Britain's place in the world in the light of Brexit".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/for-the-record-david-camerons-autobiography-gets-release-date-11721627|title=For The Record: David Cameron's autobiography gets release date|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Writing in the [[I (newspaper)|''i'']], James Hanning, a biographer of Cameron, said "his book displays all the sensitivity and communication skills he showed in office... Cameron is said to have not enjoyed writing this book, but it doesn't feel that way. Despite its demands, he gives every sense of having enjoyed office. Until June 2016, that is."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/books/david-cameron-for-the-record-review-revelations-omissions-regrets-634096|title=David Cameron, For the Record, review: Memoir has plenty of revelations — and omissions|last=Hanning|first=James|date=18 September 2019|website=inews|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

[[John Rentoul]], the chief political commentator for ''[[The Independent]]'', compared the book to [[Tony Blair]]'s memoir, ''[[A Journey]]'', and said "Cameron makes his case with style. The book is easy to read, with some nice self-deprecating touches."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/david-cameron-book-review-for-the-record-memoir-brexit-referendum-a9111296.html|title=David Cameron’s memoir of failure carries eerie echoes of Tony Blair|last=Rentoul|first=John|date=19 September 2019|website=The Independent|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

[[The Daily Telegraph|''The Telegraph'']] called the book "well-written and lucid" and said "To Cameron's great credit, the importance of family shines throughout this book... He details a patrician, gilded, almost Edwardian upbringing, growing up in a [[Berkshire]] rectory with a nanny, boarding school at the age of seven, [[Eton College|Eton]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. He married a beautiful and supportive wife, their happiness shaken by the birth of a disabled son Ivan, who died aged six. His account of that tragedy is heartbreaking."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/record-david-cameron-reviewa-lucid-heart-breaking-memoir-cameron/|title=For the Record by David Cameron, review: A lucid, heart-breaking memoir – but is Cameron fooling himself?|last=Johnston|first=Philip|date=2019-09-18|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-09-19|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Jonathan Freedland]] said that the book "reminds you why Cameron dominated British politics for so long. The prose is, like him, smooth and efficient. There are welcome splashes of colour."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/19/david-cameron-autobiography-for-the-record-review-brexit-referendum|title=For the Record: David Cameron's memoir is honest but still wrong|last=Freedland|first=Jonathan|date=2019-09-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Telegraph'']], [[Allison Pearson]] called it "an exhaustive (and exhausting) case for the defence", in which "the author is like a driver who, in a moment of madness, caused an almighty pile-up and tries to convince a jury to go easy on him, offering plentiful evidence of previous good conduct."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/record-david-cameron-review-hadnt-chosen-head-heart/|title=For the Record by David Cameron, review: If only he hadn’t chosen head over heart|last=Pearson|first=Allison|date=2019-09-22|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-09-24|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

Writing in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', editor (and former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Cameron) [[George Osborne]] found it to be "one of the very best" political memoirs, saying "His book has been so hard for him to write. It's been a kind of purgatory for him, motivated by a sense of duty that Prime Ministers should explain why they did what they did, for the record. It's why it is so good." He clarified "I'm not neutral as Cameron is my friend."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/david-cameron-for-the-record-review-george-osborne-a4240941.html|title=George Osborne: My friend David’s memoir is a great political read|date=2019-09-19|website=Evening Standard|language=en|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>

In ''[[The Times]]'', [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]] called the book "a traditional exercise in self-justification" and said that its publication "could hardly be worse timed. It is as if [[Stanley Baldwin]], another quintessential Tory leader, had published his memoirs at the height of [[the Blitz]]."<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/my-articles/for-the-record-by-david-cameron-review-robert-harris-has-no-truck-with-the-former-pms-memoir-jplp0mfr7|title= For the Record by David Cameron review — Robert Harris has no truck with the former PM’s memoir|last=Harris|first=Robert|date=2019-09-28|work=The Times|access-date=2019-09-29|language=en-GB|issn=1479-2559}}</ref>
