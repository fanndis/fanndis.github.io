''The Forward''{{'}}s perspective on world and national news and its reporting on the Jewish perspective on modern United States have made it one of the most influential American Jewish publications. ''The Forward'' is published by an independent [[not-for-profit]] association. It has a politically [[Progressivism|progressive]] editorial focus.<ref>Ricki Hollander, [http://www.camera.org/article/jewish-journalism-focus-on-the-forward "Jewish Journalism: Focus on the Forward"], 15 November 2017, [[CAMERA]].</ref>

The Yiddish Forward (''Forverts'') is a clearinghouse for the latest developments in the Yiddish world with almost daily news reports related to Yiddish language and culture as well as videos of cooking demonstrations, Yiddish humor and new songs. A Yiddish rendition of the [[Leonard Cohen]] song "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]", translated and performed by klezmer musician [[Daniel Kahn & the Painted Bird#Daniel Kahn|Daniel Kahn]], garnered over a million views.

On January 17, 2019, the publication announced it would be ceasing its print edition and would only be publishing its English and Yiddish editions online.

==History==
{{Yiddish Journalism}}

===Origins===
The first issue of ''Forverts'' appeared on April 22, 1897, in New York City.<ref name="Manor3">Ehud Manor, ''Forward: The Jewish Daily Forward (Forverts) Newspaper: Immigrants, Socialism and Jewish Politics in New York, 1890–1917.'' Eastbourne, England: Sussex Academic Press, 2009; pg. 3.</ref> The paper was founded by a group of about 50 [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking [[socialist]]s who had organized three months earlier as the Forward Publishing Association.<ref name="Manor3" /> The paper's name, as well as its political orientation, was borrowed from the [[German Social Democratic Party]] and its organ ''[[Vorwärts]]''.

[[File:Cahan-Abraham-bust.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Abraham Cahan]], patriarch of ''The Forward'' until 1946]]

''Forverts'' was a successor to New York's first Yiddish-language socialist newspaper, ''Di Arbeter Tsaytung'' (''The Workman's Paper''), a weekly established in 1890 by the fledgling Jewish trade union movement centered in the [[United Hebrew Trades]], as a vehicle for bringing socialist and trade unionist ideas to Yiddish-speaking immigrants, primarily from eastern Europe.<ref name="Manor4">Manor, ''Forward,'' pg. 4.</ref><ref>''Dos Abend Blatt'' was established October 15, 1894 and terminated April 23, 1902. For further bibliographic information, see: Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s–1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 555.</ref> This paper had been merged into a new Yiddish daily called ''[[Dos Abend Blatt]]'' (The Evening Paper) as its weekend supplement when that publication was launched in 1894 under the auspices of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP).<ref name="Manor4" /> As this publication established itself, it came under increased political pressure from the de facto head of the SLP, [[Daniel De Leon]], who attempted to maintain a rigid ideological line with respect to its content.<ref>Manor, ''Forward,'' pp. 4–5.</ref> It was this centralizing political pressure which had been the motivating factor for a new publication.

[[File:waiting for the forwards.jpg|thumb|Newsboys for the ''Forward'' wait for their copies in the early morning hours in March 1913]]

Chief among the dissident socialists of the Forward Publishing Association were [[Louis Miller]] and [[Abraham Cahan]]. These two founding fathers of ''The Forward'' were quick to enlist in the ranks of a new rival socialist political party founded in 1897, the [[Social Democratic Party of America]], founded by the nationally famous leader of the 1894 [[American Railway Union]] strike, [[Eugene V. Debs]], and [[Victor L. Berger]], a German-speaking teacher and newspaper publisher from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. Both joined the SDP in July 1897.<ref>Manor, ''Forward,'' pg. 7.</ref>

Despite this political similarity, Miller and Cahan differed as to the political orientation of the paper and Cahan left after just four months to join the staff of ''The Commercial Advertiser,'' a well-established [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] newspaper also based in New York City.<ref>Manor, ''Forward,'' pp. 8–9.</ref>

For the next four years Cahan remained outside of ''The Forward'' office, learning the newspaper trade in a financially successful setting. He only returned, he later recalled in his memoirs, upon the promise of "absolute full power" over the editorial desk.<ref>Abraham Cahan, ''Bleter fun main Leben.'' New York: Forward Association, 1927; vol. 4, pg. 342. Quoted in Manor, ''Forward,'' pg. 9.</ref>

The circulation of the paper, which was described as "one of the first national newspapers,"<ref>{{cite journal  
   |journal=[[The New York Observer|The Observer]]
   |url=https://observer.com/2013/10/seth-lipsky-looks-forward
   |title=Seth Lipsky Looks Forward: New bio takes on Abraham Cahan, 'the first neoconservative'
   |author=Matthew Kassel |date=October 15, 2013}}</ref> grew quickly, paralleling the rapid growth of the Yiddish speaking population of the United States. By 1912 its circulation was 120,000,<ref name=NYTimes>Christopher Gray, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E7DA1131F93AA25754C0A96E958260  "Streetscapes/The Jewish Daily Forward Building, 175 East Broadway; A Capitalist Venture With a Socialist Base"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 2, 2007.</ref> and by the late 1920s/early 1930s, ''The Forward'' was a leading U.S. metropolitan daily with considerable influence and a nationwide circulation of more than 275,000<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=History>[http://www.forward.com/about/history/ "Our history"], ''Forward'' website. Accessed April 2, 2007.</ref> though this had dropped to 170,000 by 1939 as a result of changes in U.S. immigration policy that restricted the immigration of Jews to a trickle.<ref name=NYTimes/>

Early on, ''The Forward'' defended trade unionism and moderate, democratic socialism.  The paper was a significant participant in the activities of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]]; [[Benjamin Schlesinger]], a former president of the ILGWU, became the general manager of the paper in 1923, then returned to the presidency of the union in 1928. The paper was also an early supporter of [[David Dubinsky]], Schlesinger's eventual successor.

[[File:forward roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This November 1, 1936, magazine section of ''The Forward'' illustrates its evolution from a [[Democratic Socialism|Democratic Socialist]] publication to a [[Social Democracy|Social Democratic]] supporter of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s "[[New Deal]]"]]
The best-known writer in the ''Yiddish Forward'' was [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] as well as other well known Socialist literary and political figures, such as [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Morris Winchevsky]].

===Modern times===
By 1962, circulation was down to 56,126 daily and 59,636 Sunday,<ref name=Time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827975,00.html "The Victim of Success"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', December 28, 1962.</ref> and by 1983 the newspaper was published only once a week, with an English supplement.<ref name=History/> In 1990, the English supplement became an independent weekly<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[Advertising Age]]
   |title=Jewish weekly goes nat'l  |date=June 11, 1990 |page=50
   |quote=going national with an English-language weekly}}</ref> which by 2000 had a circulation of 26,183, while the Yiddish weekly had a circulation of 7,000 and falling.<ref name=Nation>Alterman, Eric (May 22, 2000). "[https://www.thenation.com/article/back-forward Back to the ''Forward'']. ''[[The Nation]]''. Retrieved April 1, 2017.</ref>

As the influence of the Socialist Party in both American politics and in the Jewish community waned, the paper joined the American liberal mainstream though it maintained a [[social democracy|social democratic]] orientation. The English version has some standing in the Jewish community as an outlet of liberal policy analysis. For a period in the 1990s, conservatives came to the fore of the English edition of the paper, but the break from tradition didn't last. (A number of conservatives dismissed from ''The Forward'' later helped to found the modern ''[[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]''.)

The Yiddish edition has recently enjoyed a modest increase in circulation as courses in the language have become more popular among university students; circulation has leveled out at about 5,500. [[Boris Sandler]], one of the most significant contemporary secular writers in Yiddish, was the editor of the Yiddish ''Forward'' for 18 years, until March 2016; the new editor who succeeded him is [[Rukhl Schaechter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/335537/boris-sandler-retires-as-editor-of-yiddish-forward/|title=Boris Sandler Retires as Editor of Yiddish Forward|date=March 9–11, 2016|website=The Forward|access-date=June 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>Kaplan, Rose (May 17, 2016).

Retrieved April 1, 2017.</ref>

From 2013 to 2017, prior to the current format as a monthly magazine, ''The Forward'' was published as a newspaper in separate English weekly and Yiddish biweekly editions, and online daily. Each was effectively an independent publication with its own contents. Jane Eisner became the first female editor in chief of the English ''Forward'' in June 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/business/media/13forward.html?fta=y|title=A New Editor at the Forward|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=September 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name="womensenews.org">Besa Luci, [http://womensenews.org/story/journalist-the-month/080701/eisner-breaks-glass-stelya-at-jewish-forward "Eisner Breaks Glass Stelya at Jewish Forward,"] WeNews, July 1, 2008.</ref> The previous editor in chief was [[J.J.

In August 2015, ''The Forward'' received wide attention for reporting from Iran<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cohler-Esses|first1=Larry|title=A Jewish Journalist's Exclusive Look Inside Iran|url=http://forward.com/news/318930/a-jewish-journalists-exclusive-look-inside-iran/|access-date=August 19, 2015|publisher=The Forward|date=August 12, 2015}}</ref> at a charged moment in American politics, as the U.S. Congress was ramping up to a vote on an accord reached the month before to limit Tehran's nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Assistant Managing Editor [[Larry Cohler-Esses]] was, in the words of ''[[The New York Times]]'', "The first journalist from an American Jewish pro-Israel publication to be given an Iranian visa since 1979."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Rick|title=Reporting From Iran, Jewish Paper Sees No Plot to Destroy Israel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/world/middleeast/reporting-from-iran-jewish-paper-sees-no-plot-to-destroy-israel.html|access-date=August 19, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 12, 2015}}</ref>

For a few years, there was also a Russian edition. The website of ''The Forward'' describes its formation: "In the fall of 1995 a Russian-language edition of the Forward was launched, under the editorship of [[Vladimir Yedidowich|Vladimir "Velvl" Yedidowich]]. The decision to launch a Russian Forward in the crowded market of Russian-language journalism in New York followed approaches to the Forward Association by a number of intellectual leaders in the fast-growing émigré community who expressed an interest in adding a voice that was strongly Jewish, yet with a secular, social-democratic orientation and an appreciation for the cultural dimension of Jewish life."

The Russian edition was sold to [[RAJI]] (Russian American Jews for Israel) in 2004, although initially it kept the name.<ref name=Voice>Murphy, Jarrett (January 11, 2005). "[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/forward-backlash-6405283 ''Forward'' Backlash]". ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Retrieved April 1, 2017.</ref> In contrast to its English counterpart, the Russian edition and its readership were more sympathetic to right-wing voices. In March 2007, it was renamed the ''Forum''.

Around the same time in 2004, the Forward Association also sold off its interest in [[WEVD]] to [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s sports division, [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]].

The name of the publication was shortened to ''The Forward'' in April 2015.<ref name="assimilating" />

As of July 2016, ''The Forward'' began publishing a monthly magazine.  The last newspaper published was the June 30, 2016 issue.<ref>Sore-Rokhl Schaechter: [http://yiddish.forward.com/articles/196439/big-changes-ahead-at-the-forverts/?p=all “Groyse enderungen baym ''Forverts''.”] Online April 28, 2016, in print May 13, 2016.</ref>

At the peak of its circulation, the Forward erected a ten-story office building at 175 [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]] on the [[Lower East Side]], designed by architect George Boehm and completed in 1912. It was a prime location, across the street from [[Seward Park (Manhattan)|Seward Park]]. The building was embellished with marble columns and panels and stained glass windows.

==Forward 50==
The "Forward 50" is a list of fifty Jewish-Americans "who have made a significant impact on the Jewish story in the past year", published annually as an editorial opinion of ''The Forward'' newspaper since 1994.<ref name=home>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/forward-50/ |title=Official Website |work=The Forward |access-date=June 29, 2011}}</ref> The list was the initiative of [[Seth Lipsky]], founding editor of the English ''Forward''.<ref name=f2009>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/forward-50-2009/#toppicks |title=2009 Forward 50 |publisher=Forward |access-date=June 29, 2011}}</ref>

According to the magazine's website, this is not a scientific study, but rather the opinion of staff members, assisted by nominations from readers. ''The Forward'' does not endorse, or support any of the individuals mentioned in the listing. The rankings are divided into different categories (which may vary from year to year): Top Picks, Politics, Activism, Religion, Community, Culture, Philanthropy, Scandals, Sports and, new in 2010, Food.<ref name=home/>

The list also includes those Jews whose impact in the past year has been dramatic and damaging.<ref name=f2009/>

==The Forward in English==
''The Forward'', described in 2019 as "a 122-year-old Jewish publication" that "began as a Yiddish-language daily newspaper" while adding "English-language editions in the 1980s," as of then "produces articles in both languages online."<ref>{{cite newspaper
