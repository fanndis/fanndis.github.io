The '''Creative Arts Emmys''' are a class of [[Emmy Award]]s presented in recognition of technical and other similar achievements in American television programming. They are commonly awarded to behind-the-scenes personnel such as [[art director|production designers, set decorator]]s, [[video editor]]s, [[costume designer]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[Casting (performing arts)|casting director]]s, and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Creative Arts Emmy Awards Show|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/emmys/creative-arts-emmys|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Television Academy|language=en}}</ref>

The Creative Arts category also includes awards for outstanding animated programs, commercials, and guest actors.

Both the Primetime and Daytime awards each present their Creative Arts Emmys at separate Creative Arts ceremonies on the weekend before their respective main ceremonies. Both the primary and the creative arts for sports are all given away at one ceremony.
