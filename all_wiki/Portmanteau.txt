A portmanteau word is similar to a ''[[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]'', but contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'' to make ''don't'', whereas a portmanteau is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a single concept. A portmanteau also differs from a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]], which does not involve the truncation of parts of the [[stem (linguistics)|stems]] of the blended words. For instance, ''starfish'' is a compound, not a portmanteau, of ''star'' and ''fish'', as it includes both words in full.

== Origin ==
The word ''portmanteau'' was introduced in this sense by [[Lewis Carroll]] in the book ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871),<ref name="oed">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title =portmanteau, ''n.'' |encyclopedia= Oxford English Dictionary, third edition |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/148217 |accessdate =23 February 2011}}</ref> where [[Humpty Dumpty]] explains to Alice the coinage of unusual words used in "[[Jabberwocky]]".<ref name="multiple">Fromkin, V., Rodman, R., and Hyams, N. (2007) ''An Introduction to Language'', Eighth Edition. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth. {{ISBN|1-4130-1773-8}}.</ref> ''Slithy'' means "slimy and lithe" and ''mimsy'' means "miserable and flimsy". Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice the practice of combining words in various ways:
{{Quote|You see it's like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.}}

In his introduction to ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', Carroll again uses ''portmanteau'' when discussing [[Blend word|lexical selection]]:<ref name="multiple" />
{{quote|Humpty Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. For instance, take the two words "fuming" and "furious". Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first … if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say "frumious".}}

In then-contemporary English, a portmanteau was a [[Portmanteau (suitcase)|suitcase]] that opened into two equal sections. According to the [[OED Online]], a portmanteau is a "case or bag for carrying clothing and other belongings when travelling; (originally) one of a form suitable for carrying on horseback; (now esp.) one in the form of a stiff leather case hinged at the back to open into two equal parts".<ref name=OED_online_portmanteau/> According to [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] (AHD), the etymology of the word is the French {{lang|fr|porte-manteau}}, from {{lang|fr|porter}}, "to carry", and {{lang|fr|manteau}}, "cloak" (from Old French {{lang|fr|mantel}}, from Latin {{lang|la|mantellum}}).<ref>"Portmanteau". ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition''. 2000.</ref> According to the [[OED Online]], the etymology of the word is the "officer who carries the mantle of a person in a high position (1507 in Middle French), case or bag for carrying clothing (1547), clothes rack (1640)".<ref name=OED_online_portmanteau>{{Cite OED|portmanteu|accessdate =18 July 2019}}</ref> In modern French, a {{lang|fr|porte-manteau}} is a [[clothes valet]], a coat-tree or similar article of furniture for hanging up jackets, hats, umbrellas and the like.<ref>[[Petit Robert]]: ''portemanteau'' – "malle penderie" (suitcase in which clothes hang).</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/portemanteau |title= PORTEMANTEAU : Définition de PORTEMANTEAU |work= cnrtl.fr |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140821190449/http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/portemanteau |archivedate= 21 August 2014 |df= dmy-all |lang=fr}}</ref><ref>Such a "coat bag" is mentioned in Chapter 12 of Alexander Dumas' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.</ref>

An occasional synonym for "portmanteau word" is ''frankenword'', an [[autological word]] exemplifying the phenomenon it describes, blending "[[Frankenstein]]" and "word".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2016/feb/05/frankenwords-portmanteau-blend-words "Frankenwords: They're Alive!"] ''The Guardian'', 5 February 2016. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110043343/https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2016/feb/05/frankenwords-portmanteau-blend-words |date=10 January 2017 }}.</ref>

== Examples in English ==
{{Main list|List of portmanteaus}}
[[File:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|right|The original ''[[Gerrymander]]'' pictured in an 1812 cartoon. The word is a portmanteau of Massachusetts Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]]'s name with ''[[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]]''.]]

Many [[neologism]]s are examples of blends, but many blends have become part of the lexicon.<ref name="multiple" /> In ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1896, the word [[brunch]] (breakfast + lunch) was introduced as a "portmanteau word."<ref>''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' 1 August 1896, 58/2</ref> In 1964, the newly independent African republic of [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]] chose the portmanteau word [[Tanzania]] as its name. Similarly [[Eurasia]] is a portmanteau of Europe and Asia.

Some city names are portmanteaus of the border regions they straddle: [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]] spreads across the Texas-Arkansas-Louisiana border, while [[Calexico, California|Calexico]] and [[Mexicali]] are respectively the American and Mexican sides of a single [[conurbation]]. A scientific example is a ''[[liger]],'' which is a cross between a male lion and a female tiger (a ''[[tigon]]'' is a similar cross in which the male is a tiger).

Many company or brand names are portmanteaus, including [[Microsoft]], a portmanteau of ''[[microcomputer]]'' and ''software''; the cheese ''[[Cambozola]]'' combines a similar rind to ''[[Camembert]]'' with the same mould used to make ''[[Gorgonzola]]''; passenger rail company ''[[Amtrak]]'', a portmanteau of ''[[United States|America]]'' and ''[[Track (rail transport)|track]]''; ''[[Velcro]]'', a portmanteau of the French {{Lang|fr|velours}} (velvet) and {{Lang|fr|crochet}} (hook); ''[[Verizon]]'', a portmanteau of {{Lang|lat|veritas}} (Latin for truth) and ''horizon''; and [[ComEd]] (a Chicago-area electric utility company), a portmanteau of ''Commonwealth'' and ''[[Thomas Edison|Edison]]''.

''Jeoportmanteau!'' is a recurring category on the American television [[quiz show]] ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' The category's name is itself a portmanteau of the words ''Jeopardy'' and ''portmanteau.'' Responses in the category are portmanteaus constructed by fitting two words together.

Portmanteau words may be produced by joining together [[proper nouns]] with common nouns, such as "[[gerrymandering]]", which refers to the scheme of Massachusetts Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]] for politically contrived redistricting; the perimeter of one of the districts thereby created resembled a very curvy [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] in outline. The term gerrymander has itself contributed to portmanteau terms [[bjelkemander]] and [[playmander]].

[[Oxbridge]] is a common portmanteau for the UK's two oldest universities, those of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]. In 2016, Britain's planned [[withdrawal from the European Union|exit from the European Union]] became known as "[[Brexit]]". 

[[File:Spork.jpg|thumb|right|A [[spork]]]]

Many portmanteau words receive some use but do not appear in all dictionaries. For example, a ''[[spork]]'' is an eating utensil that is a combination of a spoon and a fork, and a ''[[skort]]'' is an item of clothing that is part [[skirt]], part [[shorts]]. On the other hand, ''[[turducken]]'', a dish made by inserting a chicken into a duck, and the duck into a turkey, was added to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 2010.

Similarly, the word ''refudiate'' was first used by [[Sarah Palin]] when she misspoke, conflating the words ''refute'' and ''repudiate''. Though initially the word was a gaffe, it was recognized as the ''New Oxford American Dictionary''{{'}}s "Word of the Year" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title = NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY'S 2010 WORD OF THE YEAR IS... |url = http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2010/11/noad-2010-word-of-the-year/ |access-date=30 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120116163439/http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2010/11/noad-2010-word-of-the-year/ |archive-date=16 January 2012  }}</ref>

The business lexicon is replete with newly formed portmanteau words like "permalance" (permanent freelance), "advertainment" (advertising as entertainment), "advertorial" (a blurred distinction between advertising and editorial), "infotainment" (information about entertainment or itself intended to entertain by its manner of presentation), and "infomercial" (informational commercial).

Company and product names may also use portmanteau words: examples include ''Timex'' (a portmanteau of ''Time'' [referring to [[Time magazine]]] and [[Kleenex]]),<ref name="kleenex">{{cite magazine

=== Name-meshing ===
{{Main|Name blending}}

Two proper names can also be used in creating a portmanteau word in reference to the partnership between people, especially in cases where both persons are well-known, or sometimes to produce [[epithet]]s such as "Billary" (referring to former United States president [[Bill Clinton]] and his wife, former United States Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]). In this example of recent American political history, the purpose for blending is not so much to combine the meanings of the source words but "to suggest a resemblance of one named person to the other"; the effect is often derogatory, as linguist [[Benjamin Zimmer]] states.<ref>{{cite web |last= Zimmer |first= Benjamin |authorlink= Benjamin Zimmer |title= A perilous portmanteau? |work= [[Language Log]] |publisher= [[University of Pennsylvania]] |date= 1 November 2005 |url= http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002610.html |accessdate= 11 November 2008 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081229180953/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002610.html |archivedate= 29 December 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> By contrast, the public, including the media, use portmanteaus to refer to their favorite pairings as a way to "...giv[e] people an essence of who they are within the same name."<ref name="news.BBC.co.uk">{{cite news|first=Denise|last=Winterman|title=What a mesh|publisher=BBC News Magazine|date=3 August 2006|accessdate=17 July 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5239464.stm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216171930/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5239464.stm|archivedate=16 December 2007}}</ref> This is particularly seen in cases of fictional and real-life "[[supercouple]]s".

Holidays are another example, as in [[Thanksgivukkah]], a portmanteau neologism given to the convergence of the American holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and the first day of the [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Hanukkah]] on Thursday, 28 November 2013.<ref>{{cite web |author=Christine Byrne |url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah |title=How To Celebrate Thanksgivukkah, The Best Holiday Of All Time |publisher=Buzzfeed |date=2 October 2013 |access-date=10 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131009221928/http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah |archive-date=9 October 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Stu Bykofsky |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20131011_Thanks_for_Thanukkah_.html |title=Thanks for Thanukkah! |website=Philly.com |date=22 October 2012 |access-date=11 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085041/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20131011_Thanks_for_Thanukkah_.html |archive-date=14 October 2013  }}</ref> [[Chrismukkah]] is another pop-culture portmanteau neologism popularized by the TV drama ''[[The O.C.]]'', merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's [[Hanukkah]].

== Other languages ==
=== French ===
The French linguistic term {{Lang|fr|[[mot-valise]]}}, literally a "suitcase-word", is a relatively recent back-translation from English, attested only since 1970.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Although the French language in France is regulated by the [[Académie française]] (which has had a conservative attitude to neologisms), it produced a number of portmanteau words such as {{Lang|fr|franglais}} (frenglish) and has used the technique in literature ([[Boris Vian]]) or to create brands such as ''Transilien'' ({{Lang|fr|transports}} {{Lang|fr|franciliens}}, [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] transportation system).{{NoteTag|The name also combines the word ''lien'' (link).}} Recent portmanteau examples are [[Douzelage]] (from {{Lang|fr|douze}} [twelve] and {{Lang|fr|jumelage}} [twinning]) and {{Lang|fr|japonaiserie}} (from {{Lang|fr|japonais}} ["japanese"] and {{Lang|fr|niaiserie}} ["inanity"]).

The French language in [[Quebec]], Canada, also has a regulatory body, the [[Office québécois de la langue française]] (OQLF). It tends to produce neologisms to replace anglicisms. It created the portmanteaus {{Lang|fr|courriel}} (e-mail) from {{Lang|fr|courrier}} (mail) and {{Lang|fr|électronique}} (electronic), and {{Lang|fr|clavardage}} (online chatting) from {{Lang|fr|clavier}} (keyboard) and {{Lang|fr|bavardage}} (chatter), for example.

=== Modern Hebrew ===
[[Modern Hebrew]] abounds with European mechanisms such as blending: Along with CD, or simply {{Hebrew|דיסק}} (''Disk''), Hebrew has the blend {{Hebrew|תקליטור}} (''taklitor''), which consists of {{Hebrew|תקליט}} (''taklít'', Phonograph record) and {{Hebrew|אור}} (''or'', light). Modern Hebrew is full of portmanteau blends, such as the following:<ref>See p. 62 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722010237/http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf |date=22 July 2018 }}, ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;40–67.</ref>
*{{Hebrew|ערפיח}} (''arpíakh'', smog), from {{Hebrew|ערפל}} (''arafél'', fog) and {{Hebrew|פיח}} (''píakh'', soot)
*{{Hebrew|מדרחוב}} (''midrakhov'', pedestrian-only street), from {{Hebrew|מדרכה}} (''midrakhá'', sidewalk) and {{Hebrew|רחוב}} (''rekhóv'', street)
*{{Hebrew|מחזמר}} (''makhazémer'', musical), from {{Hebrew|מחזה}} (''makhazé'',theatre play) and {{Hebrew|זמר}} (''zémer'', singing [gerund])

Other blends include the following:
*{{Hebrew|מגדלור}} (''migdalór'', lighthouse), from {{Hebrew|מגדל}} (''migdál'', tower) and {{Hebrew|אור}} (''or'', light)
*{{Hebrew|קרנף}} (''karnàf'', rhinoceros), from {{Hebrew|קרן}} (''kéren'', horn) and {{Hebrew|אף}} (''af'', nose)
*{{Hebrew|רמזור}} (''ramzór'', traffic light), from {{Hebrew|רמז}} (''rémez'', indication) and {{Hebrew|אור}} (''or'', light)

Sometimes the root of the second word is truncated, giving rise to a blend that resembles an [[acrostic]]:
*{{Hebrew|תפוז}} (''tapúz'', orange (fruit), from {{Hebrew|תפוח}} (''tapúakh'', apple) and {{Hebrew|זהב}} (''zaháv'', gold), as well as {{Hebrew|תפוד}} (''tapúd'', potato) from {{Hebrew|תפוח}} (''tapúakh'', apple) and {{Hebrew|אדמה}} (''adamah'', soil) but the full {{Hebrew|תפוח אדמה}} is more common in the latter case.

===Irish===
A few portmanteaus are in use in modern Irish, for example:
* [[Brexit]] is referred to as {{lang|ga|Breatimeacht}} (from {{lang|ga|Breatain}}, "Britain", and {{lang|ga|imeacht}}, "leave") or {{lang|ga|Sasamach}} (from {{lang|ga|Sasana}}, "England," and {{lang|ga|amach}}, "out")<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/the-irish-words-for-selfie-brexit-and-spam-1.3160155|title=The Irish words for ‘selfie’, ‘Brexit’ and ‘spam’|website=Irishtimes.com|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-date=1 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201062338/https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/the-irish-words-for-selfie-brexit-and-spam-1.3160155|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/making-sense-of-brexit-1.3040836|title=Making sense of Brexit|website=Irishtimes.com|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-date=8 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508153550/http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/making-sense-of-brexit-1.3040836|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Icelandic ===
There is a tradition of [[linguistic purism in Icelandic]], and [[neologism]]s are frequently created from pre-existing words. For example, ''Tölva'' ("computer") is a ''portmanteau'' of ''tala'' ("digit; number") and ''völva'' ("oracle or seeress").<ref>Kristján Árnason; Sigrún Helgadóttir (1991), "Terminology and Icelandic Language Policy", Behovet och nyttan av terminologiskt arbete på 90-talet, Nordterm 5, Nordterm-symposium, pp.&nbsp;7–21.</ref>

In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], portmanteaus are often used as both formal and informal [[acronym]]s and referrals. Many organizations and government bodies use them for brevity. Journalists often create portmanteaus for particular historical moments. Examples include:

Formal and journalism uses:

=== Japanese ===
{{main|Japanese abbreviated and contracted words}}
A very common type of portmanteau in Japanese forms one word from the beginnings of two others (that is, from two [[clipping (morphology)|back-clippings]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/contractions.html |title=What are contracted words like rimokon? |website=Sljfaq.org |access-date=3 October 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232800/http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/contractions.html |archive-date=4 October 2013  }}</ref> The portion of each input word retained is usually two [[on (Japanese prosody)|morae]], which is tantamount to one [[kanji]] in most words written in kanji.

The inputs to the process can be native words, [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese words]], [[gairaigo]] (later borrowings), or combinations thereof. A Sino-Japanese example is the name {{nihongo|東大||''Tōdai''}} for the [[University of Tokyo]], in full {{nihongo|'''東'''京'''大'''学||'''''Tō'''kyō '''dai'''gaku''}}. With borrowings, typical results are words such as {{nihongo|パソコン||''pasokon''}}, meaning personal computer (PC), which despite being formed of English elements does not exist in English; it is a [[wasei-eigo|uniquely Japanese]] contraction of the English {{nihongo|''personal computer''|'''パ'''ー'''ソ'''ナル'''・コン'''ピュータ|'''pāso'''naru '''kon'''pyūta}}. Another example, {{nihongo|''[[Pokémon]]''|ポケモン}}, is a contracted form of the English words {{nihongo|''pocket''|'''ポケ'''ット|'''poke'''tto}} and {{nihongo|''monsters''|'''モン'''スター|'''mon'''sutā}}.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.sfu.ca/gradlings/SFUWPL/ICEAL2/Rosen_E.pdf |title=Japanese loanword accentuation: epenthesis and foot form interacting through edge-interior alignment∗ |first=Eric |last=Rosen |work=University of British Columbia |access-date=25 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131040/http://www.sfu.ca/gradlings/SFUWPL/ICEAL2/Rosen_E.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2011  }}</ref> A famous example of a blend with mixed sources is {{nihongo|''[[karaoke]]''|カラオケ|karaoke}}, blending the Japanese word for {{nihongo|''empty''|空|'''kara'''}} and the Greek word {{nihongo|''orchestra''|オーケストラ|'''ōke'''sutora}}. The Japanese egg-shaped key chain pet toy fad from the 1990s, Tamagotchi, is a portmanteau combining the two Japanese words tamago (たまご), which means "egg", and uotchi (ウオッチ) "watch". The portmanteau can also be seen as a combination of tamago (たまご), "egg", and tomodachi (友だち), which means "friend".

Some Anime titles also are portmanteaus, such as ''[[Hetalia]]'' (ヘタリア). It came from '''He''ta'''''re (ヘタレ), which means "idiot", and I'''''ta''ria''' (イタリア) which means Italy. Another example is ''[[Servamp]]'',
which came from the English words '''Ser''va'''''nt (サーヴァント) and '''''Va''mp'''ire (ヴァンパイア).

===Portuguese===
In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], portmanteaus are usually slangs, some of them include:
* ''Cantriz'', from ''cantora'' (female singer) and ''atriz'' (actress), which defines women that both sing and act.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://istoe.com.br/103725_A+HORA+DAS+CANTRIZES/|title=A hora das cantrizes – ISTOÉ Independente|date=4 October 2010|work=ISTOÉ Independente|access-date=15 April 2018|language=pt-BR|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806125949/https://istoe.com.br/103725_A+HORA+DAS+CANTRIZES/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://tititi.uol.com.br/noticias/perfil/consegui-realizar--meu-grande-sonho-ser-cantriz.phtml|title="Consegui realizar meu grande sonho: ser cantriz!"|date=2 February 2016|work=Tititi|access-date=15 April 2018|language=pt-BR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416013435/http://tititi.uol.com.br/noticias/perfil/consegui-realizar--meu-grande-sonho-ser-cantriz.phtml|archive-date=16 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In [[European Portuguese]], portmanteaus are also used. Some of them include:

* ''Telemóvel'', which means mobile phone, comes from ''telefone'' (telephone) and ''móvel'' (mobile).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguee.com/portuguese-english/translation/telem%C3%B3vel.html|title=telemóvel – English translation – Linguee|website=Linguee.com|access-date=15 April 2018|archive-date=8 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008194250/https://www.linguee.com/portuguese-english/translation/telem%C3%B3vel.html|url-status=live}}</ref>
* ''Cantautor'', which means Singer-songwriter, and comes from ''cantor'' (singer) and ''autor'' (songwriter).

=== Spanish ===
{{Refimprove-section|date=June 2020}}
Although not very common in Spanish (except for a pair of compulsory contractions, 'a el' = 'al' and 'de el' = 'del'), portmanteaus are finding their way into the language mainly through marketing and media efforts, such as in [[Mexican Spanish]] 'cafebrería' from 'cafetería' (coffee shop) and 'librería' (bookstore), or Teletón from 'televisión' and 'maratón'. However, it is very frequent in commercial brands of any type (for instance, "chocolleta", from "chocolate" + "galleta", (cookie), and above all family-owned business (of small size, for instance: Rocar, from "Roberto" + "Carlos", and Mafer, from "Maria" + "Fernanda"). Such usages are prompted by the registering of a distinguishable trademark, but with time, commonly, a specific trademark became the name of the all similar products, like in [[Cola Cao]], a name which is very common to use to refer any similar product.

Other examples:
* ''Cantautor'', which means Singer-songwriter, and comes from ''cantante'' (singer) and ''autor'' (songwriter).<ref>[https://dle.rae.es/cantautor {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229130634/https://dle.rae.es/cantautor |date=29 February 2020 }} ''Cantautor, ra'' [[Royal Spanish Academy]]]</ref>
*''[[Mechatronics|Mecatrónica]]''<ref>{{Citation|title=Ingeniería mecatrónica|date=2 December 2019|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingenier%C3%ADa_mecatr%C3%B3nica&oldid=121746363|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=10 December 2019|archive-date=8 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008194251/https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingenier%C3%ADa_mecatr%C3%B3nica&oldid=121746363|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[:es:Ofimática|Ofimática]]'' two [[Neologism]]s that are blends of ''mecánica'' (mechanical) with ''electrónica'' (electronics), and ''oficina'' (office) with ''informática'' ([[Computer science|informatics]]) respectively.
*''[[Espanglish]]'', interlanguage that combines words from both Spanish (''Español'') and English.
*''[[Metrobus (disambiguation)|Metrobús]]'', blend of ''metro'' (subway) and ''autobús.''
*''[[Autopista (disambiguation)|Autopista]]'', blend of ''automóvil'' (car) and ''pista'' (highway).
*''[[:es:Trabalenguas|Trabalenguas]]'', which means tongue twister, from ''trabar'' (tangle up, jam) and ''lengua'' (tongue).
*Company names and brands with portmanteaus are common in Spanish. Some examples of Spanish portmanteaus for Mexican companies include: The Mexican flag carrier [[Aeroméxico]], (Aerovías de México), Banorte (Bank and North), [[Cemex]] (Cement and Mexico), [[Jumex]] (Jugos Mexicanos or Mexican Juice), [[Mabe (company)|Mabe]] (from founders Egon MAbardi and Francisco BErrondo), [[Pemex]] (Petróleos Mexicanos or Mexican Oil), [[Softtek]] (portmanteau and stylization of Software and technology), and [[Telmex]] (Teléfonos de Mexico). [[Gamesa]] (Galletera Mexicana, S.A. or Mexican Biscuit Company, Inc.) and [[Grupo Famsa|Famsa]] (fabricantes Muebleros, S.A.) are examples of portmanteaus of four words, including the "S.A." (Sociedad Anónima).
*Many more portmanteaus in Spanish come from [[Anglicism]]s, which are words borrowed from English, like ''módem'', ''transistor, códec, email, internet'' or ''emoticon.''

A somewhat popular example in Spain is the word Gallifante,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/para-todos-la-2/gallifantes/1030400//|title=Gallifantes – RTVE.es|date=25 February 2011|website=Rtve.es|access-date=6 February 2018|archive-date=7 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207005306/http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/para-todos-la-2/gallifantes/1030400//|url-status=live}}</ref> a portmanteau of Gallo y Elefante (Cockerel and Elephant). It was the prize on the Spanish version of the children TV show Child's Play (Juego de niños) that ran on the public television channel [[La 1 (Spanish TV channel)|La 1]] of [[Televisión Española]] (TVE) from 1988 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/1988/06/04/radiotv/581378404_850215.html|title=Jugar bien vale un 'gallifante'|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=4 June 1988|website=Elpais.com|access-date=6 February 2018|archive-date=6 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206190347/https://elpais.com/diario/1988/06/04/radiotv/581378404_850215.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Portmanteau morph ==
In [[linguistics]], a [[Blend word|blend]] is an amalgamation or fusion of independent [[lexeme]]s, while a ''portmanteau'' or ''portmanteau morph'' is a single [[Allomorph|morph]] that is analyzed as representing two (or more) underlying [[morpheme]]s.<ref name="What is a portmanteau morph" /> For example, in the Latin word ''animalis'' the ending ''-is'' is a portmanteau morph because it is used for two morphemes: the singular number and the genitive case. In English two separate morphs are used ('''''of an''' animal''). Other examples include French ''à le'' → [[wikt:au#French|''au'']] /o/, and ''de le'' → [[wikt:du#French|''du'']] /dy/.<ref name="What is a portmanteau morph" />
