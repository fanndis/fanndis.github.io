'''Viktor Andriyovych Yushchenko''' ({{lang-uk|Віктор Андрійович Ющенко}}, {{IPA-uk|ˈwiktor ɐnˈd⁽ʲ⁾r⁽ʲ⁾ijowɪtʃ ˈjuʃtʃenko|IPA|Juschtschenko.ogg}}; born 23 February 1954) is a Ukrainian politician who was the third [[President of Ukraine]] from 23 January 2005 to 25 February 2010.

As an informal leader of the Ukrainian opposition coalition, he was one of the two main candidates in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]. Yushchenko won the presidency through a repeat [[runoff election]] between him and Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukrainian Supreme Court]] called for the runoff election to be repeated because of widespread [[electoral fraud]] in favor of Viktor Yanukovych in the original vote. Yushchenko won in the revote (52% to 44%). Public protests prompted by the electoral fraud played a major role in that presidential election and led to Ukraine's [[Orange Revolution]].

Following an assassination attempt in late 2004 during his election campaign, Yushchenko was confirmed to have ingested hazardous amounts of [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]], the most potent [[dioxin]] and a contaminant in [[Agent Orange]]. He suffered disfigurement as a result of the poisoning, but has since made a full physical recovery.

Before his election as president, Yushchenko had already had a career in Ukrainian politics. In 1993, he became governor (head) of the [[National Bank of Ukraine]]. From 1999 to 2001 he was [[prime minister]]. After his dismissal as prime minister, Yushchenko went into opposition to President [[Leonid Kuchma]] and he founded the [[Our Ukraine bloc]], which at the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2002 parliamentary election]] became Ukraine's most popular political force, with 23.57% of the votes.

After Yushchenko's election in 2004 to the presidency, this alliance was unable to continue this success, garnering only  13.95% of the votes in 2006 and 14.15% of the votes in the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]]. Yushchenko failed to secure a run-off spot during the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]]; gaining 5.5% of the vote. During the [[2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election]]s, Yushchenko headed the election list of [[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]. The party won 1.11% of the national votes and no [[constituencies]], and thus failed to win parliamentary representation.

==Early life==
Viktor Andriyovych Yushchenko was born on 23 February 1954, in [[Khoruzhivka]], [[Sumy Oblast]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], into a family of teachers. His father, Andriy Andriyovych Yushchenko (1919–1992) fought in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], was captured by German forces and imprisoned as a [[POW]] in a series of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the German Reich, including [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. He survived the ordeal, and after returning home, taught English at a local school. Viktor's mother, Varvara Tymofiyovna Yushchenko (1918–2005), taught physics and mathematics at the same school. The [[Sumy Oblast]] region where he was born is predominantly Ukrainian-speaking, and this differentiated him in later life from his political counterparts, for whom Russian was the mother tongue.<ref name="BBCProfileYushchenko">{{cite news| title=Profile: Viktor Yushchenko  | author=BBC| publisher=BBC| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4035789.stm|  date=13 January 2010}}</ref>

Viktor Yushchenko graduated from the [[Ternopil National Economic University|Ternopil Finance and Economics Institute]] in 1975 and began work as an accountant, as a deputy to the chief accountant in a [[kolkhoz]]. Then, from 1975 to 1976, he served as a [[conscript]] in the [[Transcaucasian Military District]] on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]–[[Turkey|Turkish]] border.

==Central banker==
{{BLP unsourced section|section|date=January 2014}}
In 1976 Yushchenko began a career in banking.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/orange-revolutionary/|title=Orange Revolutionary|last=Cronin|first=David|date=March 5, 2005|website=Politico Europe|access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref> In 1983, he became the Deputy Director for Agricultural Credit at the Ukrainian Republican Office of the [[Soviet Union]] State Bank.<ref name=":0" /> From 1990 to 1993, he worked as vice-chairman and first vice-chairman of the JSC Agroindustrial Bank ''Ukraina''. In 1993, he was appointed Governor of the [[National Bank of Ukraine]] (Ukraine's [[central bank]]).<ref name=":0" /> In 1997, [[Verkhovna Rada]], the parliament of Ukraine, re-appointed him.

As a central banker, Yushchenko played an important part in the creation of [[Ukraine]]'s national [[currency]], the [[hryvnia]], and the establishment of a modern regulatory system for commercial banking. He also successfully overcame a debilitating wave of [[hyper-inflation]] that hit the country—he brought inflation down from more than 10,000 percent to less than 10 percent—and managed to defend the value of the currency following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].

In 1998, he wrote a thesis entitled "The Development of Supply and Demand of Money in Ukraine" and defended it in the [[Ukrainian Academy of Banking of the National Bank of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Banking]]. He thereby earned a doctorate in economics.

==Prime minister==
In December 1999, Ukrainian President [[Leonid Kuchma]] unexpectedly nominated Yushchenko to be the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|prime minister]] after the parliament failed by one vote to ratify the previous candidate, [[Valeriy Pustovoitenko|Valeriy Pustovoytenko]].

Ukraine's economy improved during Yushchenko's cabinet service. However, his government, particularly Deputy Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], soon became embroiled in a confrontation with influential leaders of the [[coal mining]] and [[natural gas]] industries. The conflict resulted in a 2001 [[no-confidence vote]] by the parliament, orchestrated by the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]], who opposed Yushchenko's economic policies, and by centrist groups associated with the country's powerful "[[Business oligarch|oligarchs]]." The vote passed 263 to 69 and resulted in Yushchenko's removal from office.

=="Our Ukraine" leader==

In 2002, Yushchenko became the leader of the ''[[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]]'' (''Nasha Ukrayina'') political [[coalition]], which received a plurality of [[Constituency|seats]] in the year's [[Elections in Ukraine|parliamentary election]]. However, the number of seats won was not a majority, and efforts to form a majority coalition with other [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] parties failed. Since then, Yushchenko has remained the leader and public face of the Our Ukraine parliamentary [[Political factions|faction]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In 2001, both Yushchenko and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] broached at creating a broad opposition bloc against the incumbent [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] in order to win the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential election 2004]].<ref name=CarnIP/>

In late 2002 Yushchenko, [[Oleksandr Moroz]] ([[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]), [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[Communist Party of Ukraine]]) and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] ([[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]) issued a joint statement concerning "the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine". Though the communists stepped out of the alliance and though Symonenko opposed having one single candidate from the alliance in the 2004 presidential election, the other three parties remained allies<ref name="Ref_e">[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&pg=PA117&dq=Tymoshenko+Moroz+Presidential+candidate+2004&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Tymoshenko%20Moroz%20Presidential%20candidate%202004&f=false Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], [[M.E.

On 2 July 2004 Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the ''Force of the people'', a coalition which aimed to stop "the destructive process that has, as a result of the [[incumbent]] authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine", at the time President Kuchma and [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were the incumbent authorities in Ukraine. The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko would win the October 2004 presidential election.<ref name=CarnIP>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X0PAQrsx-6YC&pg=PA34&dq=Force+of+the+people+Tymoshenko&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Force%20of%20the%20people&f=false ''Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine's Democratic Breakthrough''] by [[Anders Aslund]] and [[Michael A.

Yushchenko was widely regarded as the moderate political leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition, since other opposition parties were less influential and had fewer seats in parliament. Since becoming President of Ukraine in 2005, he has been an honorary leader of the ''[[People's Union "Our Ukraine"|Our Ukraine]]'' party.

From 2001 to 2004, his rankings in popularity polls were higher than those of President [[Leonid Kuchma]]. In later public opinion polls, though, his support plummeted from a high of 52% following his election in 2004 to below 4%.<ref name="Ref_g">[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/215119.html Socis Poll: "25% Of Ukrainians Prepared To Support Yanukovych For President, 20.5% To Vote For Tymoshenko"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819012221/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/215119.html |date=August 19, 2009 }}, ''Ukrainian News'' (August 17, 2009)</ref><ref name="Ref_2009">{{citation|title=Surviving the Crisis in Ukraine (Forum Video)|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/07/ukraine_event.html|work=[[Center for American Progress]]|date=July 30, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Ref_2009a">{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/blogs/bloggers/tarasgkuzio/5121 |title=With or without Baloha, Yushchenko is unelectable |access-date=2009-05-28 |date=May 28, 2009 |work=[[Taras Kuzio]] |publisher=[[Kyiv Post]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

However, in the parliamentary elections of March 2006, the Our Ukraine party, led by Prime Minister [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]], received less than 14% of the national vote, taking third place behind the [[Party of Regions]] and the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]. In a poll by the Sofia Social Research Centre between 27 July and 7 August 2007 more than 52% of those polled said they distrusted Yushchenko.<ref name="Forua_110055">{{cite news|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2007/08/15/110055.html|title=Half of Ukrainians ready to deprive Yushchenko of presidency|publisher=ForUm News agency|date=2007-08-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120717/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2007/08/15/110055.html|archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>

==Presidential election of 2004==

In 2004, as President Kuchma's term came to an end, Yushchenko announced his candidacy for president as an [[independent (politician)|independent]]. His major rival was Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. Since his term as prime minister, Yushchenko had slightly modernized his political platform, adding social partnership and other [[Liberalism|liberal]] slogans to older ideas of [[European integration]], including Ukraine's joining [[NATO]] and fighting [[political corruption|corruption]]. Supporters of Yushchenko were organized in the "Syla Narodu" ("Power to the People") electoral coalition, which he and his political allies led, with the Our Ukraine coalition as the main constituent force.

Yushchenko built his [[political campaign|campaign]] on face-to-face communication with [[voter]]s, since the government prevented most major TV channels from providing equal coverage to candidates.<ref name="hrw_open_letter">{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/press/2002/12/ukraine1203ltr.htm|title=Open Letter to the Speaker of the Verhkovna Rada of Ukraine Volodymyr Lytvyn and Deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|first=Elizabeth|last=Andersen|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=2002-12-03}}</ref><ref name="temniki">{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/archive/2004/july/6/3.shtml|title=Temniki.

===TCDD poisoning===
[[File:Viktor Yuschenko.jpg|thumb|Yushchenko at the University of Amsterdam, with [[chloracne]] from [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]] poisoning (2006).]]
The campaign was often bitter and violent. Yushchenko became seriously ill in early September 2004. He was flown to [[Vienna]]'s Rudolfinerhaus clinic for treatment and diagnosed with [[acute pancreatitis]], accompanied by interstitial edematous changes, due to a serious viral infection and chemical substances that are not normally found in food products. Yushchenko claimed that he had been poisoned by government agents. After the illness, his face was greatly disfigured: [[jaundice]]d, bloated, and pockmarked.

British [[toxicologist]] [[John Henry (toxicologist)|Professor John Henry]] of [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]] in London declared the changes in Yushchenko's face were due to [[chloracne]], which results from [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] poisoning.<ref name="BBC: Yushchenko and the poison theory">{{cite news | title = Yushchenko and the poison theory | work = BBC News | date = 2004-12-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4041321.stm }}</ref> Dutch toxicologist Bram Brouwer also stated his changes in appearance were the result of chloracne, and found dioxin levels in Yushchenko's blood 6,000 times above normal.<ref name="CBS: Yushchenko: Live And Carry On">{{cite news | title = Yushchenko: 'Live And Carry On' | publisher = CBS News | date = 2005-01-30 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/01/28/60minutes/main670103.shtml }}</ref>

On 11 December, Dr. Michael Zimpfer of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic declared that Yushchenko had ingested [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD dioxin]] and had 1,000 times the usual concentration in his body.<ref name="CNN: Doctors: Yushchenko was poisoned">{{cite news|first=Jill |last=Dougherty |title=Doctors: Yushchenko was poisoned |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/12/11/yushchenko.austria/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=December 11, 2004 |access-date=2007-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218082557/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/12/11/yushchenko.austria/index.html |archive-date=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Many have linked Yushchenko's poisoning to a dinner with a group of senior Ukrainian officials (including [[Volodymyr Satsyuk]]) that took place on 5 September.<ref name="BBC: Yushchenko and the poison theory" /><ref name="CBS: Yushchenko: Live And Carry On" /><ref name="CNN: Doctors: Yushchenko was poisoned" />

Since 2005, Yushchenko has been treated by a team of doctors led by Professor Jean Saurat at the [[University of Geneva]] Hospital.<ref name="Ref_2005">{{cite news | title = Doctor: Yushchenko in 'very good' health | work=USA Today | date = 2005-07-18 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-07-18-yushchenko_x.htm }}</ref>  Analysis of Yushchenko's body fluids and tissues provided useful information on the human toxicokinetics of TCDD and its metabolites.<ref name="Sorg2009" />

Yushchenko himself implicated David Zhvania, the godfather of one of his children, of involvement in his dioxin poisoning.<ref name="Bill2009">{{cite web|title= Ukraine president blames former ally for poisoning |url= http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2008/07/ukraine_president_blames_forme.html |author= Bill Meyer |date= 2009-07-24 |access-date=2010-02-11}}</ref>

In August 2009, ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a scientific paper by Swiss and Ukrainian researchers on the monitoring, form, distribution, and elimination of [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] (TCDD) in Yushchenko in relation to his severe poisoning. The 2004 TCDD levels in Yushchenko's blood serum were 50,000-fold greater than those in the general population.<ref name="Sorg2009">{{cite journal |author1=O Sorg |author2=M Zennegg |author3=P Schmid |author4=R Fedosyuk |author5=R Valikhnovskyi |author6=O Gaide |author7=V Kniazevych |author8=J-H Saurat |title=2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) poisoning in Victor Yushchenko: identification and measurement of TCDD metabolites |journal=The Lancet |volume=374 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60912-0 |pages=1179–85 |pmid=19660807 |issue=9696|s2cid=24761553 }}</ref> This new study also concluded that the dioxin "was so pure that it was definitely made in a laboratory".<ref name="Ref_j">[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hW1QRD4tlRX2-UW9yc_oDcwrzMgwD99SBRO80 Associated Press: Study: Dioxin that poisoned Yushchenko made in lab] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On 27 September 2009 Yushchenko said in an interview aired on [[Channel 1+1]] that the testimony of three men who were at a dinner in 2004 at which he believes he was poisoned is crucial to finishing the investigation, and he claimed these men were in Russia. Ukrainian prosecutors said Russia has refused to extradite one of the men, the former deputy chief of [[Security Service of Ukraine|Ukraine's security service]], [[Volodymyr Satsyuk]], because he holds both [[Russian citizenship|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian citizenship]].<ref name="Ref_2009c">{{cite web|url= http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/49610 |title= Yushchenko to Russia: Hand over witnesses |publisher= [[Kyiv Post]] |date=2009-10-28 |access-date=2010-02-11}}</ref> After arriving in Russia Satsyuk was granted Russian citizenship protecting him from extradition.<ref>{{cite book |title= KGB's Poison Factory: From Lenin to Litvinenko |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X4vtgWCjAuwC&q=Volodymyr+Satsyuk+granted+citizenship&pg=PA116 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630001302/http://books.google.com/books?id=X4vtgWCjAuwC&pg=PA116&dq=Volodymyr+Satsyuk+granted+citizenship&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gcQjU57lE4LcqgG3goCgDQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA |url-status = dead |archive-date = 30 June 2014 | author = Boris Volodarsky |publisher = MBI Publishing Company |page = 116 |year = 2010 |isbn = 9780760337530|access-date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

===Unprecedented three rounds of voting===
{{Main|Orange Revolution|Post-election developments in Ukraine, 2004}}

The initial vote, held on 31 October 2004, saw Yushchenko obtain 39.87% of vote, ahead of his opponent Yanukovych with 39.32%. Because neither candidate reached the 50% [[majority]] required for outright victory, a second round of [[Two-round system|run-off voting]] was held on 21 November 2004. Although a 75% [[voter turnout]] was recorded, [[observation|observers]] reported many irregularities and abuses across the country, such as organized multiple voting and extra votes for Yanukovych after the polls closed. [[Exit poll]] results put Yushchenko ahead in the western and central provinces of the country, and one poll gave him an 11% margin of victory.  However, the final official result was a 3% margin of victory for Yanukovych.

The allegations of [[electoral fraud]] and the discrepancy between exit polls and the final tally prompted Yushchenko and his supporters to refuse to recognize the results.

After thirteen days of massive popular protests in [[Kyiv]] and other Ukrainian cities that became known as the [[Orange Revolution]], the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]] overturned the election results and ordered a re-vote of the run-off election for 26 December. Yushchenko proclaimed a victory for the opposition and declared his confidence that he would be elected with at least 60% of the vote. He did win the re-vote of second round, but with 52% of the vote.

===Presidency===
[[File:BushYushchenkoWH1.jpg|thumb|right|Yushchenko meeting then-United States President [[George W. Bush]] at an April 2005 press conference.]]

The first 100 days of Yushchenko's term, 23 January 2005 through 1 May 2005, were marked by numerous dismissals and appointments at all levels of the executive branch. He appointed [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] as Prime Minister and the appointment was ratified by parliament. [[Oleksandr Zinchenko (politician)|Oleksandr Zinchenko]] was appointed the head of the [[Secretariat of the President of Ukraine|presidential secretariat]] with a nominal title of Secretary of State. [[Petro Poroshenko]], a fierce competitor of Tymoshenko for the post of Prime Minister, was appointed Secretary of the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|Security and Defense Council]].

May 2005 saw Ukraine host the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in the capital of [[Kyiv]]. Some accused Yushchenko of attempting to gain political capital from the event, with his appearance on stage at the end criticised as 'undignified' by certain commentators.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas |url=http://news.kievukraine.info/2005/05/kiev-counts-cost-of-eurovision-hosting.html |title=Kiev Ukraine News Blog: Kiev Counts Cost of Eurovision Hosting |publisher=News.kievukraine.info |date=2005-05-27 |access-date=2014-03-16}}</ref> During 2005, Yushchenko was in confident mood, making such pledges as solving the [[Georgiy Gongadze|Gongadze]] case to the removal of Russia's [[Black Sea Fleet]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas |url=http://news.kievukraine.info/2005/12/ukraine-raises-russias-black-sea-fleet.html |title=Kiev Ukraine News Blog: Ukraine Raises Russia's Black Sea Fleet Issue in Gas Row |publisher=News.kievukraine.info |date=2005-12-20 |access-date=2014-03-16}}</ref>

In August 2005, Yushchenko joined with [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] in signing the [[Borjomi Declaration]], which called for the creation of an institution of international cooperation, the [[Community of Democratic Choice]], to bring together the democracies and incipient democracies in the region around the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. The first meeting of presidents and leaders to discuss the CDC took place on December 1–2, 2005 in Kyiv.

According to former [[Security Service of Ukraine]] Chairman [[Oleksandr Turchynov]], Yushchenko prevented in the summer of 2005 an investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices in the transport of [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] [[natural gas]] to Ukraine and the arrest of [[Yuri Boyko]] for [[abuse of office]] while heading [[Naftogaz]].<ref name=GosLobby>[http://www.taraskuzio.net/media24_files/8.pdf Gas Lobby Takes Control of Ukrains Secret Service] by [[Taras Kuzio]] (18 March 2010)</ref><ref name=arrest>[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1061677.html Ukraine: Battle Against Corruption Grinds To A Halt], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (September 26, 2005)</ref>

===Dismissal of other Orange Revolution members===
On 8 September 2005, Yushchenko fired [[First Tymoshenko Government|his government]], led by [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], after resignations and claims of corruption.

On 9 September, acting [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]] tried to form a new government.<ref name="Ref_k">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4228650.stm Ukraine leader to build new team] 9 September 2005</ref> His first attempt, on 20 September, fell short by 3 votes of the necessary 226, but on 22 September the parliament ratified his government with 289 votes.

Also in September 2005, former president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] accused exiled Russian tycoon [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] of financing Yushchenko's presidential election campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies he said were controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yushchenko's official backers. Berezovsky confirmed that he met Yushchenko's representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, but he refused to confirm or deny that the money was used in Yushchenko's campaign. Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine.

In August 2006, Yushchenko appointed his onetime opponent in the presidential race, [[Viktor Yanukovych]], to be the new Prime Minister. This was generally regarded as indicating a rapprochement with Russia.<ref name="Ref_l">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5242860.stm Ukraine comeback kid in new deal] 4 August 2006</ref>

===First dissolution of Parliament===
{{Main|2007 Ukrainian political crisis|Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007}}
On 2 April 2007, Yushchenko signed an order to dissolve [[Verkhovna Rada|the parliament]] and call early elections.<ref name="Ref_2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/02/europe/web0204-kiev.php|title=Ukraine president dissolves Parliament and calls for elections|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=2007-04-02}}</ref><ref name="Ref_2007a">{{cite web|url=http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=264%2F2007|title=On stopping ahead of schedule powers of Verhovna Rada of Ukraine|work=Order of President of Ukraine|date=2007-04-02|language=uk}}</ref> Some consider the dissolution order illegal because none of the conditions spelled out under [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 90|Article 90]] of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] for the president to dissolve the legislature had been met. Yushchenko's detractors argued that he was attempting to usurp the functions of the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]] by claiming constitutional violations by the parliament as a pretext for his action; the parliament appealed the Constitutional Court itself and promised to abide by its ruling. In the meantime, the parliament continued to meet and banned the financing of any [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|new election]] pending the Constitutional Court's decision. Competing protests took place and the crisis escalated. In May 2007, Yushchenko illegally dismissed three members of Ukraine's Constitutional Court, thus preventing the court from ruling on the constitutionality of his decree dismissing Ukraine's parliament.<ref name="Ukranews">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/112528.html|title=Supreme Court Restores Stanik As Constitutional Court Judge|publisher=Ukrainian News agency|date=2008-03-27|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509123552/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/112528.html|archive-date=2008-05-09}}</ref>

Yushchenko again tried to dissolve the parliament on 9 October 2008 by announcing parliamentary elections to be held on December 7. Yushchenko's decree was suspended and has since lapsed.  Yushchenko in defense of his actions said, "I am deeply convinced that the democratic coalition was ruined by one thing alone—human ambition. The ambition of one person." Political groups including members of his own [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]] party contested the election decree and politicians vowed to challenge it in the courts.<ref name="Ref_m">{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35872120081009 |title=reuters.com, Ukraine president sets parliament election for Dec 7 |publisher=In.reuters.com |access-date=2014-03-16}}</ref><ref name="Ref_n">[http://article.wn.com/view-travelagents/2008/10/09/Ukraines_president_sets_date_for_new_election_b/ Ukraine's president sets date for new election]</ref>

In December 2008, following a back room revolt from members of Our Ukraine-Peoples' Self Defense Party a revised coalition was formed between members of [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] (OU-PSD), the [[Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko]] (BYuT), and the [[Lytvyn Bloc]] (LB), increasing the size of the governing coalition by an additional 20 members. Yushchenko in responding to journalists questions claimed "The  fact is that the so-called coalition was formed on basis of political corruption, this coalition will be able to work only if the [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist Party]] will join it. Speaking about such a type of coalition, it is even more shameful." Victor Yushchenko also stated that Yulia Tymoshenko's desire to keep her job as [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] was the main motive for creating the coalition and that he wanted to expel the OU-PSD lawmakers who supported the creation of the coalition from the list of members of parliament.<ref name="Ref_o">[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-290621.html Yushchenko wants to expel lawmakers who supported coalition], [[UNIAN]] (17 December 2008)</ref><ref name="Ref_p">[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/169570.html Yuschenko Advocates Expulsion Of Our Ukraine People's Union MPs That Support Coalition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721030947/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/169570.html |date=July 21, 2009 }}, Ukrainian News Agency (17 December 2008)</ref>

Yushchenko claimed (19 March 2009) that his conflicts with Tymoshenko are not due to personal differences, but to the incompleteness of the constitutional reforms of 2004.<ref name="Ref_q">[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/10232/ Yuschenko describes his relations with Tymoshenko an internal affair] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129111617/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/10232/ |date=January 29, 2012 }}, [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (March 29, 2009)</ref>

On 23 July 2009, under the terms of Ukraine's [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 90|Constitution]] the president cannot dismiss the parliament within six months from the expiration of his five-year term of authority, which ends on 23 January 2010.

==Political positions==
[[File:Wiktor Juschtschenko, Präsident der Ukraine, im Widenmoos.jpg|thumb|right|Yushchenko]]
On 31 March 2009, in his address to the nation before Parliament, Yushchenko proposed sweeping government reform changes and an economic and social plan to ameliorate current economic conditions in Ukraine and apparently to respond to standing structural problems in Ukraine's political system.

The proposal, which Yushchenko called a 'next big step forward for fairness and prosperity in Ukraine' included the following proposals:<ref name="Ref_ag">{{cite web|url=http://www.nashkrok.org.ua/en/ |title=The Next Big Step: Fairness and Prosperity for All Ukraine |access-date=June 15, 2009 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409161037/http://www.nashkrok.org.ua/en/ |archive-date=April 9, 2009 }}, Viktor Yushchenko elections website</ref>
* Restore financial stability in the country by implementing the [[International Monetary Fund]] reforms and a balanced budget
* Abolish [[parliamentary immunity]]
* Fair pension system based on the number of years of work and salary received
* Pass a realistic state budget for 2009 that reduces inflation and stabilizes the [[hryvnia]]
* Have the state assume responsibility for struggling banks
* Rejuvenate rural areas by eliminating state interference in agriculture production
* Promote Ukrainian products abroad to increase sales for Ukraine's producers
* European Union membership and increased trade while simultaneously improving relations and trade with Russia
* Allow voters to elect members of parliament from the areas where they live
* Open up [[party lists]] for both parliamentary and local elections
* Create [[bicameral parliament]] to bring stability to the [[legislative branch]]
* Reduce the number of [[members of parliament]]

Yushchenko also advocates [[Ukraine–NATO relations|NATO membership]] for Ukraine<ref name="Ref_ah">[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/50824 Yushchenko: Ukraine has every chances to be European Union member], [[Kyiv Post]] (October 16, 2009)</ref> and is against promoting [[Russian language in Ukraine#Russian language in Ukrainian politics|Russian as the second state language in Ukraine]].<ref name="Ref_ai">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,647401,00.html 'The Problems Began After the Orange Revolution'], [[Spiegel Online]] (July 9, 2009)</ref>

According to Yushchenko, a good future for the country is impossible without national unity.<ref name=U>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/22104/ Yuschenko says good future for Ukraine impossible without national unity, reconciliation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021074301/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/22104/ |date=October 21, 2009 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (October 14, 2009)</ref> Yushchenko also advocates the formation of a single [[Orthodox Church]] in Ukraine, thus unifying the current three branches of the Orthodox church in Ukraine (the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate]], the only one recognized by the world orthodox community, the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate]] and the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]]).

Actions by the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] have been praised by Yushchenko,<ref name=U/> and he has tried to give anti-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] who fought in World War II the status of war veterans.<ref name="Ref_aj">{{cite web|url=http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/01/11/121551 |title=Yushchenko pushes for official recognition of OUN-UPA combatants |publisher=Zik.com.ua |date=2008-01-11 |access-date=2014-03-16}}</ref>

According to Yushchenko the difficulties of [[Ukrainian-Russian relations|relations between Ukraine and Russia]] are because the countries follow different directions and have different system of values.<ref name="Ref_ak">[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-353668.html Yushchenko: in case of victory of Yanukovych or Tymoshenko, all we to sing Murka], [[UNIAN]] (December 23, 2009)</ref> Yushchenko thinks that "the [[Russia-Georgia war]] of August 2008 poses a threat that European leaders still haven’t addressed". He has called for a [[demarcation line|demarcation]] of [[border]]s between Russia and Ukraine, which has been delayed by Russia since Ukraine won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.<ref name="Ref_al">[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a6iHrwUxQYZ0 Yushchenko Warns Obama of Russia’s Post-Georgia Security Threat], [[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg]] (September 20, 2009)</ref> During the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election#Electoral campaign|campaign for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2010]] Yushchenko said Russia's influence was again a factor in the upcoming election and warned of "interference" from Moscow in the distribution of [[Russian passport]]s to residents of [[Crimea]].<ref name="Ref_am">[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/49613 Monday Morning: Yushchenko says NATO needed to safeguard independence], [[Kyiv Post]] (September 28, 2009)</ref> He has also stated (on 10 December 2009) "Russia is a friendly country and that it would be a great mistake for Ukraine to lose these relations or to slow down their development; I believe that there will appear politicians in Russia, who will respect the rights of all neighbors, including Ukraine".<ref name="Ref_an">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/54709/ Yushchenko: Politicians respecting Ukraine's rights will appear in Russia], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 10, 2009)</ref>

Yushchenko's [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|2010 presidential election program]] promised visa-free travel with EU, the withdrawal of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] of the [[Russian Federation]] by 2017 and "an active dialogue with all of Ukraine's neighbours based on the principles of equal rights, good neighbourly relations and mutual trust", but did not mention NATO membership.<ref name="Ref_ao">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/53403/ Yuschenko's election platform promises visa-free travel with EU, not mentioning NATO membership], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 23, 2009)</ref> Yushchenko also believed that the [[2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis]] could be tackled with the help of reconstruction, including road reconstruction.<ref name="Ref_ap">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53321/ Yuschenko: crisis could be tackled through reconstruction, including road reconstruction], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 21, 2009)</ref> Furthermore, the program banned tax collection in advance, would return non-reimbursed VAT, create equal tax rules for everybody and stop government interference in certain enterprises and whole sectors of the economy.<ref name="Ref_aq">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/54554/ Presidential Secretariat: Yuschenko defends economic freedom in contrast to state monopolism of Tymoshenko], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 8, 2009)</ref>

==Family and private life==
In 1977, Yushchenko married Svitlana Ivanivna Kolesnyk, with whom he has two children and three grandchildren:<ref name="Ref_as">{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/worldabus/190781-mk-semya-ne-rada-yushchenko-ne-test |title=Московский комсомолец: Семья - не рада, Ющенко - не тесть (компромат) |publisher=Korrespondent.net |access-date=2014-03-16}}</ref>
* Vitalyna (b. 15 April 1980) currently married to Oleksiy Khakhlyov and has two children.
** Oleksiy Khakhlyov is a director of the Tar-paper Factory in [[Slavuta]], [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]]
* Andriy (b. 1985) married [[Yelyzaveta Efrosinina]] (b. 1981) in 2009 and has a daughter

In 1998, he married [[Kateryna Yushchenko|Kateryna Chumachenko]], with whom he has three children. She is a [[Ukrainian-American]] born in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] who received a degree in Economics from [[Georgetown University]] and an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Chicago]]. She also studied at the Ukrainian Institute at [[Harvard University]].

Her resume includes working for the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, the Bureau for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs at the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan White House]], the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], and the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee of Congress]]. In Ukraine she first worked with the US-Ukraine Foundation, then as Country Director for [[KPMG]] Barents Group. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

She heads the Ukraine 3000 Foundation, which emphasizes promoting civil society, particularly charity and corporate responsibility. The Foundation implements programs in the areas of children's health, integrating the disabled, improving education, supporting culture and the arts, publishing books, and researching history, particularly the [[Holodomor]]. From 1995 to 2005, she worked closely with Pryately Ditey, an organization that helps Ukrainian orphans. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Criticized by her husband's opponents for her US citizenship, Kateryna became a Ukrainian citizen in March 2005 and renounced her US citizenship, as required by Ukrainian law, in March 2007. During the 2004 election campaign, she was accused of exerting influence on behalf of the U.S. government on her husband's decisions, as an employee of the U.S. government or even a [[CIA]] agent. A Russian state television journalist had earlier accused her of leading a U.S. project to help Yushchenko seize power in Ukraine; in January 2002, she won a libel case against that journalist. Ukraine's then anti-Yushchenko TV channel [[Inter (TV channel)|Inter]] repeated the allegations in 2001, but in January 2003 she won a libel case against that channel. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Cultural and political image==
As a politician, Viktor Yushchenko is widely perceived as a mixture of Western-oriented and Ukrainian [[nationalist]]. He advocates moving Ukraine in the direction of Europe and NATO, promoting free market reforms, preserving Ukraine's culture, rebuilding important historical monuments, and remembering Ukraine's history, including the [[Holodomor]] famine of 1932–1933.  His opponents (and allies) sometimes criticize him for indecision and secrecy, while advocates call the same attributes signs of Yushchenko's commitment to teamwork, [[consensus]], and negotiation. He is also often accused of being unable to form a unified team free of inner quarrels.

[[United States Ambassador to Ukraine]] [[John F. Tefft]] described Yushchenko, in a document uncovered during the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]], as discredited among the population because of his weakness of leadership, continuous conflicts with [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], needless hostility towards Russia and his NATO ambitions.<ref name=WLCKyiv2232010>{{in lang|de|en}}[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,728632,00.html US-Probleme in der Ukraine: Fatales Spiel mit falschen Freunden], [[Der Spiegel]] (December 2, 2010)</ref>
