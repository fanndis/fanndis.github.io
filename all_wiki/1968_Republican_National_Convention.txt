The '''1968 National Convention''' of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of the United States was held at the [[Miami Beach Convention Center]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]], from August 5 to August 8, 1968, to select the party's nominee in the [[1968 United States presidential election|general election]]. It nominated former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Spiro Agnew|Spiro T. Agnew]] for vice president. It was the fourth time Nixon had been nominated on the Republican ticket as either its vice presidential ([[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]) or presidential candidate ([[1960 United States presidential election|1960]]).

==Political context==
{{Main|1968 Republican Party presidential primaries}}
[[File:Miami Beach FL Convention Center01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Miami Beach Convention Center]] was the site of the 1968 Republican National Convention.]]
Former Vice President [[Richard M. Nixon]], emerged as the frontrunner again for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. Nixon had been the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], and lost to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[John F. Kennedy]].

The so-called "New Nixon" in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]] devised a "[[Southern strategy]]," taking advantage of the region's opposition to racial integration and other progressive/liberal policies of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Nixon decided not to re-select his 1960 running mate [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], and [[House Minority Leader]] [[Gerald Ford|Gerald R. Ford]] of [[Michigan]] proposed [[New York City]] [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[John Lindsay|John V. Lindsay]] for vice president. Nixon turned instead to another perceived moderate, [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Spiro Agnew|Spiro T. Agnew]]. Agnew, former [[Baltimore County Executive]] in the [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]] suburbs (1963–1967), and since [[Governor of Maryland]], had come to Republican leaders and Nixon's attention when he summoned several Black civic, religious, and political leaders in Baltimore to the local State Office Building complex, following the disastrous [[Baltimore riot of 1968|April 1968 urban riots]] which enveloped Black sections of East and West Baltimore in the wake of the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Agnew complained of the Black leaders' lack of support after a number of what he perceived to be positive projects, programs and support by his Republican administration for the minority communities in the city. Agnew's biting comments caused many in the audience to walk out.

Nixon was nominated on the first ballot with 692 votes to 277 votes for [[Nelson Rockefeller]], 182 votes for California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] and the rest scattered. In his acceptance speech he deplored the state of the union: {{Quote|When the strongest nation in the world can be tied down for four years in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] with no end in sight, when the richest nation in the world can't manage its own economy, when the nation with the greatest tradition of the [[rule of law]] is plagued by unprecedented racial violence, when the President of the United States cannot travel abroad or to any major city at home, then it's time for new leadership for the United States of America.<ref>{{cite web |title=Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25968 |website=The American Presidency Project |accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>}}

Nixon also said that he had "a good teacher", referring to Eisenhower, and made the delegates happy with the statement "Let's win this one for Ike!" Eisenhower was not present during Nixon's speech nor during any part of the convention. Due to failing health, he was under doctor's orders not to travel. He died the following March.
