The '''CMT Music Awards''' is a fan-voted awards show for [[Country music|country]] [[music video]]s and television performances. The awards ceremony is held every year in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and broadcast live on [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]]. Voting takes place on CMT's website, CMT.com.

==History==
Beginning in 1967, the''' Music City News Awards''' were presented yearly by the now-defunct ''Music City News'' magazine. In 1988, [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN) began a fan-voted awards show dubbed the '''Viewers' Choice Awards''' to help the network celebrate its fifth anniversary. In 1990, the two awards shows merged to become the '''TNN/Music City News Country Awards'''.

The TNN contract with ''Music City News'' ended in 1999, and the magazine ceased publication shortly thereafter. ''[[Country Weekly]]'' became the presenting sponsor of the awards show in 2000, and the show was known as ''' ''Country Weekly'' presents the TNN Music Awards'''. In 2001, as TNN began to phase out its association with country music, the decision was made to shift the awards show to sister network CMT. The 2001 show was simulcast on both networks and was called the '''TNN/CMT ''Country Weekly'' Music Awards'''. When the show moved permanently to CMT, ''Country Weekly'' ended its brief association with the production. During this era, viewers voted for the nominees by telephone or mail in traditional categories such as "Entertainer of the Year," "Male/Female Artist of the Year," "Song of the Year," etc. Most of the categories mirrored those on the [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA Awards]] and [[Academy of Country Music Awards|ACM Awards]], except all awards were fan-voted{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

The awards show was completely retooled in 2002 to become the '''CMT Flameworthy Video Music Awards''', named for the network's branding concept at the time for its most popular videos ("flameworthy" based on the concept of [[Concert etiquette#Rock and metal music|concert lighter waving]] to ask for the playing of a popular song, rather than the meaning of [[Flaming (Internet)|Internet flaming]] most associated with the term today). The show became more production-based, rather than awards-based, and was modeled after sister network [[MTV]]'s [[MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Awards]]. In the process, the traditional awards were shifted to specifically honor the music videos of country artists. The "Flameworthy" name was coined by program development vice president Kaye Zusmann.<ref name="havighurst">{{cite news|title=Front-row video|first=Craig|last=Havighurst|work=The Tennessean|date=June 12, 2002}}</ref>

The show included several non-traditional categories highlighting especially funny, sexy, and patriotic videos; however, these categories were phased out over the years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Look for sexy, funny, patriotic at CMT video awards show|first=Peter|last=Cooper|work=The Tennessean|date=May 15, 2002}}</ref> The show further differentiated itself from the CMA Awards and ACM Awards by showcasing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] performers such as [[Alison Krauss]] and [[Earl Scruggs]].<ref name="havighurst"/>

In 2003, the show was moved to April but returned to June in 2009 to coincide with the [[CMA Music Festival]] (the renamed "Fan Fair") and the influx of tourists to Nashville as well as capitalize on a time when many of the artists would already be in Nashville at once. In 2020, the awards were delayed until October due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], with that year's CMA Fest not going forward. Initially planned for October 14, a scheduling conflict with that year's Billboard Music Awards caused the ceremony to be pushed back until October 21.

The name of the show was changed to '''CMT Music Awards''' in 2005, although the format remained largely the same as in previous years.<ref>{{cite news|title=You might be a redneck if you prognosticate correctly|first=Peter|last=Cooper|author2=Brad Schmitt|work=The Tennessean|date=April 11, 2005}}</ref>

==Special/discontinued awards==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
All of the traditional categories awarded during the TNN/''Music City News''/''Country Weekly'' era were discontinued following the 2001 show when the production was moved to CMT and retooled to honor music videos.

Several categories were removed after only one year, including the Love Your Country Video (2002), LOL (Laugh Out Loud) Video (2002), Fashion Plate Video (2002), Special Achievement (2003), Cocky Video (2003), Cameo of the Year (2004), Comedy Video (2008), Tearjerker Video (2008), and Supporting Character of the Year (2008). The Most Inspiring Video Award was presented only two years (2004–05).

In 2004, the [[Johnny Cash]] Visionary Award was introduced to honor innovation and vision in creating music (a similar award, "Video Visionary", was presented in 2002). [[Reba McEntire]] was the first recipient of the award.<ref>{{cite news|title='American Soldier' wins top Flame|first=Peter|last=Cooper|work=The Tennessean|date=April 22, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kristofferson honored for innovation and vision|first=Beverly|last=Keel|work=The Tennessean|date=April 17, 2007}}</ref> It was discontinued after 2007.

The Hottest Video of the Year award was discontinued after 2006 (and was split into Male/Female categories in 2003 alone). It honored videos featuring especially sexy performances by the artists or supporting cast.

In 2007, the Wide Open Country Video Award (named for the [[CMT Pure Country]] video block of the same name) was introduced to recognize music not normally played on country radio. [[Jack Ingram]]'s "[[Love You (Jack Ingram song)|Love You]]" was the first recipient.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fans crown Underwood star of the night at CMTs|first=Peter|last=Cooper|work=The Tennessean|date=April 17, 2007}}</ref> It was discontinued after 2009.

In 2009, the CMT Performance of the Year (to honor a CMT-exclusive performance by an artist or a collaboration) and [[Nationwide Insurance|Nationwide Is On Your Side]] awards (to honor an up-and-coming artist/group) were introduced. The Nationwide award is awarded off-camera, but the recipient offers a brief (taped) acceptance as the broadcast cuts to a commercial break.

In 2020, the first CMT Equal Play award was given to [[Jennifer Nettles]]. The award recognizes the work that an artist has done in fighting for parity. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Jennifer Nettles Says 'We Have More to Do' as She Accepts First-Ever CMT Equal Play Award|url=https://people.com/country/cmt-awards-2020-jennifer-nettles-equal-play-award-speech/|access-date=2020-11-09|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN}}</ref>
