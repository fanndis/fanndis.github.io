In 1975 he graduated the Kharkiv Higher Armor Command College. In 1975-80 Kuzmuk starting out as a platoon leader of armor forces served until becoming the deputy chief of staff of an armor regiment. In 1980-83 he was an audit student of the [[Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy]] ([[Moscow]]). After that until 1988 Kuzmuk was an instructor at the academy.

In 1988-93 he was in leading positions of mechanized rifle division. From 1975 to 1993 Kuzmuk served in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]], [[Belorussian Military District]], [[Moscow Military District]], [[Leningrad Military District]], [[Carpathian Military District]] and [[Odessa Military District]]. In 1993-95 he was a commander of the 32nd Army Corps, senior military chief of Crimea.

In 1995-96 Kuzmuk was a commander of the [[National Guard of Ukraine]] and in 1996-2001 - the Minister of Defense. At the end of 2001 he finished his military career and became a politician by participating in the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] on the party list of [[For United Ukraine]].

After the [[Orange Revolution]] Kuzmuk lost his ministerial seat and was replaced by [[Anatoliy Hrytsenko]].
