Between January 2012 and February 2014, plaintiffs in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee filed federal district court cases that culminated in ''Obergefell v. Hodges''. After all district courts ruled for the plaintiffs, the rulings were appealed to the [[Same-sex marriage in the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit]]. In November 2014, following a series of [[U.S. Courts of Appeals|appeals court]] rulings that year from the [[Same-sex marriage in the Fourth Circuit|Fourth]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]], and [[Same-sex marriage in the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] [[Same-sex marriage by Circuit Court|Circuits]] that state-level bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, the Sixth Circuit ruled that it was bound by ''[[Baker v.

===Michigan case: ''DeBoer v. Snyder''===
{{see also|DeBoer v. Snyder}}
One case came from Michigan, involving a female couple and their three children. April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse held a commitment ceremony in February 2007. They were foster parents. A son was born on January 25, 2009, and adopted by Rowse in November. A daughter was born on February 1, 2010, and adopted by DeBoer in April 2011. A second son was born on November 9, 2009, and adopted by Rowse in October 2011. Michigan law allowed adoption only by single people or married couples. Consequently, on January 23, 2012, DeBoer and Rowse filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] (Southern Division, Detroit), ''[[DeBoer v. Snyder]]'', alleging Michigan's adoption law was unconstitutional. [[Rick Snyder|Richard Snyder]], the lead defendant, was then governor of Michigan.<ref>[http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marriage/images/a/ae/DeBoer_v._Snyder_1_Complaint.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20130816053808 Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief], ''DeBoer v.

During a hearing on August 29, 2012, Judge [[Bernard A.

Two cases came from Ohio, the first ultimately involving a male couple, a widower, and a funeral director. In June 2013, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', [[Jim Obergefell|James "Jim" Obergefell]] ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|oʊ|b|ər|g|ə|f|ɛ|l}} {{Respell|OH|bər-gə-fel}}) and John Arthur decided to marry to obtain legal recognition of their relationship. They married in Maryland on July 11. After learning that their state of residence, [[Ohio]], would not recognize their marriage, they filed a lawsuit, ''Obergefell v. Kasich'', in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]] (Western Division, Cincinnati) on July 19, 2013, alleging that the state discriminates against same-sex couples who have married lawfully out-of-state. The lead defendant was Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]].<ref>[https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/ohio/ohsdce/1:2013cv00501/164617/1/0.pdf?ts=1376344485 Verified Complaint for Temporary Restraining Order and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief], ''Obergefell v.

As the case progressed, on July 22, District Judge [[Timothy S.

====''Henry v. Wymyslo''====
The second case from Ohio involved four couples, a child, and an adoption agency. Georgia Nicole Yorksmith and Pamela Yorksmith married in California on October 14, 2008. They had a son in 2010 and were expecting another child. In 2011, Kelly Noe and Kelly McCraken married in Massachusetts. They were expecting a child. Joseph J. Vitale and Robert Talmas married in New York on September 20, 2011. In 2013, they sought the services of the adoption agency, Adoption S.T.A.R., finally adopting a son on January 17, 2014, the same day Brittani Henry and Brittni Rogers married in New York. They, too, were expecting a son. The three female couples were living in Ohio, each anticipating the birth of a child later in 2014. Vitale and Talmas were living in New York with their adopted son, Child Doe, born in Ohio in 2013 and also a plaintiff through his parents. On February 10, 2014, the four legally married couples filed a lawsuit, ''Henry v.

===Tennessee case: ''Tanco v. Haslam''===
{{see also|Tanco v. Haslam}}
One case came from Tennessee, involving four same-sex couples. Joy "Johno" Espejo and Matthew Mansell married in California on August 5, 2008. On September 25, 2009, they adopted two foster children. After Mansell's job was transferred to the state, they relocated to Franklin, Tennessee, in May 2012. Kellie Miller and Vanessa DeVillez married in New York on July 24, 2011, later moving to Tennessee. Army Reservist Sergeant First Class Ijpe DeKoe and Thomas Kostura married in New York on August 4, 2011. In May 2012, after completing a tour of duty in Afghanistan, Sergeant DeKoe was restationed in Memphis, Tennessee, where the couple subsequently relocated. On September 3, 2013, the Department of Defense began recognizing their marriage, but the state did not. Valeria Tanco and Sophia Jesty married in New York on September 9, 2011, then moved to Tennessee, where they were university professors. They were expecting their first child in 2014. On October 21, 2013, wishing to have their out-of-state marriages recognized in Tennessee, the four couples filed a lawsuit, ''[[Tanco v. Haslam]]'', in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee]] (Nashville Division). [[Bill Haslam|William Edwards Haslam]], the lead defendant, was then governor of Tennessee.<ref>[http://oakridgetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tanco-v.-Haslam.pdf Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief] at 1, 5–6, 38, ''Tanco v.

As the case progressed, on November 19, 2013, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining the state from applying its marriage recognition ban against them.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/gov.uscourts.tnmd.57114/gov.uscourts.tnmd.57114.29.0.pdf Motion for Preliminary Injunction], ''Tanco'', No. 3:13-cv-01159 (motion filed Nov. 19, 2013); [http://www.nclrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/TN-Prelim-Injunction.pdf Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction], ''Tanco'', No. 3:13-cv-01159 (memorandum filed Nov. 19, 2013).</ref> On March 10, 2014, plaintiff couple Kellie Miller and Vanessa DeVillez withdrew from the case.<ref>[http://attorneygeneral.tn.gov/cases/tanco/tancostipulation-3-10-2014.pdf Stipulation of Dismissal of Plaintiffs Kellie Miller and Vanessa DeVillez and Defendant Bill Gibbons], ''Tanco'', No. 3:13-cv-01159 (stipulation filed Mar. 10, 2014).</ref> On March 14, Judge [[Aleta Arthur Trauger]] granted a preliminary injunction requiring the state to recognize the marriages of the three plaintiff couples. She wrote, "At this point, all signs indicate that, in the eyes of the United States Constitution, the plaintiffs' marriages will be placed on an equal footing with those of heterosexual couples and that proscriptions against same-sex marriage will soon become a footnote in the annals of American history."<ref>''Tanco'', [https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/tennessee/tnmdce/3:2013cv01159/57114/67/0.pdf?ts=1394893463 slip op.] at 19; see, also, ''Tanco'', No. 3:13-cv-01159 ([https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/tennessee/tnmdce/3:2013cv01159/57114/69/0.pdf?ts=1394893964 preliminary injunction]) (preliminary injunction filed Mar. 14, 2014).</ref> The state immediately filed a motion to stay this ruling, but, on March 20, Judge Trauger denied the request, reasoning that "the court's order does not open the floodgates for same-sex couples to marry in Tennessee ... [and] applies only to the three same-sex couples at issue in this case."<ref>[https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/tennessee/tnmdce/3:2013cv01159/57114/78/0.pdf?ts=1395410460 Memorandum and Order] at 7, ''Tanco'', No. 3:13-cv-01159 (memorandum and order filed Mar. 20, 2014).</ref>

On November 6, 2014, in a decision styled ''DeBoer v. Snyder'', the Sixth Circuit ruled 2–1 that Ohio's ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The court said it was bound by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1972 action in a similar case, ''[[Baker v.

===Merits briefs===
On January 16, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court consolidated the four same-sex marriage cases challenging state laws that prohibited same-sex marriage—''[[DeBoer v. Snyder]]'' (Michigan), ''Obergefell v. Hodges'' (Ohio), ''[[Bourke v. Beshear]]'' (Kentucky), and ''[[Tanco v. Haslam]]'' (Tennessee)—and agreed to review the case. It set a briefing schedule to be completed April 17. The Court ordered briefing and oral argument on the following questions:
# Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex?
# Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?
The Court also told the parties to each of the four cases to address only the questions raised in their particular case. Thus, ''Obergefell'' raises only the second question, the recognition of same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions.<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011615zr_f2q3.pdf Order List], 574 U.S. ___ (Jan. 16, 2015) (No. 14-556) (order granting cert.); regarding case consolidation, generally, see Fed.

[[File:SCOTUS Marriage Equality 2015 (Obergefell v. Hodges) - 26 June 2015.jpg|thumb|left|On the morning of June 26, 2015 outside the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the crowd celebrates the Court's decision.]]

On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court held in a 5–4 decision that the Fourteenth Amendment requires all states to grant same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages granted in other states. The Court overruled its prior decision in ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', which the Sixth Circuit had invoked as precedent.

The ''Obergefell v. Hodges'' decision came on the second anniversary of the ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' ruling that struck down Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which denied federal recognition to same-sex marriages, as being unconstitutional. It also came on the twelfth anniversary of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which struck down sodomy laws in 13 states. The ''Obergefell'' decision was issued on the second-to-last decision day of the Court's term; and, as late as 9:59&nbsp;a.m. in the morning of the decision, same sex couples were unable to marry in many states.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koch|first1=Brittany Blackburn|title=The Effect of Obergefell v.

The justices' opinions in ''Obergefell'' are consistent with their opinions in ''Windsor'' which rejected DOMA's recognition of only opposite-sex marriages for certain purposes under federal law.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schiff Hardin LLP|title=New Employee Benefits Rules for Some Same-Sex Marriages|journal=The National Law Review|date=3 July 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-employee-benefits-rules-some-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> In both cases, Justice Kennedy authored the majority opinions and was considered the "swing vote".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Dan|last2=Siddiqui|first2=Sabrina|title=Anthony Kennedy: How One Man's Evolution Legalized Marriage for Millions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/26/kennedy-ruling-gay-marriage-supreme-court |website=The Guardian|date=June 26, 2015|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}</ref>

===Majority opinion===
[[File:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] authored the Court's opinion declaring same-sex couples have the right to marry.]]
Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] authored the [[majority opinion]] and was joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan]]. The majority held that state same-sex marriage bans are a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses.

"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach," the Court declared, "a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity."<ref>''Obergefell v. Hodges'', No. 14-556, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 1–2 (U.S. June 26, 2015).</ref> Citing ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', the Court affirmed that the [[fundamental rights]] found in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause "extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs," but the "identification and protection" of these fundamental rights "has not been reduced to any formula."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 10 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</ref> As the Supreme Court has found in cases such as ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', ''[[Zablocki v. Redhail]]'', and ''[[Turner v. Safley]]'', this extension includes a fundamental right to marry.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 11.</ref>

The Court rejected respondent states' framing of the issue as whether there were a "right to same-sex marriage,"<ref>The dissenting justices framed the issue similarly, but not necessarily using the same language. See the dissenting opinions below.</ref> insisting its precedents "inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right." Indeed, the majority averred, "If rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification and new groups could not invoke rights once denied." Citing its prior decisions in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the Court framed the issue accordingly in ''Obergefell''.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 18 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</ref>

The Court listed four distinct reasons why the fundamental right to marry applies to same-sex couples, citing ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' in support throughout its discussion. First, "the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 12.</ref> Second, "the right to marry is fundamental because it supports a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals," a principle applying equally to same-sex couples.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 13.</ref> Third, the fundamental right to marry "safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education"; as same-sex couples have children and families, they are deserving of this safeguard—though the right to marry in the United States has never been conditioned on procreation.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 14–16.</ref> Fourth, and lastly, "marriage is a keystone of our social order," and "[t]here is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this principle"; consequently, preventing same-sex couples from marrying puts them at odds with society, denies them countless benefits of marriage, and introduces instability into their relationships for no justifiable reason.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 16–17.</ref>

The Court noted the relationship between the liberty of the Due Process Clause and the equality of the Equal Protection Clause and determined that same-sex marriage bans violated the latter.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 19–22.</ref> Concluding that the liberty and equality of same-sex couples was significantly burdened, the Court struck down same-sex marriage bans for violating both clauses, holding that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all fifty states "on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 22–23.</ref>

Due to the "substantial and continuing harm" and the "instability and uncertainty" caused by state marriage laws differing with regard to same-sex couples, and because respondent states had conceded that a ruling requiring them to marry same-sex couples would undermine their refusal to hold valid same-sex marriages performed in other states, the Court also held that states must recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 27–28.</ref>

Addressing respondent states' argument, the Court emphasized that, while the democratic process may be an appropriate means for deciding issues such as same-sex marriage, no individual has to rely solely on the democratic process to exercise a fundamental right.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 23–26.</ref> "An individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act," for "fundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 24 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</ref> Furthermore, to rule against same-sex couples in this case, letting the democratic process play out as "a cautious approach to recognizing and protecting fundamental rights" would harm same-sex couples in the interim.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 25–26. The Court invoked ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' as an exemplum of this principle.</ref>

Additionally, the Court rejected the notion that allowing same-sex couples to marry harms the institution of marriage, leading to fewer opposite-sex marriages through a severing of the link between procreation and marriage, calling the notion "counterintuitive" and "unrealistic".<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 26.</ref> Instead, the Court stated that married same-sex couples "would pose no risk of harm to themselves or third parties".<ref name="Obergefell, slip op. at 27">''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 27.</ref> The majority also stressed that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects those who disagree with same-sex marriage.<ref name="Obergefell, slip op. at 27"/>

In closing, Justice Kennedy wrote for the Court:

{{quote|text=No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 28.</ref>}}

===Dissenting opinions===

====Chief Justice Roberts====
[[File:Official roberts CJ.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In his dissent, [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] argued same-sex marriage bans did not violate the Constitution.]]

Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] wrote a [[dissenting opinion]], which was joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. Roberts accepted [[substantive due process]], by which [[fundamental rights]] are protected through the [[Due Process Clause]], but warned it has been misused over time to expand perceived fundamental rights, particularly in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' and ''[[Lochner v. New York]]''.<ref>''Obergefell v. Hodges'', No. 14-556, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 10–15 (U.S. June 26, 2015) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> Roberts stated that no prior decision had changed the core component of marriage, that it be between one man and one woman; consequently, same-sex marriage bans did not violate the Due Process Clause.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 15–17 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> Roberts also rejected the notion that same-sex marriage bans violated a [[right to privacy]], because they involved no government intrusion or subsequent punishment.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 17–18 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> Addressing the [[Equal Protection Clause]], Roberts stated that same-sex marriage bans did not violate the clause because they were rationally related to a governmental interest: preserving the traditional definition of marriage.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 24 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref>

More generally, Roberts stated that marriage, which he proposed had always had a "universal definition" as "the union of a man and a woman", arose to ensure successful childrearing.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 4–5 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> Roberts criticized the majority opinion for relying on moral convictions rather than a constitutional basis, and for expanding fundamental rights without caution or regard for history.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 19–20 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> He also suggested the majority opinion could be used to expand marriage to include legalized polygamy.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 20–21 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> Roberts chided the majority for overriding the democratic process and for using the judiciary in a way that was not originally intended.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 24–26 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> According to Roberts, supporters of same-sex marriage cannot win "true acceptance" for their side because the debate has now been closed.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 26–27 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref> Roberts also suggested the majority's opinion will ultimately lead to consequences for religious liberty, and he found the Court's language unfairly attacks opponents of same-sex marriage.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 27–29 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</ref>

====Justice Scalia====
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Thomas. Scalia stated that the Court's decision effectively robs the people of "the freedom to govern themselves", noting that a rigorous debate on same-sex marriage had been taking place and that, by deciding the issue nationwide, the democratic process had been unduly halted.<ref>''Obergefell v. Hodges'', No. 14-556, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 2 (U.S. June 26, 2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref> Addressing the claimed [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] violation, Scalia asserted that, because a same-sex marriage ban would not have been considered unconstitutional at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, such bans are not unconstitutional today.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 4 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref> He claimed there was "no basis" for the Court's decision striking down legislation that the Fourteenth Amendment does not expressly forbid, and directly attacked the majority opinion for "lacking even a thin veneer of law".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lastly, Scalia faulted the actual writing in the opinion for "diminish[ing] this Court's reputation for clear thinking and sober analysis" and for "descend[ing] from the disciplined legal reasoning of [[John Marshall]] and [[Joseph Story]] to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 9, 8 n.22 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</ref>

====Justice Thomas====
[[File:Clarence Thomas official.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a dissent rejecting [[substantive due process]].]]

Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Scalia. Thomas rejected the principle of substantive due process, which he claimed "invites judges to do exactly what the majority has done here—roa[m] at large in the constitutional field guided only by their personal views as to the fundamental rights protected by that document"; in doing so, the judiciary strays from the Constitution's text, subverts the democratic process, and "exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority."<ref>''Obergefell v. Hodges'', No. 14-556, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 2–3 (U.S. June 26, 2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</ref> Thomas argued that the only liberty that falls under Due Process Clause protection is freedom from "physical restraint".<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 6–7 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref> Furthermore, Thomas insisted that "liberty has long been understood as individual freedom ''from'' governmental action, not as a right ''to'' a particular governmental entitlement" such as a marriage license.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 7 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref> According to Thomas, the majority's holding also undermines the political process and threatens religious liberty.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 13–14, 14–16 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref> Lastly, Thomas took issue with the majority's view that marriage advances the dignity of same-sex couples. In his view, government is not capable of bestowing dignity; rather, dignity is a natural right that is innate within every person, a right that cannot be taken away even through slavery and internment camps.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 16–17 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref>

====Justice Alito====
Justice [[Samuel Alito]] wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. Invoking ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', in which the Court stated the Due Process Clause protects only rights and liberties that are "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition", Alito claimed any "right" to same-sex marriage would not meet this definition; he chided the justices in the majority for going against judicial precedent and long-held tradition.<ref>''Obergefell v. Hodges'', No. 14-556, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 2–3 (U.S. June 26, 2015) (Alito, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</ref> Alito defended the rationale of the states, accepting the premise that same-sex marriage bans serve to promote procreation and the optimal childrearing environment.<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 3–6 (Alito, J., dissenting).</ref> Alito expressed concern that the majority's opinion would be used to attack the beliefs of those who disagree with same-sex marriage, who "will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools", leading to "bitter and lasting wounds".<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 6–7 (Alito, J., dissenting).</ref> Expressing concern for judicial abuse, Alito concluded, "Most Americans—understandably—will cheer or lament today's decision because of their views on the issue of same-sex marriage. But all Americans, whatever their thinking on that issue, should worry about what the majority's claim of power portends."<ref>''Obergefell'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf slip op.] at 8 (Alito, J., dissenting).</ref>
