'''Wolfgang Schnur''' (8 June 1944 – 16 January 2016) was an [[East Germany|East German]] civil rights lawyer. He was closely involved with the [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Association of Evangelical Churches (''"Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen"'' / BEK)]] and worked on many of the cases in which the BEK's leading figures were involved. He also became well networked, on more than one level, with the country's [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|political establishment]].<ref name=WSlautHME>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=3117| title=Schnur, Wolfgang * 8.6.1944, † 16.1.2016 Vorsitzender der Partei Demokratischer Aufbruch| publisher= Ch.

East Germany was a [[one-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]]. During the 1970s and 1980s, the churches increasingly provided an outlet for alternative political views which, under a more decentralised system, would have been expressed through an effective multi-party parliamentary structure. Schnur was a founding member of the oppositional [[Democratic Awakening|"Demokratischer Aufbruch" (''loosely "Democratic Awakening"'' / DA)]] in October 1989.  He was one of the "new party" leadership team's most attractive and dynamic members:  over the next few months there was talk of Wolfgang Schnur becoming prime minister in a new genuinely democratic [[German Democratic Republic]]. In February 1990 he appointed [[Angela Merkel]] as a press spokeswoman, the start of a remarkable political career. Wolfgang Schnur's political career had peaked, however. On 8 March 1990 he rejected allegations that he had been a [[Stasi]] [[Unofficial collaborator|informer]]. On 14 March 1990, less than a week before East Germany's first (and only) [[1990 East German general election|free parliamentary election]], it was reported that Schnur had resigned from the presidency of Democratic Awakening. He was expelled from the party the next day.<ref name=WSlautHME/><ref name=WSlautAK/><ref name="Kobylinski2016">{{cite book|author= Alexander Kobylinski|title=Der verratene Verräter: Wolfgang Schnur: Bürgerrechtsanwalt und Spitzenspitzel| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8uaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT5|date=26 January 2016| publisher=Mitteldeutscher Verlag| isbn=978-3-95462-679-3|pages=|accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=WSlautEK>{{cite web| url=https://www.ddr89.de/personen/schnur.html| work=DDR 1989/90 |title=Wolfgang Schnur|publisher=Erhard Kleps, Berlin| accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=AMlautGP>{{cite web|url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german| title=The Quiet German|work=The astonishing rise of Angela Merkel, the most powerful woman in the world.|date=1 December 2014| author=George Packer|publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref>

==Life==
===Provenance and early years===
Wolfgang Schnur was born in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] which at that time was in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Stettin was a strategic port and as Schnur was born the city center and many of the surrounding residential and commercial districts were bombed by [[RAF Bomber Command|British bombers]]. Infection was rampant and very soon after his birth Wolfgang fell ill with [[Diphtheria#Diphtheritic croup|Laryngeal Diphtheria]]. Wolfgang Schnur never knew his father: such vague and contradictory "facts" as have emerged about his paternity have been difficult to confirm and are likely to be, at least in part, incorrect. Wolfgang's mother, Erna Hermine Schnur had been born in [[Danzig]] on 24 July 1915. Schnur was her birth-name, so she was probably unmarried. At the time of Wolfgang's birth she was working as a domestic servant for a couple called "Piper". When, in the context of the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|ethnic cleansing of 1944/45]], the Pipers moved to [[Lübeck]], Erna Schnur went with them, leaving Wolfgang behind. She had already, in December 1941, given birth to Wolfgang's sister, Brigitte who had been taken from her mother within a few days and transferred to an orphanage.  In the context of the chaos of the final part of the [[Second World War]], records that may have been created concerning Wolfgang's paternity and first weeks of life do not survive, but it is known that once he had recovered from his Diphtheria he was moved directly from the hospital wing to the "Bergquell Children's Home" in Stettin, since "his mother did not want him".<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

By the time the [[Red army|Soviet army]] captured Stettin on 27 April 1945, inmates and patients from the children's home and the nearby children's hospital had been evacuated to the [[Rügen|Island of Rügen]] a short distance to the west, where an abandoned barracks building was reassigned to accommodate them. The "Children's Barracks", as it became known, also accommodated the smaller infants. Meanwhile, following a [[Yalta Conference|redrawing of frontiers]], [[Szczecin|Stettin]] [[Oder–Neisse line|had become]] [[Recovered Territories|part of Poland]], ostensibly to compensate for the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish lands now incorporated into the Soviet Union]]. Evacuation to the island meant that Schnur would grow up, classified as a "parentless child" (''"elternloses Kind"'') in the part of Germany [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered]] as the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. In April 1946 he was placed with foster parents at [[Samtens|Natzevitz]], a small village on the southern part of Rügen.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

Martha and Rudolf Mummethei were so-called "new peasants", who had been allocated a parcel of land following the break-up by the military authorities of the great landed estates (and before the more long-lasting East German land reforms). Rudolf Mummethei had become a "milker" and Martha Mummethei, who before the war had worked as a domestic servant for one of the landowning families in the region, now ran the home and helped her husband with his agricultural work. Wolfgang spent his early childhood believing that Martha and Rudolf Mummethei were his parents. When he was five or six they carefully explained to him that they were not his "real parents", and that his real parents were "probably dead".  Later Schnur would describe his shock at the revelation and also his anger that his foster parents had only told him the truth after the Children's Office of the local Welfare Department had intervened on several occasions, instructing them to do so. For the next ten years, he grew up believing himself a "full orphan", unaware that his mother was still alive. Despite his conflicted emotions, on learning that the Mummetheis were not his "real parents", Schnur had a mostly good relationship with his foster parents, who treated him "as their own". Files nevertheless refer to his having run away at least once, and having been removed from his foster parents home on several occasions, which Schnur later attributed to his foster mother's nervous illness on account of a bad nose fracture and resulting "substantial social difficulties".  In many respects, Schnur's situation was not so different from that of many of his contemporaries. War had created many orphans.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

In 1951 he was sent to the junior school at a village in the area called Seedorf. Interviewed sixty years later his former teacher, Horst Bürger, still recalled his deep interest in politics. He was a "good student" and engaged fully in the activities and trips of the [[Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation]] and also stood out because of his contributions in school plays. He excelled in lessons and his teacher recommended, unusually in rural East Germany at this time, that he should be entered for the [[Abitur]], which would have opened the way to university-level education. On 1 September 1959 he transferred to the senior school at [[Bergen auf Rügen]] in order to prepare for the exam.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

===Mother===
At Christmas 1960 the sixteen-year-old Wolfgang Schnur discovered that he was not an orphan. His mother was alive and had been found living in [[German Federal Republic|the west]].<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

The news came from Dr.Alfred Weckram, his former pediatrician at the little hospital in [[Bergen auf Rügen|Bergen]].  The doctor also told him that as far back as 1946 his mother had posted a small "search advertisement" [in a newspaper]. The doctor showed him the "small ad".  The doctor seems to have been operating on behalf of the East German tracing service. Schnur immediately became convinced that in the chaos of the final months of the war he and his mother had become separated against his mother's will. This is what he would write in an extensive autobiographical résumé that he provided to the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] much later, in March 1983. There could be no other explanation for the "search advertisement" from 1946. It was only much later that he learned from Erna Schnur's stepmother something of the difficulties that his mother had experienced during the [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist years]]. Erna Schnur was half Jewish and had herself spent the war years in Stettin, hidden by a succession of families in order to avoid being caught up in the [[Shoah]].  It was only with the arrival of the Red Army in April 1945 that she had been able to come out of hiding. (An explanation for her not having retrieved her child from the orphanage before leaving for Lübeck never emerged, however.)<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

By 1960 Erna Schnur had been living for fourteen years in [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe|Bad Homburg]], near [[Frankfurt am Main]]. She was employed by the [[:de:Waldkrankenhaus Köppern|Waldkrankenhaus]], a psychiatric hospital in the [[:de:Köppern|Köppern]] quarter of [[Friedrichsdorf]], a couple of kilometers outside Homburg. Although she never married, she had told the tracing services in West Germany that the existence of her children should not be disclosed to her employers. In August 1961 (eight days before the sudden and unexpected erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] heralded a rapid intensification of east-west travel restrictions) Wolfgang Schnur booked himself time off work and set off excitedly for a joyful reunion with his mother, traveling via Berlin and passing through the [[Friedrichstraße]] passport control point without encountering any delays. Since Christmas mother and son had written to each other several times, but Wolfgang had not mentioned his plans for a visit. That would be a surprise. Since Christmas he had left school and embarked on an apprenticeship at the [[Stralsund]] [[shipyard]]. His school in [[Bergen auf Rügen|Bergen]] had arranged the apprenticeship for him only after becoming convinced of his determination not to complete his academic course.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

After crossing into [[West Berlin]] he stopped off at a [[Summer camp|Youth Camp]] where he was required to undergo a medical examination. A shadow in his lungs was identified. On 13 August 1961 [[Berlin Wall|the wall went up]]. On 23 August 1961 he was nevertheless able to leave the city, taking a flight from West Berlin to [[Giessen]] where he was accommodated at another [[Summer camp|Youth reception Camp]], not far from his mother's home at Bad Homburg.  When Wolfgang turned up, unannounced, at her front door, Erna Schur's reaction was not the one that her son had anticipated. There was no welcoming hug. She did not even invite him into her home. She was simply overwhelmed by the situation. She did, in fact, almost at once arrange for him to transfer from the [[Summer camp|Youth reception Camp]] in Giessen to an [[Internationaler Bund]] establishment in Homburg which specialised in preparing young [[Republikflucht|refugees]] from East Germany for life in the west. Wolfgang was nevertheless desperately hurt that he had crossed the country in search of his long lost mother only to find himself an inmate of yet another institution. His relationship with his mother would never become close.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>   Commentators have seen some of his more remarkable actions and character traits as evidence of a deeply seated search for an "alternative mother".<ref name=WSlautIFL/>

For the next few years, he stayed in the area. Between August 1961 and October 1962 he was able to support himself as a youth worker. The tasks were not so different from some of the activities in which he had been involved with the [[Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]]. In October 1963 he was able to collect a western [[Mittlere Reife|Middle School]] completion certificate. He was not unduly troubled by the political differences that had by now developed between east and west. There were people in charge who set the rules, and you did what you did within those rules. He was appointed, in May 1962, to the vice-presidency of a Youth Social Work forum in [[Hesse]]. In the longer term, he decided to build a career as a journalist, and he applied successfully for a traineeship with the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], which started in September 1962. The paper was keen to send him to [[East Berlin]] to gather material on politics, economics and sport. However, Schur was nervous about the idea, fearing (with good cause) that after his extended stay in the west he might find himself convicted of [[Republikflucht|Escaping from the Republic (''"Republikflucht"'')]], a crime which under Paragraph 213 of the East German criminal code would normally lead to a prison sentence.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

==="Asylum" back home in the German Democratic Republic===
At some stage Wolfgang Schur nevertheless decided to return to East Germany. He himself later explained that "there were two things that drew ... [him] ... back."   One was that he badly missed his stepmother, whom he had neglected to tell about his plans when he had headed across to Bad Homburg, and the other was that in Oberursel he met up with a school teacher whom he identified, in the context of the times, as a Nazi. That may have been less than a total explanation, but it does appear that he could see no long term future for himself in [[West Germany|the west]].  On 21 October 1962 he crossed into the German Democratic Republic at the [[Wartha (Eisenach)|Wartha]] border crossing near [[Eisenach]]. As he had anticipated, the East German officials were unsure of how to deal with him. He was not a typical disillusioned westerner seeking a new life in the workers' and peasants' paradise. The question arose, as he had anticipated, of whether he might be charged with "[[Republikflucht]]". He was held at a detention centre in Eisenach while decisions were made about his future. There were questionnaires to be filled out. Then, after two days, he was permitted back into the country without further ado, and by the end of October 1962 he was back with his foster parents in [[:de:Samtens|Natzevitz]]. His foster mother welcomed him home with the immediate hug that his birth mother had not been able to provide. It was only later that various more intractable difficulties with the authorities, arising from his year in the west, became apparent.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

In many ways, he had to start again. After intense investigations by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] he was accepted under a conditional contract as a track construction assistant, working for the rail depot at [[Bergen auf Rügen|Bergen]]. At the political and bureaucratic levels there was a powerful mutual suspicion between East and West Germany, and the authorities evidently thought that Schur might have been smuggled back into East Germany in order to spy for [[Federal Intelligence Service|western intelligence]]. He himself was under intense surveillance from comrades looking for any signs that he might be a spy. After six months a back injury made it necessary for him to give up the labouring job on the railways, and in May 1963 he was assigned to an office job with the [[Handelsorganisation|East German Trade Organisation]], with which he remained till October 1966. Here the situation seemed more relaxed, and an older female comrade with a motherly touch took him in hand and showed him how to become a "good comrade".<ref name=JSabPanSED>{{cite web| url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/uploads/pdf-2010/pannen.pdf|title="Wo ein Genosse ist, da ist die Partei!"? - Stabilität und Erosion an der SED-Parteibasis |author=Sabine Pannen |publisher=Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=23 March 2019}}</ref>    He soon worked out how to join the political mainstream and on 16 March 1965 his application to become a candidate for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership was accepted and his name was added to the candidates list. He took on (unpaid) party work and became a local leader with the [[Free German Youth]].<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

===Free German Youth===
Schnur's obvious intellectual ability and meticulous approach, combined with his determination to become a "good comrade" brought him to the attention of the authorities. His complicated childhood and relationship with his mother, along with questionable aspects of his year in the west, also opened up vulnerabilities which might turn out to be useful. He was headhunted to study Marxism-Leninism at the "Free German Youth Wilhelm Pieck Academy" (''"Jugendhochschule Wilhelm Pieck"'' – housed in a [[Bogensee|lakeside villa]] which had been, in another time, the holiday home of [[Joseph Goebbels]]). The course commenced at the beginning of September 1965. By the end of October 1965 Schnur had withdrawn from it, ostensibly on health grounds. [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security]] files disclose a more complicated reason. New information had come to the attention of [[Free German Youth|FDJ]] officers concerning Schnur's time in the west when he had engaged in youth work in [[Oberursel]]. The Oberursel facility in which he had been based was believed – probably correctly – to be heavily infiltrated by US-Intelligence, and further enquiries failed to extinguish intensified security service suspicions about Schnur. The [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security]] themselves had already investigated his background thoroughly and had already filled files with large amounts of information about his time in the west, but those details could not be disclosed in elaborate detail to the [[Free German Youth|Free German Youth (FDJ)]] decision-takers who now simply asserted that no future FDJ official should have links to the west. And his mother actually lived in the west!   Schnur was expelled from the [[Free German Youth|FDJ]] which he himself always claimed to regard as a career catastrophe for his subsequent career prospects. The [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security]] tended to take a more strategic view, however, and seem to have regarded the entire incident as no more than a setback. Their fundamental faith in Wolfgang Schnur's long term potential – of which Schnur himself still knew nothing – was not affected.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

In the aftermath of the FDJ affair, Schnur's candidacy for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership was set aside on 28 February 1966, which he himself regarded as a major punishment (''ein "hohes Strafmaß"''). Meanwhile, it turns out that he had already been providing information to [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security (''"Stasi"'')]] officers, possibly without even knowing that they were Stasi officers, in connection with "Operation Bussard". No surviving files describing Operation Bussard have been located and Schnur himself, when asked about it decades later, said he could not remember what it was all about. There is no equivalent uncertainty, however, concerning his signature, dated 4 June 1965, on the declaration agreeing to become a [[Stasi]] [[Unofficial collaborator|informer]]. The document includes his code name, "[[Unofficial collaborator|GI]] Torsten".{{efn |The document of the time uses the term "Geheimer Informant" (''"Secret Informant"'').   The term used since 1968, and frequently applied retrospectively in sources to earlier years, is "Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter" (''loosely, "Unofficial [co-]worker"''}} By now he was 21.  Exceptionally ambitious personally and financially, he recognised that he still had much "catching up" to do if he ever wanted to be a "good comrade", following his year in the west. He chose the name Torsten because a friend at work had a son called Torsten.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

===Stasi===
The meeting at which he had signed up had taken place in a "secret apartment" (''"konspirative Wohnung"'') near his home somewhere on [[Rügen]], and this apartment, made available by the elderly lady who lived in it and who was herself an [[Unofficial collaborator|IM]], now became his Stasi contact location. His first operation - probably a test mission - announced itself in the form of a letter from a young woman in [[Hamburg]] who wanted to visit him on [[Rügen|the island]]. He had originally met Marlies Bähr at a large [[Free German Youth|FDJ]] [[:de:Deutschlandtreffen der Jugend|east-west social event]] in [[East Berlin]] the previous year. Schnur wrote back just four days later, recommending a holiday apartment which the municipality rented out to holiday makers. When he reported back to his [[Stasi]] handler it was agreed that the authorities would arrange the Miss Bähr's holiday themselves, and a room was booked for her at a little guest-house in [[Binz]]. Marlies Bähr arrived and a "holiday romance" ensued although, as his handling officer's surviving report approvingly attests, his genuine infatuation did nothing to compromise the excellent quality of Schnur's "espionage" work with respect to the young women. Over several days, as they danced, walked, flirted and just sat and talked, he subjected her to a sustained and intensive interrogation which, it appears, she barely noticed, in order to evaluate her true feelings and motives in respect of political matters and her personal life. Officers who read his detailed reports of the social interaction between himself and Marlies compared him to an "uninterrupted continually running tape recorder". That quality is apparent from the level of detail in a succession of [[Stasi]] files covering Schnur's activity over the next 24 years. Marlies was a student at the (US-funded) [[Free University of Berlin]]. His Stasi handlers became satisfied that she was not an American spy, and they shared Schnur's conviction that she must have picked up a large amount of knowledge about East German students who had emigrated – after [[Berlin Wall|1961]] "escaped" –  to the west. The opportunities were all too obvious. Marlies was just the person to convince "Torsten" about the superior freedoms available in the west, and to help him plan and organise an "escape to the west" on his own account. Marlies Bähr was of limited interest to the [[Stasi]] as a potential intelligence source, but as a possible route into the closed circle of [[Free University of Berlin|FU students]] around [[:de:Detlef Girrmann|Detlef Girrmann]] (and others) helping often desperate East German citizens escape to the west, she could be invaluable.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

At the end of her holiday, Marlies Bähr was more unsure than ever of what to make of "Torsten". As he reported to his handlers, she had made clear that she had no wish to engage with him in any more discussions about politics. Possibly he had "gone too far". But she was happy to tell him what she knew about escaping from East Germany to the west. She knew it was very dangerous. To do it he must be 150% sure that it was what he wanted. She had heard of East German escaping via Turkish ships in the Mediterranean after managing to get themselves included on government-sponsored Mediterranean youth-holidays on an East German ship. But she very strongly counselled him to do everything he could to find a legal route for any escape to the west before involving himself with the illegal methods. "Torsten" was not successful in getting her to disclose whatever she knew about the "Fluchthelfer" (''escape helpers'') among her university contemporaries. He reported that she knew "nothing concrete" about that side of things. But Schnur's handlers were more interested in using Marlies to enable "Torsten" himself to become involved with the "traffickers". She introduced him to "Hendrik", a student at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] to whom "Torsten" confided that he still feared arrest, following the unpleasantnesses at the "Free German Youth Wilhelm Pieck Academy". Hendrik did not want to know the details, but he was indignant on Torsten's behalf and understood the point at once. He knew a man.... Somehow "Torsten" very soon broke off contact with both Marlies and Hendrik, but the exceptionally comprehensive and detailed nature of the reports of his various meetings that Schnur submitted to his handlers continued to impress. His progress may well still have been held up through suspicions generated on account of his connections with the west, but he was nevertheless given a succession of further assignments to investigate and report back.  On his home base at [[Rügen]] he was employed as an "omni-directional radar" to identify and investigate possibly negative or hostile elements among the young people on the holiday island.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

===The church community and a first marriage===
A possibly more important assignment came up in April 1966 when "Torsten" was sent to join the youth club attached to the [[:de:Evangelische Kirche Binzen|protestant church]] at [[Binzen]]. The Stasi knew that the church's youth community included conscript soldiers and [[Construction soldier|so-called "Bausoldaten" (non-combatant conscientious objector soldiers)]] from the [[National People's Army|NVA]] barracks at [[Prora]]. The [[Construction soldier|"Bausoldaten"]] were viewed with particular suspicion. "Torsten" reported back with characteristic detail and precision on conversations at the weekly "tea and sandwiches" functions held by the pastor – even in weeks when the pastor himself was unable to attend – enabling handlers to identify potential trouble makers and, indeed, potential informants among the coming generation. It was through the church youth community that "Torsten" met Bärbel, who on 1 July 1966 became the first of his several<!---many?---> wives. Bärbel came to the marriage with a son from a previous relationship. She herself was part of a large and "interesting" extended family.  The couple's three children together – believed to be the first three of Wolfgang Schnur's eleven children – had been born by 1974.<ref name=WSlautMD>{{cite web|title=Nachruf Wolfgang Schnur|work="Eine tief gespaltene Persönlichkeit| url= https://www.fr.de/politik/eine-tief-gespaltene-persoenlichkeit-11255503.html|date=20 June 2016|author=Markus Decker| publisher= Frankfurter Rundschau GmbH|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref>   Schnur was a restless and frequently absent father: childcare responsibilities fell almost exclusively to Bärbel. It was also Bärbel who "led him to faith":  Wolfgang Schnur became a Christian.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

===Back to school===
In June 1967 Schnur returned to his studies for the [[Abitur|Abitur (secondary school final exam)]] in order, belatedly, to work towards a university degree. By now he had abandoned the idea of obtaining a degree in Journalism, favouring instead [[Commercial law|"Wirtschaftsrecht" (''loosely, "Economic Law"'')]] he undertook his Abitur course locally,  through the [[Folk high school|"Kreisvolkshochschule" (large secondary school)]] in [[Putbus]]. As before, his unconventional past created suspicions on the part of local party officials which resulted in difficulties in securing a study place, but behind the scenes contacts via the [[Stasi|Ministry of State Security]] in the end enabled those difficulties to be overcome. Then, in the Autumn term of 1967, he commenced his student career, studying law at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|(East) Berlin University]]. According to the relevant [[Stasi|ministry]] files he had "organised his student place himself". His plan was to focus on his studies in order to become a full-time [[Unofficial collaborator|informer]]. A few weeks after becoming a student he informed his Stasi handlers that once he had his degree his future would undoubtedly involve a posting in the west, a plan which the responsible officer felt was at best "opaque". He was also beginning to lose a little of the trust he had formerly enjoyed from his handlers, after it was discovered from routine postal intercepts that "Torsten" still (or again) had on-going contacts with Marlies Bähr in Hamburg, but had neglected to mention the fact in his reports. One of her postcards to him was also copied for the Stasi files on him.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

Despite an apparent cooling in the relationship with his Stasi handlers, "Torsten" was offered and accepted a mission to report "everything" about the youth community in [[Binzen]]. He was nevertheless encountering difficulties on obtaining law-related work because he had not been able to join [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]] and because the record of his expulsion from the [[Free German Youth|FDJ]] remained on the files. He asked the [[Stasi|ministry]] contacts for help, but it is not clear how much effort they were able or willing to exert on his behalf at this point. Nevertheless, with a family to support, he had no choice but to try and find a job at which he could work in parallel with his university law studies. Eventually, he accepted a job as a [[justiciar|justiciar (legal officer)]] with a newly created abattoir (''"VEB-Fleischkombinate"'') in [[Stralsund]].  He was appalled by the absence of effective political-ideological education taking place at the business, which is fully reflected in his reports to his handlers of the time. He seems to have become depressed and disillusioned at this time, and in around 1968, which was the year of the crushing of the [[Prague Spring]],  he ended his habit of regularly completing and submitting application forms for [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership. Much of his energy was necessarily devoted to his studies, but he was also spending more time involving himself with the [[:de:Evangelische Kirche Binzen|protestant church community]] at [[Binzen]], and providing his handlers with the relevant reports.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/>

===The lawyer===
Despite the distractions and difficulties, in 1973 Wolfgang Schnur finally received his [[Diplom-Jurist|law degree]] after what had become, by this stage, a "distance-learning" based degree course.  He now supported himself as a lawyer, based in [[Binzen]].<ref name=WSlautHME/><ref name=WSlautBS>{{cite web|url=http://www.ostsee-zeitung.de/Nachrichten/MV-aktuell/Bruder-Schnur-und-Stasi-Spitzel|date=21 January 2016|title="Bruder Schnur" und Stasi-Spitzel|work=Wolfgang Schnur ist im Alter von 71 Jahren in Wien gestorben|author=Bernhard Schmidtbauer|publisher=Verlagsgesellschaft Madsack GmbH & Co. KG (Ostsee-Zeitung), Hannover|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>   In 1978 he opened his own legal practice in [[Rostock]], along the coast on the mainland, to the west. This suggests that he was at the time well regarded by his handlers, since permission for a lawyer to set up in what amounted to a form of private practice was a "rare privilege" in the German Democratic Republic.<ref name=WSlautBS/><ref name=WSNachrufZeit>{{cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-01/ddr-oppositionspolitiker-stasi-spitzel-wolfgang-schnur|title=DDR-Anwalt Wolfgang Schnur ist tot|work=Er verteidigte Regimekritiker, nach der Wende flog er als Stasispitzel auf und versuchte sich als Geschäftsmann.

It was partly as a result of his engagement with the [[:de:Evangelische Kirche Binzen|protestant church community]] at [[Binzen]] since the 1960s that Schnur had established and sustained contacts with many former [[Construction soldier|so-called "Bausoldaten"]], people conscripted for military service who served in non-combatant units for reasons of conscience. Some of these later went on to become high-profile artistic figures whose commitment to environmental protection and human rights brought them into serious conflict with the government. As a civil rights lawyer Wolfgang Schnur's clients included the song-writers [[Stephan Krawczyk]] and [[Freya Klier]], along with civil rights activists such as [[Bärbel Bohley]] und [[Vera Wollenberger]] and many other less well remembered "dissidents" and objectors to the government's military service requirements.<ref name=WSNachrufZeit/>   He also became one of East Germany's best-known church representatives, both as a lawyer and in the public sphere more generally.<ref name=WSlautGZG>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesellschaft-zeitgeschichte.de/obere-navigation/aktuelles/anzeige-archivierte-news/article/der-fall-wolfgang-schnur-ein-unmoegliches-leben/?no_cache=1|date=4 September 2017|title=Der Fall Wolfgang Schnur – ein unmögliches Leben|publisher=Gesellschaft für Zeitgeschichte e.V. , Erfurt|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>   He was a member of the synod of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg|Evangelical Lutheran Church for]] [[Mecklenburg]], and served for at least one term as vice-president of the national [[:de:Evangelische Kirche der Union|Evangelical Church]] synod.<ref name=WSNachrufZeit/>

Alongside his intellectual horsepower, endless energy and sheer ambition, there were those who thought they noticed something else a little odd about the church's increasingly high-profile lawyer. [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church|Bishop]] [[:de:Horst Gienke|Horst Gienke]] of [[Greifswald]] described him as a "man with a devilish look" (''"... als einen Mann mit diabolischem Blick"''). His self-evident travel privileges, granted by the authorities, and his habit of driving a western car, were hard to miss. No one seems to have asked why a lawyer specialising in political dissidents could finance such a lifestyle. East Germans had learned not to ask questions.<ref name=WSlautIFL/>

===The networker===
Schnur always had a close working relationship with [[Horst Kasner]], who had worked in [[Templin|Templin (near Berlin)]] for many years as head of the [[:de:Evangelische Kirche in Berlin-Brandenburg|Evangelical Church's]] pastoral college for [[Berlin-Brandenburg]].  Kasner was a shrewd if cautious man who took his own decisions and who was seen as an important intermediary between the church nationally and the state.<ref name=HKlautPG>{{cite web|title=Der Geistliche Horst Kasner starb mit 85 Jahren|work=Bei der Vereidigung seiner Tochter als Bundeskanzlerin war er dabei, ansonsten hielt er sich aus der Öffentlichkeit zurück: Jetzt ist Horst Kasner, der Vater von Angela Merkel, im Alter 85 Jahren gestorben. |date=5 September 2011|author=Peter Gärtner|publisher=Schwäbisches Tagblatt GmbH, Tübingen|url=https://www.tagblatt.de/Nachrichten/Angela-Merkel-trauert-um-ihren-Vater-177910.html|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>   He was a member of the influential [[:de:Weißenseer Arbeitskreis|Weißensee Working Circle]] of senior churchmen and was viewed by the state authorities as one of the more progressive (i.e. pro-[[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] church leaders.

A regular interlocutor for Schnur and Kasner in the context of the church's on-going conversations with [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]] was the lawyer-churchman Clemens de Maizière (1906–1980), whose son [[Lothar de Maizière|Lothar]] later became East German prime minister.  Clemens de Maizière was both a member of the [[:de:Evangelische Kirche in Berlin-Brandenburg|Berlin-Brandenburg]] synod and a leading member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|''East'' German CDU]] ([[National Front (East Germany)|party]]).<ref name=CMlautUM>{{cite web|title=Die Familie de Maizière - eine deutsche Dynastie|date=6 March 2011|author=Uwe Müller|url=https://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article12710275/Die-Familie-de-Maiziere-eine-deutsche-Dynastie.html|publisher=WeltN24 GmbH, Berlin|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>   On the government side the principal interlocutor for all three men was the [[State Secretary for Church Affairs]].

===The political pioneer===
On 1 October 1989 Wolfgang Schnur was a co-founder of [[Democratic Awakening|"Demokratischer Aufbruch" (''loosely "Democratic Awakening"'' / DA)]], an organisation with many of the characteristics of a western-style political party.<ref name=DAlautEK>{{cite web|url=https://www.ddr89.de/da/DA.html|title=Demokratischer Aufbruch - sozial + ökologisch| work=DDR 1989/90 |publisher=Erhard Kleps, Berlin| accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>   As the professional lawyer among the group it had fallen to Schnur to draft the party constitution, taking every possible care to try and ensure that DA could not legitimately be declared illegal.<ref name=DAlautEK/>   At the founding conference, held in [[East Berlin]], he was elected "party president" – effectively the leader of the operation.<ref name=WSTagesspiegelNachruf>{{cite web|date=20 January 2016|title=Wende-Politiker Merkel-Entdecker Wolfgang Schnur ist tot|work=Der Wende-Politiker Wolfgang Schnur ist nach Informationen der "Bild"-Zeitung im Alter von 71 Jahren in einem Krankenhaus in Wien gestorben.

In December 1989, as the [[Die Wende|political changes]] gathered pace, Schnur was also an early participant at the [[:de:Runder Tisch#Zentraler Runder Tisch in der DDR 1989/1990|National Round Table meetings (''"Zentraler Runder Tisch"'')]]. Ominously, however, he withdrew from these meetings on 27 December 1989 following allegations (which he refuted) of "Corruption and abuse of office".<ref name=RunTis271289>{{cite web|title=4.

===Nemesis===
At the beginning of 1990 it was far from clear to most people that [[Die Wende|the path]] on which East Germany had embarked was a one-way street to [[German reunification|reunification]]. One person with rather fewer doubts on the matter was the [[West Germany|West German]] [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]], [[Helmut Kohl|Dr. Kohl]]. He had already held in-depth discussions on the issues involved with his friend [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as they walked together in the [[:de:Pfälzerwald|woods]] behind [[Deidesheim]] (and, no doubt, in the [[Deidesheim]] restaurant where Helmut Kohl liked to entertain his fellow statesmen to hearty meals involving [[Saumagen]]). Kohl was a supporter,<ref name=Spiegel132000>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13497766.html|title=Der Untertan, Ausgabe Ost|work=Er war so gierig auf die Macht, dass er seine Vergangenheit und die 33 Stasi-Ordner glatt vergaß. Darum fiel nach der Wende keiner tiefer als Wolfgang Schnur. Demnächst soll der ehemalige Rechtsanwalt wegen versuchten Betrugs vor Gericht. |date=27 March 2000|author=Klaus Brinkbäumer|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] (online), volume 13/2000|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref> regularly endorsing the view that Wolfgang Schnur would make an excellent East German prime minister through the run-up to some "theoretical" coming together of the two Germanys. During the campaign that preceded the [[1990 East German general election|East German General election]] scheduled for March 1990 Helmut Kohl even took time out to join his new friend on campaign visits. On Monday, 5 March 1990 Wolfgang Schnur's political ambitions met with an insurmountable setback, however, after disclosures surfaced concerning the nature, duration and extent of his activities as a [[Stasi]] [[Unofficial collaborator|informer]]. The information came from the carefully maintained and indexed files held by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] at their [[Rostock]] office. The following afternoon the Rostock regional party executive of [[Democratic Awakening|DA]] was informed of the discoveries. They immediately sent an express courier with the news to [[Magdeburg]] where Schnur was campaigning with [[Helmut Kohl]].<ref name=Spiegel132000/>   The following day, which was a Wednesday, the Rostock branch confirmed to the [[Democratic Awakening|DA]] national executive members [[Rainer Eppelmann]], [[:de:Oswald Wutzke|Oswald Wutzke]] and Fred Ebeling that there could be absolutely no doubt as to the authenticity of the "IM Torsten" files which had, during the intervening two days, been subjected to further scrutiny. That evening they confronted Schnur with the findings of the Rostock branch executive. Schnur's immediate reaction was that the files could not possibly refer to him, since he had never been an [[Stasi|MfS]] [[Unofficial collaborator|informer]]. It must be a forgery. He was thinking about taking legal action.<ref name="Kobylinski2016"/><ref name=WSlautAK/>   Schnur rejected the allegations again the next day, Thursday 8 March 1990:<ref name=WSlautHME/> then he collapsed and was taken to hospital.<ref name=WSlautAK/>   On Thursday afternoon his friend and party colleague [[Rainer Eppelmann]] read out a statement to the press defending Schnur and insisting that Schnur had never worked for the Stasi. He read out Schnur's own forthright denial.{{efn|''"Ich erkläre hiermit verbindlich, ich habe nie für die Staatssicherheit gearbeitet, ich habe nie einen Orden des Ministeriums für Staatssicherheit empfangen."''<ref name=WSenttarntlautSpiegel111990>{{cite web|title=Das war 'ne Top-Quelle|work=Schwere Vorwürfe gegen den Chef des „Demokratischen Aufbruchs“ in der DDR Wolfgang Schnur.

Sources differ over just how much evidence had been found against Wolfgang Schnur. One refers to the biographer Alexander Kobylinski, who interviewed Schnur at very great length, having also combed through 12,000 pages in 39 [[Stasi]] files.<ref name=WSlautIFL>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/staatssicherheit-leben-in-einer-welt-des-verrats.1310.de.html?dram:article_id=320206| title=Leben in einer Welt des Verrats|work=Packend wie ein Agentenroman: Alexander Kobylinski erzählt in seinem Buch „Der verratene Verräter“ von Wolfgang Schnur.

The Stasi offices in Rostock had been occupied and sealed since 5 December 1989 by a local "Citizens' Committee" determined to ensure no further destruction of Stasi files.<ref name=WSenttarntlautSpiegel111990/>  There are no clear answers on how the information about Schnur's past emerged, but there are hints. The actual discovery of Schnur's name in the Stasi records came about on account of a "clumsy misfiling" as a result of which a reference to the succession of military awards awarded to "the lawyer Wolfgang Schnur", and a couple of unexpected references to "meetings", turned up in papers being reviewed by an investigation committee working for the Citizens' Committee in Rostock on the supervision of the winding-up of the Rostock regional Stasi administrative office. During the closing months of 1989 Schnur had presumably reported back with precision and insight on his participation in the [[:de:Runder Tisch#Zentraler Runder Tisch in der DDR 1989/1990|Round Table meetings]], but his own contributions must nevertheless have been particularly upsetting for senior (and other) [[Stasi]] officers. An important responsibility for the Round Table participants involved supervision of the winding-up of the detested [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]]. As a trained lawyer and as the representative at meetings of [[Democratic Awakening|DA]], it was principally Wolfgang Schnur who complained about the inadequacy of that supervision. Even after his twenty-five years as an exceptionally well-placed and productive [[Stasi]] [[Unofficial collaborator|informer]], for his handlers and senior officers doubts persisted as to which team Wolfgang Schnur was really part of.<ref name=WSlautAK/>

Once the news broke, the first person to whom Schnur confessed his [[Stasi]] past, albeit at this stage only orally, was [[Helmut Kohl]].<ref name=WSlautAK/>   From Kohl's own autobiography it appears that he may already have been aware of the breaking news, which he received from his own sources late one evening after a day of campaigning in the East German election. Kohl immediately conferred with his party colleagues [[Eberhard Diepgen]] and [[:de:Bernd Neumann|Bernd Neumann]], who handled the (West) German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]'s relationship with [[Democratic Awakening|DA]]. The priority was clarity.  Kohl's team were keen to establish whether Schnur really had been working for the Stasi for many years, or whether he was simply the victim of a high-level [[Zersetzung|personal undermining programme]], of the kind in which the Stasi were known to specialise, launched by political opponents.<ref name="Kohl2014">{{cite book|author=Helmut Kohl|title=Sieg der Selbstbestimmung - Die ersten freien Wahlen in der DDR  |work=Vom Mauerfall zur Wiedervereinigung: Meine Erinnerungen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6RmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT141|date=26 September 2014|publisher=Droemer eBook |isbn=978-3-426-42798-9|pages=141}}</ref>    CDU Party Secretary [[Volker Rühe]] thought immediately of Stasi "dirty tricks".<ref name=WSenttarntlautSpiegel111990/>   Once, however, it had been established that the reports were true, [[:de:Bernd Neumann|Neumann]] and others in Kohl's team were keen to obtain Schnur's confession in writing as a matter of critical urgency, in order to minimise the risk that on-going doubts or some subsequent retraction might undermine the electoral prospects of the CDU's eastern ally, the [[Alliance for Germany]].<ref name=WSlautAK/>

On Friday 9 March 1990, nine days ahead of [[1990 East German general election|the elecion]], [[Helmut Kohl]] was campaigning in [[Rostock]] on behalf of his [[Alliance for Germany]] allies. It was noticed that the [[Democratic Awakening|DA]] leader was unexpectedly absent from the big man's side. It was explained that reports had been received from his party that the previous day Wolfgang Schnur had collapsed with a blood circulation complaint (''"einen Kreislaufkollaps"''). Over the previous couple of days, reports of the discoveries in the Rostock Stasi files had been filtering through to the press, along with reports of Schnur's denials.<ref name=WSenttarntlautSpiegel111990/><ref name=WSlautMKuAK>{{cite journal|title=Matthias Kluge, Alexander Kobylinski, Der verratene Verräter |journal=Jahrbuch Extremismus & Demokratie (E & D)|isbn=978-3-8452-7930-5| pages=356–359|doi=10.5771/9783845279305-356}}</ref>   On Monday 12 March the [[Democratic Awakening|DA]] leaders issued a statement to the press in which the focus was on Schur's medical condition:  it was still "very bad". Visited the previous day in hospital his face had worn a "glazed look":  he was affected by heavy medication. But he had nevertheless given a declaration concerning his personal honour with great "mental clarity".  The matter of the Rostock files and a detailed follow-up report appearing in [[Der Spiegel]] could only be cleared up by Schnur himself. Meanwhile, the East German prosecutor's office had already confirmed that a preliminary investigation against persons unknown had already been launched in respect of an alleged defamation.<ref name=12031990lautEK>{{cite web|url= https://www.ddr89.de/chronik/0390/120390.html|title= Mo. 12.

===After politics===
In October 1990 [[German reunification|the two versions of Germany were formally reunited]]. In 1991 Wolfgang Schnur set up a [[law firm]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1993, however, he lost his practicing certificate on account of his "unsuitability" (''"Unwürdigkeit"'') and for [[:de:Parteiverrat|"Mandantenverrat" (''serious breach of clients' trust'')]].<ref name=WSlautEKM-P>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirche-mv.de/Frueherer-DDR-Rechtsanwalt-Wolfgang-Schnur-tot.6418.0.html|work="Demokratischer Aufbruch"-Gründer mit 71 Jahren gestorben|title=Früherer DDR-Rechtsanwalt Wolfgang Schnur tot|date=20 January 2016|publisher=Evangelische Kirche in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>    The ban arose out of accusations (which Schnur always denied) that in his reports to his [[Stasi]] handlers he had breached his duty of professional confidentiality towards clients, especially dissidents [[Republikflucht|planning their escape from East Germany]] and those objecting to military service on grounds of conscience.  It was confirmed by the [[Federal Court of Justice|High Court]] the next year.<ref name=WSAuslassung>{{cite web|title=Bundesgerichtshof bestätigt Entscheidung Schnur verliert Zulassung |date=14 July 1994|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/bundesgerichtshof-bestaetigt-entscheidung-schnur-verliert-zulassung-17212772|publisher= [[Berliner Zeitung]]| accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>

On 15 March 1996 he was convicted at the [[Landgericht Berlin|Berlin District Court]] on two counts under §241a of the [[Strafgesetzbuch|Penal Code]].<ref name=§241a>{{cite web|url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__241a.html|title=§241a|publisher=Bundesamt für Justiz, Bonn|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref>   §241a was added to the [[West Germany|West German]] law during the early years of the [[Cold War]], in 1951 and was deemed to have applied across the reunified country even in respect of events predating [[German reunification|reunification]]. It defines as a criminal offence the action of placing someone else in danger of political persecution. Examples given of political persecution include the suffering of admonition or of damage to life or limb by violent or arbitrary measures such as deprivation of liberty or of economic disadvantage in the workplace.<ref name=§241a/>   The case against Schnur involved [[Stephan Krawczyk]] and his wife [[Freya Klier]], a dissident couple who were high-profile East German authors who had experienced difficulties with the authorities before 1990. The difficulties had culminated in the two of them being unceremoniously expelled to the west in 1988. Wolfgang Schnur had been their lawyer. He had also been, they believed, a friend of longstanding, and they had trusted his advice uncritically. In the 1997 case against Schnur was presumably launched on the basis of investigations involving the [[Stasi Records Agency|Stasi archives]]. The court determined that Schnur had breached §241a when he reported to his [[Stasi]] handlers his suspicion that [[Stephan Krawczyk]] had been in contact with western television companies. He was further convicted because the court determined that he had reported to the [[Stasi]] his suspicion that [[Freya Klier]], who is an author, had hidden in the loft of the house where she was living a manuscript that was clearly critical of conditions in the German Democratic Republic. On conviction Wolfgang was sentenced to a total of twelve months in jail, but the sentence was suspended on the condition that he should comply with the conditions of a [[Probation|probation order]] issued as part of the sentencing process. Schnur appealed the judgement, citing an intervening decision in another case to argue that §241a had not applied in the German Democratic Republic at the time of the events giving rise to the charges, but on 27 November 1996 the court rejected his appeal.<ref name=Urteil1996>{{cite web|url=http://archiv.jura.uni-saarland.de/Entscheidungen/pressem96/BGH/strafrecht/schnur.html|title=Pressemitteilung des Bundesgerichtshofs Nr. 69/96|date=27 November 1996|work=Verurteilung des früheren DDR-Rechtsanwalts Wolfgang Schnur rechtskräftig|publisher=Institut für Rechtsinformatik, Universität des Saarlandes (Juristisches Internetprojekt Saarbrücken)|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=WSlautTC>{{cite web|title=Westschokolade für den "großen Meister"|date=26 January 2016|url=https://thomas-claer.de/2016/01/26/www-justament-25-1-2016-westschokolade-fur-den-grosen-meister/|work=Zum Tod des DDR-Juristen Wolfgang Schnur.
