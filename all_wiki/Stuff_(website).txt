==History==
The former New Zealand media company [[Independent Newspapers|Independent Newspapers Ltd]] (INL), owned by News Corp Australia, launched Stuff on 27 June 2000 at a cybercafe in [[Auckland]], after announcing its intention to go online more than a year earlier.<ref name="NZ_Herald_141822">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=141822 |title=Online launch for INL 'stuff' |author=Scherer, Karyn |date=28 June 2000 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="NBR_Million">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/a-million-readers-get-stuff |title=A million readers get Stuff |date=6 August 2005 |work=[[National Business Review]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref> The development of Stuff was supported and governed by, the INL Board, Mike Robson, INL CEO, and Don Higgins, Corporate Development Manager. Mark Wierzbicki, founding Internet Business Manager, lead development and ongoing management of the Stuff site and team. Advertising agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] conceived the name "Stuff", and INL had to buy the domain name from a [[cyber squatter]].<ref name="NZ_Herald_141822"/> In its first month, the site had 120,000 unique visitors.<ref name="NBR_Million"/> At the time, Wierzbicki described the name as a copywriter's dream, although he conceded that "it's not without risk, especially if we stuff up." The start up was built by a group of engineers from a few tech companies in [[Wellington]] led by founding CTO and engineering manager Will Everitt and project manager Bill Alp and used a software platform from News Corp Australia's [[news.com.au]].

On 30 June 2003, INL sold its publishing assets including ''The Dominion Post'', ''The Press'', and the Stuff website to [[Fairfax Media]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Inl Shareholders Approve Sale To Fairfax |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0306/S00314.htm |date=30 June 2003|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] / INL press release |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fairfax snaps up NZ publisher |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-04-14/fairfax-snaps-up-nz-publisher/1836190 |date=14 April 2003  |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>
