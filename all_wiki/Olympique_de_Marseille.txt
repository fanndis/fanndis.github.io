==History==
{{See also|Olympique de Marseille seasons}}
[[File:René Dufaure de Montmirail.jpg|thumb|200px|René Dufaure de Montmirail]]

Olympique de Marseille was founded as an omnisport club in 1892 by René Dufaure de Montmirail, a French sports official. Known as Sporting Club, US Phocéenne and Football Club de Marseille in the first five years after its foundation, the club adopted the name ''Olympique de Marseille'' in 1899 in honour of the anniversary of Marseille's founding by [[Greeks]] from [[Phocaea]] some 25 centuries earlier, with the name Olympique, coming from ancient [[Olympic Games]].<ref>https://thesefootballtimes.co/2020/04/09/behind-the-badge-how-a-rugby-fan-and-his-creative-wife-devised-marseilles-famous-crest/</ref>

At first, [[rugby union]] was the most important team sport of the club, the motto ''Droit au but'' coming from rugby. Affiliated with the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques]] (USFSA) since 1898, it was only in 1902, thanks to English and [[German people]] (according to [[André Gascard]]), that football began to be played by Olympique de Marseille. Richer and better organised than other football teams of Marseille (Sporting, Stade, Phocéenne), Olympique de Marseille, then playing at the [[Stade de l'Huveaune]], took the leadership in the city. In 1904, Olympique de Marseille won the first ''Championnat du Littoral'', involving opposing teams from Marseille and its suburbs, and took part in the final rounds of the 11th [[Ligue 1|French championship]]. At that time, the word ''"football"'' applied to rugby, and people used the word ''"Association" (which would be soccer in North America)'' for football.

[[File:Olympique de Marseille - OM - 1911.jpg|thumb|The team of 1911]]

During the 1920s, Olympique de Marseille became an important team in France, winning the [[Coupe de France]] in 1924, 1926 and 1927. The team won the [[Ligue 1|French championship]] in 1929, defeating [[Club français]]. The Coupe de France in 1924 was the club's first major title, won against [[FC Sète]], a side that dominated [[Football in France|French football]] at the time. In the '20s, numerous [[France national football team|French internationals]], such as [[Jules Dewaquez]], Jean Boyer or [[Joseph Alcazar]], played for Marseille.<ref name="OM history on its official site">{{cite web|url=http://www.om.net/fr/Club/501002/Histoire_de_l_OM/25675/Historique_de_l_OM|title=History of l'OM|date=8 April 2006|accessdate=26 April 2007|work=OM official site|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515070126/http://www.om.net/fr/Club/501002/Histoire_de_l_OM/25675/Historique_de_l_OM|archive-date=15 May 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1930, Marseille lost against Sète, which would be the winner, in the semi-final round. In 1931, the team became champion of the South-East, with victories against rivals such as Sète. In the Coupe de France, l'OM lost in five matches to Club français, winning the second match that was cancelled due to the disqualification of Marseille striker Vernicke. Even though the 1931–32 season was less successful, Marseille easily entered the professional ranks, becoming a member of the union of professional clubs in 1932. On 13 January 1932 at 9:15&nbsp;pm, at the Brasserie des Sports, Mr. Dard, Mr. Bison, Dr. Rollenstein, Mr. Etchepare, Mr. Leblanc, Mr. Mille, Mr. Anfosso, Mr. Sabatier, Mr. Seze, Mr. Bazat, Mr. Molteroj and Mr. Pollack elected the following committee:
Honorary presidents: Paul Le Cesne et Fernand Bouisson
President: M. Dard
Vice-Presidents: Mr. Leblanc, Mr. Bison, Mr. Etchepare, Dr. Rollenstein et Mr. Anfosso
general secretary: Mr. Possel-Daydier
Treasurer: Mr Bison (assisted by Mr Ribel).

For the first championship, [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] was divided into two pools. Marseille finished second in the first, behind [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. For its first match of the championship, Marseille defeated the future champion, Lille. In 1937, Marseille won its first professional [[Ligue 1|French championship]] thanks to goal difference ''(+30 for Marseille, +17 for [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]])''. The arrival of Vasconcellos made the defence stronger, whereas former goalkeeper [[Laurent Di Lorto]] shone with [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]] and [[France national football team|France]]. In the meantime, Marseille won the [[Coupe de France]] in 1935 and 1938 but failed a double success in 1934, due to [[FC Sète]]. In 1938, [[Larbi Benbarek]] signed with Marseille and became ''"the black pearl"'' for the team. [[World War II]] would cut his career short. The 1942–43 season was full of records: 100 goals in 30 matches, including 20 in one match (20–2 against [[AC Arles-Avignon|Avignon]]), in which Aznar scored nine goals, including the first eight (Marseille was leading 8–0), playing only 70 minutes. Aznar scored 45 goals in 30 matches, plus 11 in cup games, for a record of 56 goals in 38 matches. With the ''minots'' (young players) of the moment (Scotti, Robin, Dard, Pironti), Marseille won the cup in two matches against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] (4–0). In 1948, thanks to a draw against [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]], Marseille became the champions of France. The two last victories at the [[Stade Vélodrome]] against Roubaix (6–0) and [[FC Metz|Metz]] (6–3) were important, as Aznar and Robin's returned in spring.

In 1952, Marseille were about to be relegated, but [[Gunnar Andersson (footballer)|Gunnar Andersson]] saved his team, finishing as top scorer with 31 goals. The team won (5–3) on aggregate against [[US Valenciennes|Valenciennes]]. The same year, Marseille lost at the [[Stade Vélodrome]] against [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] 10–3, but Liberati was injured. In 1953, Gunnar Andersson would take the record of goals scored in one season with 35. Marseille was runner-up in the [[Coupe de France]] ([[OGC Nice|Nice]] won 2–1) in 1954 and the [[Coupe Drago]] in 1957 to ([[RC Lens|Lens]] which won 3–1). Marseille were struggling at the time and were relegated for the first time in 1959. From 1959 to 1965, the team played in the second division, except during the 1962–63 season, finishing 20th out of 20 in the first division. In 1965, [[Marcel Leclerc]] became president.

===1965–1986: Leclerc era and crisis===
[[File:Jairzinho 1974.jpg|thumb|Brazilian [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] winner [[Jairzinho]] joined OM in 1974.]]
The first period of Olympique de Marseille's domination of the French League started in the early 1970s under Marcel Leclerc's presidency (1965–1972). His ambition allowed Marseille to return to the First division in 1965–66. They went on to win the ''Coupe de France'' in 1969 as well as the First division in 1971 with a record of 44 goals by [[Josip Skoblar]], helped by [[Roger Magnusson]]. The arrival of [[Georges Carnus]] and [[Bernard Bosquier]] from [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] helped them to win the Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France in 1972. Marseille played in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1971–72 and 1972–73, but were knocked-out by [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] of [[Johan Cruyff]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], respectively. However, success was not to last. Marcel Leclerc was forced to leave the club on 19 July 1972. The President was a stubborn man, and he threatened the league to withdraw his professional team from Ligue 1 because the federation refused to accept three foreign players per team (Leclerc wanted to acquire the Hungarian star [[Zoltán Varga (footballer, born 1945)|Zoltán Varga]] but he had already the maximum number of two foreigners in his team). Marseille decided, instead of following Leclerc against the league, to fire him.<ref>[[France Football]], N°2936 bis, PP 28–29 ''La nuit des longs couteaux à l'OM''</ref> Then followed an era of crisis, with Marseille only winning a Coupe de France in 1976 and being relegated to the second division, where they played with a bunch of young local players: the ''Minots'' who allowed the team to return to First division in 1984. [[Éric Di Meco]] was one of them.

===1986–1996: Tapie era, bribery scandal, and decline===
{{Main|French football bribery scandal}}
On 12 April 1986, [[Bernard Tapie]] became president, thanks to [[Marseille]] mayor [[Gaston Defferre]], and promptly built the greatest team seen France up to that point. His first signings were [[Karl-Heinz Forster]] and [[Alain Giresse]], who were bought after the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]. Tapie signed a large number of highly regarded players over the next few years in his pursuit of the European Cup, such as [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], [[Chris Waddle]], [[Klaus Allofs]], [[Enzo Francescoli]], [[Abedi Pele]], [[Didier Deschamps]], [[Basile Boli]], [[Marcel Desailly]], [[Rudi Völler]], [[Tony Cascarino]] and [[Eric Cantona]] as well as appointing high-profile coaches like [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Gérard Gili]] and [[Raymond Goethals]]. Between 1989 and 1992, Olympique de Marseille won four league titles in a row and the [[French Cup]]. The team also reached the [[1991 European Cup Final|Champions Cup final]] for the first time in 1991, losing on penalties to [[Red Star Belgrade]]. The highlight of the club's history is winning the new format [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in 1993. [[Basile Boli]] scored the only goal against Italy's [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] held in [[Munich]]'s [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]]. That triumph was the first time ever for a French club and it made [[Didier Deschamps]] and [[Fabien Barthez]] the youngest captain and goalkeeper, respectively, to capture the title.

This triumph, however, was followed by a decade of decline. In 1994, due to financial irregularities and a match-fixing scandal involving then-president [[Bernard Tapie]], they suffered enforced relegation to [[Ligue 2|the second division]], where Marseille stayed for two years before returning to the [[Ligue 1|First division]]. Moreover, they lost their 1992–93 Division 1 title and the right to play in the [[UEFA Champions League 1993-94]], the [[1993 European Super Cup]] and the [[1993 Intercontinental Cup]]. This scandal, called ''l'affaire VA-OM'' (VA for [[Valenciennes FC|Union Sportive Valenciennes-Anzin]] and OM for Olympique de Marseille), was exposed by [[Valenciennes FC|Valenciennes]], whose players [[Jacques Glassmann]],<ref name="iht2">{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/03/14/tapie.php|title=Tapie Directly Implicated As Marseille Trial Opens|work=International Herald Tribute|date=14 March 1995|accessdate=12 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061128001024/http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/03/14/tapie.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 November 2006}}</ref> [[Jorge Burruchaga]]<ref name="nyt">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D61F3DF931A35754C0A965958260|work=The New York Times|date=2 July 1993|accessdate=12 March 2007|title=Argentine Charged in Marseille case}}</ref> and [[Christophe Robert]]<ref name="nyt" /> were contacted by Marseille player [[Jean-Jacques Eydelie]]<ref name="eurosport">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/sport_sto817893.shtml|title=Wenger slams former Marseille Chairman|date=23 January 2006|accessdate=12 March 2007|work=Eurosport}}</ref> to let OM win and, more importantly, not to injure any OM player ahead of the [[UEFA Champions League]] final.

===1996–2009: Return to success===
[[File:Didier Deschamps 2011 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|right|OM won six titles with [[Didier Deschamps]] as manager between 2009 and 2011.]]
Marseille returned to the top flight in 1996 with backing from [[Adidas]]'s CEO [[Robert Louis-Dreyfus]]. He chose [[Rolland Courbis]] as coach, signed [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]], [[Laurent Blanc]], and [[Andreas Köpke]], and Marseille finished 11th for his return. For the [[1998–99 French Division 1|1998–99 season]], the team celebrated their centenary and built a team of stars: [[Robert Pires]], [[Florian Maurice]], and [[Christophe Dugarry]], culminating in a second-place finish in the [[1998–99 French Division 1|French championship]], behind [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and an appearance in the [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final in 1999]], losing to [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. Courbis left the team in November 1999 after a poor start to the season.

The closest Marseille got to another trophy was when they reached the [[2004 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final in 2004]], impressively beating [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] along the way. But they were beaten in the final by newly crowned Spanish champions [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and once again fans were forced to continue waiting for the next trophy to come along. In 2005, Marseille succeeded in winning the [[Intertoto Cup]], beating the likes of [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] in doing so, and earning another shot at the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].
[[File:Didier Drogba'14.JPG|thumb|left|[[Didier Drogba]] played for OM in the [[2003–04 Ligue 1|2003–2004 season]].]]
In January 2007, there was negotiation between Louis-Dreyfus and [[Jack Kachkar]], a Canadian doctor and businessman ''(CEO of pharmaceutical company [[Inyx]])'', about selling the club. As [[Jack Kachkar]] took too much time to buy the team, Louis-Dreyfus decided on 22 March 2007 not to sell to the Canadian businessman.<ref name="RTL">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.fr/sports/article.asp?dicid=523798|title=Kachkar, It's over now|date=29 March 2007|accessdate=26 April 2007|work=RTL|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421105808/http://www.rtl.fr/sports/article.asp?dicid=523798|archive-date=21 April 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Another close call to glory was in the [[Coupe de France]] [[2007 Coupe de France Final|final against]] [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]] in May 2007. However, they lost on penalties after a 2–2 draw after extra time, to the disappointment of everyone linked with the club, but they soon wiped all that disappointment away by qualifying for the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage after securing second place with one game to spare.

In the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], Marseille became the first [[Ligue 1|French team]] to win at [[Anfield]] when they beat [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007 runners-up]] Liverpool 1–0, and the team took six out of six points from their opening two games. They only drew one more match, and in a winner-takes-all final group game they lost 4–0 to Liverpool, who became the first [[Premier League|English team]] to win at the [[Stade Vélodrome]]. Marseille, coming third in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group A|Champions League Group A]], then joined the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup knockout stage|UEFA Cup]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7136346.stm Marseille 0–4 Liverpool] BBC Sport – 11 December 2007</ref>
Marseille finished the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season with a second-place finish in Ligue 1]], following a tight race with Bordeaux for the title.  This earned them direct entry into the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stages of the UEFA Champions League]], their third consecutive season in the competition. Marseille won the [[2010 Coupe de la Ligue Final]] beating Bordeaux 3–1 at the [[Stade de France]] in March 2010. This was their first major title since their Champions League triumph 17 years earlier. Two months later, Marseille won their first [[Ligue 1|league championship]] for 18 years with two games to spare after beating [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] 3–1.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robin|last=Bairner|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/465/france/2010/05/05/1910716/olympique-de-marseille-win-2009-10-ligue-1-title|title=Olympique de Marseille Win 2009–10 Ligue 1 Title|date=5 May 2010|publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref><ref>http://www.soccerbox.com/blog/olympique-marseille-ligue-1-history/</ref> Marseille defeated [[Paris Saint Germain F.C.|PSG]] on penalties to win the 2010 [[Trophée des Champions]] at [[Stade 7 Novembre]] in [[Rades]], [[Tunisia]], before the season began. Marseille then became the first team to win back-to-back [[Coupe de la Ligue]] successes when they won the [[2011 Coupe de la Ligue Final|2011]] edition by beating [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] 1–0 on 23 April. Before that, they qualified for the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Round of 16|last 16]] of the [[2010-11 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] for the first time since their historic success, but lost 2–1 at [[Old Trafford]] to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and also set a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] record by thrashing [[MŠK Žilina|Žilina]] 7–0 in what was the biggest away win in the competition's history. In 2011, Marseille lost the [[2010–11 Ligue 1|Ligue 1 championship title]] but qualified for the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] for the fifth time in a row, a club record. On 27 July 2011, Marseille won the [[2011 Trophée des Champions]] title by beating [[Lille OSC|Lille]] 5–4 at [[Stade de Tanger]] in Morocco. The result was significant as OM were 3–1 down with five minutes to go, only to embark on a remarkable comeback which saw 5 goals scored in the last five minutes with [[André Ayew]] scoring a hat-trick.

===2009–2014: Deschamps, Baup, Anigo===
The club struggled in the 2011–12 season, going to the bottom of the Ligue 1 table after six matches. Nevertheless, Marseille rebounded, winning 3–0 against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], as well as a 3–0 success over rivals PSG in November of that year. Marseille ended 2011 with a good sequence, also qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League for the second season running.

In February 2012, Marseille embarked on 13 games without victory,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.om.net/fr/Saison/101002/Actualites/60590|title=Le soulagement, et après?|first=Emmanuel|last=Jean|publisher=OM.net|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=6 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014544/http://www.om.net/fr/Saison/101002/Actualites/60590|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but rallied to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since [[1992-93 UEFA Champions League|winning the competition in 1993]]. Despite an indifferent club form, OM lost to eventual finalists [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], and slumped to an overall tenth-place finish in [[2011–12 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]]. However, the club retained the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] for the third year running, beating [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] 1–0 in the [[2011–12 Coupe de la Ligue|Final]].

In the summer of 2012, Deschamps resigned, and later took on the [[France national football team|France]] job. [[Elie Baup]] took over, leading the club to a surprising second-place finish in the [[2012–13 Ligue 1|2012–13 season]] despite selling multiple key players, including [[Loïc Rémy]], [[César Azpilicueta]] and [[Stéphane Mbia]]. Marseille returned to the Champions League, spending close to €40&nbsp;million on the likes of [[Dimitri Payet]], [[Florian Thauvin]] and [[Giannelli Imbula]]. The club were top of the table at the end of August 2013, but OM proceeded to lose all six games in [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|Europe]], suffering the ignominy of becoming the first French team, and the biggest European team to date, to have picked up zero points in a Champions League group stage.

Baup was sacked on 7 December 2013, following the 1–0 defeat to [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] at Stade Velodrome. He was replaced on an interim basis by [[José Anigo]]. In Anigo's brief tenure, OM went out of the two cups, and struggled, leading to continued protests and jeers by fans. The club finished sixth in the [[2013-14 Ligue 1|2014 season]], missing out on an important European competition place for the first time in ten years. Anigo left the club soon after, taking on an ambassadorial/scouting role in North Africa, his first post outside of the city for more than four decades.

===2014–2015: Bielsa era and stagnation===
[[File:Dimitri Payet - France v Armenia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dimitri Payet]] is the leader of the ''OM Champions project'' of [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]].]]
Marseille announced on 2 May 2014 an agreement with [[Marcelo Bielsa]], who took the managerial hotseat. Bielsa was the club's first Argentine coach and the first coach to lead the team into the renovated Velodrome, which opened in August with a fixture against Montpellier. In Bielsa's first season in charge, the club led the league table for seven months but finished fourth and thus qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. June 2015 saw three key players leave the club—[[André-Pierre Gignac]] and [[André Ayew]] left the club for [[Tigres UANL]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], respectively, after their contracts expired, while [[Dimitri Payet]] left to join [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] for a €15&nbsp;million transfer fee.

After a solid pre-season, which included a 2–0 win over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the [[Robert Louis-Dreyfus Trophy]] and the signature of nine players, Bielsa resigned from his post, just minutes after the first Ligue 1 game of the [[2015–16 Ligue 1|2015–16 season]] against [[SM Caen|Caen]]. Marseille lost the game 1–0, and Bielsa shocked the footballing world with his unexpected decision, citing a lack of trust with the club's management, who he said had reneged on a previously agreed contract extension. Bielsa's departure reportedly left his players in a state of shock, many of whom learnt the news via social media in the dressing room.

On 19 August 2015, [[Míchel (footballer)|Míchel]] was announced as Marseille's new coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/ligue-1/article/2015/08/19/ligue-1-l-espagnol-michel-devient-le-nouvel-entraineur-de-l-om_4730183_1616940.html|title=Michel, légende du Real Madrid, nouvel entraîneur de l’OM|first1=Remy|last1=Dupre|newspaper=Le Monde|date=19 August 2015|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> He endured a frustrating season, with OM failing to win a home game in [[Ligue 1]] for more than six months. Following a number of poor performances, Míchel was sacked in April by club owner Margarita Louis Dreyfus, citing poor conduct as the team's coach. The sacking came on the eve of the club's Coupe de France semi-final fixture. As in 2015, Passi was installed as the caretaker coach. Under his direction, Marseille reached the [[Coupe de France]] final for the first time in nine years, losing out [[2016 Coupe de France Final|4–2]] to rivals Paris Saint-Germain. OM would finish the league season in 13th, the club's worst league finish in 15 years.

In the summer of 2016, Marseille once more sold off a number of key players to meet financial obligations and to clear its wage bill ahead of an impending takeover. [[Steve Mandanda]], the club's long-serving captain ended eight years at the club and moved to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Nicolas N'Koulou]] moved to [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], while striker [[Michy Batshuayi]] was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a club record €40&nbsp;million.

===2016–present: New ownership and revival===
Marseille began the [[2016–17 Ligue 1]] season with interim manager [[Franck Passi]] at the helm. On 29 August 2016, it was announced that American businessman [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]] had agreed to buy the club from [[Margarita Louis-Dreyfus]].<ref name="The Wall Street Journal"/> The purchase deal was completed for a reported price tag of €45&nbsp;million on 17 October 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37685865|title=Marseille: Frank McCourt promises £180m investment after buying Ligue 1 club|work=BBC Sport|date=17 October 2016}}</ref> Within the next few days, McCourt appointed [[Jacques-Henri Eyraud]] as the club's president, [[Rudi Garcia]] as the manager of the club's first team and [[Andoni Zubizarreta]] as director of sport.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.om.net/actualites/277806/andoni-zubizarreta-nomme-directeur-sportif-de-lom|title=Andoni Zubizarreta nommé directeur sportif de l’OM|date=2016-10-27|newspaper=OM.net|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref>

On 3 May 2018, Marseille reached the final of the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League]] after eliminating [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in the semi-finals 3–2 on aggregate, 14 years after its last final in a European competition in [[2003–04 UEFA Cup|2004]] against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. However, they lost [[2018 UEFA Europa League Final|the final]] to [[Atlético Madrid]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=UEFA Europa League - Marseille-Atlético |publisher=UEFA |date=18 May 2018 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |url= https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2018/matches/round=2000895/match=2022218/index.html}}</ref>

In the [[2019–20 Ligue 1]] season, Marseille finished second after the season was ended early due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], thus qualifying for the [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League]] for the first time since 2013–14.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/marseille-keep-champions-league-place-despite-breaking-uefa/j8rjr1q086xb115t1om2x0qae |title=Marseille keep Champions League place despite breaking UEFA FFP rules |website=Goal.com |date=19 June 2020 }}</ref>

==Le Classique==
[[File:PSG-OM 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|PSG-OM in 2007]]
{{Main|Le Classique}}

'''Le Classique''' is a football match that is contested between [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and Olympique de Marseille. The term Classique is modelled on [[El Clásico]], contested between [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F|Real Madrid]]. Like all the game's major rivalries, the antipathy between [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] and Marseille extends outside the pitch. The French ''clásico'' has a historical, cultural and social importance that makes it more than just a football game, pitching capital against province, and the traditional wealth and high culture of Paris against the industrial and cosmopolitan traditions of Marseille. However, this rivalry appears only in the 1990s, where it is promoted by the respective owners of PSG - Canal+, the TV channel which broadcast the League 1 football matches - and Olympique de Marseile - Bernard Tapie, also owner of the sports company Adidas -, for obvious marketing reasons. It is sometimes seen as 'the favourite son' of [[Football in France|French football]] against its [[L'enfant terrible|''enfants terribles'']].<ref name="fifa.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicderby/news/newsid=1037223.html#frances+passion+play |title=France's passion play |publisher=FIFA |date=29 May 1993|accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ligue1.com/ligue1/lireArticle.asp?idArticle=14341 |title=French Football League – Ligue 1, Ligue 2, Coupe de la Ligue, Trophée des Champions |publisher=Ligue1.com |accessdate=27 April 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> With [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] being located in the north in the [[Paris|French capital]] and Marseille located along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]], the rivalry is often referred to as ''"the North versus the South."'' [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] and Marseille are the only [[Ligue 1|French clubs]] to have won [[UEFA|European trophies]], PSG having won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1996]] and Marseille won the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]], and they were the two dominant forces before the emergence of [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] at the beginning of the 21st century. However, despite their recent ups and downs, [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] and Marseille remain fierce rivals, giving this match a special atmosphere.<ref name="fifa.com"/><ref>Antonio Missiroli.

==Stadium==
{{Main|Stade Vélodrome}}
From 1904 to 1937, Marseille played at the [[Stade de l'Huveaune]]. The club were the owner of the venue, unlike their current stadium. L'Huveaune, once named "Stade Fernand Buisson" in honour of a former [[Rugby football|rugby]] player of the club who became deputee, was renovated at the beginning of the twenties, thanks to supporter's financial help. It had a capacity of {{formatnum:15000}}. After 1937, ''l'OM'' used this venue under Marcel Leclerc's presidency to compel the city of [[Marseille]] to lower the rent of [[Stade Vélodrome]] and during the renovation of [[Stade Vélodrome|Vélodrome]] for [[Euro 1984]], during the 1982/83 season. The stadium again underwent redevelopment in time for the [[1998 World Cup]] and was transformed into an immense ground composed of two [[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] ends (Virage Nord and Virage Sud – North Curve and South Curve) which house the supporters groups as well as the main stand, Jean Bouin, and the imposing Ganay stand.
In its last uplift, the municipality covered the stadium and increased its capacity to 67,000 to host the [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] games.
Before the start of each home game the song "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]" by [[Van Halen]] is heard.
When a goal is scored by Marseille in their home matches the song "[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy song)|Come with Me]]" by [[Puff Daddy]] is played.

== Kits and crest ==
{{Commons|Olympique de Marseille kits}}
Marseille's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were white shirts and shorts with blue socks until 1986. Since 1986, Marseille have played with white shirts, white shorts and white socks, and the blue color became lighter due to [[Adidas]] marketing but in 2012–2013, the club returned to its original kit, wearing blue socks.

Club founder [[:fr:René Dufaure de Montmirail|René Dufaure de Montmirail]] drew inspiration from his personal [[Seal (impression)|seal]], which featured interlaced letters ''"D"'' and ''"M"'', to create the club's first badge. The club's motto, ''"Droit au but"'', dates from the days when the club's main sport was rugby, under the name ''"Football Club de Marseille"''. The original badge featured an ornate letter ''"M"'' superimposed over an "O", with the club motto draped across the glyph. The logo persisted for three decades, until 1935, when an [[art deco]] shield was adopted, with a simple ''"M"'' encased within the ''"O"''. In 1972, OM redesigned its logo, this time preferring a complex ''"M"'' letterform. In 1986, the club re-adopted its first badge; the logo evolved slightly over the next few decades, gaining a star in 1993 to commemorate the club's [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|UEFA Champions League trophy]]. To commemorate the club's 100th anniversary in 1999, a variant featuring a golden ''"O"'' and a turquoise ''"M"'' was used; a similar 110th anniversary logo was used during the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]]. The most recent form was revealed on 17 February 2004; the ''"O"'' and ''"M"'' are rendered as a single unit in turquoise without shading or borders, and the logo is capped by the golden star representing the victory in the Champions League and sits above. The club's motto ''Droit Au But'' (French for "Straight to the Goal") also rendered in gold appears under the badge.

==Supporters==
[[File:Stade Vélodrome (Marseille).jpg|thumb|OM's supporters in 2007]]

===Virage Nord-Patrice de Peretti===
The atmosphere in the [[Stade Vélodrome]] is created by the dominance of OM's own supporters who are housed in the [[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] style ends behind the goals. The North Curve is home to the Marseille Trop Puissant, Fanatics, and Dodgers supporters associations who buy up the tickets at the start of each season and sell them on to their members. The Virage Nord is next to the away enclosure, which is protected by high fences. In 2002, the Virage Nord was officially given the name of Patrice de Peretti ''(1972–2000)'', the late founder and leader of the supporters group Marseille Trop Puissant. In 2010, the third kit of Olympique was a tribute to MTP, with the red, yellow and green colours of Africa, symbols of this left-wing curva. In 2018, new owner Frank McCourt and president Jacques-Henri Eyraud decided to exclude the Yankee Nord due to a number of delictuous activities, especially concerning tickets ; they therefore forbid them to sell the said tickets, and the association is no longer officially recognized by the club.

===Virage Sud Chevalier Roze===
As with the Virage Nord, the South Curve is controlled by supporter's associations with the Commando [[Ultras]] 1984 and the South Winners dominating the central section and Amis de l'OM and Club Central des Supporteurs filling the remaining sections of the stand.
The 2007/08 third shirt of OM was a tribute to South Winners fans whose colours are orange, as they are traditionally left wing fans.

===AEK Athens, AS Livorno and Sampdoria===
[[File:AEK fans vs PSG 2007.jpg|thumb|AEK fans ([[Original 21]]) lifting an Ultras banner]]

There is a strong relationship between [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|AS Livorno]], [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]], [[UC Sampdoria]] and Marseille. Marseille fans often lift banners and create choreography in support of the fellow teams.

==Honours==
Marseille have won the French national championship 10 times; with nine French [[Ligue 1]] titles they are second only to [[AS Saint-Étienne]]'s total of ten, and equal to [[Paris Saint-Germain]] (The first championship won by Marseille was in 1929, before the professional era of French football).<ref>{{cite web
