[[File:A session of the 10th East Asia Summit (EAS).png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A session of the 10th East Asia Summit, 2015.]]

The '''East Asia Summit''' ('''EAS''') is a regional forum held annually by leaders of, initially, 16 countries in the [[East Asia]]n, [[Southeast Asia]]n, [[South Asia]]n and [[Oceania]]n regions, based on the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus Six mechanism]]. Membership expanded to 18 countries including [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] at the [[Sixth East Asia Summit|Sixth EAS]] in 2011. Since its establishment, [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] has held the central role and leadership in the forum. EAS meetings are held after the annual ASEAN leaders' meetings, and plays an important role in the regional architecture of [[Asia-Pacific]]. The first summit was held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on 14 December 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asean2018.sg/.../9910BDFDE5CE45C598B529B8D501AA23.ashx}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About {{!}} EAS {{!}} ASEAN India |url=http://mea.gov.in/aseanindia/about-eas.htm |website=mea.gov.in |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
=== History prior to the first East Asia Summit ===
The concept of an East Asia Grouping has significant history going back to an idea first promoted in 1991 by then Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]].

The final report in 2002 of the East Asian Study Group, established by the [[ASEAN Free Trade Area#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]] countries, was based on an EAS involving ASEAN Plus Three, therefore not involving [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], or [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/viewpdf.asp?file=/pdf/easg.pdf|title=Report of the East Asian Study Group|website=aseansec.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708020825/http://www.aseansec.org/viewpdf.asp?file=%2Fpdf%2Feasg.pdf|archivedate=8 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The EAS as proposed was to be an [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]-led development, with the [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] to be linked to [[ASEAN Summit|ASEAN summit meetings]]. However, the issue was to which countries beyond those in ASEAN the EAS was to be extended.

The decision to hold the EAS was reached during the 2004 ASEAN Plus Three summit and the initial 16 members determined at the ASEAN Plus Three Ministerial Meeting held in [[Laos]] at the end of July 2005.<ref>[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/eas/outline.html Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan) – General Information on East Asia Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525061808/http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/eas/outline.html |date=25 May 2006 }} [http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed081805a.cfm First appeared in The Asian Wall Street Journal – Watching the East Asia Summit]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603004508/http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed081805a.cfm |date=3 June 2006 }}</ref>

Credit for advancing the forum during the 2004 ASEAN Plus Three summit has been attributed to [[Malaysia]].<ref name="discord">{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/east-asia-summit-more-discord-accord|title=The East Asia Summit: More Discord than Accord – YaleGlobal Online|website=yaleglobal.yale.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414122413/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/east-asia-summit-more-discord-accord|archivedate=14 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Early summits===
{{Main|First East Asia Summit|Second East Asia Summit}}
Prior to the first meeting there was significant discussion as to which countries should be represented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=76332|title= Mahathir blasts Australia over summit – Nine MSN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619183728/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=76332 |archive-date=19 June 2006 |website=ninemsn.com.au|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> At the time there were difficulties in the relationship between the "Plus Three" members (i.e. Japan, China and South Korea) of [[ASEAN Free Trade Area#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bowring.net/easiasummit.htm|title=An Asian Union?

Russia expressed early interest in EAS membership and attended the first EAS as an observer at the invitation of 2005 EAS host Malaysia.

The next EAS was to be held on 13 December 2006 in [[Metro Cebu]], Philippines.  After the confidence building of the inaugural EAS the 2006 EAS will help to define the future role of the EAS, its relationship with ASEAN Plus Three and the involvement of Russia in EAS.  However, in the face of Tropical [[2006 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Utor (Seniang)|Typhoon Utor]] the summit was postponed until January 2007.<ref>[http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=114940 ''Bangkok Post'' – "Asean summit may be reset for Jan 8–13"]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/12/13/asean.summit.shelved.effectively..html Sun Star – Asean summit shelved ‘effectively’?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101130705/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/net/2006/12/13/asean.summit.shelved.effectively..html |date=1 January 2007 }}</ref> It was rescheduled for 15 January 2007, approximately a month after the original scheduled date.

===Internal issues===
{{Main|Third East Asia Summit|Fourth East Asia Summit}}
Internal [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] issues were significant for the next Summits.  The issues of [[Myanmar]] (Burma), following the [[Saffron Revolution|2007 Burmese anti-government protests]], and [[climate change]] were expected to be discussed at the Third EAS.  Myanmar successfully blocked formal discussion of its internal affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/specialreport/news/312568_51/1/.html|title=ASEAN stands ready to help Myanmar: Singapore PM Lee – Channel News Asia|website=channelnewsasia.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref>

The summit did issue the Singapore Declaration on Climate Change, Energy and the Environment.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The Summit also agreed to the establishment of the [[Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia]] and to receive the final report on the [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]] at the [[Fourth East Asia Summit|Fourth EAS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/21127.htm|title=Chairman's Statement of the 3rd East Asia Summit Singapore, 21 November 2007 – Paragraphs 13 and 14|website=aseansec.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521115217/http://www.aseansec.org/21127.htm|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The outcomes are summarised in the [http://www.aseansec.org/21127.htm Chairman's Statement of the 3rd East Asia Summit Singapore, 21 November 2007.]

The [[Fourth East Asia Summit|Fourth EAS]] was significantly delayed and its location changed a number of times due to internal tensions in Thailand, the host nation. In the lead up to the summit there were several [[Cambodian–Thai border dispute#April 2009|border clashes]] between Thailand and Cambodia. The summit however is said to be used as an opportunity for discussions on the sidelines between the respective nation's leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/world/22368-thai-cambodian-pms-to-meet-to-defuse-tension |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412100354/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/world/22368-thai-cambodian-pms-to-meet-to-defuse-tension |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The summit was cancelled following protesters taking over the summit's venue on the day of the summit.<ref name="edition.cnn.com">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/04/12/thailand.protests/index.html|title=Thai riot police clash with protesters.com|website=CNN|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224219/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/04/12/thailand.protests/index.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was rescheduled and held on 25 October 2009. The summit adopted statements on disaster relief and the [[Nalanda University]].

===Growth of the Summit===
{{Main|Fifth East Asia Summit|Sixth East Asia Summit|Seventh East Asia Summit}}
After a period of review, the Summit grew from 16 to 18 nations by adding the United States and Russia to the Summit.  Initially represented by their Foreign Ministers at the Fifth EAS, the two new members were invited to formally join with the Sixth EAS.  Tensions between the members of the Summit continued to impede the members developing a more ambitious program.

==Energy==
At the [[Second East Asia Summit|Second EAS]] the EAS members signed the [[Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security]], a declaration on energy security and biofuels, containing a statement for members to prepare non-binding targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.12thaseansummit.org.ph/innertemplate3.asp?category=docs&docid=31|title=12thaseansummit.org.ph – 12thaseansummit Resources and Information.|website=www.12thaseansummit.org.ph|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101132138/http://www.12thaseansummit.org.ph/innertemplate3.asp?category=docs&docid=31|archivedate=1 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Trade and the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East Asia (CEPEA)==
Trade is an important focus for the summit.

As to trade and regional integration the following was noted in the Chair's report for the [[Second East Asia Summit|Second EAS]]:

<blockquote>
12. We welcomed ASEAN's efforts towards further integration and community building, and reaffirmed our resolve to work closely together in narrowing development gaps in our region. We reiterated our support for ASEAN's role as the driving force for economic integration in this region. To deepen integration, we agreed to launch a Track To study on a [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]] (CEPEA) among EAS participants. We tasked the ASEAN Secretariat to prepare a time frame for the study and to invite all our countries to nominate their respective participants in it.

We welcomed Japan's proposal for an [[Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia]] (ERIA).
</blockquote>

The reality appears however that movement towards such a relationship is a long way-off.  [[Lee Kuan Yew]] has compared the relationship between [[Southeast Asia]] and India with that of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]] and [[Turkey]], and has suggested that a free-trade area involving Southeast Asia and India is 30 to 50 years away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s1933180.htm|title=EU expansion a lesson: Lee Kuan Yew|website=www.radioaustralia.net.au|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626115809/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s1933180.htm|archivedate=26 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

As noted above the Second EAS welcomed the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).

India has launched several [[India–Myanmar barrier#Look-East connectivity|Look-East connectivity projects]] with China and [[ASEAN]] nations.

==East Asian Community==
{{Main|East Asian Community}}

After the EAS was established the issue arose of whether any future East Asia Community would arise from the EAS or ASEAN Plus Three.  Prior to the creation of the EAS it appeared that ASEAN Plus Three would take the role of community building in East Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/DH31Ae06.html|title=Asia Times|website=www.atimes.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref>

Malaysia felt that it was still the case that the role of the community building fell to ASEAN Plus Three shortly before the second EAS despite "confusion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/12/5/nation/16226090&sec=nation|title=Much confusion over East Asian community building|date=1 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501134400/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/12/5/nation/16226090&sec=nation|accessdate=7 May 2018|archive-date=1 May 2011}}</ref> China apparently agreed whereas Japan and India felt the EAS should be the focus of the East Asian Community.<ref>[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/editorial/20061215TDY04005.htm Original link dead]

After the first EAS the feasibility of EAS to have a community building role was questioned with [[Ong Keng Yong]], the secretary-general of ASEAN being quoted as describing the EAS as little more than a "brainstorming forum".<ref>[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=117796 Timor parliament to consider oil deal<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824071007/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=117796 |date=24 August 2007 }}</ref>
Nevertheless, the [http://www.aseansec.org/18579.htm Chairman’s Press Statement for the Seventh ASEAN Plus Three Foreign Ministers’ Meeting] Kuala Lumpur, 26 July 2006 said

<blockquote>
25. The Ministers welcomed the convening of the East Asia Summit as a forum for dialogue on broad strategic, political and economic issues of common interest with the aim of promoting peace, stability and economic prosperity in East Asia. In this respect, they recognized that the East Asia Summit could make a significant contribution to the achievement of the long-term goal of establishing an East Asian community.
</blockquote>

It appeared that over time following the first EAS the focus was less on whether the EAS has a role in community building to what the role and whether it was secondary to ASEAN Plus Three.  By mid-2006 the Chinese news site Xinhua Net suggested the community would arise through a two-phase process with ASEAN Plus Three as the first phase and the EAS as the second phase.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-07/29/content_4890285.htm Xinhua – English<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501124402/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-07/29/content_4890285.htm |date=1 May 2011 }}</ref> The China-India joint declaration of 21 November 2006 linked, at paragraph 43, the EAS with the East Asian Community process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=22168|title=PIB Press Release<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=pib.nic.in|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613045925/http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=22168|archivedate=13 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The concentric circle model of the community process with ASEAN at the centre, ASEAN Plus Three at the next band and the East Asia Summit at the outer band is supported by the [http://www.aseansec.org/21099.htm  Second Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation Building on the Foundations of ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation] which said:

<blockquote>

III.  Looking Forward to a Decade of Consolidation and Closer Integration (2007–2017)
<br /><br />
A. Defining the Objectives and Roles of the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation in the Emerging Regional Architecture
<br /><br />
1. We reaffirmed that the ASEAN Plus Three Process would remain as the main vehicle towards the long-term goal of building an East Asian community, with ASEAN as the driving force.
<br />
...  
<br /><br />
3. We recognised and supported the mutually reinforcing and complementary roles of the ASEAN Plus Three process and such regional fora as EAS, ARF, APEC and ASEM to promote East Asian community building.
<br /><br />
4. We reiterated that East Asian integration is an open, transparent, inclusive, and forward-looking process for mutual benefits and support internationally shared values to achieve peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in the region. Guided by the vision for durable peace and shared prosperity in East Asia and beyond, we will stand guided by new economic flows, evolving strategic interactions and the belief to continue to engage all interested countries and organisations towards the realisation of an open regional architecture capable of adapting to changes and new dynamism.
</blockquote>

On any view, community building is not a short-term project.  However, after the second EAS, the Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] was confident that the EAS would lead to an East Asia Community.<ref>http://www.dailyindia.com/show/103864.php/East-Asia-Summit-would-ultimately-lead-to-creation-of-East-Asia-community:-PM {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154815/http://www.dailyindia.com/show/103864.php/East-Asia-Summit-would-ultimately-lead-to-creation-of-East-Asia-community%3A-PM |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> China had also apparently accepted this was the case.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/16/content_5612470.htm Xinhua – English<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501124358/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/16/content_5612470.htm |date=1 May 2011 }}</ref>

If achieved the Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA) would be a tangible first step in the community building process.  The second EAS seems to have increased confidence in CEPEA but is still only a proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1074792|title=East Asia summit is an unqualified success for India – Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=16 January 2007|website=dnaindia.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930035349/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1074792|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

It has been suggested that as the EAS consists of an "anti-region" the prospects of it forming a community are less than likely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pab/Breslin_07_PAB.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128193052/http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pab/Breslin_07_PAB.pdf |archivedate=28 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Relationship with ASEAN Plus Three==
The relationship between the EAS on one hand and [[ASEAN Free Trade Area#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]] on the other is still not clear. As discussed above, some countries are more supportive of the narrower ASEAN Plus Three grouping whereas others support the broader, more inclusive EAS. ASEAN Plus Three, which has been meeting since December 1997<ref>[http://www.aseansec.org/16580.htm ASEAN secretariat – ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528001949/http://www.aseansec.org/16580.htm |date=28 May 2013 }}</ref> has a history, including the [[Chiang Mai Initiative]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/afp/113.htm|title=ASEAN secretariat – China, Japan, South Korea, ASEAN Agree on Wider Currency Swap Arrangements|website=aseansec.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521124149/http://www.aseansec.org/afp/113.htm|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> which appears to have led to the development of the [[Asian Monetary Unit]].  This may be significant for those advocating a broader role for EAS in the future.

The tension between the groupings extends to the respective members' intentions towards future Free Trade Agreements with China and South Korea focused on ASEAN Plus Three and Japan on the broader EAS members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=215499|title=Bernama – Japan Pushes For Expanded EAFTA Comprising 16 Countries|website=bernama.com.my|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103158/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_business.php?id=215499|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] had demonstrated the need for regional groupings and initiatives.  It was during this time ASEAN Plus Three had commenced and it was also during this time that the East Asian caucus was being discussed.

The EAS is just one regional grouping and some members down play its significance, the former Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] has stated that the EAS was secondary as a regional summit to [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] which has on his view a premier role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2005/s1530494.htm|title=AM – APEC leads Asian summits, PM says|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512010724/http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2005/s1530494.htm|archivedate=12 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Not all members of the EAS, notably India, are members of APEC.  However, as the EAS meetings are scheduled with the ASEAN Plus Three meetings (they both follow the annual ASEAN meetings) and all members of ASEAN Plus Three are members of EAS the ability of the two forums to remain relevant given the existence of the other remains in question.  China has stated its preference for both EAS and ASEAN Plus Three to exist side by side.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200512/14/eng20051214_228024.html People's Daily Online – East Asia Summit, a new platform for regional cooperation<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225224740/http://english.people.com.cn/200512/14/eng20051214_228024.html |date=25 February 2006 }}</ref>

=== ASEAN + 8 ===
In April and May 2010 it was discussed that the roles for Russia and the United States may be to create a new grouping "ASEAN + 8" including the East Asia Summit members together with the United States and Russia.  ASEAN + 8 may not meet as regularly as the East Asia Summit due to the logistical difficulties in the United States President committing to an annual Asian meeting.  Such a meeting could be held every two to three years to coincide with the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] meeting occurring in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/05/08/asean8-a-recipe-for-a-new-regional-architecture/|title=ASEAN+8 – A recipe for a new regional architecture|date=8 May 2010|website=eastasiaforum.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928035132/http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/05/08/asean8-a-recipe-for-a-new-regional-architecture/|archivedate=28 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
