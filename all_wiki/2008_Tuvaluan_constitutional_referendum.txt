{{Politics of Tuvalu}}

A constitutional referendum was held in [[Tuvalu]] on 30 April 2008.<ref name=TN>[http://www.tuvaluislands.com/news/archives/2008/2008-04-30.htm "Tuvaluans vote against republic"], Tuvalu News, April 30, 2008</ref> The referendum sought to [[Abolished monarchy|abolish]] the [[monarchy of Tuvalu]] and establish the country as a [[republic]]. Had the referendum passed, the new president would have been indirectly elected by the [[Parliament of Tuvalu]].

The referendum failed, with 679 votes in favour of establishing a republic and 1,260 votes to retain the monarchy.<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200806/s2276618.htm?tab=latest "Tuvalu votes to maintain monarchy"], Radio Australia, 17 June 2008</ref> As a consequence, Tuvalu remained a monarchy, and [[Elizabeth II]] remained Head of State. Turnout for the referendum was low. Only 1,939 voters cast valid ballots, out of the approximately 9,000 voting-aged Tuvaluans. In comparison, 8,501 votes were cast in the 2006 parliamentary election.<ref name=TN/> A [[1986 Tuvaluan constitutional referendum|previous referendum]] on becoming a republic in 1986 was also rejected.
