'''Rio de Janeiro''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʁi.u dʒi ʒɐˈnejɾu|Rio de Janeiro.ogg}}<ref>In the variety of [[Brazilian Portuguese]] spoken in Rio de Janeiro, according to ''Larousse Concise Dictionary: Portuguese-English'', 2008, p. 339 (in which the pronunciations "refletem a língua falada no Rio de Janeiro").

It has the second largest economy of Brazil, with the largest being that of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].<ref>http://www.faemg.org.br/Noticia.aspx?Code=4774&ContentVersion=C</ref> The state, which has 8.2% of the Brazilian population, is responsible for 9.2% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].<ref>[https://noticias.r7.com/prisma/o-que-e-que-eu-faco-sophia/descubra-quais-sao-os-15-estados-mais-ricos-do-brasil-15122019 Descubra quais são os 15 Estados mais ricos do Brasil]</ref><ref>[https://www.terra.com.br/economia/infograficos/pib-estados/ ‘The Economist’ compara economia de Estados do Brasil com países]</ref><ref>[https://www.ibge.gov.br/cidades-e-estados Dados dos estados e cidades do Brasil]</ref><ref>[https://www.ibge.gov.br/apps/populacao/projecao/ População dos estados do Brasil]</ref>

The state of Rio de Janeiro is located within the Brazilian geopolitical region classified as the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] (assigned by [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]). Rio de Janeiro shares borders with all the other states in the same Southeast macroregion: [[Minas Gerais]] ([[North|N]] and [[Ordinal directions|NW]]), [[Espírito Santo]] ([[Ordinal direction|NE]]) and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] ([[Ordinal directions|SW]]). It is bounded on the east and south by the [[South Atlantic Ocean]]. Rio de Janeiro has an area of {{cvt|43653|km²}}. Its capital is the city of [[Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]], which was the capital of the Portuguese [[Colonial Brazil|Colony of Brazil]] from 1763 to 1815, of the following [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] from 1815 to 1822, and of later independent Brazil as a [[Realm|kingdom]] and [[republic]] from 1822 to 1960.

The state's 22 largest cities are [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]], [[Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro|Duque de Caxias]], [[Nova Iguaçu]], [[Niterói]], [[Campos dos Goytacazes]], [[Belford Roxo]], [[São João de Meriti]], [[Petrópolis]], [[Volta Redonda]], [[Magé]], [[Macaé]], [[Itaboraí]], [[Cabo Frio]], [[Armação dos Búzios]], [[Angra dos Reis]], [[Nova Friburgo]], [[Barra Mansa]], [[Barra do Piraí]], [[Teresópolis]], [[Mesquita, Rio de Janeiro|Mesquita]] and [[Nilópolis]].

Rio de Janeiro is the smallest state in the Southeast macroregion and one of the smallest in Brazil. It is, however, the [[List of Brazilian states by population|third most populous Brazilian state]], with a population of 16 million of people in 2011 (making it the [[List of Brazilian states by population density|most densely populated state in Brazil]]) and has the third longest coastline in the country (after those of the states of [[Bahia]] and [[Maranhão]]).

In the [[Flag of Brazil|Brazilian flag]], the state is represented by [[Beta Crucis|Mimosa]], the beta star in the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] (β Cru).

==Demonym{{anchor|Gentilic}}==
The original demonym for the State of Rio de Janeiro is "fluminense", from [[Latin]] ''flumen, fluminis'', meaning "river". While "carioca" (from [[Old Tupi]]) is an older term, first attested in 1502, "fluminense" was sanctioned in 1783, a few years after the city had become the capital of the Brazilian colonies, as the official demonym of the Royal Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro and subsequently of the Province of Rio de Janeiro. From 1783 through the [[Empire of Brazil|Imperial Regime]], "carioca" remained an unofficial term which other Brazilians used for the inhabitants of the city as well as the province. During the first years of the Brazilian Republic, "carioca" came to be the name given to those who lived in the city's slums or a pejorative used to refer to the bureaucratic elite of the Federal District. Only when the city lost its status as Federal District (to [[Brasília]]) and became the State of [[Guanabara State|Guanabara]] in 1960 did "carioca" become an official demonym along with "guanabarino". In 1975, Guanabara State was incorporated into Rio de Janeiro State, becoming the present City of Rio de Janeiro. "Carioca" became the demonym of the city, while ''fluminense'' continues to be used for the state as a whole.

Although "carioca" officially refers only to the city, the term is commonly used to refer to the entire state. Contemporary social movements like "Somos Todos Cariocas" ("We are all Cariocas") have tried to achieve the official recognition of "carioca" as a co-official demonym of the state.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Hereditary captainships===
European presence in Rio de Janeiro is as old as Brazil itself, dating back to 1502.  Rio de Janeiro originated from parts of the captainships of de Tomé and São Vicente. Between 1555 and 1567, the territory was occupied by the French, who intended to install a colony, [[France Antarctique]]. Aiming to prevent the occupation of the Frenchmen, in March 1565, the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was established by [[Estácio de Sá]].

In the 17th century, cattle raising and sugar cane cultivation stimulated the city's progress, which was definitively assured when the port started to export gold extracted from [[Minas Gerais]] in the 18th century. In 1763, Rio de Janeiro became the capital of Colonial Brazil. With the flight of the Portuguese royal family from Portugal to Brazil in 1808, the region soon benefited from urban reforms to house the Portuguese. Chief among the promoted changes were: the transformation of agencies of public administration and justice, the creation of new churches, and hospitals, the foundation of the first bank of the country - the [[Banco do Brasil]] - and the Royal Press, with the Gazette do Rio of Janeiro. The following years witnessed the creation of the Jardim Botânico (Botanical Garden) and the Academia Real Militar.

There followed a process of cultural enhancement influenced not only by the arrival of the Royal Family, but also by the presence of European graphic artists who were hired to record the society and Brazilian natural features. During this same time, the Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (The Royal School of Sciences, Arts, and Works) was founded as well.

In 1834, the city of Rio de Janeiro was transformed into a [[Neutral municipality|"neutral city"]], remaining as capital of the state, while the captainships became provinces, with headquarters in [[Niterói]], a neighboring city. In 1889, the city became the capital of the Republic, the neutral city became the federal district and the province a state.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1894, [[Petrópolis]] became the capital of Rio de Janeiro, until 1902 when Niterói recovered its capital status.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/1360/ |title = Emperor Street |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1860–1870 |accessdate = 2013-08-24 }}</ref> With the relocation of the federal capital to Brasília in 1960, the city of Rio de Janeiro became [[Guanabara State]]. Niterói remained the state capital for Rio de Janeiro state, while Rio de Janeiro served the same status for Guanabara.

===The new state of Rio de Janeiro===
In 1975, the states of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro were merged under the name of Rio de Janeiro, with the city of Rio de Janeiro as state capital. The symbols of the former State of Rio de Janeiro were preserved, while the symbols of Guanabara were kept by the city of Rio de Janeiro.


==Geography==
[[Image:Amanhecer no Hercules --.jpg|thumb|[[Serra dos Órgãos National Park]]]]
[[File:Vale dos Frades.jpg|thumb|Vale dos Frades (Frades Valley)]]
The state is part of the [[Mata Atlântica]] [[biome]] and is made up of two distinct [[geomorphology|morphological]] areas: a coastal [[plain]], known as ''baixada'', and a [[plateau]], which are disposed in parallel fashion from the shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean inland towards [[Minas Gerais]].

The coastline extends 635 kilometers and is formed by the bays of [[Guanabara Bay|Guanabara]], [[Sepetiba]], and [[Ilha Grande]].
There are prominent [[slope]]s near the ocean, featuring also diverse environments, such as [[Atlantic Coast restingas|restinga vegetation]], [[bay]]s, [[lagoon]]s and [[tropical forest]]s.

Most of the state however consists of highlands, often higher than 1000 m, formed by several mountain chains like the [[Serra do Mar]] which separates Rio from the [[state of São Paulo]]. The highest point of the state, the [[Pico das Agulhas Negras]] (Black Needles Peak) is located in the [[Serra da Mantiqueira]] which forms the physical border with neighbouring [[Minas Gerais]].

Its principal rivers are the Guandu, the Piraí, the [[Paraíba do Sul River|Paraíba do Sul]], the Macaé and the Muriaé.

===Vegetation and animal life===

Tropical forests used to cover more than 90% of the territory of Rio; large portions were devastated for urbanization and for plantations ([[coffee]], [[sugar cane]]); preserved areas can be found in the steepest parts of the mountain chains.

The state's tropical coast and river areas are the only remaining habitat of the [[golden lion tamarin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.czs.org/CZS/Brookfield/Exhibit-and-Animal-Guide/Tropic-World/Golden-Lion-Tamarin |title=Chicago Zoological Society - Golden Lion Tamarin |accessdate=2012-04-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507032015/http://www.czs.org/CZS/Brookfield/Exhibit-and-Animal-Guide/Tropic-World/Golden-Lion-Tamarin |archivedate=May 7, 2008 }}</ref>

===Climate===
[[Image:Prainha_Arraial_do_Cabo.jpg|thumb|[[Arraial do Cabo]]]]
[[File:Rio de Janeiro Köppen.svg|left|thumb|Climate types of Rio de Janeiro.]]
The entire state is located within the [[tropical zone|tropics]] (the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] passes just a few kilometers south of the state's southernmost point) so a tropical climate is predominant. However, due to altitude, temperatures can drop to freezing point or below in some parts. Frost is not uncommon in some mountainous cities such as Teresópolis, Nova Friburgo and Petrópolis and snow has been reported occasionally in the Itatiaia National Park.

Annual mean temperatures on the coast are around {{convert|23|C}}, {{convert|26|C}} in summer and {{convert|20|C}} in winter. In the mountains annual mean temperatures are around {{convert|18|C}} but can range from {{convert|20|C}} at an elevation of {{convert|600|to|700|m}} above sea level to {{convert|7|C}} in the Itatiaia National Park. Summers in these areas tend to be warm but not hot, with averages around {{convert|22|C}}. Winters are quite chilly by Brazilian standards with lows around {{convert|8|to|9|C}}

Rains tend to be concentrated in the summer (December to March) with a dry season in the winter (June to September). Most of the state receives between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm}} of rainfall in a year.

According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] of 2008, there were 15,772,000 people residing in the state. The population density was {{convert|352.58|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}.

[[Urbanization]]: 96.9% (2004); [[Population growth]]: 1.3% (1991–2000).

The last PNAD (National Household Survey) census revealed the following numbers: 8,509,000 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (54.2%), 5,302,000 [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (33.8%), 1,809,000 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (11.5%), 25,000 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (0.2%), 19,000 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.1%).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=pnad&o=3&i=P&c=262 |title=Sistema IBGE de Recuperação Automática - SIDRA |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|year=2008|language=Portuguese |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

People of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39,74% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46,30% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20,36% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30,84%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51,20% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267664 people in 1890.<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=QPDe42CBSeMC |page=107 }} |title=Os lusíadas na aventura do Rio moderno |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

Other [[European ethnic groups]], such as [[Swiss Brazilian|Swiss]], [[Finnish Brazilian|Finnish]] and [[German Brazilian|Germans]] settled mostly in the mountainous areas ([[Nova Friburgo]], [[Petrópolis]], etc.) and in the capital. [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]] and [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spaniards]] are also present in the capital as well as in the surrounding cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/colonia_suica.html |title=A Colônia Suíça de Nova Friburgo |publisher=Multirio.rj.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>http://www.luteranos.com.br/202/160_anos/colonizacao.html</ref>

People of [[Afro-Brazilian|African]] descent are numerous, particularly in the metropolitan area of the capital city. Those of [[Mixed-race Brazilian|mixed-race]] ancestry (tri-racials, ''[[mulatto|mulatos]]'', and some ''[[caboclo]]s'' and ''[[Zambo|cafuzos]]'') make up the majority of the population in many cities. The city of [[Itaguaí]] was considered a [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] colony in the 20th century, but many of the Asian Cariocas that once lived there moved overseas (most of them to [[Brazilians in Japan|Japan]]) as well to other Brazilian states like [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].

==Culture==

===Carnival===
The occasion of the last five days leading up to Lent is annually cause for a great explosion of joy in Rio – a round-the-clock party uniting emotions, creativity, plasticity, colours, sounds and much fantasy. It is the greatest popular party in the world, a unique record of the rich cultural melting pot typical of Brazil. [[Image:Desfile Portela 2014 (906185).jpg|thumb|left|[[Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], famous for its production.]] In Rio, it is celebrated in various ways, most famously through the elaborate competition of [[samba school]]s comprising thousands of dancers in each school, each of which has composed a new "enredo de samba" (samba script) for the year that is released and popularized by the time Carnaval arrives, thus already recognizable for its lyrics, themes, and rhythms by the energized audience in the bleachers thronging to see the all-night competition of one samba school after another until dawn. Each samba school consists of 'alas' (wings) of samba dancers costumed to carry out one aspect of the theme of the song they all sing.  This event began in the 1930s as a diversion for what politicians sought to assuage as an otherwise restive populace. It came to be held on the bleacher-lined Marques du Sapucai for decades until a covered [[Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí|sambadrome]] was built in the 1980s.

In other parts of the city, Carnaval festivities include the Banda de Ipanema, a street parade of transvestite costuming that draws its throngs of revelers to the streets of Ipanema.  In the city center on the final night of Carnaval, into the wee hours of Quarta Cinza (Ash Wednesday), a very different flavor of street parade is provided by Quilombo (the word given to slave refugee colonies) with authentic African costuming.  For others, Carnaval is a time of clubbing in costume in more exclusive locales in the Zona Sul.

The film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'' is set in the context of Carnaval in Rio.

===New Year's Eve===
[[File:Rio New Year Fireworks.jpg|thumb|right|Fireworks over [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], Rio de Janeiro City.]]
In [[Rio de Janeiro]], a globally unique New Year's Eve celebration involves the whole city population. Local inhabitants and visitors join in flocking to the ocean to celebrate the night of the year when thanks are given and wishes are made to the goddess of the sea, [[Iemanja]].  In honor of her traditional garb, celebrants dress in white and bear gifts like flowers, especially white, and even [[blancmange]].  At midnight, beachgoers on the typically hot midsummer night, walk into the surf and cast their flowers (and wishes for the coming year) on the lapping waves to be carried out to honor the goddess (the tradition says that wishes will turn to reality if the waves take the gifts to the sea, and won't if the gifts come back to the beach). Nearby parties, concerts and music last into the dawn, many choosing to sleep it off on the beach on New Year's Day.  In recent years, campfires and the oral tradition of shared stories around statues of Iemanja has modernized into massive fireworks displays and to a mega-concert on the famous beach of [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]].

==Infrastructure==

===International airport===

Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from [[Santos Dumont Airport]], to [[Rio de Janeiro-Galeão International Airport]], Rio de Janeiro has second international airport of Brazil.

Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Galeão has connections to 18 other countries. It can handle up to 15 million passengers a year in two passenger terminals.

There are special shuttle buses linking Galeão to Santos Dumont, and bus and taxi service to the rest of the city.
