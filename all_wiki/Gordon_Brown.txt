'''James Gordon Brown''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|HFRSE}} (born 20 February 1951) is a British politician who was [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from [[2007 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|2007]] to [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|2010]]. He served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]] to [[2007 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|2007]]. Brown was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] to [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], first for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] and later for [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]].

A [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral graduate]], Brown read [[history]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he was elected [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh]] in 1972. He spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a [[further education]] college and a television journalist. He entered the [[British House of Commons]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] as the MP for Dunfermline East. He joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] in 1989 as [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Shadow Secretary of State for Trade]], and was later promoted to become [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1992. After Labour's victory in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history.

Brown's tenure as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting powers to the [[Bank of England]], by a wide extension of the powers of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to cover much domestic policy and by transferring responsibility for banking supervision to the [[Financial Services Authority]]. Brown presided over the longest period of sustained economic growth in British history,<ref>[http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/Our_Society_Today/News_Articles_2005/economy.aspx?ComponentId=8723&SourcePageId=11412 "Budgeting for stable economic growth"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528071333/http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/Our_Society_Today/News_Articles_2005/economy.aspx?ComponentId=8723&SourcePageId=11412 |date=28 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/publicfinances/story/0,,1439789,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=His record – 304 years and counting | first=Julian | last=Glover | date=17 March 2005 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | archive-date=22 September 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922223719/http://society.guardian.co.uk/publicfinances/story/0,,1439789,00.html | url-status=live }}</ref> but this became increasingly dependent on mounting debt, and part of this growth period started under the preceding [[Second Major ministry|Conservative government]] in 1993.

Brown's government introduced rescue packages in [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|2008]] and [[2009 United Kingdom bank rescue package|2009]] to help keep the banks afloat during the [[global financial crisis of 2008|global financial crisis]], and as a result the [[United Kingdom national debt|United Kingdom's national debt]] increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in [[Northern Rock]] and [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], both of which experienced financial difficulties, and injected large amounts of money into several other banks, including [[Lloyds Banking Group]], which formed through the [[Lloyds Banking Group's acquisition of HBOS|acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB in 2009]]. In 2008, Brown's government passed the world's first [[Climate Change Act 2008|Climate Change Act]]. Despite initial rises in opinion polls after Brown became Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined with the onset of a [[Great Recession|recession in 2008]], leading to poor results in the [[2009 United Kingdom local elections|local]] and [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European elections in 2009]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 July 2007 |title=New British PM gives party biggest poll lead in two years |url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/6018/gma-vows-hunt-down-killers-marines-pursue-peace-talks-rebels |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317011420/http://www.philstar.com/nation/6018/gma-vows-hunt-down-killers-marines-pursue-peace-talks-rebels |archive-date=17 March 2014 |access-date=19 July 2009 |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]]}}</ref><ref name="timesonline1">{{Cite news |last1=Sherman |first1=Jill |last2=Yeoman |first2=Fran |last3=Hamilton |first3=Fiona |date=6 June 2009 |title=Labour suffers wipeout in its worst local election results |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6440935.ece |access-date=21 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="labour">{{Cite news |date=8 June 2009 |title=Labour slumps to historic defeat |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8088133.stm |url-status=live |access-date=14 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610210245/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8088133.stm |archive-date=10 June 2009}}</ref> In the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Labour lost 91 seats, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Maddox |first=David |date=7 May 2010 |title=General Election 2010: Gordon's career is finished&nbsp;– Labour MP |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/general-election-2010-gordon-s-career-is-finished-labour-mp-1-803131 |url-status=live |access-date=3 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021184357/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/general-election-2010-gordon-s-career-is-finished-labour-mp-1-803131 |archive-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> resulting in a [[hung parliament]] in which the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were the largest party.

He was accepted by the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study history at the same early age of 16.

In his youth at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was involved in a romantic relationship with [[Princess Margareta of Romania|Margarita, Crown Princess of Romania]]. Margarita said about it: "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing." An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: "She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife.

==Election to Parliament and opposition==
Brown was elected to Parliament as a Labour MP at his second attempt, for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]]. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency, [[Tony Blair]]. Brown became an [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the [[Independent Labour Party]] politician [[James Maxton]], the subject of his doctoral thesis. Brown was [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992.<ref name=bbb/><ref name=GBStory/> Having led the ''Labour Movement Yes'' campaign, refusing to join the cross-party ''Yes for Scotland'' campaign, during the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum]], while other senior Labour politicians – including [[Robin Cook]], [[Tam Dalyell]] and [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] – campaigned for a ''No'' vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]], signing the [[Claim of Right 1989|Claim of Right for Scotland]] in 1989.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wright |first=Kenyon |author-link=Canon Kenyon Wright |date=4 April 1999 |title=Scotland can sing a new song to a different tune and in a clear voice |work=[[The Sunday Herald]] |publisher=[[HighBeam Research]] |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18985240.html |url-status=dead |access-date=1 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327044716/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18985240.html |archive-date=27 March 2014 |quote=...the Claim of Right of Scotland.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer (1997–2007)==
{{Main|Chancellorship of Gordon Brown}}
In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Labour defeated the Conservatives by a landslide to end their 18-year exile from government, and when [[Tony Blair]], the new Prime Minister, announced his [[First Blair ministry|ministerial team]] on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Brown would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history.<ref name=ddd/> The Prime Minister's website highlights some achievements from Brown's decade as Chancellor: making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the [[G8]] summit in 2005.<ref name=bbb/>

===Early economic reforms===
On taking office as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] Brown gave the [[Bank of England]] operational independence in [[monetary policy]], and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)|Monetary Policy Committee]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schifferes |first=Steve |date=6 June 2002 |title=Five years on: Rating the MPC |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2002471.stm |url-status=live |access-date=21 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213024319/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2002471.stm |archive-date=13 February 2007}}</ref> At the same time, he also changed the [[inflation rate|inflation measure]] from the [[Retail Price Index]] to the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the [[Financial Services Authority]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 May 1997 |title=Chancellor announces new framework for monetary policy |url=http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/press/1997/p40_97.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720163816/http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/press/1997/p40_97.html |archive-date=20 July 2011 |access-date=27 February 2009 |publisher=HM Treasury}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |year=1997 |title=Memorandum of Understanding between HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archive-date=3 December 2010 |access-date=14 October 2012 |website=HM Treasury, Bank of England, FSA}}</ref> Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hosking |first=Patrick |date=2 June 2009 |title=Gordon Brown and Treasury accused on banking crisis |work=The Times |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6410087.ece |url-status=live |access-date=19 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611225442/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6410087.ece |archive-date=11 June 2011}}</ref>

===Taxation and spending===
In the 1997 election and subsequently, Brown pledged not to increase the basic or higher rates of [[income tax]]. Over his Chancellorship, he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%. However, in all but his final budget, Brown increased the tax thresholds inline with inflation, rather than earnings, resulting in [[fiscal drag]]. [[Corporation tax]] fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for [[small business]]es.<ref name="AdamBrowne">Adam, S. and J.

According to the [[OECD]] UK taxation increased from a 39.3% share of gross domestic product in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than that of Germany.<ref>OECD: [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/51/2483816.xls General Government Outlays as percentage of GDP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163319/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/51/2483816.xls |date=8 December 2015 }} ([[Microsoft Office Excel]] table)</ref> This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing "[[stealth tax]]es". A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way [[corporation tax]] is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the [[dividend]]s on [[stock]] investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Halligan |first=Liam |author-link=Liam Halligan |date=16 October 2006 |title=Brown's raid on pensions costs Britain £100&nbsp;billion |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531448/Brown%27s-raid-on-pensions-costs-Britain-andpound100-billion.html |url-status=live |access-date=1 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830070813/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531448/Brown%27s-raid-on-pensions-costs-Britain-andpound100-billion.html |archive-date=30 August 2008}}</ref> The Treasury contends that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth.

Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and [[global change]]. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a [[Fabian Society]] conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Make education our national mission |date=15 January 2007 |publisher=[[Fabian Society]] |url=http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/events/event-reports/brown-make-education-our-national-mission |access-date=21 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722190808/http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/events/event-reports/brown-make-education-our-national-mission |archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>

Until his resignation from the post in May 2010 he was [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. He was Member of Parliament for the constituency of [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]] until he stepped down in 2015.

Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight into the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form "citizens' juries", easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the [[Cash for Honours|loans for peerages]] scandal.<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 July 2007 |title=Gordon Brown's big idea |work=[[The Economist]] |url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9441642 |url-status=live |access-date=15 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022105918/http://www.economist.com/node/9441642?story_id=9441642 |archive-date=22 October 2012}}</ref>

There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a [[snap election|snap general election]]. Indeed, the party launched the [[Not Flash, Just Gordon]] advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October<ref>{{Cite news |last=McBride |first=Damian |date=5 October 2012 |title=Gordon Brown and the 2007 election: why it never happened |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown/9589561/Gordon-Brown-and-the-2007-election-why-it-never-happened.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021824/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown/9589561/Gordon-Brown-and-the-2007-election-why-it-never-happened.html |archive-date=6 October 2012}}</ref> that there would be no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by [[David Cameron]]) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in [[Crewe]] and [[Glasgow]] did himself and the government no favours either.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Landale |first=James |date=11 May 2010 |title=Gordon Brown's political career |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8673608.stm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513074445/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8673608.stm |archive-date=13 May 2010}}</ref>

Brown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner. However, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim.

===Domestic policy===
[[File:Gordon Brown Davos 2008 crop (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Brown at the [[World Economic Forum]] meeting in Davos in 2008]]
During his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives, which he called the ''manifesto for change''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hipwell |first=Deirdre |date=13 May 2007 |title=Gordon's manifesto for change |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1782142.ece |access-date=15 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=13 May 2007 |title=Poll surge as Brown unveils policy blitz |work=The Observer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/13/uk.labourleadership |url-status=live |access-date=2 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203150026/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/may/13/uk.labourleadership |archive-date=3 February 2009}}</ref>

The manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new [[Ministerial Code]], which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers.<ref>{{Cite news |date=3 July 2007 |title=Brown sets out reform proposals |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6258794.stm |url-status=live |access-date=3 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726222650/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6258794.stm |archive-date=26 July 2008}}</ref> He also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wants a "better constitution" that is "clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today". He planned to set up an all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between [[Whitehall]] and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops were sent into action in future.

He said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal to build new [[eco-towns]], each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 home-owners – up to 100,000 new homes in total.
Brown also said he wanted to have doctors' surgeries open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], which awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Brown also stated in the manifesto that the NHS was his top priority.

On 5 June 2007, just three weeks before he was due to take the post of Prime Minister, Brown made a speech promising "British Jobs for British workers".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jones, Toby Helm and Graeme Wilson |first=George |date=6 June 2007 |title=British workers for British jobs says Brown |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553710/British-workers-for-British-jobs-says-Brown.html |url-status=live |access-date=25 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202121416/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553710/British-workers-for-British-jobs-says-Brown.html |archive-date=2 February 2009}}</ref> Brown reiterated that promise at the Labour Party's annual conference in September, which caused controversy as he coupled this with a commitment to crack down on migrant workers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Russell |first=Ben |date=10 September 2007 |title='Jobs for every Briton,' says Brown in crackdown on migrant workers |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jobs-for-every-briton-says-brown-in-crackdown-on-migrant-workers-401873.html |url-access=subscription |access-date=25 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222420/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jobs-for-every-briton-says-brown-in-crackdown-on-migrant-workers-401873.html |archive-date=16 April 2009}}</ref><ref name="BBCJobs">{{Cite news |last=Parkinson |first=Justin |date=16 November 2007 |title=What does 'British jobs' pledge mean? |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7097837.stm |url-status=live |access-date=25 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002023829/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7097837.stm |archive-date=2 October 2013}}</ref> The Conservative Party, led by [[David Cameron]], promptly pointed out that such a commitment was illegal under EU law.<ref name=BBCJobs/>

He has often said "War is tragic", echoing Blair's quote, "War is horrible".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dougary, Ginny |author-link=Ginny Dougary |date=10 April 2010 |title=What Gordon Brown is really thinking |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7088875.ece |access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref> Nonetheless, in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the [[Military Covenant]], a convention within British politics ensuring adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government.<ref>{{Cite news |date=11 November 2007 |title=Renew the Military Covenant |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-renew-the-military-covenant--in-full-399856.html |url-status=live |access-date=11 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206110745/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-renew-the-military-covenant--in-full-399856.html |archive-date=6 December 2008}}</ref>

Brown did not attend the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] on 8 August 2008 in Beijing; instead, he attended the closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to send a message to China, concerning the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]]. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.<ref>{{Cite news |date=10 April 2008 |title=PM not attending Olympics opening |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7339580.stm |url-status=live |access-date=19 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417112037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7339580.stm |archive-date=17 April 2008}}</ref>

I will continue to work, as [[Tony Blair]] did, very closely with the American administration."

Brown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the [[EU Reform Treaty]]. Brown's opponents on both sides of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original [[EU Constitution]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Elliott |first=Francis |date=23 October 2007 |title=Gordon Brown attacked on all sides for 'running away' from referendum |work=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2718086.ece |url-status=live |access-date=23 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007162634/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2718086.ece |archive-date=7 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2 October 2007 |title=Cameron attacks Brown on EU vote |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7023458.stm |url-status=live |access-date=15 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021083951/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7023458.stm |archive-date=21 October 2007}}</ref> Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum.

===Global recession===
Brown's premiership coincided with the [[Great Recession|global recession]], during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. Domestically, Brown's administration introduced measures including a [[2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package|bank rescue package]] worth around £500&nbsp;billion (approximately $850&nbsp;billion), a temporary 2.5 percentage point cut in [[value-added tax]]<ref>{{Cite news |date=1 December 2008 |title=Lower VAT rate comes into force |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7757854.stm |url-status=live |access-date=12 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419185951/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7757854.stm |archive-date=19 April 2012}}</ref> and a "car scrappage" scheme.<ref>{{Cite news |date=28 September 2009 |title=Scrappage scheme to be extended |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8278679.stm |url-status=live |access-date=12 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116001953/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8278679.stm |archive-date=16 November 2012}}</ref>

===Challenges to leadership===
In mid-2008, Brown's leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign.  This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from [[Local Government Act 1972|(pre-1974) Lancashire]] urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership.  Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest.  However, certain prominent MPs, such as [[Jacqui Smith]] and [[Bill Rammell]], suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Nigel |date=29 July 2008 |title=Cabinet backs Brown but 'Lancashire plot' sparks open warfare |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cabinet-backs-brown-but-lancashire-plot-sparks-open-warfare-879414.html |url-status=live |access-date=29 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206111340/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cabinet-backs-brown-but-lancashire-plot-sparks-open-warfare-879414.html |archive-date=6 December 2008}}</ref>  In the autumn, [[Siobhain McDonagh]], an MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government,<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 September 2008 |title=Profile: Siobhain McDonagh |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7613296.stm |url-status=live |access-date=14 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915050755/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7613296.stm |archive-date=15 September 2008}}</ref> spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position.

On 4 June 2009 [[James Purnell]] resigned from the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]], and called for Brown's resignation as Prime Minister.

On 6 January 2010, [[Patricia Hewitt]] and Geoff Hoon jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Brown's leadership.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kettle |first=Martin |date=6 January 2010 |title=Hewitt and Hoon's great gamble |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/06/hoon-hewitt-gordon-brown-labour |url-status=live |access-date=3 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108090357/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/06/hoon-hewitt-gordon-brown-labour |archive-date=8 January 2010}}</ref>  The call received little support, and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was "over".

These results were Labour's worst since World War II.

===Return to the backbenches (2010–2015)===
On 13 May 2010, in his first public appearance since leaving [[10 Downing Street]], two days after resigning as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party, Brown confirmed he intended to stay on in Parliament, serving as a Labour [[backbencher]], to serve the people of his [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency]].<ref name="BBC13May2010Backbencher">{{Cite news |date=13 May 2010 |title=Brown to remain as backbench MP |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8681018.stm |url-status=live |access-date=14 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516150404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8681018.stm |archive-date=16 May 2010}}</ref>

Towards the end of May 2010, Brown began writing ''[[Beyond the Crash]]'', completing it after 14 weeks.

===IMF speculation===
In April 2011, media reports linked Brown with the role as the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]].

In December 2015, Brown took his first large-scale role in the private sector since standing down as prime minister in 2010, becoming an advisor to [[PIMCO]].

===Views on poverty===
In 2018, he said: "It makes me angry. I'm seeing poverty I didn’t think I would ever see again in my lifetime. Slum housing was a feature of my childhood in the 1950s and 1960s, and I thought we had finally got over the worst of child poverty. Tax credits were the key to that." He also said, "You can't solve child poverty with the existing system. [[Universal credit]] is completely underfunded and every time they move people on to it you see more poverty. Minimum wage jobs don't pay enough to keep a family with two or three children out of poverty." Brown said further, "The government is trying to analyse this as people who are too lazy to get into work. But the problem is that people can't earn enough to stay out of poverty."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/14/gordon-brown-didnt-think-see-child-poverty-again-in-my-lifetime-universal-credit Gordon Brown: I didn't think I'd see child poverty again in my lifetime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214181020/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/14/gordon-brown-didnt-think-see-child-poverty-again-in-my-lifetime-universal-credit |date=14 December 2018 }} ''The Guardian''</ref>

Brown is a strong supporter of the NHS, partly due to both the experimental surgery that saved the sight in his right eye after his retina became detached, and the care he and Sarah Brown received when their premature firstborn baby died. Blindness in his left eye resulting in his lack of peripheral vision contributed to Brown's supposed antisocial nature and awkward public manner. For example, both on a podium and before a camera, while reading "he needs to look slightly to one side of the paper to focus; when speaking to an audience or into a camera lens, he must remember to correct what would normally be an automatic tendency to look slightly askew to see clearly with his good eye". Brown's papers were prepared in capital letters and in extremely large type, resulting in his stack of papers at the dispatch box being noticeably bulky due to fewer words per page.
