He was nominated to the Board of the Federal Reserve in 2012 by President [[Barack Obama]], and subsequently nominated to the [[Chair of the Federal Reserve|Chair of the Fed]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]], and confirmed in each case by the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite news |website=[[NPR]] |title=Senate Confirms Jerome Powell As New Federal Reserve Chair |accessdate=January 31, 2018 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/23/580157250/senate-confirms-jerome-powell-as-new-federal-reserve-chair}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=The Hill |title=Senate confirms Jerome Powell as Fed chairman |accessdate=January 31, 2018 |url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/370329-senate-confirms-jerome-powell-as-fed-chairman}}{{cite news |author=The Federal Reserve |title=Federal Open Market Committee unanimously selects Jerome H.

As Fed Chair, rather than having strong monetary views, Powell was seen as a consensus-builder and problem-solver, who kept close contact with Capitol Hill.<ref name=WP1/>  Powell won bipartisan praise for the actions taken by the Fed in early 2020 to combat the financial effects of the [[coronavirus pandemic]],<ref name=wp3/> but the resulting disconnect between asset prices and the economy was controversial,<ref name=bbg6/><ref name=WPO3/><ref name=ft3/> both for the financial risks of simultaneous large bubbles in several major asset classes,<ref name=ft1/><ref name=bb2/><ref name=Time1/><ref name=bb9/> and the historic widening of [[wealth inequality]].<ref name=WPO2/><ref name=AXOIS/> So dominant, and distorting,<ref name=Time1/><ref name=hill1/> were Powell's actions in 2020 on asset prices – despite a pandemic, divided Congress, weak economy, low [[Share repurchase|buybacks]], and trade wars – that by late 2020, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' called Powell, "Wall Street's Head of State",<ref name=bbg4/> and that his actions were "exuberantly asymmetric".<ref name=bbg6/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said the scale and manner of Powell's actions in 2020 "is changing the Fed forever",<ref name=Time1/> and shared concerns he had conditioned Wall Street to unsustainable levels of monetary stimulus to artificially sustain high asset prices, likened to a continual [[Greenspan put]], and also termed ''The Everything Bubble''.<ref name=bbg6/><ref name=WPO3/><ref name=ft3/><ref name=Time1/>

In 2018, for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, Powell started to reduce the size of the Fed's balance in a process called [[quantitative tightening]], with a plan to reduce it from USD 4.5 trillion to USD 2.5–3 trillion within 4 years.<ref>{{cite newspaper | url=https://www.ft.com/content/0d8b3fc8-1c95-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6 | title=Why Jay Powell's Fed taper is not causing tantrums | first=Gillian | last=Tett | date=1 March 2018 | accessdate=13 November 2020 | newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | url=https://www.ft.com/content/1459cdc4-040c-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1 | first=Joe | last=Rennison | date=20 December 2020 | accessdate=9 November 2020 | title=Investors raise alarm over Fed's shrinking balance sheet}}</ref>  Powell described the monthly reduction of USD 50 billion as being "on automatic pilot", however, approaching the end of 2018, global markets entered a steep decline;<ref name=RT4>{{cite website | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-balancesheet-idUSKCN1R12QA | title=Fed announces plan to end balance sheet runoff in September | first=Trevor | last=Hunnicut | date=20 March 2019 | accessdate=13 November 2020 | website=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> the reliance of markets on continuous central bank asset purchases to sustain asset prices had not been appreciated, and Powell was forced to abandon quantitative tightening in Q1 2019, leading to a recovery in global asset prices.<ref name=RT4/><ref>{{cite newspaper | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/fed-quantitative-tightening.html | title='Quantitative Tightening': the Hot Topic in Markets Right Now | first=Matt | last=Phillips | date=30 January 2019 | accessdate=9 November 2020}}</ref>  

Powell's actions drew negative comments from Trump who said in June 2019: "Here's a guy, nobody ever heard of him before. And now, I made him and he wants to show how tough he is ...

==Economic philosophy==

===Monetary policy===

On joining the Fed, Powell was not considered a deep expert in macroeconomics or monetary policy; and rather than having strong economic views, Powell was seen as a consensus builder, and a rational fact-based problem solver, who was prepared to visit Capitol Hill frequently to communicate and listen to all views on the economy.<ref name=WP1>{{cite newspaper | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/31/jerome-powell-trumps-pick-to-lead-fed-would-be-the-richest-chair-since-the-1940s/ | first=Heather | last=Long | date=2 June 2017 | accessdate=9 November 2020 | title=Who is Jerome Powell, Trump's pick for the nation's most powerful economic position?}}</ref>  The Bloomberg Intelligence Fed Spectrometer rated Powell as neutral in terms of monetary views (i.e., neither a [[Monetary hawk and dove|hawk nor a dove]]).<ref name=know/> Powell was a skeptic of round 3 of [[quantitative easing]] (or QE3), initiated in 2012, although he eventually voted for it.<ref name=know>{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-01/here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-powell-s-fed-chair-selection | title=Here's What You Need to Know About Powell's Fed Chair Selection | first=Steve | last=Matthews |work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | date=November 1, 2017}}</ref>

Powell's first year as Fed chairman saw him raise rates and attempt to reduce the Fed's balance sheet (i.e. hawkish actions); in his second year, Powell re-started expanding the Fed's balance sheet (i.e dovish actions), which led to an expansion of equity valuation multiples to levels not seen since 1999–2000.<ref name=ft1/>  Powell's actions to combat the financial effects of the pandemic saw him more overtly embrace asset bubbles as an acceptable consequence of his actions.<ref name=bb2>{{cite website | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-11/powell-signals-fed-is-ready-to-let-asset-bubbles-inflate-again-kba982so | website=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=John | last=Authers | date=11 June 2020 | accessdate=9 November 2020 | title=Powell's Ready to Play the Fresh Prince of Bubbles}}</ref><ref name=WSJ4>{{cite newspaper | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=16 September 2020 | accessdate=9 November 2020 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/quick-hits-powell-isnt-worried-fed-actions-are-generating-asset-bubbles-11600302153 | title=Quick Hits: Powell Isn't Worried Fed Actions Are Generating Asset Bubbles}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper | url=https://www.ft.com/content/321b0306-e02d-4ae2-bff0-7edcc39d2fd6 | title=Investors reset for Fed's single-minded pursuit of policy goals | first=Michael | last=Mackenzie | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | date=13 June 2020 | accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref>  The simultaneous bubbles created by Powell in 2019–2020 in the bond markets, the equity markets, and laterally in the housing markets,<ref name=bb9>{{cite website | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-13/housing-market-s-p-e-ratio-is-in-the-stratosphere | title=Home Prices Are In a Bubble.

===Housing finance reform===
In a July 2017 speech, Powell said that in regard to [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] the status quo is "unacceptable" and that the current situation "may feel comfortable, but it is also unsustainable". He warned that "the next few years may present our last best chance" to "address the ultimate status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac" and avoid "repeating the mistakes of the past". Powell expressed concerns that, in the current situation, the government is responsible for mortgage defaults and that lending standards were too rigid, noting that these can be solved by encouraging "ample amounts of private capital to support housing finance activities".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/07/07/2191096/jerome-powell-has-some-curious-ideas-about-housing-finance/ |title=Jerome Powell has some curious ideas about housing finance | first=Matthew C. | last=Klein | work=[[Financial Times]] |date=July 7, 2017}}</ref>
